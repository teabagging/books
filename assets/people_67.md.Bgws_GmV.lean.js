Don't let the fact that it is an anthropology book scare you off- it is not overly dry or academic in the least. While it is very informative and contains a lot of info about politics and ethnicity in the Isthmus, it's written in a casual, personal style that is extremely readable. It contains a lot of funny anecdotes that really brought the Isthmus alive for me. I found myself becoming immersed in the author's vivid descriptions of the countryside, the towns, the colorful characters he met and the political rallies that he attended. More than anything it reads like a travel book, but with a bit more substance. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone who plans to travel to Oaxaca, or is remotely interested in indigenous Mexico."},{"Title":"Mexican Memoir: A Personal Account of Anthropology and Radical Politics in Oaxaca","review":"This comment is not about the content of the book, which I am sure I would enjoy. It is about the extremely-poor formatting, which makes the book impossible to read. Some lines have words scrunched together and, since some of the book is in Spanish and Zapotec, it is hard to figure out. Some lines have only one word. Some letters are even backward! Since so much of the book is in other languages, the reader is reliant on the footnotes but, as they are at the back of the chapter, one has to spend a lot of time finding them. This is much more annoying in a Kindle than in a conventional book. I had expected that I might be able to highlight the text and find the footnote, but the Kindle book isn't configured that way.I won't be buying any serious academic texts from Kindle until this problem is resolved."},{"Title":"MCSE Test Success(TM): NT Server 4","review":"I found this book to be concise on the topics that it covered, but I also found that it didn't cover everything you needed.

Mary Blew finds herself pressed into caregiving when her Aunt Imogene calls and says that she is going to move from Port Angeles, Washington to Lewistown, ID to be near Mary. Mary has no idea why her aunt would want to leave her beautiful view of the ocean and surrounding area and questions her. Since their family has tacitly agreed never to speak about what is important, her aunt ambiguously replies that it is because one day she &quot;forgot how to make oatmeal.&quot; Blew is confused since Aunt Imogene, whose independence she has long admired, was the steadying rock in her life that offered her support during her two divorces.Quickly we realize that that Aunt Imogene is suffering from mental lapses that rapidly progress to &quot;dementia&quot; where she flickers arbitrarily between reality and her own world. Dealing with an independent aunt who is struggling to control her life is compounded by Blew's estranged daughter divorcing her husband and moving near her mother. As Blew works to rebuild a relationship with the daughter who she had treated with great reserve, she is forced to revisit her divorces, her treatment of her daughter, and her expectations for life. Then Mary Blew finds and reads her aunt's diaries. Aunt Imogene has never married, and Mary searches the diaries to discover why. Carefully reading between the lines, she finds surprising revelations not only about her aunt but also about her parents and grandparents, thereby overlaying and entwining the lives of four generations. This gives the memoir a fragmented narrative associatively entwining the life of the narrator, her daughter, her aunt, and their ancestors.Refusing to keep her family's code of silence about important things, Blew shares her findings with her daughter. What she finds are dysfunctional marriages that compel females in her family to strive for personal freedom, females who are unwilling to speak about what really matters, and women with an ability to suppress large parts of their lives. Aunt Imogene has paid dearly for her freedom in Port Angles; however, as she loses her grasp with the world, Mary Blew slowly receives a firmer grasp on her own world. Recognizing destructive familial patterns in herself, Blew intimates that her journey of self-discovery was successful as she takes small steps to spring loose &quot;unacceptable&quot; ideas that she has suppressed."},{"Title":"Balsamroot: A Memoir","review":"This is a book about a dearly loved aunt's slide into dementia, a book about a tentative reconciliation between mother and daughter, a book about a Montana childhood remembered, and a book about an earlier Montana imaginatively reconstructed from the aunt's fifty years of laconic daily diaries. Just when I would settle into one book, swallowing Blew's often self-pitying tone, wham, off we would go into another book. She is trying for a quilt of a book and leaves us with pieces. But these pieces are often of very good writing indeed, especially the fond anecdotes of the generations of horses which worked the family property. As you read, remember the family motto --&quot;Never speak aloud of what you feel deeply.&quot; As often as I was engrossed in what is in this book, I wondered what deliberately is kept out and how other voices -- the daughter and the aunt -- might tell this story."},{"Title":"Balsamroot: A Memoir","review":"I loved this book and recommend it to any lover of memoir. Mary Clearman Blew renders a heartfelt story about uncovering the mysteries of her Aunt Imogene's life, and in turn, embarking on self-discovery. I suggest first reading &quot;All But the Waltz,&quot; which puts Balsamroot in a rich context of family history. It is also a wonderful narrative on its own."},{"Title":"Balsamroot: A Memoir","review":"BALSAMROOT is a memoir wrapped around a melancholy tribute to a favorite maiden aunt of the author. \\"Auntie\\" Imogene was a schoolteacher whom Blew had always remembered as being independent and happy. When Blew is forced to become her aunt's caretaker in her final years, she discovers Auntie's diaries, and, reading them, learns the true cost of her aunt's independence and the hollowness if not falsity of her supposed happiness. Blew herself has gone through some tough times, a single mother who was long estranged from her own daughter, she became a mother again 21 years after the birth of her first daughter, Elizabeth. Some of her story was told in her other Montana memoir, ALL BUT THE WALTZ. This book exposes the loneliness of her Aunt's solitary life, causing Blew to perhaps question her own choices as she grows older herself, and watches Imogene lapse rather rapidly into dementia and utter helplessness and dependence. Blew makes no bones or excuses about her own life choices, admitting what might be seen by some as selfishness in her relentless pursuit of a successful career in writing and teaching. This is not always an easy story to read, but it is an extremely well-written one. Blew's unfailing attention to her craft - which is ably demonstrated here - excuses a multitude of personal failings, at least for this reader. Mary Clearman Blew knows who she is. She is a writer. Like her first memoir, BALSAMROOT is an admirable piece of work. I liked it. - Tim Bazzett, author of the REED CITY BOY trilogy"},{"Title":"The Ingoldsby legends, or Mirth & marvels","review":"If I were exiled to the moon and could only take one book, (no compendiums allowed) that would be The Ingoldsby Legends, Myths and Marvels, by Richard Harris Barham.

This is not to say the book is without merit; as a systematic rundown of major books dealing with American black slavery and therefore as a reference guide to basic historiography of the subject for undergraduates, it could hardly be bettered. But, if I had wanted to read book reviews, I would have gone to H-Net. And that is all this book is, book reviews, good ones, but still, frustrating if one was looking for a bit more."},{"Title":"In the Image of God: Religion, Moral Values, and Our Heritage of Slavery","review":"David Brion Davis is a leading American historian best known for his superb trilogy on the problem of slavery in western culture. This book promises us a fourth volume on the problem of slavery in the age of emancipation. In the meantime we have a collection of assorted articles published over the past fifteen years or so. Some historians have been able to develop this genre into important works: one thinks of Perry Anderson's \\"A Zone of Engagement\\" or Eugene Genovese's \\"In Red and Black.\\" But such works often say little of originality or importance and often have an artificial unity imposed on them. Such, unfortunately, is the case with this book. This book consists largely of book reviews, most of which come from The New York Review of Books. In it we read reviews of such leading scholars as David Garrow, C. Vann Woodward, Eugene Genovese, Bernard Lewis, David Eltis, Robin Blackburn, Herbert Klein, Jacqueline Jones and Brenda Stevenson. There are also a couple of articles which introduce other, more scholarly articles on the nature of racism. Arguably these are the most important chapters in the book. There is also a useful piece which demonstrates the important if stunningly obvious point that the Jewish role in the Slave Trade was virtually non-existent. (In 1830 less than 0.3% of major American slaveholders were Jewish)Davis' first essay is on the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, and I have to say what one thinks of the book depends on your opinion of that most respected of theologians. If you think Niebuhr was a man of deep realism and profound theology you will appreciate this book. If, however, you think that instead of being \\"the American Jeremiah\\" (Davis' phrase) Niebuhr was more the American Tartuffe or the American Vicar of Bray, there will be something off about this collection. I have yet to encounter any liberal or socialist who has vigorously waved the banner of human perfectibility. Such technocratic shortcuts to happiness tend to be associated more with the right such as Larry Niven, Robert Heinlein, Edward Teller and Newt Gingrich via Alvin Toffler. Yet Davis (in the age of Clinton no less!) feels it necessary to warn several times against the chimeras of utopianism and perfectability. Although elsewhere Davis writes of the need for government aid to solve poverty, his book is enfeebled by the NYRB fear of appearing too liberal. An article on the relationship between blacks and Jews looks more at the philanthropic activities of Jewish organizations as opposed to the racial views of the Jewish population. At one point Davis, with some pride, points out that a couple of Jews assisted John Brown. Yet at another point, in trying to show that C. Vann Woodward was not a sentimental deracinated liberal, he notes Woodward's distaste for those who engage in \\"uncritical worship of fanatics like John Brown.\\"Davis is a bit too indulgent about Genovese's truly awful \\"The Southern Front,\\" and endorses a misleading point about Southern antebellum tolerance for Jews. (It is true that the first Jewish senator came from Louisiana, but Louisiana is the least Protestant of the Confederate states and no-one has ever argued that New Orleans is a triumph of the quasi-Calvinist Protestant hegemony that Genovese has recently championed.) Discussing the Moynihan Report he wonders how it would possible to support affirmative action and other remedial programs for Africa-Americans without it. But this ignores the manifold problems with the report. By emphasizing the damage slavery had done to the family, Moynihan left the impression that any weaknesses in the African-American family were the result of something that had ended a century and left the idea that the non-Southern majority of the United States was off the hook for anything that had happened since 1865. At the same time there is the perversity, as pointed out by Ruth Feldstein, of how Moynihan, in an age of segregation, disfranchisment and systematic discrimination, singled out the weakest and poorest segment of society, black mothers, and criticized them for, in effect, having too much power and having a bad influence. Similarly, Davis show more \\"realistic\\" Niebuhrian concern about the underclass and its mass unemployment and social disorganization than actual knowledge about it.The reviews themselves are respectful, intelligent and usually thoughtful expressions of Davis' scholarly liberalism. But at the same time they do little to advance Davis' own scholarship. Individually the essays have some value, taken together it is a bit like reading a thirty page historiographical essay extended to 378 pages. Reading this book you will learn more about recent scholarship on the economics of slavery, the nature of abolitionism and the origins of racism. Like the readers of the New York Review of Books you will be updated more than you will be informed. The reviews are only a partial substitute for the monographs themselves."},{"Title":"In the Image of God: Religion, Moral Values, and Our Heritage of Slavery","review":"I am a great fan of Davis's earlier books on slavery. This book is a disappointment and I am sorry to say I think he wrote it for the money and no other or good reason.

Review it carefully before buying and don't be suckered into buying it by the author's name.Shame on you, Professor Davis."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Military Modelling","review":"Beginning with historical perspective and a broad survey of the modeling world, the authors divide the hobby into major historical periods of interest, then proceed quickly to the tips and techniques of construction, with practical advice on the needed tools and supplies. Special attention is given to such tricky subjects as horses, vehicles, and human faces, always with an eye to maximum realism. The effects that can be achieved are very impressive indeed.The illustrations are generous and nicely reproduced, and the instruction first rate. Some American insignia is oddly jumbled and mislabeled, sources for the supplies mentioned and a bibliography would not have gone amiss, and the index is unfortunately stingy, but the work will stand as a useful basic introduction to an interesting hobby.(The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not &quot;score&quot; books.)"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Military Modelling","review":"This book appears to be a reprint of a book released in 1981.

Best to leave this one for the used book aisle."},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Military Modelling","review":"With excellent quality of contents, paper, printing and photos, this is a valuable book for the millitary modeler.It starts talking about major modelling periods, from ancient up to modern days. Here shows what could be the major flaw of the book, namely, that it is relatively old (1981), so you will find no references to latest conflicts (Malvinas/Falklands, Lebanon War, Gulf War, etc).Then it talks about: How to start, figure modelling, weapons and equipment, soft skin and armoured vehicles, artillery and dioramas.Most chapters are very good, with pictures and sample projects. Maybe the exception is the diorama chapter, rather short and raw for an issue as important as this for military modeling.Given that the book tries to cover all the history of warfare, if you are oriented to, say, tank modeling, maybe you will feel that much of the book is not relevant for you (same could be said for figure modelers).

However, if one wants hard examination with hard logic and true genius, this is the gold standard. Theology students be warned: This man takes no prisoners. And, you may find yourself within a seeming abyss of depression- until you can discern the light which shines on recognition of what this man has said. A pearl of great price.

It is not easy to read, not a fast read, but very profound in its message."},{"Title":"God and the Universe","review":"This is the first time that I have been asked to review a book that is simply unintelligible. The trouble lies with the author's allusive, non-linear style, where rigour and clarity are needed. His writing style is so jumbled that it is impossible to tell what, if anything, he is getting at. The range of material he refers to is unmanageably vast, but he is a long way from being in control of it. Surprising connections are made, but he seems unable to think clearly about them. The result is pretentious and bizarre.I note that the &quot;blurb&quot; on the dust-jacket makes no attempt to summarize what the book is saying, neither do the prestigious people who have provided endorsements. I suspect that neither they nor the publishers could follow the book any better than I could. There may be short-term puzzlement about how Routledge came to publish such an unsatisfactory manuscript but, beyond that, it will surely sink without trace.With such an incomprehensible book, it is hard for a reviewer to begin to indicate what it is about, but one central idea seems to be that of &quot;live metaphor&quot;. There is no clear definition of the concept, but Gibson seems to be suggesting that much discourse in both cosmology and theology consists of &quot;live metaphors&quot;. There are indeed interesting issues about how these two disciplines are radically metaphorical in similar but non-identical ways. That, I suspect, is the issue that the author was trying to write about, but it can't be clarified by a book of this kind. I certainly cannot recommend it. - Fraser Watts, University of Cambridge"},{"Title":"God and the Universe","review":"God and the Universe by Arthur Gibson (Routledge) combines incisive interpretations of the latest scientific theories of the origins of the universe with an unparalleled understanding of their religious and philosophical implications. In tackling head-on the highly charged issue of God's relevance to contemporary cosmology, the breadth of Gibson's perspective on his subject matter is amazing: from virtual reality to the meaning of life and from Aristotle to Stephen Hawking. Books like this do not come along very often. I suggest one take a couple of mornings off and read through it. God and the Universe will provide some important novel perspectives about how things can mean from the smallest to the largest and how perhaps best to go about learning more. God and the Universe is a preliminary exploration to suggest strategies to discover ways out of this impasse, conceived as the first of a series of books. It displays many limitations: does the book cover too much ground and too many subjects? Gibson does not engage with Hegel, and is content only occasionally to treat Kant. The book addresses Aristotle's Poetics, rather than, as one might expect, his Metaphysics, and instead attempts to construct metaphysical problems out of our contemporary astrophysics, without introducing the significance of the reception of Aristotle's thinking into Christian theology. But, however one assesses, for example, Kant's contribution to \`faith and reason' and \`God's relation to the world' debates, the effect of systematically commenting upon Kant's great opus, or other seminal authors, is to be regulated by the controlling notions of relevance and commentary to which they subject us, and to which they have been subjected. This is not a whim by which one denounces or discards such authors, but to attempt, however imperfectly, to stand as far as is possible independently of these histories of influence and to think afresh. Yet to ignore them is both impossible and to delight in alienation. Gibson has tried to produce a different sort of use and this avoidance of authorities. The learning is staggering and can leave one wondering what are Gibson's premises. Still this read is pure adventure that many will find plenty to think about, even if the details eventually take us in different directions.It's an important read."},{"Title":"God and the Universe","review":"This book is almost impenetrable.

During dinner Kala had prodded her husband to produce a letter just received from a photography expert, engaged by wealthy British collector Radin Heur to pronounce on the authenticity of a \\"spirit photograph\\" Linn has offered for sale. The photograph shows the souls rising from three \\"Esquimaux\\" killed in a small-plane crash. A crash that Kala, we learn, only just survived. And believes her husband caused by sabotaging the plane in order to kill her.In this first chapter, Norman plunges the reader into a tantalizing story of intrigue and adultery, made powerful by the subtle, vicious manipulations of husband and wife and the passive wariness of the narrator. \\"It all but made my skin crawl, the civility.\\"Peter, though a photographer's assistant, is no photographer and has no ambition to be one. Instead, Peter makes up captions, obsessively. \\"So that, for instance, if I left my raincoat inside on a rainy day, I would immediately think, MAN WHO FORGOT RAINCOAT STANDING ON STREET.\\"Peter is also aware that his situation is precarious, fluid, temporary. \\"The foretaste of regret. I was convinced that I was building up such an archive of memories - all these various views of Kala sleeping - that I could never get them out of my mind. And where would that leave me, should it happen that we didn't stay together? I'd suffer one of Miss Houghton's hauntings, except without any photographs involved.\\"Miss Houghton is the author of Kala's favorite book, her professional Bible, \\"The Unclad Spirit,\\" devoted to the investigation of spirit photography and quoted frequently in the course of Peter's narration. \\"A spirit photograph is one in which someone whom Miss Houghton called the 'uninvited guest' was present.\\" Uninvited, often unwanted, always dead: an estranged spouse, a debauched uncle, a secret lover. Kala lectures on spirit photography and Miss Houghton and it was in this capacity Peter first encountered her on his arrival at a rustic, nearly deserted hotel in Churchill, Manitoba. Her audience consisted of three Eskimos and her husband - or husband-to-be, as it was their wedding day.The pair have an extended history, though, and Peter begins to learn about it on his very first night, as Kala celebrates her new marriage by coming to his bed. It is not long before he discovers that Vienna Linn is in hiding from the collector Radin Heur, who pays in advance for grisly accident photographs. Heur had, it seems, paid for a photographic record of a train wreck, but Linn botched the wreck and spent the money.The spirit photograph of the airplane crash is Linn's inspired ticket out of claustrophobic exile in Manitoba, where winter is one adversary who can never be bested. As his wife recuperates from her injuries with Peter by her side, Linn abandons all pretense of normal civility (the locals no longer worth the effort) and holes up in his dark room, preparing his masterpiece of spirit photography.The understated tension builds as Linn establishes contact and the trio leave for Halifax to make the deal. Once in the city Linn re-exerts his social powers, charming the police and the landlady, while Peter sinks back into the grief and anger over his mother's tragic death which drove him to leave Halifax in the first place and events build to a discordant, crashing, crescendo.Some readers may find Peter a too-passive narrator, intentional though it is. It is difficult to identify with a protagonist who makes you feel like shaking him from time to time. Yet Peter works his passivity like a weapon and Norman's unaffected simplicity, carefully crafted to heighten the chilled atmosphere, makes the whole thing work within the framework of the melodramatic plot."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"While I certainly wouldn't want to read Howard Norman's books every day of the week, I do enjoy him as a change of pace. As anyone familiar with Norman knows, life in his world is bleak and fierce, men are meek and women are bold and mysterious happenings are simply the everyday stuff of life. Norman's novels are stories of love, murder, madness and, strangely enough, the redemptive power of art.While the characters in Norman's books are usually quite low-key (the exception being some of the female characters), his plots border on the outlandish. No, they're not science fiction or fantasy, they're more plain illogical and downright strange. If you can't accept something like this, then Norman's books, good as they are, simply wouldn't be for you.\\"The Haunting of L\\" is no exception. Set in Halifax and on Hudson Bay, the cold described so lyrically in the book seems to literally permeate each page of the story.\\"The Haunting of L\\" takes place in 1927 and basically revolves around three characters: the narrator, Peter Duvett, and an unhappily married couple, Kala Murie andVienna Linn.Kala is the strange one of this trio right from the start. She is a disciple of a spiritualist who has a deep and abiding belief in \\"spirit photographs,\\" a belief he passes on to Kala. Vienna, who is not so believing, still manages to find a way to profit from these strange and rather ghoulish \\"spirit photos.\\"While we know very well why Kala and Vienna are on the northern edge of Manitoba, we aren't so sure about Peter. He's sort of a ghost of a character himself, paling beside both Kala and Vienna. Complications arise when Vienna must deliver an assortment of \\"very special\\" photographs to his English benefactor, Radin Heur. Not to be beaten, Vienna \\"arranges\\" for the much needed photos. But does the end ever justify the means?Without giving away the plot, I will just say that this book, while well-written and entertaining, simply asks far too much of the reader. There is a little too much authorial intrusion and it spoils what could have been so much better. While I enjoyed reading \\"The Haunting of L,\\" I did come away from it less than satisfied and it will be awhile before I return to Howard Norman again. Though I will return."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"We picked this book for our Book Club and it has proved to be one of our all time favorites. Harold Norman is an excellent writer and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat. I am now looking forward to reading his other 2 novels. Do not pass this one up."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"I look forward eagerly to every new release from Mr. Norman, for I know that I will be dazzled by his writing. His books about the Canadian Maritimes are excellent, and his writing style is just sparse enough to give the reader a heightened sense of interest in the plot. As usual with Mr. Norman, the plot itself is interesting and entangled at the same time. We have a young man caught up in adultery with the wife of his odd employer, and there are spirit photographs, mysterious and dangerous British millionaires, baptized Eskimos, and a crippling snowstorm, just to name some of what happens in this work. There is enough foreshadowing that you just feel the ominous sense of impending tragedy, though when it comes you realize that you weren't expecting it in just that way. I don't want to give away much of the plot, for it is integral to the enjoyment of the book as a whole. Just take my advice and read the book; you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"If to haunt someone is to steal that person's peace of mind, the three characters of Howard Norman's novel are haunted indeed. Set in remote areas of Canada in the late 1920s, Peter Duvett, Kala Murie, and Vienna Linn form a strange trio hooked to each other by perverse forces revealed in a manner so understated that they become even creepier.Photographer's assistant Peter Duvett leaves Halifax to take a job in the remote north of Manitoba. The settlement is accessible only by plane and so small that it is hard to imagine that there would be enough customers to support any business, let alone one which would require a photographer's assistant. When Peter checks in at the hotel, there is a woman giving a lecture on spirit photographs-the \\"uninvited guests\\" whose shadowy forms have mysteriously appeared in photo backgrounds. Why is this woman giving a lecture on such an arcane subject in a settlement so tiny that there are only three people in the audience? She is Kala Murie, fianc&eacute;e of Vienna Linn, Peter's new employer. It is their wedding day, an event to which Peter is not invited and from which Kala comes to Peter's bed. With the bride as his lover and his boss as his enemy, Peter starts work. Vienna Linn, he learns, takes photos of Catholic converts for the town priest, but his real business is creating fatal accidents and taking pictures of the resulting mayhem for a wealthy British client. Train wrecks are a favorite, but planes, streetcars, and automobile accidents are acceptable as long as people die.Yet watching photographic evidence of murder appear in the developing pan does not send Peter running from this strange couple. His passivity and attraction to Kala keep him in their orbit even when he knows too much.The behavior of all three main characters is so strange that you cannot imagine how the story will end. Apparently, neither did Howard Norman. The climax is disappointing and there is now way this story could be resolved that simply. It negates the atmosphere that has been so carefully built up."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"This third and final novel in a trilogy about Canada is haunting, as the title implies. The story and the language linger in my mind. Norman's new novel is sensuous, romantic, mysterious. The author always writes about eccentric characters. His vision and voice are original, not at all ordinary, and we learn much about history and human nature from reading his books.I loved this novel, could not put it down and have recommended it to several people."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"CONAN DOYLE WAS AMONG many of the famous who believed in Spirit Pictures in the 1920s and 1930s.These pictures consisted of regularly developed photographs onto which -abracadabra!- pictures of dear departed ones attached themselves supernaturally.They gained a Victorian following, and fooled many an intellectual.Author Howard Norman, of Vermont, visits this strange belief in the last of his welcome Canadian trilogy.It oozes creativity, and lies outside usual mystery formulas.Peter Duvell, a young Canadian, arrives in 1927 in Hudson's Bay to become assistant to a renowned photographer named Vienna. Vienna's new wife, Kala, seduces Peter (on her wedding night!)Through her, Peter loses his innocence and falls under her spell. He joins her in a passionate interest in Spirit Pictures, and attends her lectures on the subject.He finds out that Vienna is engaged in dubious activities that gradually become more evil. These eventually go beyond what either of the two adulterers can imagine, and involve a strange religious millionaire.Norman creates a strong sense of menace hanging over his unusual characters. His fine novel explores themes of morality, responsibility, ethics, and of turning a blind eye --all within a suspenseful read."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"Howard Norman is a terrific, contemporary American novelist and deserves to be read widely. His work is intense and cohesive, demanding that the reader not look away. The Bird Artist may be the strongest of his three most recent novels, but The Haunting of L. is a beautiful, disturbing study of characters and their motivations. The novel gets off to a relatively slow start, but there's nothing like adultury and a plane crash to get a plot moving. And the photographer of the dead introduces complications readers can't really expect.Norman's strength is his ability to create quirky characters we don't think we know in real life but want to know, if only to make our own lives more intriguing and tangible than they are without these characters. These same characters in another author's hands would be too unbelievable, but Norman conveys them with such depth and assurrance that we cannot undo their seams. His characters taunt us, entice us to want to know the possibly odd and dangerous motivations that are potentially forming in all of us.Don't be put off by the setting--it's no contemporary United States in Norman's novels. Don't stop reading in the early pages, when you might not know exactly what's going on or why you're starting to care about characters you know you shouldn't like as people. Read The Haunting of L., maybe read The Museum Guard, but definitely also read The Bird Artist, Norman's most inviting work."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"That's about it really. It's well written and has a good setting but the ending felt weak and I kind of cringed when learned what the title meant because I was hoping for something more clever."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"Young Peter becomes an assistant to the portraitist Vienna Linn in a remote Canadian town, and discovers that a series of accidents have actually been arranged as settings for a private collection in The Haunting Of L., a story of intrigue and danger. Add an uneasy romance between three people and you have a moving story not of ghosts, but of questionable pursuits and ethics."},{"Title":"The Haunting of L.","review":"While I have enjoyed previous Howard Norman works, particularly The Museum Guard, I cannot say the same for THE HAUNTING OF L.Though the premise of the book is promising: an exploration of the turn-of-the century phenomenon known as \\"spirit photography\\" which evidently enjoyed a short-lived vogue, by the time I got to the end, I felt no sympathy nor antipathy towards any of the three principal characters.These three people all seem to have their own selfish motivations and desires in mind when tromping on each others' emotions. While I didn't come away hating any one in particular, I didn't feel they deserved any compassion either. They lived to pursue their heart's desires no matter the outcome. Maybe that is justly the moral of this story: reap what you sow.Some of the critics' reviews I have read cite THE HAUNTING OF L as the third in Norman's trilogy that is preceded by THE BIRD ARTIST and THE MUSEUM GUARD. Though it might have been the author's intention to do just that, THE HAUNTING OF L is sadly a badly played \\"note\\" in what is otherwise a beautifully-written trio of stories.If you're new to his work, you'll likely find the book readable.

Heinlein'sOrphans of the Sky, a novel he felt lacking in emotion, Aldiss' novel is a classic generation starship tale.The idea that their universe is the inside of a giant spaceship is known but derided in the Greene tribe. They're a barbarous lot. They destroy books whenever they find them. The Teaching, a Freudian inspired religion with its talk of id and ego, values full and immediate expression of fear and anger lest the repression of those emotions curdle into neurosis. A nomadic lot, they seal off the hallway they live in, moving the barricades when they exhaust the \\"ponics\\", plants that abound in the ship's corridors. Their power stems from a cache of weapons found two generations ago.And protagonist Roy Complain is not happy with his life in the tribe. He gets flogged for losing his woman on a hunting expedition into the \\"deadways\\" beyond the tribes \\"Quarters\\". Chaffing under the Teaching and floggings of his tribe, Complain decides to accompany priest Marapper and three others through the deadways and to the land of the advanced people of Forwards. Marapper expects, somewhere, to find the ship's control room, seize control of the vessel, and end this painful journey through the stars.In his wanderings, Complain learns the truth behind the other groups -- the mutants, the Outsiders, and the Giants -- rumored to inhabit the ship. Aldiss puts an ironic twist to the generation starship tale, particularly ORPHANS OF THE SKY, when he reveals the exact situation of the ship. By novel's end, Aldiss gives a detailed and ingenious explanation for Complain's world.It's not necessary to read the Heinlein story, or any other generation starship tale, to appreciate this fine novel. Aldiss gives us believable emotion and, in Complain, a fine portrait of a man growing into a true knowledge of himself and his world."},{"Title":"Non-Stop","review":"Mystery/suspense are seated comfortably alongside sci-fi in this story of a community of people searching for their lost past.

If you can hunt this book down, it is worth the read. I haven't read any other generation ship stories before this one, but I found this one to not only be enjoyable but also emotionally compelling. Brian Aldiss is really trying to tell us about the built-in urge to be free and to discover who you really are. the plot is simple: The characters are on a huge ship hurtling through space but have no idea of that fact and simply know the ship as their world.

The five star rating is based upon the paperback 'Starship' bought in the 1960's.

I googled Starship up one way and down the other and never found it. Even the list of 1950's SF books did not identify its alternate Starship name. Eventually I searched on topic 'multi-generational SF' and one of the summaries identified the customary 'Non-Stop'.The original paperback is somewhere in the basement.

Of course, all ends well, but the story is quite humorous and kids love to read this story, as well as the rest of the series. Fluffy and the other classroom guinea pigs are outside when Fluffy goes down the groundhog's hole.The reader can share Fluffy's thoughts since he cannot talk, which usually leads to laughter. Fluffy is quite a character!The series is gentle, non-threatening read in which the classroom guinea pig gets himself into all kinds of situations which always turn out fine. The situations can often serve as a springboard to discuss topics with your child or student (in this book, for example, you could use it to talk about stereotypes, mediation or so forth) as well as Groundhog Day. My students love Fluffy and often do not want to stop reading--they want to know what happens next. These books are level 3 readers, grades 3-4 really like them. They are easy to read, 3-4 chapters and 40-50 pages with larger print than most books. I highly recommend them to all kids, especially those who need encouragement to read.

It's a typical entrepreneurial story of a guy with an idea that sees a market that his unique talent can fill. Most aren't successful but with hard work, luck and talent, Motown is successful. It should be noted that his success is even more impressive in the civil rights environment of the late 50s/early 60s when Berry was starting his firm.The book does a great job of detailing Berry's techniques that lead to the success of Motown. In addition, individual artists, producers and writers are highlighted and their stories overlapped with the Motown story. If you like this music or grew up in this era, the names will all be recognizable.The final two chapters deal with Motown's foray into movies and the ultimate demise. I was not aware of their movie involvement and it's comical how Berry backed into the business and then makes all the mistakes people with too much money make when they are touched by movie magic. Finally, the music magic has gone, Berry's interest has waned, and an exciting new company is consistently getting beaten in the marketplace probably due to poor management.I strongly recommend this book if you have any interest in music, the culture of the 60s, or any pop music stars who recorded in the 60s. As to others complaints, they may be more knowledgeable of the Motown experience but I'm glad I read this book to learn more."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"This book was a disappointment because so much of the information was wrong.

There are so many GLARING errors in his text that one must assume he'd never heard of Motown until the week before he began to write, or should I say assemble this collection of questionable \\"facts\\". While most Motowners suffer from his heavy handed ineptitude, Posner selects Diana Ross as an easy target. While he learned little in the way of facts to write the book, he did gain knowledge from disgruntled, also-ran Supreme Mary Wilson's books: bad mouth Diana Ross - true or not - to get press. Posner succeeds here. His final assaults on the truth include the lie that the 2000 Diana Ross & The Supremes Tour \\"Return To Love\\" line-up was Ross, Wilson & Birdsong. Even the most casual fan knows Wilson's outrageous demands kept her off the tour. His \\"RTL\\" lies imply consistant poor reviews and sales.

Or maybe it is both. Gerald Posner has a hard time making that decision, despite a well researched and historically well documented survey of Berry Gordy (and family's) legendary contribution to the music business.Posner has crafted a study of Motown that presents its founders, and stars as less-than-perfect (though most often well-likable) pioneers in business and entertainment, working together, though often butting heads with each other, in defining a company built on a legendary sound. Everyone is familiar with most of the players - The Gordy Family (this book delves into the family more so than most other Motown studies, and makes clear that Berry was the head, though not the sole talent of the family), Marvin Gaye (who is painted as a head case through much of the book), Diana Ross (Posner adds some new &quot;legends&quot; to this diva's conduct file, none of them pretty or flattering), Stevie Wonder (both respected and severely exploited, given his youth), Smokey robinson (probably the smartest businessman in the Motown stable), and others. Posner shoots down the legendary &quot;mob-connection&quot; tale, but fills his book with court records, verified statements from insiders, and previously published facts to present a company where competition between artists fueled the hit pipeline, but with severe cost to artists (Florence Ballard's story is still painful to read) and creativity.This book is a great, enjoyable read in many parts, but it fails to capture any of the joy of Motown. You are left feeling sorry for many of the artists you have come to love over the years. For this reason, I'm glad I saw &quot;Standing In The Shadows Of Motown&quot; before reading &quot;Motown: Money, Power...&quot;, for that movie is a celebration of the most important element of the Motown legacy - some of the best music ever recorded."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"This book is the most intelligent and best-written opus on Motown currently available but why couldn't the distinguished and experienced Gerald Posner get his FACTS right?

Georgeanna Tillman was a different person, also one of the original five.Also: Gladys Horton was not replaced as lead singer in the Marvelettes by Anne Bogan. Well before Horton left Wanda Young has assumed the lead on records, though in person both ladies alternately led. Bogan came into the group as a background singer, only recording leads on two album tracks, one of which was pulled for a single. The final Marvelettes album was a Young solo project; Young never refused to move to L.A. nor did the Marvelettes ever make a decision to break up. They just found themselves in Detroit with no record company. Much worse: Martha Reeves not even being told the company had moved.Also: Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne were not in the Supremes the same time; Laurence sang with the Jean Terrell-led group, Payne replaced Terrell.Also: Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong did not decide to do the \\"Return to Love\\" tour. Diana Ross got the original offer, then called Mary Wilson, who wasn't in the mood to get low pay, no profits from merchandise sales and work as an employee of Miss Ross, with all the attendant disrespect implied (when Ross complained that all Wilson would have had to do is \\"show up\\" that really inflamed Wilson. \\"Why, after devoting my life to keeping this group and its legacy alive would I just want to 'show up,'\\" she asked). Wilson did at the very last minute agree to join the tour but was told it was too late. Birdsong was not involved at all, though she didn't give up hope for such a tour. Wilson also was much insulted by the souvenir booklet for the tour, which almost no one saw, which mentions her exactly once following Birdsong's name as continuing as a Supreme after Ross left the group, just one more example of Ross's habit of rewriting history (she does not in any way acknowledge that the group started as three girls who became equally beloved by the public, not a lead singer with two backup voices in the shadows).And there's much else wrong and much missing...particularly the saga of the post-Ross Supremes, who labored working for a record company which was making darned sure the group didn't in any way overshadow Ross or equal its success with her as a member. Many acts central to the story, such as the Lewis Sisters, are missing; the saga of the one-man graphic arts department which had to create album packages of what were almost always just randomly-gathered tracks; and much else is gone. The definitive work on Motown and Ross are the books written by Randy Taraborrelli--he gets it all, gets it right and exudes a tangible love for and fascination with the company, the music and people. This new book is beautifully written and elegantly presented but it's SO frustrating to run into the errors which renders this a classy book but classy in a dumbed-down world."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"I say that as a title because while reading the book I felt like I was re-reading other books that I have read before on Motown. It was almost quoted word for word in many stories which made it difficult to keep my interest. I enjoyed parts of it because I am always interested in new information that I didn't know which is what I though the book would reveal. I love finding out information on business practices and how a company became successful. The section on the royalties, sales and payments was by far the most interesting to me. Overall Gerald Posner didn't do a bad job, I just think that the story has been told so many times by so many people that it is really hard to come up with anything new or original without referencing previously published material. From a die hard Motown fan and I would dare to call myself a self proclaimed Motown historian the book also had questionable facts. However, someone else who doesn't know the history of the company as much as I do may find it good reading. Before you take it at face value I suggest you do some cross referencing and basically do your homework regarding the facts in this book."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"Looking over Mr. Posner's previous work, I expected much more. What I got instead is a book that,quite frankly, I could have written myself. It seems that Mr. Posner and I have read the same Motown books over the years. Hardly any of the info in this one is new. To be fair, Mr. Posner does reveal some info from court documents that is interesting, but these revelations are very brief and don't make up for the rest of the book..The repeated information wouldn't be so bad if there weren't also so many inaccuracies in the rest of the book. The Supremes reunion at MOTOWN 25 was unplanned? Unrehearsed maybe, but certainly not unplanned. Marvin Gaye's song SEXUAL HEALING was his first number one hit since WHAT'S GOING ON? Not true. Florence Ballard did marry Thomas Chapman,. Yet, in this book, he is only referred to as her boyfriend, even after they had three children together.If you know nothing about Motown, this book is a quick way to get acquainted. If you are a Motown completist, you'll probably add this book to your collection anyway.

A better writer when he takes on assassinations (JFK and MLK), Posner is out of his depth when writing about music. He lacks a certain appreciation for how these songs changed American pop culture.

This book is full of mistakes regarding when songs were released, who recorded them first, on and on and on...As bad as Tony Turner's book was, I'd recommend it any day over this trash. Hardly any of the label's singers appear to be happy about ever having recorded there. Diana Ross once again gets kicked around and blamed for everyone's lack of sustained sales and stardom. Big surprise there. And his recent appearance on the E! True Hollywood Story about Diana Ross - what happened, they couldn't get Mary Wilson to talk about how evil Ross is, so they carted out Mr. Posner who's never even met her?

I think the author did an excellent job of compiling the information and presenting it in an enjoyable to read format.I read this book and \\"The Motown Music Machine\\" at the same time. Though the other book might be considered more authoritative based on the authors personal experience within Motown, I don't believe that it tells the full story.

There is an insight and understanding how the music industry works, how songs are selected for \\"hits\\"; We are educated on the distribution of records and its practices. It seems clear that if a record company was not gypping entertainers, something was not done right.Lawsuits, battles, downfallsAlso explained is how and when entertainers and staff deflected to other companies. We are given a clear explanation of the struggles within the Supremes and the birth of the supergroup, The Jackson 5, the rise and fall of Marvin Gaye, success of Stevie Wonder, Berry Gordy's bond with Smokey Robinson of the Miracles, infighting, lawsuits, etc., etc.Much is written about the love affair of Diana Ross and Berry Gordy, and her bitter relationship with other Motown performers.The book also details the trials and tribulations of the 25th Anniversary Television show, where Michael Jackson performed the moon walk and made history.Motown moviesIt's clear that when Berry Gordy had a quest for the movie business, it would ultimately lead to neglecting the music business.What about the SOUND of MotownI did have one question: The Funk Brothers - the sound of Motown! There is almost nothing on the Funk Brothers.Although receiving negative reviews for what readers called \\"many mistakes\\", I don't care if so and so had this hit first before such and such hit, or so and so went to bed with so and so instead of so and so....

This book was just a rehash of what we already know from the various stars' memoirs. A lot of what he took was from Berry's book. He did reveal some things about Motown's business practices that were eye-openers. He also talks about what happened to flow and that whole situation was a crying shame.

He acknowledged this in the foreword, noting that a music writer advised him to \\"look at Motown, there's a big story there\\".So, he concentrates on the business end of it as an investigative reporter. This is the main reason why he received few on-the-record interviews, but with all of that, I think it still adds to the public understanding of this company. Not the least of which was his main contribution, researching the legal records in the Wayne County clerk's office (which is what makes his effort unique).It covers the period of Berry Gordy's ascent - to him selling the company years later for over $60 million dollars. Plus some of the aftermath of the sale (including the recent TV programs, such as the one on the Temptations).I would have appreciated a concluding chapter (summing up the history), plus a guess as to the high-water-mark of the company, and I would agree that other books are needed to flesh out the musical aspect of Motown and its influence on other musicians (not to mention the world). This is still, I believe, a good effort in describing the rise-and-fall of a great institution."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"Rather than concentrate on the music coming out of Motown, Mr. Posner mostly trashes the women at Motown. Does he have a bias towards African American women? He trashes Suzanne de Passe by implying that she had no business skills and that she suffered from a weight problem. He stated that Tammi Terrell was a promiscuous and had a drinking problem (he probably read the book by that woman that claimed to married to David Ruffin). And since he made that statement about Ms. Terrell, why didn't he mention that she was involved with James Brown? Posner states that Florence Ballard had her boyfriend manage her career but he it's obvious he didn't do too much homework because Flo married Tommy Chapman. I guess it suited Posner's frame of mind to make the women at Motown look like a bunch of loose women just to suit the title of his book. The only thing that was interesting in his book is the way Motown ripped off the artists and producers by selling records at a discount so they didn't have to pay royalties.If you're a Motown fan, please check this book out of the library because it's not worth purchasing."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"A quick note on Ponser's book. I probably would have never picked up a book about Motown or sought one out, but decided to take a quick look at the bookstore and was immediately intrigued. I think that it's a great read, and never felt that the narration was slow or dull at any moment. It had a fast paced energy that kept me wanting more. I thought that the way the drama between Motown's management and stars developed was more fascinating than a year of soap operas.:)Particularly the sections about Diana Ross's relationship with Gordy and Gordy's business moves into film. Overall...I'm very impressed with the writing and the book has compelled me to look more into Motown's music to help fully understand what is so fascinating about this period of music making.

Great job, Gerald!"},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"An earlier community reviewer accused Gerald Posner of sloppy scholarship regarding his study of the Kennedy assassination in \\"Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the Assassination of JFK.\\" His opinion is not at all shared by the numerous scholars who praise the author for his meticulous research and objectively weighing of the evidence. Posner is on a first name basis with a high number of the greatest historians living today. He is far more than a mere journalist. Most assuredly, Posner has written the definitive book on the Motown phenomenon. Any mistakes, which are normal in a work of this kind, will be far and few between. Posner pulls no punches about the huge price both the executives and entertainers of this recording giant paid for putting out such beautiful music. The Motown sound is greatly responsible for bringing together the races during the Civil Rights era of the 1960s. Never before did so many white teenagers listen to the offerings of Afro-American musical artists. Their racial attitudes dramatically changed for the better. Barry Gordy comes across as a genius who understood what the public wanted, and how best to respond to that need. The leader generally sets the tone for everybody else and he failed miserably to set a good example. Gordy is no saint and the record tycoon's own irresponsible actions encouraged similar misbehavior by those around him. Illegal drug use, widespread alcohol abuse, and promiscuous sex became the norm to the point where one doubts if a person adhering to conventional values could have even survived a week in such a warped social milieu. The Motown people are highly talented, but few are to be envied or looked upon as role models. It is no coincidence that some of them died an early death.The viewing of laws and sausage being made is not for the faint of heart. Do we also really need to know that entertainers are often immature and reckless? Isn't it preferable to leave some stones unturned? Has Gerald Posner told us more than we should want to know concerning the Motown empire? I don't accept this line of argumentation. Posner stops short of indulging in prurient scandal mongering. He knows where to draw the line. Motown still plays an important role in the cultural life of our nation. We therefore have a legitimate reason to learn more about this influential organization's history. Gerald Posner's \\"Motown: Money, Power, Sex, and Music\\" is also highly recommended for anyone contemplating a show business career. They might be able to learn how to avoid similar personal heartbreak and degradation."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"Since Gerald Posner's error-filled \\"Case Closed\\" work on the JFK assassination (exposed most articulately by author Harold Weisberg), I have regarded him with a jaundiced eye. His latest work, Motown:Money, Power, Sex, and Music is an even sketchier effort, offering nothing in the way of new revelations about the legendary music company, it's creator Berry Gordy, or it's stable of timeless stars. Being very familiar with all that's been written to this point, I can say that Posner's work is little more than a cut and paste job of previous works (many factually dubious and slanted...like Mary Wilson's agenda filled drivel)and is no where near the work on Motwon by Nelson George.Like others before him, Posner seems to take extreme delight in tearing apart Diana Ross, repeating salacious rumors repeated by jealous co-workers, ignoring the fact that Ross started a trust fund for Flo Ballard's children, bought Wilson a home, and was regarded by her contemporaries as the hardest working star at Motown who earned her fame. Posner outright lies at the reason for Ross's last canceled tour (the tour was a near sell out) and also lies about the reviews for the RTL Tour (which were almost unanimously glowing).Finding the real reasons behind the cancellation of that tour would have been interesting.His treatment of Gordy is equally shameful, and it is a shame Posner wasted the time spent scouring Motown's legal records to come up with next to nothing to add to the historical record.Pass up this mess, and buy George's Where Did Our Love Go if you want an accurate picture of Hitsville, USA."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"This book was nothing more than a collection of excerpts from other peoples (auto)biographies.That's it.

Do we really need to know who screwed (in the real sense or otherwise) whom? It reads like one of TV's \\"inside reporting\\" jobs on celebrities, and maybe that's the wide audience the writer is trying to tap into. Motown was about the music. That, however, is just the starting platform of this book and quickly left behind. For me, the rest of the data is a Big Who Cares?"},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"This is my first Motown read which I personally enjoyed. The story starts with Berry Gordy's early days as a co-songwriter of Jackie Wilson's most popular hits; To Be Loved,\\" and his hit classic \\"Lonely Teardrops,\\" etc. Once Gordy had a falling out with co-songwriter Billy Davis and royalty issues existed with the label for both, the duo went their separate ways. Berry Gordy used what royalties he made to establish his Hitsville USA Studios in Detroit - which became the Motown recording label and a Legend (Motown) was born. The story implies how Berry did the same thing with royalties that was done to him which is basically short change the young artists and songwriters he signed with shrewd contracts and capitalizing on their being nave in the music industry. On the flip side Berry could make these artists and songwriters pull magic out of themselves that both artists and songwriters had in their souls to create that special Motown sound. He made them all take it to another level to put only the best Motown songs out to the market.Posner writes about the earliest days of the Motown Hitsville USA bus tours down south and the terrible things all the new artists had to overcome because of segregation and prejudice. Then finally how the Motown sound was accepted as crossover music for artists like The Marvelettes, Supremes, Temptations, Miracles etc. which was Berry Gordy's goal from day one. In this book you'll read about the struggles and tragedies of stars like Marvin Gaye, Florence Ballard and Paul Williams who all passed away too early... Posner also writes about how this new Motown Sound was hitting the airwaves which changed our music culture in the 60s. Even the Beatles loved the Motown sound! The young artists knew that if you made it you became part of the Motown name and family forever. Although I felt Posner focused a lot on the legalese side there was enough of the Motown story to keep me interested. One last comment as a writer of that era. I agree with one thing from Publishers weekly review. \\"Although Posner's writing does cover many of the songs for the nostalgic he doesn't convey the richness of the music itself.\\" Other than that this is a good read and I have already recommended this book to a few of my peers that love Motown..."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"Books and movies on the Funk Brothers and Motown artists enrapture readers and viewers with Motown's mobilized creativity and the never-again equalled gems. This book, Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power, by Gerald Posner is a great read with a different perspective. It shows the toils, foibles, relationships, un-substantiated schemes, and amok-isms behind the skin of the Motown company (\\"Beauty is only skin deep.\\" Yawn, yes. But, it is true.). Rather than enrapturing, this book evokes, at times, admiration and, at times, revulsion. The book suggests that Berry Gordy's greatnesses helped build the beautiful Motown and his weaknesses gave Motown cardiac arrest to the abandonment of the Detroit musicians, artists, and the world-wide listening public. The reader infers from this book that Berry Gordy, perhaps alone, landed on his feet - a rich man of questionable conscience with many good people left as his road kill.

I found that Mr Posner does not have a clue about the people that he is writing about. He is using well known facts from other books and making it seem like he is giving us something new. Nothing in the book is fresh, so go to other sources to find out the information. In fact, I just saw him on the E online special about Diana Ross, talking as if he were an expert, but he has never interviewed any of the major players (Diana, Berry, Smokey etc.), so how is he an expert. If this were the case, I could write a book and make it seem like I know these people."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"I was doing some research on Motown and so read a few books on the company.

Skip it and go to Gordy's."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"One has to wonder what the point is behind this analysis of Motown. The problems can be seen right at the beginning of the book, as Posner describes in the preface that he was unable to interview virtually anybody. His main source of information is court records from the numerous lawsuits against Motown from artists trying to get their royalties. Therefore this is a very biased and lopsided book. First, Posner is clearly not a music writer and has extremely little understanding of the classic music of Motown and the social forces that shaped it and were shaped by it. When attempting to describe the sounds he can only use shallow adjectives like \\"funky\\" or \\"sharp.\\" Posner instead focuses on the business behind the Motown phenomenon, as Berry Gordy started with $800 and built one of the greatest record labels in history, but then was unable to prevent its slow and painful downfall. However, as noted above, Posner mainly uses legal documents as evidence, so his stance on business practices is tilted toward Gordy's enemies from the outset.Worst is Posner's coverage of individuals, especially Gordy himself. Since Posner admits that he interviewed nobody, then his descriptions of a person's private thoughts and beliefs, which he attempts frequently, can only be copied straight from other biographies with little surrounding context. Posner also easily joins the parade of disparagement against Diana Ross, who may just deserve people's wrath, but you should be suspicious when a person is criticized but is not there to give their side of the story. Posner also gets in over his head when trying to analyze the complex personalities of Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. Finally his slow-moving writing style doesn't give you the incentive to turn the pages, and the end of the story is appallingly weak with a halfhearted attempt to wrap up Motown's place in history.If you are interested in the classic music of Motown and its talented stars, go elsewhere, please. This book does a better job of analyzing the business of Motown but is too fragmented and second-hand for true believability. If you're interested in that subject, also go elsewhere."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"Mr. Posner has given us a well-written and most enjoyable book that has a clear-eyed affection for its subject. The book captures the magic of the early years, the painful maturity as artists decided to leave Motown, the meandering later years, and the eventual and multiple sales of Motown to different entities. The stories are told with enthusiasm and the accomplishments are given the praise deserved, but Mr. Posner doesn't flack for any personality or viewpoint. In fact, he often presents multiple points of view of some events so the reader can decide where the truth is likely to be hiding.Since this isn't a book of encyclopedic length, it has to focus on certain key points and that means a lot gets left out. And though many artists contributed to Motown's fabulous accomplishments, the book centers on Berry Gordy, Jr., his founding of the company, how he gathered all that amazing talent, and how Motow provided an environment where that talent could develop and flourish.The book also focuses on the biggest acts and on those employees who were closest to Gordy. Necessarily, a lot of talented and wonderful people get left out of this telling of the story. THe book is just over 300 pages and it would take thousands of pages to tell something approaching a complete history of Motown. However, this book is delightful to read and gets those of us without inside knowledge closer to these personalities than many of us have every been.There are so many different and passionate views about who deserves credit for what in all the successes of Motown and who deserves blame for all the various failures that no book can satisfy everyone. However, Mr. Posner has done a great deal to talk to as many folks as would talk with him, did a lot of reading, and dug into court records to find out what really went on. He found out a lot about the truth of the charges and counter charges in key court cases and business practices that existed in Motown over the decades of its existence. The book takes an even handed view and isn't afraid to tell us about Mr. Gordy's rather sharp business practices, the self-delusion and self-destruction of many artists, as well as the glorious way they pulled together in the early years to make themselves into huge stars. The book isn't a puff piece, but it also doesn't drag the people discussed in the book through the mud.If you haven't already made up your mind, I think you will enjoy this book very much. At least, I can say that I did.

This particular history of Motown is quite extensive starting with founder Berry Gordy's life before he founded Motown and going all the way to the present state of Motown.There are comments and interviews from all of the major players from Berry Gordy on down to the producers, songwriters and other staff of Motown. It isn't immediately clear whether these are firsthand interviews or comments from other sources (i.e. Marvin Gaye's comments are necessarily from older printed sources) but all are presented well in context. You really get a comprehensive view of how Motown worked from all sides of the equation, not just the artists. It's also an eye-opener to modern readers about just how tough a time Gordy had breaking African-American records into the mainstream. It seems a no-brainer these days but obviously, it wasn't always that way.Keep your iPhone or tablet handy because you'll want to listen to snippets of the songs as they're mentioned in the book.

Yes, these people had sad lives and I am truly sorry for the problems they had, but Posner doesn't add anything to the stories. He simply re-hashes them. Also, I'm sick of reading the \\"Dynasty\\" style stories about Berry Gordy and Diana Ross. I'm not saying they are either saints or sinners. They are people with many flaws.I thought maybe Posner would concentrate on the music, which he rarely does. If I have to read another sentence about the awful \\"Mahagony\\" movie, I think I'll get sick.I wish someone would write a book about Motown's music and just stick to that. If writing about various Motown artists' problems can help them or their families, then I'm all for it, but dredging up tabloid/trash stories is just plain bad!Like one other reviewer stated, I did find the section on Motown's practices with cut-out albums interesting.Sorry to rant and rave so much but I agree with the reviewer who said check it out of the library.

Posner read alot of other books, news articles and court records to compile his information and puts all of his findings here in his book, which was great for me. I would say that if you want a general overview of Motown's history, then get this book. If you want an indepth delving into Motown's history, get this book to start with. Then read other books such as Temptations, by Otis Williams, or Dreamgirl and Supreme Faith by Mary Wilson of the Supremes, or Where Did Our Love Go by Nelson George."},{"Title":"Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power (ISBN:0375500626)","review":"As many other reviewers have already written here, this book is largely inaccurate, overdramatic, and very disappointing. Mr. Posner has consistently incorrect facts throughout the book from the very beginning right through the end which is surprising because the stories he tells have already been well documented several times and this book had the opportunity to become the definitive Motown story. It doesn't even come close.The supposed \\"blank packages\\" Gerald claims to have received in preparing for this book must have literally been blank because there was little to no revealing information contained inside that couldn't have been found elsewhere.His stories all came from published sources, and in retelling the story, his facts get mixed up or are often just plain wrong. In some cases, he doesn't even cite the source. For instance, Claudette Robinson did not sing lead on the original version of Shop Around. Smokey sings lead on both, and the book just goes downhill from there. In other sections of his book, Posner took stories directly out of Mary Wilson's autobiography, Dreamgirl, but didn't even credit the book as a source (instead he credited her second book about her life after the 60s Supremes broke up).In his acknowledgements, Posner thanks Adam White for correcting many of his mistakes, I assume Adam never saw more than an overview or a few pages. Too bad he didn't turn the entire thing over to Adam.Mr. Posner, please do your homework next time. This book report does not pass."},{"Title":"Whiteoaks","review":"Quite a few years ago I was introduced to the Jalna series. As I was skeptical, I started with the main title Jalna.

If you want some good meaty ideas on techniques and equipment, look elsewhere.I bought this book looking for specific ideas on equipment usage and for killer photos. In many of the photos the flower itself appears, in my opinion, overexposed. Hopefully this is an artifact of the printing process. In any case the end result is that some of the printed photos do not meet the quality standard set by other photo books.The comments on exposure scattered throughout the book imply that the author did not use TTL (through-the-lens) spot metering. Today it is hard to buy a 35mm camera without some sort of TTL spot function The author's lack of specificity in this case can greatly mislead those who are just beginning flower photography. The author's comments apply perfectly--to full screen metering only. Whay chaps me is that the author says nothing about the type of metering used. This, in a nutshell, is my biggest squawk about this book. Too many generalities. And if you want to do the best you can with what you have, you need specifics.There are some good ideas like carry some string to tie back branches. I especially like the trick of converting the camera to an incedent light meter. Elegant.Insofar as equipment utilization, the subject of multiple flash was barely mentioned. Nor was, unless I missed it, the idea of using a 24mm lens plus your smallest (12mm) extension tube for close up in the face shots."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Flowers (How To Photograph Series)","review":"Like another reviewer, I was a bit let down with this one.

That being said, I did pick up several good techniques from it, i.e. tricks of the trade, so It was helpful in that aspect.

I hate to visit such terms on the reader, but they do cover naturopathy's sectarian set: 'purposeful life spirit / god power within' / 'healing power of nature / vis medicatrix naturae' keystone belief obligations {the metaphysical, supernatural, idealistic, theistic / religious}. I attended UBCNM, where I was taught that 'modern nonsectarian scientific medicine' is founded upon such flapdoodle: that within the scientific is the unevidenced, the nonscientific, the scientifically-ejected, and the scientifically-discarded. Lindlahr was a required author, along with Kent and Hahnemann, Kaptchuk and Goodheart, to name a few. Some quotes from this book pertaining to FNPLA naturopathy's woo-woo: \\"life or vital force [...is] the primary force of all forces [...] an expression of divine intelligence [...of] the divine energy which sets in motion the whirls in the ether [...an] intelligent energy [that] can have but one source: the will and intelligence of the creator [p.023...] the life force, [is] itself a manifestation of the great creative intelligence which some call god, others nature, the oversoul, brahma, prana, the great spirit, etc. [...] this supreme intelligence and power acting in and through every atom, molecule and cell in the human body, which is the true healer, the 'vis medicatrix naturae' [...aka] 'the healer within' [p.024...] everything is done to improve and economize the vital force [p.029...] health is dependent upon an abundant supply of life force [p.032...] just what this vital force is and where it originates we do not know. It is the manifestation of that which we term god, nature, the higher power, or the divine within [p.273].\\" How is the belief that god and the godly are within oneself NOT a religious type?

That was Tim Tackett, Chris Kent production then. The pictures in this book are new but not as good or comprehensive as the Tackett/Kent book. My advice is get the Text Book version, and Pick up Tackett and Kent's Jeet Kune Do kickboxing book. Those are actually good. If you want to review techniques and understand alot of what goes into making a good JKD fighter. It is important to note that for that last part you must have read and absorbed the Tao of Jeet Kune Do.Another complaint I have about this book, and is by no means minor, is the way Chris Kent handles grappling. It is quite clear to even a six month practicianer of, nearly any grappling art, except maybe Small Circle Jiu-jitsu, that Kent has no idea of what he is talking about. The problem is that Kent does not understand the grappling range at all. He seems to think it is a place where (after he has performed his miracle trapping) his opponent will just allow him to twist, crank, and lock him in any way Kent wants. There is no discussion of how dynamic this range is. Chris Kent, like Larry Harstell, can perform myriad locks and takedowns in the context of various drills, I am not sure they can do anything in a live situation. I am not saying they cannot, but the way they present their grappling, it appears that they really do not have an accurate idea of what happens when some one with skill crashes into you. I must say that is not the case with all JKD fighters (and in their defense, it may not be the case with Kent, and Hartstell). Roy Harris, Jack McVicker, Paul Vunak, Dion Riccardo, and Eric Paulson, and Dan Insosanto all understand what it is to really grapple. The point is from the Kent book I do not think he could handle a white belt of one year at any reputable bjj school."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"This book is perfect summer reading! It is a delicious little fantasy that is obviously based on the author's affection for real people, not cardboard romance heros and heriones.

If you want a romance that has a genuine sense of personality, and enough substance from a historical and political perspective to keep you interested, I highly recommend this one"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"This was my first EJ book to read. For some reason I had a hard time getting involved in this book until after the first 1/3 of the book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. Gabby and Quill were delightful. I liked the fact that Gabby isn't perfect in her figure as in so many other books. I appreciated Quill taking up for & looking after Gabby. He was kind of her \\"knight in shining armor\\" showing up at the right times- or taking up for her since she hadn't been taught correct etiquette. One of the scenes that I enjoyed was Quill trying to ask Gabby to marry him and casualy quoting Shakespeare \\"I pine, I burn, I perish for you\\" in his practiced speech- he was real ackward with it. Gabby was getting tickled since she recognized the lines. Quill got frustrated and decided to drop the whole speech taking Gabby into his arms kissing her passionately quoting a couple of words here and there between kisses-I pine (kiss) I burn (kiss) I perish for you (kiss)- boy, it worked for me. The friendship between Gabby and Lady Sophie was precious, too. There was humor as well as some sadness- due to the death of Quill's father and Quill's unsureness about his illness and being able to satisfying Gabby. I also enjoyed the the love story between Emily and Lucien. Over all it is a good book."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"&quot;Enchanting Pleasures&quot; is the third book in the Pleasure series.

I was anticipating Quill's story, and I was a little disappointed, especially with the heroine Gabby."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I began reading Eloisa James. I picked up this book at my used book store and I really couldn't remember if I had read it. I think I may have started it back when it was first out, but I decided to read it again. I was so pleasantly surprised. Looking back now, I can see what a good writer E. James was. To me, she has become too smart for her own good and her recent books are overpopulated with too many decadent characters and confusing plots.Enchanting Pleasures had a likable couple and a little bit of a silly plot device designed to keep them from their HEA right away. But, and I think this last reason is why I liked her earlier books, it only had one other story going on. Lucien and Emily's story was very captivating, but EJ kept it short and sweet. In her books now, there are so many characters and stories going on, that it is sometimes hard to keep them straight. And she has definitely gone in for a lot more decadence than she did at the beginning. That isn't always a good thing.I liked that in this book the story of Gabby and Quill(!!) was front and center. At times, I will admit, I skimmed the story of Kasi Rao as I didn't find the Indian politics story all that interesting. As I said before, this was a well-written, tight story. Not a lot of jumping around from couple to couple.My final thought is that maybe I don't like this book so much as I really dislike her present writing style. But, I know I have a copy of Potent Pleasures around somewhere. I'm going to dig it out and reread it. And, I hope Eloisa James gets back to her roots."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I thought this follow up book for Ms. James &quot;Pleasure&quot; series was well done. The relationship between Quill and Gabby was really cute. I found myself dreading to reach the end of the book because I fell in love with the two main characters. They did have their differences but they were not mean to each other like the way the first book of the series was. The second book &quot;Midnight Pleasures&quot; was very good, I was very happy to find that Ms. James did not let us down with &quot;Enchanting Pleasures&quot;. You will remember Quill from the second book as the gentleman that came home injured and couldn't walk. He was a close friend of Patrick and Sophie Foakes. They brought Quill's character back in this recent book, of which he still suffers from migraines when riding a horse, or any other activities that involve that sort of movement. Gabby is sent over from India as an arranged bride for Quill's younger brother because Quill's father believes Quill unable to &quot;perform&quot; his husbandly duties. Of course his younger brother doesn't want the marriage and his older brother comes in for the rescue. And the characters of Sophie and Patrick are in this book as well. It was a treat to read about the couple once again. I would not pass this book up. It is a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I had heard mixed reviews about this author, mostly negative, but I don't like to pass judgment until I have read an author's work. Suffice to say, I could only force myself to read about twelve chapters (and I do mean force) before I couldn't take anymore. The characters were confusing and not at all interesting. Nor did the title live up to the book. There was nothing pleasurable about the story or the hero and heroine."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Heroine: plump/voluptuousGabrielle Jerningham is a bride being given away by her father. Literally. The old man, who has no love for his awkward and untidy daughter, jumps at the chance to ship her from his palace in India half-way around the world to England, where she'll marry the son of his old chum Viscount Dewlan sight-unseen. Or nearly so. Declaring it makes her face look too round, Gabby refuses to send a portrait of herself to her betrothed. But the viscount sends along a miniature of his younger son Peter, whom he deems his only chance at keeping the family line secure. (Quill, his eldest, was injured in an accident some time before and believes himself unable to father children, since participating in any type of activity involving repetitive motion leaves him plagued with migraines for days afterwards.)Gabby, young, alone, and aching for love becomes deeply infatuated with Peter's likeness, imagining him to be a tender and soft-spoken gentleman who will cherish her from they moment they first meet. But reality breaks her heart when she arrives in England and discovers that he is nothing more than an arrogant fop with minimal interest in the fairer sex, except where the topic of fashion is concerned.Quill sees that Gabby is presented with options which could only result in a lifetime of misery: return to her hateful father in India; marriage to Peter, who is also sure to tear her down every chance he gets; or be saddled with a cripple if he should marry her himself. The headstrong financial whiz elects to pursue the last course of action: marry the voluptuous Gabby and take her to his bed regardless of the physical consequences he knows he'll suffer.Gabby soon falls in love with her handsome fianc&eacute; and will risk anything to help heal his malady, even if it means deceiving him. But is the cure worth the risk of losing the respect of the man she loves? Or even the man himself?What worked for me:Even though the main romance was an enjoyable one to follow, I personally loved the secondary romance, which had more touches of the traditional Regency novel. I could easily have seen this storyline fleshed out as a fourth installment in the \\"Pleasures\\" series.Size-wise Gabby is soft and lush in the eyes of Quill, but appears overly-fleshy to his brother Peter. For myself, I saw her as looking like Kate Winslet might if she added 20 pounds or so.What didn't work for me:Far more naive than other girls her age, Gabby's impetuous behavior was for the most part charming. Or at least it was until the climax of the story, at which point she just seemed extremely immature by acting out in the same all-or-nothing fashion of Juliet Capulet.Overall:A good read for fans of sensual Regency-Setting romances who appreciate excellent writing. Though it can stand on its own, I think folks owe it to themselves to read the two earlier books of the trilogy first. I certainly plan on seeking them out myself.If you liked \\"Enchanting Pleasures\\" you might also enjoy \\"The Last Days of a Rake\\", \\"Unmarriageable\\", \\"The Accidental Bride\\", \\"The Bride and the Beast\\", \\"The Fire-Flower\\", or \\"Suddenly You\\"."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"&quot;Enchanting Pleasures&quot; is, I think, the best Regency romance novel that Eloisa James has written to date. And while the whole premise of Quill Dewland's illness seems a bit unbelievable to me, the story line and characters are still enjoyable and crisp, and made for riveting reading.Viscount Dewland owes his good friend Jerningham a large sum of money, and instead of repaying the loan, which he can now do because of his eldest son's, Quill, industriousness, the Viscount has decided that his younger son, Peter, will marry Jerningham daughter, Gabrielle. (Quill quite ineligible because of an accident that makes it difficult and painful for him to perform his martial duties.) Peter is aghast: a fastidious man with firm ideas of what his wife should look and be like, he is appalled at having to marry a woman sight unseen, esp as he has no immediate desire to do so right now. However the Viscount is adamant and quite ill, and so Peter finds himself agreeing to marry Gabrielle in order to placate his father.Of course Gabrielle Jerningham ('Gabby') is the exact antithesis of Peter's notions of the perfect woman. Gabby is a pretty, plump, warm hearted and clever young woman, whose charming manners and winning ways soon enchants everyone she meets ... except Peter. Peter only sees that his fiance is unpolished and unsophisticated, with dreadful clothes and hair that keeps falling down. Quill however finds Gabby to be absolutely captivating. However there is the small matter of his illness, and even if it were not for that, Gabby is still Peter's fiancee. In the meantime, romantical Gabby, who had fallen in love with Peter's likeness, realises that Peter is quite disappointed with her. She is resolved to try and live up to his expectations in order to win his approval, but is not quite sure of what else to do save dress more elegantly. She is also rather disconcerted to realise that Quill's mere presence seems to thrill her, and the fact that Quill seems to have an appreciation of her intelligence and warmth in a way that Peter does not. Gabby is quite confused at the turn things have taken, when news arrives that the Viscount's illness has taken a turn for the worse; Peter leaves London in order to support his mother, leaving Gabby to spend more time with Quill. What will happen? Will Quill and Gabby realise that they are meant for each other? And what of Peter?I enjoyed &quot;Enchanting Pleasures&quot; especially because of Gabby Jerningham. She is such a warm hearted, intelligent, charming and straightforward young woman, and I really found myself rooting for her to find her soul mate. There are three subplots to this novel: the Gabby-Peter-Quill subplot, the finding a cure for Quill's illness subplot, and the missing Indian prince subplot. All three subplots are woven together rather well. The missing Indian prince subplot is a rather interesting and informative one, esp if you are interested in a small thumbnail sketch in what was going on in India during the early 19th century, and with the East Indian Company. I found the whole Quill's mysterious illness bit a little far fetched, but then I'm not that well informed on medical matters, and perhaps Quill's illness is probable.&quot;Enchanted Pleasures&quot; is an enjoyable read. There were several instances when I found myself chuckling out loud: as when Gabby realising that neither brother really listens to her when she speaks, wonders if not really listening is an inherited trait; and when Gabby pretends to be an empty-headed young lady when she is questioned by an East Indian Army official about the missing prince's whereabouts. This is a really fun novel and made for really enchanting reading."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"In 1806 London, Viscount Dewland informs his younger child Peter that since his older son Quill is disabled and incapable of having a wife, Peter will marry the daughter of his friend Lord Jerningham. Peter refuses, insisting he will never marry. However, the Viscount turns ill as he explodes with anger because he owes his friend who lent him money without any cause or collateral except friendship. Gabrielle will be coming from India to marry Peter or else. Peter reluctantly agrees due to his father's perilous health, but plans to escape his fate.After receiving a picture of her fiance, Gabby looks forward to marrying the gorgeous Peter. However, she fears that she will never attain the level of deployment Peter expects from a wife and activities in London soon prove her correct. Then there is also Quill, who sends her heart aflutter every time she sees him. He, in turn, decides he will marry Gabby regardless of his severe headaches or his younger sibling.As expected from Eloisa James, ENCHANTING PLEASURES lives up to its title as fans of regency romance will receive much pleasure from this enchanting tale. The story line is fresh, but it is the characters who make the tale so crisp. Gabby is an innocent original while the two brothers are the type of male protagonists female readers want in their literature (and in their boudoir). Ms. James is a fabulous talent and her &quot;pleasure&quot; novels continually prove that she is heading to genre greatness.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"This is my second Eloisa James novel & I liked it enough that I'll pick up another soon, but I was on the whole frustrated.The beginning of the novel rolls along quite nicely; Gabrielle is really delightful, both clever and naive, and Quinn is stiff but immediately endearing.What bothered me is that once they're actually married, the plot starts to hinge on how angry it makes Quinn that Gabrielle (1) doesn't want to provoke his migraines because she is horrified by how painful they are (2) won't give up looking for a solution that Quinn hasn't already tried. It's easy to understand where they're both coming from; Quinn is proud, and he's wounded enough that he can be cruel, while Gabby is thin-skinned and maddeningly optimistic.But all of the fights and battles were painful to read. A little too real for me, to be honest.I really, really liked the side-plot with the marquis and the fashion columnist. It would have made a great book on its own right."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Gabrielle (&quot;Gabby&quot;) Jerningham was sent from her father in India to marry the man due to gain the title of Viscount Dewland. Even though the oldest son was named Erskine (&quot;Quill&quot;), she was to marry the younger son named Peter. Quill had a head injury some years ago and rhythm, for any amount of time (such as making love or horseback riding), caused him to suffer a severe migraine for the next 3-5 days. Therefore, he was considered lame. If a man could not make love to a wife, then he could not have a child, or heir. So Peter would have to marry Gabby.Peter was considered perfect by the Ton. He found Gabby to be too talkative, have too curvy a figure, and no sense of style. In fact, he disliked everything about her. Quill thought just the opposite of Gabby and was determined to claim her himself! Her love was worth anything, including nauseating migraines!At the same time, the East India Trading Company and England's Foreign Affairs believed Gabby knew the whereabouts of the missing Indian Prince, Kao Rasi. Kao was only 10 years old and was to be a pawn in the Indian government. Gabby would never reveal she knew where Kao was or her part in his disappearance.*** No gripping suspense, just a sweet love story. I felt the urge to slap the hero and heroine often though. The co-characters, Lady Sophie and Lady Sylvia, were a delight! I often found myself smiling or chuckling at them. This one is not the author's best work, but still highly enjoyable. ***"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"This was my first Eloisa James and I must admit that it doesn't make me want to try a second one of her books. It wasn't badly written, well not too badly, but the book's bra straps were totally showing.Erskine Dewland's viscount father has arranged for Quill, as Erskine is nicknamed, to marry Gabrielle Jerningham, the daughter of a duke's younger son who has been living in India as a missionary. However, Quill's riding accident a few years back left him with a bum leg and migraines - acute three-day migraines which are triggered by horse riding and sexual congress. Unwilling to be married if he can't be a true husband, his father compels Quill's younger brother Peter to marry her instead, much to Peter's consternation.Thus begins a sort of comedy of errors.Gabrielle has grown up in India in an extremely sheltered home and is utterly ignorant of English rules of decorum and social skills in general. Her frequent gaffes, clumsy moments and misjudgements are meant to be humorous, I suppose, but I found them grating. I didn't understand why she wouldn't ask for guidance or quietly observe how others behaved if she truly wanted to impress the propriety-focused Peter as she said she did.So we stumble along the romantic love triangle plot, an odd sub-plot involving smuggling a young heir to an Indian throne and a seemingly random sub-plot romance between a male character whose presence in the novel is never explained and woman who's connected to Gabby in a loose friend of a friend sort of way. I can't for the life of me imagine what the extra romance sub-plot was included to show, but the prince smuggling was very obviously to show how very super clever Gabby is. Hello plot? Your slip is sticking out a bit there in the back.There are a number of rather heavy handed moments like this. Gabby's friend Sophie must have been a heroine of an earlier novel, as we're given a wealth of info about her and her husband that does little to advance this plot. She's also unreasonably loyal and perfect as a friend. I get it. She's Sophie's friend. There's no need to make her a total Mary Sue to make the point.It's evident fairly early on that Peter is gay. Not only gay, but romance novel gay - obsessed with fashion, parties and gossip. He does not want to marry the ungainly Gabby at all - dismissing her as uncultured, clumsy and chubby - and treats her unfeelingly. His POV shows a callous, selfish man rather than a sympathetic outsider caught up in unfortunate circumstances. As we spend a fair amount of time with him, it's a downer to not be able to empathize with him. And again, we get it, he doesn't want to marry Gabby, he didn't have to be a total jerk about it. He is one of many unsympathetic characters in this novel.And, to be honest, Gabby was wholly unlikeable herself. I can't abide a liar, and Gabby can't tell the truth or keep a promise. Quill makes her promise not to buy crazy remedies to try to cure his migraines, as he's tried them all and has just accepted the migraines are a part of him. So what does she do? She slips him a dangerous medication because she loves him and knows what's best for him. James does not even begin to torture her nearly enough to redeem her for that violation.Quill was pretty much the only likeable character in the book. He's crippled by a riding accident, but gets on with it, refusing to dwell on what he can't change. When he sees how miserable Peter and Gabby would be, and he acknowledges how much he likes Gabby himself, he sets out to marry Gabby - three-day nausea-filled migraines be damned. He's honest, responsible and sensitive. He's also surrounded by idiots.Sad to say I disliked the book. Entirely too transparent a plot, too much telling, plot exposition in dialog and unlikeable characters team up to make me a sad panda indeed."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I has looked forward to this book since reading the author's previous two books. I knew she was revisiting with characters introduced in the previous novels. However, I was very disappointed in this book.The story was never on the same level as the first two. The medical premise of the story was weak and a bit contrived, especially the &quot;Cure&quot; and the life and death struggle at the end. The humor was weak and uneven. Overall not the quality I had anticipated."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I was really looking forward to reading Quill's story. I must say I had to struggle through finishing this book. I really didn't care for Gabby's character and if I had to read that she was plump or fat one more time I was going to scream. I am assuming from the way sophie said she was built much like her, that she was really just curvy like marilyn monroe but I was sick of hearing it said that she was fat. Also this is the second book that James insinuates that Peter is gay. We should all be adult readers, just come out and say it! I kept waiting for her to declare it to the readers but she never does. Also I found Lucien's love story holding my interest more so than Gabby and Quill's. I am glad I awaited the paperback and did not waste my money on the hardback. Since her 1st 2 novels were so great I will read her next one, but right now I am just disapointed with the story after awaiting it for so long."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Really good book. I liked that he was flawed and how she was not afraid to bring it out into the open and discuss his problem. Of course, the cure for his migraines is a little unbelievable, who knows, maybe poison from tree frogs might just be the cure everyone who suffers is looking for. I liked that right from the start he saw past the rounder than society likes figure to see the beauty and passion in Gabby. And I liked that Gabby was willng to do what it took so that Quill did not have to suffer, even if it took taking charge in the bedroom! Eloisa James has written three very good keeper books and I hope she continues to write for a long time."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Am definitely keeping this book & will read it again. Was laughing out loud (LOL) at the first \\"tea\\" and the events that took place. Excellent dialog, very subtle, dry humor at times along with slapstick comedy. Very sexy romances & the people are truly endearing. Actually was quite a page turner for me, started it at night & stayed up for hours reading it! What a treasure of a book!"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Gabrielle Jerningham journeys from her home in India to meet her betrothed, Peter Dewland. This is one small problem. Peter has no desire to marry this or any other woman. He has been forced to the altar as a result of his older brother's medical condition. Erskine, or Quill, suffers from the ill effects of an accident that has left him unable to ride a horse or perform marital duties without suffering a debilitating migraine. Yet when Quill meets his beautiful and highly unconventional sister-in-law-to-be, headaches and loyalty to his brother are the last things on his mind. Vibrant characterization flows throughout the story from the quirky Gabby to the stoic Quill to the showy Peter and all the secondary characters along the way. Sparkling dialogue complements descriptive narrative and lush sensuality. This story is devoid of useless plots and affected twists. The main deterrent to the relationship is as unique as Gabby's attempts to overcome the affliction. The story grows and develops as the relationship between Gabby and Quill blossoms. Ms. James has written a satisfying story that is difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I've read all the Pleasures books, and I think Eloisa James just keeps getting better and better. This is the funniest and the sweetest one. The scene when Gabby drugs her husband had me laughing out loud.

I adored Peter and did not like to see him troubled. But honestly, Ms James, did Quill really have to tell Gabby EVERYTHING Peter had said about her?Overall, an excellent book."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I liked it. Very good, but not off the charts . Not much more to say, so won't say more."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Catches your attention but it never goes beyond a pleasant diversionary read.I have enjoyed much better from this author."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I'm in my late 30s and decided to start reading some old classics like Brave New World, 1984, Endless Love, and Pride and Prejudice. I'm so glad Eloisa James got to write a little note in my copy of P&P because it made me want to read her works. I started with the first book of hers and LOVED IT! It was my first romance read! I have now read all 3 of this first trilogy and have to say the third (Enchanting Pleasures) is my fave so far! LOVE this time period, type of writing and LOVE LOVE LOVE all the arousing parts to the book! I've never read anything like it! I enjoyed the story, the characters and the sexiness and most of all I enjoyed the main characters' (yep, both Gabby and Quill) confidence and communication and refusal to be submissive! This is my fave so far, but I'm totally hooked on Eloisa James and am glad there are many more of her books for me to read!"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I was really pleased to read Quill's story. I thought he was a darling - I loved the way he was so madly in love with Gabby. What spoiled the book for me was Gabby herself. She started off a delightful character and turned into a complete idiot - Quill deserved much better. On the other hand, the quiet romance that went on between the marquis and the fashion column is (whose names I have forgotten)is a delight."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I don't have a lot of words like a lot of other reviewers but I do have to say that this was a totally enjoyable read.If you like to read for fun then this is a good book for you. Quite often I find myself skimming through the middle of books. You read the first chapters to get into the book, you read the last chapters to get to the good stuff and then in the middle you have to sort of skim.I didn't do any skimming in this book. I loved the heroine's quirkiness, with her hair always falling out of its bun. I loved the hero Quill who had problems with his \\"performance\\". They two were made for each other.The story never once bored me. I loved it.This is my first \\"Eloisa James\\" book, I'm going to look for some more."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"But don't let the title throw you off. It IS a heartfelt romance novel, but one that intertwines humor, wit, social satire, and self-discovery (Dare I say at times it reminded me of Jane Austen's work?). Its a beautifully written story I have read over and over again, and will continue to read. Highly recommend to my fellow romantics at heart."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"i am never disappointed when i order a book thru amazon."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I really liked this book. I thought that Quill was sexy and remote but still sensual with a good sense of humor. Gabby could slip into some silliness, case in point her ability to fall inlove with anyone, but overall was a likeable heroine.The two best things in the book were the fun use of Shakespeare (I pine, I burn, I perish), and Gabbys voluptuous figure. I also appreciated that she was not the most graceful creature on the planet.Sexy and fun"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I was really looking forward to reading Quill's story.

I found Gabby to be a wonderful character. I get so very tired of authors constantly making their heroines so incredibly beautiful that men fall over with lust just from looking at them. Gabby was a \\"real\\" woman, she had normal flaws but still was comfortable in her own skin. She needed reassurance but was willing to believe another persons evaluations of her charms and intelligence. I found that charming. So many fictional heroines must be told over and over and over and over that they are beautiful, pretty, sweet, desirable, competent, worthwhile. I just get tired of it. She was a woman that I would actually like to have as a friend. For me, the recommendation doesn't come any higher than that.Quill was a little harder to like. He insisted on complete truth from Gabby once she was his wife but did not hesitate to lie to her in order to get what he wanted. Naturally, this was the character flaw that the author wanted us to see him work his way through. I personally think she did a great job of bringing him along slowly in order to make the changes to his personality believable.The information about migraine headaches was woven throughout the plot in a fascinating manner. Also, thank you Ms. James, for not making us suffer through encounters with Gabby's father. He was painted as a very unpleasant character and I had quite enough of him.A very pleasurable read. Highly recommended, especially if you like a heroine who actually could be a real person and not just a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Yes, it's not perfect, and I'd have given it 4 & 1/2 stars, if I could. But it, nevertheless, very powerful, romantic, and wonderful.Quill is such a strong but vulnerable hero; he's proud and arrogant, but has a very sweet, compassionate side. Gabby is very naive and innocent, but also wholly natural. Her big flaw is a tendency to make others decisions for them, but she and Quill both learn the hard way...which presented some of the most moving moments of the book. I cried and cried near the end. Quill was exceptionally endearing then.I liked the secondary romance very much, but I wish it had been addressed at the end as well and that the declaration scene had been fleshed out more. The Indian plot was interesting, but for me, not as interesting as the romance and the interplay within Quill's family. Quill's illness, while perhaps a bit farfetched, was more so in its resolution than anywhere else. Still.....happy endings and all.Frankly, it's just a stirring romance, and that's the bottom line."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I've read all the books in this series and I own them all in hardback on my &quot;keeper&quot; shelf. And this final book in the series is no exception.I loved Quill when we met him in a previous book and was thrilled to see him as the hero in Enchating Pleasures. I fell in love with him and with Gabby. Ms. James has crafted such wonderful characters in these two, and spiced the book with rich secondary characters--the end result being a really great read.As always, I am anticipating Ms. James next book, and keeping a space open on my keeper shelf."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"Wow! I really loved these books -- there are three in the series and they are excellent. Eloisa James is a professor of English literature and clearly knows her stuff. Her writing is delightful. She bases her stories on history -- loosely! She creates a complicated but delightful tale. The three books are interwoven with characters that you come to care about quickly. Hope she's working on #4!"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"This is a delicious book, following the two previous &quot;Pleasure&quot; Books. I look forward to all Eloisa James future books."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I've read all the Pleasures books, and I think Eloisa James just keeps getting better and better. This is the funniest and the sweetest one. The scene when Gabby drugs her husband had me laughing out loud. This is a great Pleasure!"},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"This book is better than the other two Pleasure Series (Potent and Midnight Pleasures)....both characters are likable, truly enchanting. The only complaint I had was that since it is the last series, Ms. James should've at least revisited the characters from the other two novels. There were few parts from Sophie and Patrick but none from Charlottle and Alex. Other than that, it is a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Enchanting Pleasures","review":"I was taken with Quill in MIDNIGHT PLEASURES, and was happy to read his story. He was great, and Gabby was comical and serious and lovely all at the same time, it seemed. Patrick was a nice addition here, as was the wonderful Sophie."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"Pigs have wings is one of the best books I have read, because it so funny. The way the characters are many times spaced out and the way they act on their stupidity, mostly the way P.G. Wodehouse makes fun of characters. Pigs have wings, is about competition between two pigs for the fattest pig class. They try to steal each other's pig, and the Empress (the name of the hero's pig) has been the winner of this class for two years in a row. All this is tied with some knotted yet silly love relationships. But the way Wodehouse makes fun of it is so funny that you will laugh untill tears start pouring down."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"Wodehouse, master of words that he is, shows his wit to be in top form in this wonderfully funny story of Blandings castle. As usual, Lord Emsworth is a bit dazed and obsessing about his pig (now hoping that she'll win first in her division for the third year running at the local agricultural show) and the guests at Blandings are falling hopelessly in love with one another. This is a great book for both those new to Wodehouse and those who have enjoyed his other works. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"I originally acquired this book as a result of a minor bet between my aunt and myself. The bet I will not tell you, but I will asure all readers that it was clean and honourable (unlike my spelling). As I said in the title I said it was typical wodehouse. Boy1 meets girl1 and the fall in love, unfortunately a mishap occurs so girl1 goes and gets engaged to boy2 who is really in love with girl2 who used to be engaged to him, then girl3 falls in love with the totally unelegible. In an effort to make him elegible she attempts to find ways to supply cash for the BIG SCEME, which of course she doesn't suceed at, unfortunately, in the process she observes Boy3 (the inelegible) doing something that she believes is inappropriate and as an upshot, gets engaged to Boy1. The problem is then straightened out and Girl3 expresses dismay and tells the truth, much to dismay of boy3. But as always occurs in Wodehouse everyone eventually ends up with the right person. But mixed in with this plot is the enevitable Empress of Blandings, who is moved everywhere, and stolen and has at least one attempt to nobble her, but of course the nobbleing occurs to the wrong pig and Empress comes out as winner. And Gally gets into his usual strife."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"P.G. Wodehouse was the 20th century's answer to William Shakespeare reproduced as musical comedy. In Pigs Have Wings, Mr. Wodehouse produced one of his very best efforts.As usual, the themes involve a satire of romantic love, miscommunications between the sexes, the vapid interests of the titled class, and the silliness of people in general.As the book opens, Clarence, ninth Earl of Emsworth finds himself faced with a threat to the supremacy of his pig, Empress of Blandings, in the Fat Pigs class at the Shropshire Agricultural Show. Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, Bart, of Matchingham Hall, had already hired away Clarence's pig handler, George Cyril Wellbeloved . . . and Clarence is sure that some new skullduggery will soon follow. As the story develops, we find that it's all too true. Soon both pig camps are doing their best to knobble the other man's pig. With everyone else having a bet on the outcome, many other people are soon engaged in trying to sabotage one pig or the other. It's the most pignapping fun caper you can imagine!In the background, we have all sorts of people who've become engaged to totally unsuitable people on the rebound from slights they feel from the one they really love. P.G. Wodehouse does a yeoman effort of returning all of those twisted loves to the proper party. The plot will keep you constantly chuckling throughout.There are quite a few books based on the Empress of Blandings. So if you enjoy this one, go on to the others in the series."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"In typical Wodehouse fashion, this is a comical story with many hilarious twists and turns. I found myself laughing aloud in many places. Simply put, if you like Wodehouse and especially the Blandings Castle series, you like this book. It is one of the later &quot;chronicles&quot; of Blandings Castle, but it would be a good read for anyone--even those unfamiliar with Lord Emsworth. This is a great book, and author, for those who enjoy light, comical novels."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"Pigs nearly always feature in the Blandings novels because Lord Emsworth is simply potty about his prize pig, the \\"Empress of Blandings\\". In this novel, his rivalry with his neighbour who is also in possession of a pig which he hopes will defeat the Empress in the next competition, reaches boiling point. At the centre of the novel we have a double stealing of pigs and the usual romantic entanglements. Anyway, this is simply delicious fun, a perfect tonic. Woken up by pain as I am, I find no better tonic than to tuck into a Wodehouse novel with its nonsence.Thanks Fr Schall for reintroducing me to Wodehouse - it makes me wonder why I waited 20 years to return to him."},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"Pigs can fly? Do they have wings? These questions will be answered by wit, wonder, farce, fun and typical funny Wodehouse characters - you will laugh with each page and keep wanting more.When you want more, here is a rare Wodehouse book that I have just re-found that had me laughing for days - Don't miss it either:The Gem Collector: A British Humor ClassicEnjoy!"},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"A great and entertaining read. I highly recommend it. It's one of P.G. Wodehouse's best in my opinion. Life at Blandings castleis like paradise!"},{"Title":"Pigs Have Wings","review":"P.G.Wodehouse is the most enjoyable author who ever lived. This book is just a great example of that status. His mastery of humour is unparalleled throughout history.

Pigs Have Wings was the first of his books that I read. I decided to thumb through it again and I find that I agree with other reviewers that it is one of his best. Every sentence is a smile inducing delight."},{"Title":"Byron: A Self Portrait","review":"Most everybody in the educated world, literary or not, has this curious idea that they know all about Lord Byron, who he was, what he was like in person and as poet. This strange phenomenon has arisen due in no small part to the literary establishment's creation, in Byron's time and in our own, of what is known and taught as the \\"Byronic hero\\": A gloomy, world-weary figure, an aristocrat and rou&eacute;. But to read these nearly 800 pages of letters and diaries is to get to know the man in full, as rife with contradictory impulses as any other human being - rather than some two-dimensional stock figure. I must admit that I did not know upon embarking on this volume whether I would like or appreciate the \\"real Byron,\\" so to speak. But, after figuratively putting myself in his shoes for over a week now, I feel that he is an old friend, whom I feel it impossible to dislike, warts and all. In one of his letters to publisher John Murray, Byron confides, \\"I am not sure that long life is desirable for one of my constitutional depression of Spirits, which of course I suppress in society; but which breaks out when alone, and in my writings in spite of myself.\\" There is no real way to \\"review\\" exactly this collection of writings which broke out when Byron was alone save to proffer the prospective reader some of the striking quotes which shed light on Byron at various stages of his life:\\"The reason that adulation is not displeasing is, that, though untrue, it shows one to be of consequence enough, in one way or other, to induce people to lie, to make us their friend.\\"\\"There is something to me very softening in the presence of a woman, - some strange influence, even if one is not in love with them - which I cannot at all account for, having no very high opinion of the sex. But yet, - I always feel in better humour with myself and every thing else, if there is a woman within ken.\\"\\"You are right, Gifford is right, Crabbe is right, Hobhouse is right - you are all right, and I am all wrong; but do, pray, let me have that pleasure. Cut me up root and branch; quarter me like the Quarterly; send round my disjecti membra poetae, like those of Levite's Concubine; make me, if you will, a spectacle to men and angels; but don't ask me to alter, for I can't: - I am obstinate and lazy - and there's the truth.\\"Writing of his poem \\"Don Juan\\": \\"Could any man have written it who has not lived in the world? - And fooled in a post-chaise? - In a hackney coach? - In a gondola? - Against a wall? - In a court carriage? In a vis &agrave; vis? - On a table? - And under it?\\"\\"It is singular how soon we lose the impression of what ceases to be constantly before us. A year impairs, a lustre obliterates. There is little distinct left without an effort of memory: then indeed the lights are rekindled for a moment; but who can be sure that Imagination is not the torch-bearer? Let any man try at the end of ten years to bring before him the features, or the mind, or the sayings, or the habits, of his best friend, and he will be surprised at the extreme confusion of his ideas.\\"\\"In general, I do not draw well with literary men: not that I dislike them, but I never know what to say to them after I have praised their last publication. There are several exceptions, to be sure; but then they have either been men of the world, such as Scott, and Moore, etc., or visionaries out of it, such as Shelley.\\"I could, of course, go on for quite some time but for the 1,000 word limit which Amazon imposes upon me here, but I hope that these diverse states of mind, of mood, of age, of circumstance grant the reader an idea of the richness of personality depicted in these writings. \\"But who WAS Byron, really?\\" some may ask. I'll allow him the last word on it:\\"Last year (in June, 1819), I met at Count Mosti's, at Ferrara, an Italian who asked me \\"if I knew Lord Byron?\\" I told him NO (no one knows himself, you know).\\""},{"Title":"A Hermit in the Himalayas","review":"Paul Brunton was one of the first Westerners to gain direct access to some of the remotest spiritual heritages of the world. His in-depth writings, remarkable for their insights into Eastern philosophies, gained great respect in the early part of the 20th century. Not only did Brunton speak from profound personal experience but he put into Western terminology the most esoteric concepts from the East; and he continued these writings into the later part of the century. But it was his early journals (such as this one), filled with reflections, eye-opening stories and deep understandings, which capture the essence of the young Brunton while traveling, before India started losing so much of its endearingly isolated character. Anyone with a love of the Himalayas, who is either fascinated by its spiritual possibilities or has actually been in those rugged, phenomenal mountains, should read Paul Brunton's HERMIT IN THE HIMALAYAS. The book will help you find yourself, just as all his writing do. PB, as he's known by those who read his many books, has been a major inspiration throughout my life. And he always will be."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"This book can be tough going at times -- over 600 pages of text alone, densely written, finely detailed, full of endless descriptions of how early pianos were built in the great days of Cristoferi and Silbermann. Then why read this book? Because it is, simply, fascinating. There are chapters on the role of the piano in the works of Jane Austen, the piano as an aid to courtship, on Beethoven's paean to his Broadwood, on the quest for &quot;brilliant but not difficult&quot; music, long descriptions of 19th century mechanical devices of pianistic torture -- there is a great deal of interesting esoterica here, and much to learn. The book is a classic, and I'm glad it's on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"If you love music, especially that of the piano, then you should definitely make room on your musical bookshelf for this wonderful and comprehensive book. The author, Arthur Loesser, was a well-known concert pianist who was also a gifted writer, critic and annotator--shades of that earlier duallist, Berlioz! This dandy, thick book, detailing the history of keyboards, also includes many of the personalities involved in music-making through the centuries. The hard-cover edition--originally published in 1954--is long out of print, making this trade-paper version even more welcome. Once it's yours, you'll be in possession of nearly everything you ever wanted to know about these keyboard instruments--and then some! And, once you begin reading, you'll find it difficult to put it aside, even for a moment.Each major country had its own beginnings with music and the keyboards that brought that music to life. This book is, therefore, a geographical as well as a musical tour. Beginning in about the mid-1500s and continuing to more recent times, Loesser informs us of the musical progression in Germany, Austria, England, France, and finally the US. Whether you begin with the English in the 1500s or the Germans in the 1600s or the French in the 1700s, you'll be intrigued by the variety of instruments unveiled in these pages for your delectation, as well as his humorous side trips into more human endeavors. (There's an entire chapter [Section Three, Chapter Eighteen] on the use of music in the novels of Jane Austen, for example.)Loesser skillfully utilizes his dry and frequently wry wit in detailing the history and usage of keyboard instruments, as well as those who merely were the players of them. It's quite obvious that, to Mr. Loesser, the instruments themselves were the more worthy, and he skillfully educates the reader in the evolution of today's piano, including the advantage gained by the availability of steel framing.There are many types of keyboard instruments, some more well-known than others, but none are slighted in this comprehensive retrospective. In addition, social history is also brought into prominence, as well as those artisans who have moved us with their performances.Another bravura performance from this noted musician."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"When it comes to the history of the piano, if it's not in this book, you don't need to know it. Loesser writes this &quot;biography&quot; of the piano with accuracy, detail, plenty of anecdotes, good judgment, and an abundance of humor. You'll be hooked after a few lively chapters--even if you thought you had only a passing interest the pianoforte."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"Arthur Loesser, pianist, composer and longtime faculty member at the Cleveland Institute of Music, was also a historian and writer of talent, as evidenced by this \\"social history\\" he penned in the 1950s.\\"Men, Women and Pianos\\" is many things. It is partly a history of the instrument itself: Loesser shows how the desire of musicians for a keyboard instrument more versatile and/or powerful than the existing clavichord, harpsichord and organ led makers in several countries more or less simultaneously to invent the basic action of the piano at the turn of the eighteenth century. It is partly, of course, a history of great pianists and composers and their particular regards and attitudes toward this newfangled contraption. It is partly a history of instrument makers and their innovations, from Bartolomeo Cristofori, who is widely credited with the actual invention of the \\"pianoforte,\\" to the Steinways, whose instruments still set the standard in piano-making today. Perhaps most important, however, it is a chronicle of the instrument and its relationship to everyday people and society, at times amusing, at times sobering. Along the way Loesser examines questions that may never have occurred to other historians before him, such as how ladies played four-hand music in their enormous hoop-skirts, or how much of the appeal of a third-rate salon piece of the early 1900s called \\"A Maiden's Prayer,\\" still in print, may have emanated from its title.Summarizing Loesser's work can give but a faint idea of his wide-ranging interests, or the dry humor of his writing. This is a book that appeals even to the non-musician, but which should be required reading for musicians. It ends on a downbeat note in 1954, with piano sales declining in the face of increased competition from electric gadgets such as television and the phonograph. One wonders what Loesser would think of the scene today, with digital technology enabling musical reproduction at speeds and with an ease he never could have imagined. There is a whole other book to be written about what has happened to the keyboard and home music-making since 1954, when Loesser's chronicle ends: one only hopes that whoever finally writes it has a fraction of his erudition, wit, and love of music."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"The writing is articulate beyond belief, reflecting the author's fluency in multiple languages, and the thoroughly tongue-in-cheek tone--the \\"digiterferous bank accounts\\" of the wealthy--makes it fun to read. And of course there's the story itself, beginning in the era when Democracies were replacing Monarchies, the 18th Century, and ending in the US around the First World War, when the instrument began its abrupt decline, using old newspapers, magazine articles, publishers' catalogs, etc., as sources, translated as needed by the author.We learn of the influential Germans, who nurtured the instrument's development in the beginning, took a back seat to the English and French for a while, then regained the lead in the latter half of the 19th century as they became an industrialized nation, and the origins of Classical music--that is, the performance of dead composers' works--which replaced the usual practice of concert performers playing variations of well-known grand opera tunes when that died out as Liszt and others fled for their lives during the Second French Revolution of 1848.The story ends in the US. In the later 19th Century, the piano was the focus for entertainment in the Victorian home and popular sheet music sold millions of copies--but changing culture, as much as technology, soon doomed the instrument.In all, a tale of music's role in modern Western society told effortlessly by someone who's spent a lifetime gathering the facts."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"This book is really more than a book, it's an adventure. First of all, it is rather long, so it is not a book to be casually perused. Rather, to read it will require a fairly serious amount of time and concentration. What I find most striking about it is how thorough and in-depth it is. The author clearly went through every piece of literature he could find concerning the piano in the 18th and 19th centuries-brochures, sales records, newspaper articles, concert programs, all in multiple languages- and incorporated it all into his study. The scholarly scope and erudition of the work is staggering. However, it is not annotated.As for the content of the book, we can almost say it is a Marxist analysis of the history of the piano. He mostly discusses the life of the piano and its use in society from the point of view of class differences, as well as from the point of view of means of production and organization of labor. Much of the motivation for the middle classes to own pianos was to emulate the higher classes, he says. In this sense I felt like I was reading Paul Fussell's excellent book \\"Class.\\" Both books contain a derisive attitude toward the middle classes, depicting them as motivated solely by their desire to appear more high class than they really are, and as not really having their own independent minds, but as being swept away in whatever trend has been recently marketed to them by those who can only make a profit by selling their mass-produced inventory.A final note: Keep a dictionary handy when reading this book. The author's vocabulary is enormous, and he's not afraid to use it."},{"Title":"Men, Women and Pianos: A Social History","review":"Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing.

For his comfort we did do a few of the things Mrs. Backus suggests, but we didn't think of so many others. I recommend this book to anyone who is going through the illness of a loved one, or knows someone who is. &quot;Care for the Caretaker&quot; is the best friend I wish we had known during that terrible time. The book not only offers practical advice that will really improve the quality of life for the person who is ill, but knowing how to make it better gives a lift to the caregiver, too. Also, it is romantic and funny. Jim Backus was a wonderful actor, but I suspect that his greatest gift must have been his wife.

VERY PLEASED."},{"Title":"My Husband, My Friend","review":"I just recently read this book for the first time. Its a very interesting book and I'm glad Neile wrote it. She married Steve McQueen before he was Steve McQueen movie star. Neile was actually more successful than Steve when they married. She was the breadwinner for a while after they married. No one can accuse her of marrying for money or fame. After they married, she basically became his supporter and helper to climb that ladder of success and fame. She did a great job too. Steve always trusted her judgment, even after they divorced.Neile takes us from their humble beginnings to the heights of Steve's fame. She got to enjoy Steve's success for a few years with him before it really started to go to his head and poison their relationship, along with the drugs and women.Anyone who is interested in the life of Steve McQueen and his career can't ignore this book. Neile was Steve's first wife and longest marriage (15.5 years together) and the mother of his two children. She shares so many interesting stories of their times together. She tells of a cross-country car drive she and Steve made early in their marriage. Steve wanted her to see the US. Once they arrived in New York from California, Neile told Steve she finally knew what America looked like - a blur. Steve loved speed - as in fast cars and motorcycles. Later he came to love another kind of speed.There are so many interesting stories about so many interesting people - Frank Sinatra, Yul Brenner, Robert Vaughn, James Garner, Paul Newman. Also, Natalee Wood, Lee Remick, Faye Dunaway, Jacqueline Bisset, Suzanne Pleshette, all Steve's co-stars at one time or another. And of course, Ali MacGraw, his co-star in \\"The Getaway\\" who married Steve after his divorce from Neile. She was not the reason for the divorce and Neile always liked her and still does. She didn't know his third wife, Barbara Minty, very well, but thought Barbara looked like she could be Ali's daughter.Neile covers Steve's life all the way to the end when he died of cancer at age 50. I remember when he died in 1980. I was 23 and thought he was getting on up there. Now I realize how many more years he should have had and that he died young."},{"Title":"My Husband, My Friend","review":"Neile Adams is a remarkable and beautiful woman who is as relevant today as she was as a dancer and actress in such movies as \\"The Pajama Game\\" and \\"This Could Be The Night\\". Her candid recollections of her private life with Steve McQueen is heart-rendering and courageous as it is honest. This is no sugar-coated book. Adams reveals her own short comings, as well as her suffering as a result of Steve's childhood trauma and it's life-long effects throughout adulthood with his destructive behavior. I write this as a huge fan of Steve McQueen and with the greatest of respect. The book is very well written and is frankly, hard to put down. Anyone who has suffered multiple losses will relate to Adams and hopefully be inspired that she is a survivor who continues to record as a singer to this day. A \\"must read\\"!"},{"Title":"My Husband, My Friend","review":"Steve McQueen has been gone for 30 years and the number of people that remember when he was A Famous Movie Star are naturally diminishing. However, his story is so compelling that familiarity with just one of his movies will make this book worth your time. Any bikers or car racing enthusiasts will find much to enjoy as well. My suggestions are Bullitt, On any Sunday, or The Great Escape - all of which feature impressive car or bike sequences.Steve grew up in what now seems like another age. His father abandoned the family quickly, and his mother apparently felt that she was unable to earn a living and raise Steve also. He was left with a kindly uncle, who helped him learn some measure of discipline as a child. Reunited as a teen with his mother, he drifted into minor crime, reform school, and a few years floating around the world drinking and let's say 'dating actively'- before trying to make his way as an actor in New York.Neile Adams was far more successful than Steve when they fell in love and married - in just four months. She subordinated her career to his as soon as possible, because he wouldn't have it any other way. He was willful, stubborn, hopelessly self centered yet kind and generous, a gamboling boy inside a big tough guy. He had to be the center of all attention, and Neile's attention especially.Steve was relentlessly unfaithful and a committed drug user from well before their marriage. His bad habits were fueled rather than calmed by his success. The debacles and humiliations related to women and drugs steadily escalated over the years to the point that Neile could no longer tolerate it. She remained his best friend and closest adviser until his death by all accounts. This book relates the story, from Boy meets Girl to the ugly end and back to friendship in a warm, honest and loving way. Neile managed somehow keep her exasperation from becoming bitterness, her disappointment from becoming defeat. She was the love of Steve's life, as he's stated elsewhere, and the reason why is clear in this story. I became a fan of hers during the course of the book.She is a one time author, and should be heartily commended for her organization, style and ability to tell a story, and her publisher as well for brilliantly allowing her to do so. A critical edit would have resulted in a few different terms and possibly a bit more streamlining, but it wouldn't have been the same story."},{"Title":"My Husband, My Friend","review":"I have always been a fan of Steve Mcqueen ever since I can remember. I always had a certain image of my idols and unfourtunately once you read about them and how they were as parents and partners or as a human being then it shatters that image not that I only like bad boys. I am glad I read this book because it just shows you bad is cool and to be honest its probably more interesting reading about what they did, in Steve Mcqueen's case sleeping with whomever came to him while married telling his wife that he only loves her and just F**** the others, how understanding of her to stay with him as long as she did.She writes very honestly and I enjoyed the book alot, I had heard things about this cool man but to read it first hand from his first wife and certain details it was a surprize."},{"Title":"My Husband, My Friend","review":"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYOf all the women in his life, his first wife Niele seems to have loved him the most.

Steve McQueen was a very good actor. it was great to read about his life. Shipment came fast. I am absolutely satisfied."},{"Title":"My Husband, My Friend","review":"Although Steve McQueen left the world in 1980 at the age of 50, his film legacy lives on. McQueen starred in some of the all-time classic films and his legend continues. A few years after he died, his first wife Neile wrote the story about their life together. No one knew McQueen better than Neile and despite the ups and downs, including a bitter divorce, they stayed friends until the very end.Neile's story is both exciting and heartbreaking. She was an up and coming dancer and actress when she met McQueen. With her guidance and advice, he eventually become one of the great superstars of his day. Neile gave up her career to become a housewife and mother to their two kids and two the unpredictable Steve McQueen.Neile tells her story with honesty, sadness and joy. McQueen was a womanizer yet he always came back to Neile and the kids. His increasing drug use in the late 60's only alienated him from Neile and led to the end of their marriage.McQueen was the King of Cool but had more insecurities than anyone could imagine. Mistrusting of women because of being abandoned by his mother, left him hollow inside and seemingly void of love an emotion, but Neile understood him and forgave his faults. Theirs was a love that never died though their marriage had to end.Neile has her own remarkable story of growing up in the Philippines during WWII and eventually moving to the US and becoming an up and coming starlet. There must be a feeling of \\"what if\\" and \\"what could have been\\" in the back of her mind as McQueen's career soared. Neile has a deep compassion and sympathy for McQueen's actions, sometimes bordering on the violent. She understood him and loved him. She had a special affinity for Ali MacGraw, Steve's second wife, whose promising career was destroyed by McQueen's possessiveness. MacGraw abandoned her husband, producer Robert Evans, to marry McQueen and eventually be abandoned by McQueen himself.MY HUSBAND, MY FRIEND: A MEMOIR is an engrossing read if you are a McQueen fan. Here is the real Steve McQueen, like you have never seen him. Other biographies have glorified or vilified McQueen but Neile humanizes him. He was a flawed human with a very troubled childhood. Fame and fortune and finally drugs went to his head.She was an important part of his life in his final months. McQueen was now married to a much younger third wife, Barbara Minty, but his live for Neile endured. Here is a fascinating story that will fill the heart of a McQueen fan. McQueen was a changed man in his final months, what more did he have to offer in his middle age? We'll never know but his legend continues."},{"Title":"Discourse Networks, 1800/1900","review":"This is an awesome book if you are interested in German culture history.

The beginning of the story captured my interest and encouraged me to go on. The book was not a long story and I felt that some of the characters were invisible for too long. The suspense and ingenuity of the group was entertaining and the storyline was feasible. I believe that this was her first work and I have since read three others that are more polished in the story and character development. The ending while being possible still seemed a little far fetched. However it did not end as I had expected. I enjoy reading Ms Lord's writing and she can weave a tale to entertain and thrill."},{"Title":"Fortress","review":"I first heard about this novel after re-watching the fascinating HBO movie that is based upon it. There are scenes from that film that still haunt and inspire me to this day. Sally Jones is a young first-year teacher teaching a classroom of children varying in class from first grade to early high school. On the morning of May 8th she wakes up feeling ill and longing to be away and back in the city with her friends and teaching in a better school. But on that day, something horrible happens. A group of men hidden behind cartoon character and Christmas masks kidnap Sally and all of her students. They intend to hold them for ransom and as they day draws on, some of the men intend to have some pleasure as well. Sealed in cave miles from any signs of civilization, Sally has to gather her strength to comfort the children and somehow lead them to safety.FORTRESS shares some common themes as William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. Each book takes place in the wilderness, involves children, and examines the difference between good and evil. Besides that, the books aren't all that alike. For instance, Sally is an adult and there are no adults in LORD OF THE FILES until the end. Also, Sally is a woman and there are several female students in her class. There are no girls in LORD OF THE FLIES. The novels both reach different conclusions and though there are similar themes, they raise and answer different questions about human nature.FORTRESS is a fairly fast read. I was able to read it in about two hours at one setting. It flows at a quick pace. Yet, the author doesn't skip on things like details and setting. Some of the students don't seem to be fully developed, but in a class the size of Sally's that is understandable. This is a book that I would highly recommend to middle school and high school students who like adventure-filled suspense stories. The action and short chapters makes it a great text to keep them excited about reading, especially if the book is read aloud to the entire class. Also, if you haven't seen the movie-version of FORTRESS, do so after reading the book. It can increase one's understanding of the story."},{"Title":"Fortress","review":"Sally Jones is a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Sunny Flat, a small town in New South Wales, Australia.

One day in May, her classroom is invaded by four men wearing character masks who kidnap her and her students and intend to hold them for ransom. Their plans are thrown into confusion when Sally and her students take their fate into their own hands.First published in 1980 and also Gabrielle Lord's first novel, this book reads like a true crime novel. I found myself reading ahead to make sure of what was going to happen next and prevent too much suspense from building up (I can't take it!). I enjoyed this novel a bit, but I don't know if I will be reading more by Ms. Lord as I am not a huge fan of crime novels."},{"Title":"Fortress","review":"My review of this book is that this book is so suspenseful it's not funny.

The characters were engaging if not fully developed. I found the plot improbable in terms of the motivations of the kidnappers.As the title of the review suggests, I saw some parallels with William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies in terms of the brutality of the ending and the capacity for cruelty it demonstrated. There was, however, a huge difference in the complexity of the characters and the writing style."},{"Title":"Your Psychic Pathway to Joy: A Simple Guide for Living Lightly","review":"I was taken aback initally by the lightheartedness of this book, because of the thoroughness and depth of her other books, &quot;The Psychic Pathway&quot;, &quot;True Balace&quot; and &quot;Your Heart's Desire&quot;, all of which I found illuminating. However, this is a light, stream of consciousness approach and the book models the lightness and balance that the integrated spritual seeker can achieve. The many helpful ideas range from the simple and obvious &quot;Lighten up&quot; to a small but good section on meditation.It succeeds at what it sets out to do, but some readers will need the depth and rigor of her other works. Still, I'm glad I got it!"},{"Title":"Comprehensive Biological Catalysis, Four-Volume Set: A Mechanistic Reference","review":"Few would quarrel with the assertion that the successes of modern biochemistry and molecular biology spring from the growth of our in-depth awareness of enzyme mechanism and control. The ability to design new therapeutic agents, the creation of catalytic antibodies, the development of modified organisms that contain reorganized metabolic pathways for organic synthesis and bioremediation, and the ability to trim, cut, and redesign DNA molecules---all of these advances are the product of the systematic characterization of enzyme kinetics and mechanism. In this four-volume series, the editors have brought together the latest achievements and perspectives of the acknowledged leaders in the field. This series treats enzymes by the type of organic reaction, thereby allowing the reader to integrate the wide-ranging information and data about enzymes that are related more by their catalytic mechanisms than by their position in otherwise diverse metabolic pathways. The coverage is uniformly excellent, and the lexicon in vol. IV allows one to gain familiarity with some of the conceptual underpinning and jargon of the field. The editors, Dr. Michael Sinnott, Dr. C. David Garner, Dr. Eric First, and Dr. Gideon Davies all deserve praise for providing the reader with a virtually flawless reference book. They are also undoubtedly responsible for the uniformly high quality of the diagrams, chemical structures, as well as the three-dimensional color plates of enzymes and active sites. Perhaps, the only weakness is that one must always keep vol. IV close by, because none of the other volumes contains a subject index. (For the advertised price of $899, surely the publisher could have included a comprehensive index in each of the volumes. It's not too late to offer this feature in future printings.) Few individuals can afford to purchase treatises like &quot;Comprehensive Biological Catalysis&quot;, but everyone responsible for the reading rooms in biochemistry departments, pharmacology departments, and medicinal chemistry departments should greet this four-volume series as a special opportunity to educate graduate students, post-docs, and the faculty."},{"Title":"The Montana Frontier: One Woman's West","review":"If you grew up gobbling down books about inspiring, independent women with pioneer spirit, you will enjoy reading this loving and learned biography of the author's grandmother born in 1865. Ms. Litz' research fleshes out the economic and social circumstances only slightly apparent in the books of our youth. Lillian Weston Hazen was a successful syndicated columnist in New York City in the late 1900s when she married a promising, rich Dartmouth graduate. The Depression of 1893 bankrupted them and dried up job prospects in the East. The only position her husband could find was bookkeeper for a mining company in a rough frontier town called Gilt Edge near Lewistown, Montana. Despite tremendous physical hardships and economic setbacks, they made a life for themselves and a surviving son where many were ground down and dropped out. Despite heavy ranch labor, Lillian carved out time to write and published in Scribners and some farming journals. Her lasting legacy will turn out to be the trunk of diaries and clippings that Joyce Litz found in 1949 following her death."},{"Title":"Who Shall be the Sun?: Poems Based on the Lore, Legends and Myths of North-west Coast and Plateau Indians","review":"I've loved this book for more than 20 years. Wagoner makes the myths and sensibilities of the native people of the Pacific Northwest come alive in simple powerful language.The poems stick in my head. I remember his \`\`Songs for the Bones of Salmon'' every time I put a bite of salmon into my mouth. \`\`Lost'' resonates for me whenever I step out into the forest and see the nurse logs of fallen cedar trees, and the salal and ferny undergrowth.And his \`\`Burial Poem'' has become the mandatory reading at all our family funerals. It is elegant, spare, and presents an attitude toward death that I find consistent with my family's ecological and theological values.I do admire Wagoner's later work, but this is the book above all others that I esteem."},{"Title":"How I won the war,","review":"The book is about a soldier in WWII who is taking the army too seriously. It is extremely funny and I suspect that it is more accurate description of what happened than most history books.In the 80's, when the Czech translation of this book was published, it was one of the most popular books in Czechoslovakia. 100.000 copies was printed in our small country and still it was quite difficult to buy the book. We loved it, probably because the Irish and Czech sense of humor is similar.It is really surprising that the book hasn't been recently published again in the English language. How much bigger is the market in the USA and UK than the Czech one? 400 times? And still, one of the most funny books ever written is not worth of being published again. Possible explanation is that the book is against wars and authorities which is not very convenient for some people."},{"Title":"Theodore Austin-Sparks (1889-1971): Reflections on His Life and Work","review":"\\"T. Austin-Sparks was one of the greatest spiritual figures of the twentieth century. Perhaps no one in the last one hundred years gave us ministry that is so Christ-centered. When the measure of a man's ministry is taken as to how much he exalted Christ, then T. Austin-Sparks is without peer.Sparks wrote over one hundred books. The golden chord, which ran through all these works, was the exaltation of his Lord. He has given us more spiritual insight into Christ then perhaps any other man of the last 1700 years . . ..Sparks' writing speak little of the Christ of Galilee-rather he has given us the resurrected and enthroned Lord. He has gone even farther than this, to show us the insuperable Christ who dwells within us. This presentation of his Lord would be enough to make Sparks' ministry unique, but Sparks went on to join head to body (Christ and the church). As surely as his spoken and written ministry exalted the Lord, so also Sparks called forth the almost forgotten centrality of the church. For T. Austin-Sparks, the two were inseparable. Nor did he speak of the church that most men have known and experienced.\\"Gene Edwards (Author)T. Austin-Sparks was also the spiritual father and long time respected mentor of Watchman Nee of China.Doug Riggs"},{"Title":"Theodore Austin-Sparks (1889-1971): Reflections on His Life and Work","review":"This book is useful inasmuch as it fills an important gap in Christian literature. There is very little background information available on Theodore Austin-Sparks for the younger generation - and TAS would have wanted things that way.Unfortunately, there are a number of factual inaccuracies in this book. Bizarrely the author was perfectly happy for these to remain uncorrected because he considered them of no significance, it being undesirable for readers to give attention to the human aspects of a man of God!One of the most important insights for me which came thru TAS' ministry was the corporate dimension of the Christian life. In this respect, his writings are an important antidote for the individualism so rife in the USA and UK. And there is no question in my mind that TAS sought to follow the leading of the Spirit closely and that some of his writings have a remarkably prophetic quality.At the same time, I do not believe TAS was right on everything. For example, in later life he taught a doctrine of progressive sonship, whereas the New Testament makes it clear that the people of God become sons of God by adoption. Therefore, God's people are sons from the moment of adoption and do not have to earn sonship over a period of time. You are either a son of God or you are not. This is just one example. However, this author makes no attempt to discuss TAS' teaching from a Biblical standpoint or to view any of the problematic elements of this ministry.TAS was not infallible. And if a hearer is aware of defects in a minister, the insights which are granted to that person from the Lord to pass on to His people are all the more remarkable and shine out all the brighter for it. So there is no need to be shy of reality: God's treasure is found in earthen vessels.It is strange that TAS' ministry is much more appreciated in the USA than in the UK where he was based for so long. My hope is that future generations will be greatly blessed thru his output, but also not blind to the inherent flaws.[Just a comment about another review: it is not correct to describe TAS as Nee's 'spiritual father'. And neither TAS nor Nee would have been happy with such a concept. It is true that TAS took Nee under his wing after Nee had been rejected by the Exclusive Brethren with whom he had been associated before that time. But the influence of TAS upon Nee and Nee upon TAS was mutual and I am so glad that they kept in touch as much as possible for the remainder of Nee's life.]More recently I have discovered another, much better book about TAS and his ministry by Rex G. Beck called 'Shaped by Vision: A biography of Theodore Austin-Sparks 1888-1971' (Cleveland Heights, OH: Greater Purpose Publishers, 2005). It is a much fuller and more accurate work of 373 pages. It is also much more than a biography, giving a helpful overview of TAS' emphases and also reviewing some of his key works. Naturally it is more expensive, but if you want to buy just one book on TAS outside of TAS' own writings, I would recommend Beck's rather than Gunn's work."},{"Title":"The New Investment Superstars: 13 Great Investors and Their Strategies for Superior Returns","review":"Very poorly written.

They are in her book because of their stellar records, despite the low profile many share (due to strict marketing regs for these investment pools). For readers who want a peek behind the hedge fund curtain, this book is ideal. It captures the personalities and backgrounds of the managers, and it benefits from Peltz's analysis of commonalties and future thoughts on the industry. If you are investment professional looking to add a couple of nuggets to your repertoire, you might feel slightly let down (hence 4, not 5, stars). The eye opening aspect for me was the annual returns revealed for each of the managers. This information is not widely available, and the magnitude and consistency of the annual returns was amazing for several of the managers.

It will tell you in which areas a fund is active, but give you excactly zero detail about the strategies and tactics used by its managers. Even some rather bad books I have read at least contained one or two ideas that were worth investigating, but I couldn't gain anything at all from this book. Also, some of the track records really aren't that impressive. Not really bad, but definitely not what you'd expect from &quot;Superstars&quot;."},{"Title":"The New Investment Superstars: 13 Great Investors and Their Strategies for Superior Returns","review":"Contains useful background information and insights on managers, and the industry though it is of limited use regarding the strategies those managers use. Two really glaring errors (page 48 & 49 on incentive fees, and Page 65 on correlations - perhaps a misquote or a quote out of context) cast doubt on the reliability of other statements in the book for me. Consequently I recommend reading it, but with more than the usual level of skepticism."},{"Title":"The New Investment Superstars: 13 Great Investors and Their Strategies for Superior Returns","review":"If you are familiar with Infovest21, a hedge fund news service that's really just a lot of fluff articles about old friends of Peltz, then you are familiar with Lois Peltz's writing style. Basically, she talks a lot about personalities, very little about the news and almost nothing practical concerning strategies or markets. Her writing style is boring and usually outsourced to employees and there's nothing in it that you can't find in a thousand other news services.This book might have some of the same \\"virtues\\" were it not also hopelessly out of date. Most of these \\"superstars\\" are out of the investment business and a couple of them are in jail for ponzi schemes. THat might provide a little ironic shaudenfreud but it really doesn't.

Just buy something intelligent instead."},{"Title":"The New Investment Superstars: 13 Great Investors and Their Strategies for Superior Returns","review":"It is rare to be able to read one book on a complex topic and have it contain information of use to both the novice and the veteran. Lois Peltz has done it in regard to hedge funds...the most erudite of investment arenas. Whether it be basic information (definitions, tables showing manager spin-offs, industry disasters) or advanced (the irony of having the objective of superior performance over the long-term being measured in 90 day intervals), this easily readable and fascinating treatise delivers. From her overview of superstar managers (including the counter-intuitive observation that they're not in it for the money but rather because they love the challenge) to the side-bars concluding each that allow the reader to compare highlights, the profiles are enlightening. Specific insights on managers (Bruce Kovner's analogy of managing money to painting, Paul Singer's analysis of model and herding risk, to Raj Rajaratnam's requirement that analysts performing due diligence fax in a daily &quot;What I've learned&quot; or risk not being reimbursed for their expenses) provide enormous understanding of each manager. Finally, her own perspective, including highlighting the issue of manager capacity, offers unusual help in selecting/understanding managers. A must-read!"},{"Title":"The New Investment Superstars: 13 Great Investors and Their Strategies for Superior Returns","review":"Lois Peltz has stolen the keys to Wall Street's inner sanctum and is waving you over to take a peek inside. Her insights on the hedge fund money machine - how it works, who runs it and how - should enthrall insiders and outsiders alike. She begins with the grand old gentlemen of the game, the likes of Julian H. Robertson Jr., Michael Steinhardt and George Soros, and tells how Soros speculated his way to a $2 billion profit - in one day! She shows how the game is played, and gives an insider's perspective on the methods of the new superstar managers. The in-depth profiles include: Lee Ainslie, Leon Cooperman, Ken Griffin, John Henry, Mark Kingdon, Bruce Kovner, Daniel Och, Raj Rajartnam, Paul Singer and Brian Stark. These managers will build the vast fortunes of the future - while also amassing their own.

However, the parameters a,b given in Figure 13.71 (and those found by the search algorithm) are correct for a bandwidth value of 10Hz.

I have always searched for a book that could provide me with ideas on strengthening my preparation and execution of my performance. This book is a fantastic resource, and I am impressed by the originality and viability of the ideas. Basically, Power Performance assimilates performance to the training of an olympic athlete, something which I believe is true. Even though the book is written specifically for singers, I find it invaluable for anyone who is remotely involved in performaing, or for anyone with a desire of boosting his/her performance skills."},{"Title":"Power Performance for Singers: Transcending the Barriers","review":"This is a book with very down-to-earth advice. What amazed me most was that the most things I had always felt about performance, but didn't know how to put in words, are voiced accurately, objectively, concisely and fulfillingly in this book. Also, many things I had never stopped to think about are also dealt with nicely. You will learn how to make the most of performance problems, their sources and consequences in order to help you perform well. There is great joy awaiting you in this book.

This book is the centerpiece of a long list of reading material I've culled ideas from over the years. NOT FOR SINGERS ONLY! All musicians can benefit from this book!

If you work carefully through the charts and teaching points you will be rewarded with performances you enjoy giving and ones that audiences will enjoy hearing!

The book is giving me very helpfull practical tips about selfconfidence on stage etc. The only thing is, that the English which is being used, is not so easy to read as in most American literature (I'm from Holland).

Whether you are an opera singer, a rock & roller, an actor, an instrumentalist, a public speaker, etc., you can benefit from practicing \\"power performance\\". It doesn't come easily. There is a lot of ground-work that you must do to fully benefit, but you will find practical tools to use along your journey, even before completing the book. In my opinion, it's a much more thorough discovery process than found in \\"The Inner Game of Music\\", though along the same lines. Definitely worth the investment."},{"Title":"Power Performance for Singers: Transcending the Barriers","review":"Emmons and Thomas convert the &quot;Tennis Technique&quot; to a singer's manual for mental stamina. My favorite aspect of this book is the charts. There are charts to help you schedule, program, and maintain mental, physical, and emotional stamina throughout your practicing, preparation, and performance. The book contains many appendices that contain helpful reminders, charts, and tips for singers who teach and those who just perform. Using minimum to no scientific language, Emmons and Thomas communicate the importance of having a power performance by aiding the singer/teacher in &quot;starting from scratch&quot; to build up to the utmost potential of performance. Using techniques and advice from Olympians and teachers of singing, the witty language and motivating advice can help lead anyone to success."},{"Title":"Power Performance for Singers: Transcending the Barriers","review":"I have sung for most of my life, but I always had trouble with stage fright.

I read through this whole book, and I am going to incorporate the principles into my preparation. It is all a head game, I am understanding. The author gets you to examine your thought patterns and self talk. Also, the book has you list the things you do well so you have those in your arsenal for performing. It is going to take time, but if I'm consistent, the results will pay off.The book is written from the perspective of classical or opera singers and theatre performers, so there is some lingo you might not recognize if you are not from that genre.

I thought the characters - who had an unlimited supply of money - I wish I did - were flat, one dimensional, and never really came alive. The author did attempt to portray two men who really loved each other, I just wish he had been more successful in reaching his goal."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"I really liked the author's first book, Daytime Drama, and was hoping for an even better read this time. However, Benbow seemed to have lifted the plot from his first book, changed the characters' names and gave it a new title. Readers looking for a great read dealing with soap operas and Hollywood should try Glamourpuss and Sex Toys of the Gods by Christian McLaughlin."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"Although this book had its moments, I was perplexed by the seeming lack of proofreading or editing. The characters, with the exception of the wife and father in law, were one dimensional. The plot was riddled with historical inaccuracies and the text was rife with misspelled words. It is sad to see what passes for gay literature these days. Save your money. This is one piece of pulpy fiction without much in the way of redeeming value. The sex scenes are not even gratifying. If Mr. Benbow can pass this off as a novel and make a living in the process, there is hope for hack writers everywhere."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"A beautifully written and absolutely fun book to read over a weekend. The characters are likable and the sex is steamy. The pace is fast enough that you are never bored with the events unfolding throughout the story. I will admit that until this story, I had never read any book in the gay genre. I bought the book solely on the cover with only a quick scan of the blurb. Imagine my surprise to find that instead of male and female leads, there are instead two very intriguing men. To me, love is love regardless of gender, so I continued to read and was immediately drawn into the universe painted out in prose. The point of reading is to be entertained and I certainly was. I did not put it down until I reached the last page. Since I bought it years ago, I have repeatedly gone back to this story as a personal favorite in this genre.

He has stores all over America and is rich--but unhappy. He's gay but can't be open about it and has a real witch of a wife who uses him for his money and fame.

Their affair starts and intensifies...but wife finds out about it and threatens him to stop seeing Blake. Also her father is a powerful member of the board who hates gays and will stop at nothing to stop the affair. Will Blake and Cameron's love pull them through all this?Author Dave Benbow's first book (\\"Daytime Drama\\") was quick, fast, funny and thoroughly enjoyable gay novel. This is even better! The characters are interesting, the situations realistic (to a degree), it moves VERY quickly and has plenty of hot guy on guy sex! Basically I never wanted to put this down--it was so much fun to read! It's not perfect however--there's one ending too many and things get REAL brutral towards the end--but I still loved it and heartuly recommend it. Also some of the characters from \\"Daytime Drama\\" pop up here too (which just adds to the fun). Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"This is a fun, fast-paced love story of Cameron and Blake. They fall in love quick and hard and must make adjustments to with each other. Cameron is married to a wealthy socialite Suzette. But their's a marriage of convenience. Both are unhappy but keep up the pretense until Blake rocks Cameron's world. So much so that Cameron is ready to accept Blake at any cost.Nothing is predictable about this story, meaning nothing is obvious. You expect the standard reaction and the author does an 180. It was good to see that the focus or angst of this story is not \\"bashing\\" (with the exception of Suzette's father. But even his motives are clouded by the loss he's experienced), but good ole fashion revenge and jealousy. Cameron and Blake commit to each other and ride out the turmoil unleashed by their love.The ending rings true to the lovers as well. Very good story."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"Cameron \\"Cam\\" Fuller, strikingly handsome, high profile designer and C.E.O. for Cameron Fuller USA, a fashion dynasty on a par with Ralph Lauren, and Blake Jackson, an equally gorgeous hunk, and member of the artistic design team at Cam's Beverly Hills mega-store are the heroes of Dave Benbow's delicious new novel, MALE MODEL. Cam literally sees Blake in a window (of the mega-store) and has to have him. They meet, and the attraction is mutual and immediate. Unfortunately, there are two, not-so-little, problems to overcome; Suzette, a high maintainance shrew who just happens to be Cam's wife of twenty five years, and her devious, blue-blood father, Silas Cabbott, to whom Cam is financially indebted.Blake and Cam attempt to keep their relationship discreet. They are, after all, established, successful, career oriented men, not a couple of twenty-something bar twinks, but when Cam chooses Blake to be the spokes-model for \`PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY,' his company's new men's fragrance, it doesn't take long for their secret to be discovered, and all hell breaks loose.As he did with his previous effort DAYTIME DRAMA, Benbow, serves up an incredibly tasty dish of a novel full of clever twists, exotic locals, and passionate romance. This is the realm of super-wealth and haute couture, where the beautiful people, and those who prey upon them, flock. Here, an opportunistic underling backstabbing his way to job security seems the norm, and blackmail is just another business option. Trust-worthy friends are few and far between and everyone has a hidden agenda, some more deadly than others. How can true love possibly survive in this glamorous but cutthroat environment?John Q (Queer) Public enjoys reading about this fast-lane, designer-living world, especially when the author knows what he's talking about. Benbow's expertise in high-end, fashion retail serves him extremely well in this novel. He delivers professionally developed, charismatic characters involved in a well thought out, beautifully detailed plot. The result is pure enjoyment from cover to cover.I read fiction to be entertained, and that's the bottom line. This tale of Cameron's and Blake's budding relationship, and the treachery that surrounds it, certainly satisfied that bottom line. MALE MODEL made me want to grin like the Cheshire cat when all went well for the heroes, and scream like a banshee when the dastardly villains screwed with their lives. This novel, made me want to laugh, it made me want to cry, but most of all it made me want to run squeeze my partner, and tell him how much I love him, and it's been way too long since a novel has had that effect on me. I wish every book I read left me feeling this way...so does my partner!"},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"Face it, some guys will buy this book for the hot cover. But what's going on under the sheets--uh, I mean, between the covers of the book--is a fun, juicy romp. It's the story of Blake Jackson, who becomes a male model at the behest of Cameron Fuller, a Ralph Lauren-type. Cameron has more on his mind than advancing Blake's career. He wants to jump into his pants. Their torrid love affair is complicated by the fact that Cameron is in the closet and is married to money. His father-in-law's money, in fact, helped get him where he is.As things progress, they get more complicated, and the reader wonders what decisions Blake will make. Life as a male model is not all easy-breezy and easy money, as you'll find here. Blake has something to help him get by, though: the sex scenes crackle with white-hot electricity.

It's fast reading and 100% involving.It's light and easy and first-rate with believable characters who wear the perfect clothes, drive the best cars and live in beautifully designed homes. No, it isn't Tolstoy or Dickens, but when I picked it up, I didn't want to read Tolstoy or Dickens.I'm sure that a Hollywood producer has already bought the rights to make it into a movie. It would make a great mystery movie-of-the-week: one that would keep you guessing (and smiling) throughout."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"I just finished reading MALE MODEL, and I don't know what book the reviewer 'Read A Lot' read, but I thought MALE MODEL was awesome! I had read Benbow's first book, DAYTIME DRAMA, and loved it. I hoped that MALE MODEL would be as much fun. It was even better than I had hoped for. I don't know much about high fashion retail or modeling, but the with descriptive way Benbow writes, he makes it all really easy to 'get.' The sex scenes were really, really hot and I loved that the main characters had a real relationship, with the ups and downs everyone goes through. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun read with a bit of soap opera; tons of steamy, erotic sex; and a good dose of mystery. You won't be disappointed. I can't wait for Benbow's next one!"},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"I must confess, I swiped MALE MODEL from a friends night stand at their beach house.If you like the escapist fun in the flavor of a gay Jackie Collins, then you will love MALE MODEL.

I know I didn't."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"So this is fluff! So this is guilty pleasures ! But Male Model is the type of book which puts a smile on your face. I wish there is more of this type of gay romantic books out there today. Life is already depressing enough without writers wearing us out with the tragedy of gay love. You may call me unrealistic but I wish to enjoy my book, not be depressed by it. Male Model suits me fine. It is better than Daytime Drama, Benbow's previous effort. Not in terms of plot. Just that Daytime Drama concentrates too much on the side characters when I wish to read more about Travis and Clay. I am glad Male Model gives more space to Cameron and Blake, our new beautiful heroes, and their breathless romance. Great entertainment and for those of us, sentimental fools who wish for happy endings."},{"Title":"Male Model","review":"I found the book to be very entertaining, very amusing and sexy, but also very formulaic (is that even a word?) Everytime the two main characters (who, we are constantly reminded, are the two best looking men in the world!) have sex, well it's not just sex, but MIND-BLOWING sex! As in the best sex EVER! No two people have EVER had sex as good or hot as these guys do! You get the picture. Also, the good guys are attractive, sexy, and in great shape while the villains are old, ugly, fat or too thin, or just plain unattractive. Still, I enjoyed the book for what it was, and appreciated the author's homage to Dominick Dunne... there is a certain similarity in their writing style but I mean no disrespect to Mr. Benbow when I say he has a ways to go before he can match Dunne.

In this book, he artfully and intelligently weaves Native American, Jungian, and Freudian concepts and wisdom with touches of mysticism and philosophy. I found his insights into the dreamtime to be profound and extremely helpful...\\"we have lost the ability to communicate with the Sacred because our egos have become so full of themselves.\\" He goes on to say that through our dreams the Creator has found a way to get around our egos and talk to us. I was particularly struck by his thoughts on the meaning of suffering and the healing of the soul, not only of our patients, but of ourselves."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"This new book by Dr. Duran includes case studies of his integrating shamanic healing techniques with traditional Western therapies. Dr. Duran's writing is intelligent, brilliant, and groundbreaking in scope and content. Though the clients he works with are Native Americans, his method is a challenge for each of us to find our mythic structures and to use them to mature the flat world view of Western materialism. Again and again his clients are struck by how familiar their work is with Dr. Duran. They literally reclaim a conscious relationship to their souls and to their mental and spiritual health. This book is a further development of his first book which was a theoretical consideration of postmodern neocolonial therapeutic models. This book actually introduces healing practices which demonstrate explicitly his theoretical viewpoint. If you read Dr. Duran's second book, \\"Buddha in Redface\\", this is what happened to the therapist in that book when he \\"grew up\\". It is a book of hope, elegance, humor, and finally of meaning."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"This is a great example of the kinds of books that will actually assist in the quest for cultural competence. It is written in clear and concise language and the cultural interventions appear to be appropriate to the circumstances."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"I have to say this book is fabulous, despite the odd minor criticism. I actually brought a few things on the subject of cultural clarity to the attention of the author who was welcoming of feedback and whom showed interest in reading some of my own culture's perspective on these issues. On the whole this book does much positively in the way of challenging the status quo perspective on personal wellbeing and mental health issues in our society today. We have at large one of the most serious crises affecting our world today - that of soul loss and spiritual/cultural disenfranchisement on an epidemic scale, which is at the root, the underlying cause, of all the wars and conflicts of countless varieties on the face of the earth.Eduardo's book teaches readers much concerning the need for the psychotherapeutic/psychiatric branch of the Western medical profession to become more open to deferring expertise or knowhow to worldviews which have for decades, if not centuries, been ignored and downplayed as \\"irrational and/or unrealistic\\" in being able to offer genuine solutions to many problems in society at large today. Native cultures right across the globe have been blessed with much insight from the Creator, for at one time, all populations shared a common experience. It is a fact that now as in the more recent history, even back to the more recent ancient history that feudal hegemony in the West has had a magnitudinous effect on severing the tie between the West and the knowledge of how social structure critically influences how people within society engage with each other and the wider creation. This is not to say that Western society knows nothing about how to do this in harmony with all creation - in fact - there is much within Western philosophical ethics which does honour life and respect the rights of all in the creation to live a life of positively meaningful fulfillment. It's more that within the West's institutional structures, the main means of becoming informed lie with 'experts' who like to maintain a monopolistic position on their knowledge roles and in order to sustain this monopoly, they push the premise often that no other worldview except that which is in accordance with scientific empiricism, has any if much at all, efficacy or \\"medically proven\\" basis for being effective in problem-solving areas. This is why it is a turn for the better to see that Eduardo is doing some way-paving for the mainstream in his field and equally important is his dedication to the welfare of his own people.I have replied to the 1-star reviewer whose review was absolutely pathetic, needfuly reminding them that the author is part of the Native community and has trained in the traditional practices also! And good on those people who seriously \\"wannabe\\" more atuned to traditional ways in conjunction with the mainstream scholastic views! Eduardo Duran does well in this book to advocate for a more open-minded awareness within mainstream Western psychotherapy/psychiatry of traditional worldviews. Too often the profession sorely overlooks other paradigms or relegates them to a vague last resort should all 'medical expertise' fail, much to the detriment of many patients when these patients could have been attended to sooner and with much more success. It shouldn't be only the 'lucky few' that have access to healthier alternatives. What about all those still imprisoned within the confines of ignorant diagnostic yard-sticks? This is what he is talking about when he says cultural competency is a must for the long-standing closed-minded professions within the Western medical paradigm - this is the only way they can break through the obstinacies of theoretical dogmatism.Although this book is recommended for those involved in counselling or theraputic professions, it is really a great book for anyone interested in exploring culturally inclusive ways and means of resolving life's more perplexing challenges, for Natives and non-Natives alike. Patients and others seeking help can also benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"Duran books spark diverse feelings. I found this and his prior work superb and profound, as have years of graduate students working in the field. Its still the best book of its kind for helping those with multigenerational trauma, both with Native Americans and other victimized populations. Yet one of the reviewers above, a woman using the innovative title \\"Anonymous\\" was clearly upset by both this book and Duran's Buddha in Redface earlier contribution. A quick look at her reviews sees her self-identify as \\"of Cherokee lineage\\" but in another as a \\"non-native person like myself\\"; she reads Lara Croft books even though \\"this book sucked\\" was the verdict for one of them; she loved the movie Hidalgo and hates her coffee pot. She says she headed a behavioral health unit with Native American clients. This rare allergic reaction to Eduardo Duran's continuing contributions is notble in that it truly does symbolize the many less than competent care managers and providers who for so long misunderstood and mistreated their diverse clients; who may lack the wisdom to know what they don't know. This confusion as to identity and capacity may be threatened by the clarity and substance of Eduardo Duran's books. They may see themselves and their shortcomings in these pages and, as Hans Toch says, if the shoe fits it will hurt."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"The wisdom of the ancestors is something we lost in our society. The writer puts problems in a historic / intergenerational context. The Bible mentions this intergenerational context in a different way. Combining these approaches provides access to solutions or healing, whereby healing in the book is about harmony and balance. Looking at illnesses in this way provides new space and ways to help to cope with them, in stead of taking pills to \\"cure\\" as the only way.The book is worth reading for health professionals, people who practise family constellations, and even for organization advisors, who want to create sound organizations and sound relationships at work.A daring thought is the following: the present financial crisis is caused by some way of thinking/acting that is connected to the past, to the history of the present major decisionmakers. As the crisis can not be solved with the same consciousness that caused the crisis, it is worth trying to work with the spiritual elements described in this book, worth trying to go deep into the intergenerational context of the crisis. It takes courage to do so, I believe it is worth the effort. Our children would be delighted."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"This book was referred to me and I have passed it onto my professors. It is a must read if you want to understand the Native American culture, healing, and counseling the Native American population."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"A phenomenally practical guide to healing American Indians - and anyone who wants to explore this approach. Worth more than the price. This book will challenge the non-Native counselor to explore thier own belief systems and come to appreciate the historical approach to treating Native clients."},{"Title":"Healing the Soul Wound: Counseling With American Indians And Other Native Peoples (Multicultural Foundations of Psychology and Counseling)","review":"Duran's first book, NA Postcolonial Psychology was a ground breaker. This most recent book offends on many levels. The idea that all native people must return to traditional ways in order to heal makes the assumption that they don't have within them or around them what they need in order to do so without some hierarchical psuedo-shamanist wannabe medicine man with a degree in clinical psychology spoon feeding them. Then, to make matters worse, traditional medicines are taught to be used by 20 years worth of psychology interns without benefit of having walked that path. Leads to multiple generations of psychologists culturally misappropriating traditional ways under the guise of \\"helping cure\\" Native people. And what's this bunk about medicine people being the ones to use drugs and alcohol because they have the \\"power\\" to do so? Not sure that has anything to do with traditional native american worldview, but may have something to do with some seriously unhealthy practices. Different native people have different practices and understanding of medicine. Making blanket pan-Indian generalizations that smack of new age ideas isn't healing. There's a certain feel of cultural voyeurism that is promoted in this book and it is not recommended. I was a Director of a behavioral health clinic within the urban American Indian population, and am a psychologist. There are many ways to promote healing in communities and among people, and many ways to train cross-culturally, and this is not a book, philosophy or trend I would recommend."},{"Title":"Ardennes 1944 Peiper & Skorzeny (Elite)","review":"This book is great for wargamers and others interested in two of the key German forces in WW II's Battle of the Bulge. Kampfgruppe Peiper is shown with great detail as to what types and quantities of tanks and troops were at specific places at specific times. The battles at Stoumont and La Gleize are well documented and the writing style will put you in the heat of battle. You will want to supplement this fine book with another Osprey title, The Ardennes Offensive,VI Panzer Armee."},{"Title":"Ardennes 1944 Peiper & Skorzeny (Elite)","review":"To me his is one of the best Osprey books I have seen the color plates alone are almost worth the price of the book. You get 16 armored vehicles, 4 of the vehicles are German armor disguised as American Armor. The German armor yellow seems too light in the plates but other than that they are very well rendered. You also get 9 very well done German soldiers by Ron Volstad. There is also a nice selection of photos for such a short book (64 pages)."},{"Title":"Ardennes 1944 Peiper & Skorzeny (Elite)","review":"When I was ten and began building models of tanks from WW2, I wished I could afford an Osprey book based on the vehicle or the battles it fought. The illustrated publisher's quick histories, full-color artwork plates, maps and photographs are unique and entertaining. They, more often than not, provide a great entry point to a particular piece of history (though sometimes the authors have more passion than expertise).This particular work unveiled an aspect of the Battle of the Bulge that I was not entirely clear on. Hitler commissioned SS Commando Otto Skorzeny to create a special unit to disrupt and gain key points behind Allied lines. What made this unique is that they would pass themselves off as Americans wearing US uniforms and using US weapons and vehicles. What I did not know was that this largely failed and the unit was reconstituted into the overall attacking force which then supported Joachim Peiper's Kampfgruppe. I actually confused the massacre at Malmedy thinking that disguised Germans had carried it off but it was actually forward elements of the regular German force.The work is interesting as it covers the attempt to hobble together English-speaking combatants from the German ranks while scrounging up captured equipment, how they reshaped the hulls of Panther tanks to resemble M10 tank destroyers, used specific markings so they were not engaged by their own troops, and it debates the cause of the Malmedy massacre. The author also disputes the now famous photography of Peiper supposedly checking his progress against a road sign as not being him (I have seen it referenced in so many works as him that this is very curious). Overall, there is decent detail and great photos.I do worry about Osprey's format overall. They are pricey publications for their length and they need to rethink their offer in this digital world or may lose relevance."},{"Title":"Ardennes 1944 Peiper & Skorzeny (Elite)","review":"A good abridged account of Peiper and Skorzeny during the Battle of the Bulge. If you want more detail, you need to look elsewhere. However, this is a fantastic reference if you're a modeler and will definitely be the book you want to get for references, particularly visual. Beautiful renderings of uniforms by Volstadt - some of the other artist renderings are a bit corny, but the Volstadt renderings alone are worth the purchase price."},{"Title":"The life and treason of Benedict Arnold","review":"I must disagree with the previous reviewers rating of this book. It is indeed biased (as all history books are) and is agood example of the mythmaking of the early republican New Englanders. That is exactly what makes it a valuable text. I would recommend reading it for this reason and would not hesitate to assign it to my students or read it for fun."},{"Title":"The life and treason of Benedict Arnold","review":"Jared Sparks, long dead, was a big gun at Harvard in the early 19th Century. His biographies are prime examples of the bowdlerization of history, cleaned up and skewed to fit the popular prejudices of their time. In particular, Sparks demonized Arnold, epitomizing Shakespeare's line, \\"The evil that men do lives on after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\\" This book is useful only as an example of the kind of biased history that it took to manufacture a national patriotic mythology for an infant nation nearly two centuries ago."},{"Title":"GERMAN RULE IN RUSSIA 1941-1945 A STUDY OF OCCUPATION POLICIES SECOND EDITION","review":"Despite some omissions, Dallin's work remains a classic. There are countless tidbits of little-known information in this encyclopedic volume. For instance, ironic to the argument about the special-ness of the Jews being forced to wear the Star, there once were plans, later dropped as impractical, to force the Slavs to wear discrimination badges. (pp. 445-446). Himmler had considered a policy which would have led to the deaths of 30 million Slavs. (p. 29). Nazi anti-Christianity has been under-appreciated (pp. 472-473), though Hitler was too sophisticated to attempt a Communist-style liquidation of the church. (p. 473).Dallin comments: \\"Within the Nazi movement itself, anti-Communism had not always been as axiomatic as might be assumed. Communists and Nazis, the two extreme parties, had repeatedly joined hands to combat the Weimar Republic.\\" (p. 10). The amount of spoils that the Nazis removed from the Soviet Union was comparable to the amount they would have received had the Nazi-Soviet alliance continued, attesting to the magnitude of Soviet aid to its onetime Nazi ally. (p. 678).Ukrainian-Nazi collaboration began long before WWII, and included activities on behalf of the Abwehr. (pp. 114-116). All the while, the Nazis never seriously entertained any form of Ukrainian self-government above that of the county level (p. 144), let alone a Nazi puppet state. To the Nazis, Slavic lands, including the Ukraine, were, beginning with MEIN KAMPF (p. 3), nothing more than objects of exploitation and settling with Germans. (p. 155, 165, 276-279).The Nazis anticipated Ukrainian genocidal actions, against Jews and Poles, even back in 1939 while planning the conquest of Poland. Dallin comments: \\"In this case, Canaris noted in his diary, \`I would have to make appropriate preparations with the Ukrainians so that, should this alternative become real, the Meln'nyk organization (OUN) can produce an uprising which would aim at the annihilation of the Jews and Poles.'\\" (p. 115). Later, citing an Einsatzgruppen report, Dallin writes: \\"On July 10 [1941] the OUN/M and other nationalist groups pledged Hitler their \`most loyal obedience' in building a Europe \`free of Jews, Bolsheviks, and plutocrats.'\\" (p. 121). (This refutes the silly arguments about the OUN itself not being anti-Semitic or anti-western). However, Dallin omits the Ukrainian-Nazi collaboration in the destruction of Jews and, while discussing the OUN-UPA, which was armed by the Germans (pp. 621-622), he neglects to mention its genocide of Poles. This is not surprising, as he is over-reliant on OUN sources."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I'm continuing my rereading spree of the In Death series, and since I didn't review this the first time around, I'm doing it now. This was a great addition to the series. The relationship between Eve and Roarke just gets better and better, even with the growing pains they experience in this book (relationship squabbles, a near-death experience for Eve, and some pretty intense scenes where Roarke is put in the middle of Eve's and Summerset's dislike for each other). Well worth the time spent revisiting our main characters and meeting new ones (McNab). I missed Feeney and Mavis this time around - didn't see as much of them. Still, a great read!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Lt. Eve Dallas is personally contacted by a murderer. He gives her riddles on how to find the person he just killed, like he's playing a game. Eventually strikes again, leaving statues of the Virgin Mary at every death scene. The people who are dying are connected to Eve's Husband, Roarke, and the main suspect is Summerset, Roarke's long time friend and butler. While Eve doesn't get along with Summerset, she knows he's incapable of murder, and tries her best to prove his innocence while searching for the true murderer. In most books the reader is able to pinpoint the murderer around half-way through, but this one keeps it a secret for the majority of the book. In this book the reader learns more about Roarke and his past, as well as the loyalty of Eve's friends and colleagues. Another great installment!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I haven't read this series in order (read #1 & #2 and then skipped around) and this book seems to fall somewhere midway through the series. Despite that I'm wasn't too terribly confused. Eve Dallas is a police officer somewhere in the future where things aren't all that different from today. She is beautiful but very haunted, still somewhat emotionally stunted and married to a hunky rich guy named Rourke. In this story she is investigating a case where a family man has been horribly dismembered and the killer seems to be playing a game and leaving Eve clues. After digging around a little Eve realizes the victim has ties to her husband (who has a shady past). More people, all tied to Rourke, are murdered, secrets are revealed, McNab makes his first appearance and we learn more about Rourke's past. A solid entry in this reliable series."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I really liked the plot, even if it was a bit easy to figure the development. In this book I got annoyed with Eve. She seemed very narrow minded, more than usual. I think I'm getting a bit tired of all her stubbornness, it's like everything always revolves around her. In her fights with Roarke, especially the first, I think she crossed the line repeatedly. That man is a saint.I loved the Irish part of the story and especially it was great to learn about Roarke's past and see the humanity of him. I hope that the author in the following books will show a touch of humanity in Eve's too, because I think that to reduce her to her troubled past means doing a disservice to the character and to the story."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I love this series, but this was the very best one so far.

My solution has been to go back to the beginning, and to read ALL the books in order. This is #6, and the best one I have read so far. It has everything. There is a really creepy villain, lots of twists and thrills, and some fascinating back story about both Roarke and Summerset. I'm even getting used to the obligatory sex scenes, although I could do with fewer of them.

Although it is possible to read any one of the titles in this series independently, the reader will miss out on both individual character develpment as well as the development of the relationships amongst the key players.Eve's black and white view of right & wrong; justice & injustice are challenged by this case. Someone is trying to frame Eve's least favorite person, Sommerset for a series of murders of old Ireland connections. How Roarke and Sommerset are connected to these people and how Eve reacts to these relationships mark the first true challenge of the impact or Roarke's former life on his marriage.The management of relationships are a key theme in this title. Robb deepens the relationship between Nadine and Eve as they both learn that \\" a softened heart can not hold anger\\".

I enjoy the series greatly, even though there are remnants of the days when the author was primarily a writer of romantic novels (the heroine's husband is impossibly rich and handsome, and the sexual encounters between them are always overwhelmingly passionate), and some of the dialogue between the heroine and her husband is too predictable. But generally the dialogue, especially with the supporting characters, is realistic and fun, and all the main and supporting characters have depth and very distinct personalities. I'd enjoy spending an evening or working with these people, not just the heroine and her husband, but also her friends and co-workers, and so I enjoy reading about them. The crimes are sometimes pretty gruesome, often with a sexual aspect, and the killers generally psychopaths - these are NOT cozy mysteries. The horrific childhood of the heroine is a major element in the books. Mostly, the plots have been pretty good, not too repetitive or predictable, though I read this series for the characters and not the plots.

It seems that it only takes a few episodes to deal with realistic scenarios, and we are left with ridiculous dust-ups involving the series regulars. I know that Nora Roberts is very popular, but there is not much here except for the story. The characters would seem one-dimensional in a comic book. In a work of fiction, they are triter than trite. The plot is certainly fast-moving, but it is truly hard to believe that there are people out there who will not figure out whodunit pretty early. If you are already a fan of the series, then by all means add this notch to your gunstock, but if you are new to it, try one of the earlier works first."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I'm a huge fan of Eve and Roarke's, but I couldn't get past the fact that Roarke commited the same hideous crimes as the villians in the story.

In a futuristic setting!! Could I ask for anything more? In each book, I look forward to the fabulous &quot;gadgets&quot; of the year 2058: the Autochef, the voice-controlled shower, etc. I adore Eve. I adore Roarke. I adore them together. But this book seemed to show them in even more depth. Without giving too much away, my favourite scenes were THE FIGHT, where (for once) Roarke stands up for himself and doesn't let (Darling) Eve bully him. The scene was heartwrenching, funny (&quot;neurotic snits&quot;) and sexy. The explosion scene was gripping, the raspberries on the bed scene was howlingly funny and the car speed chase took my breath away. Read every book in the series! In order!

Also, the characters of the fellow cast is slowly evoving with each new book. I had a friend read my copy who could not get past the use of futuristic language/tech terms. I didn't see the problem with the idea of licensed companions, etc. The book is not about the future itself, but the lives of those living in it.

This novel is just great.With each of the novels in the series, Robb delves into a different supporting character - fleshing out Mavis and Peapody in past novels, for example. Summerset gets his turn in this one.In a truly entertaining plot, Summerset is framed and Dallas is forced to take her investigation underground or risk making Roarke himself the prime suspect. The villain is targeting Roarke, and is taking out everyone who helped Roarke avenge the death of Summerset's daughter 15 years ago. And we get the added entertainment of Dallas defending Summerset - Robb adds to the previous background behind Summerset's disdain for Dallas. Unlike past novels in this series, Robb makes it very hard to figure out who the villain is and yet when we do, it's very logical.The love affair between Dallas and Roarke is finely shaped, some good sparring and making up, excellent intensity. We continue to have witty exchanges between Peabody and Dallas, and meet McNab, who will be developed in a later novel.A great read!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"So far I have read seven of the J.D.

Robb's &quot;In Death&quot; series, and this book might just be the best yet. The world in 2058 is a fascinating place, but the real intrigue in this story lies in the characters.Robb has an amazing ability to paint vivid and realistic characters, and then explore those characters so that we, as readers, come to feel like we really know them. This is exactly what has happened for me with Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke. Each book delves a little deeper into these two, as individuals and as a unit, and I am completely addicted to reading about them. In fact, I would say that Eve, the independent and emotionally troubled cop, and Roarke, the dangerously handsome and charming billionaire, are my favourite couple of all time! Their relationship continues to grow and flourish as they adjust to their overpowering feelings for each other, and the passionate scenes they share all but send sparks from the pages!In this particular instalment, Eve is working a new case involving a twisted killer who commits unspeakable acts of torture on his victims (two so far) and then, after hours of torment, murders them. In each case, the killer sends the police a taunting riddle, which Eve solves just too late to prevent the murder. As Eve delves into the investigation, it becomes apparent that the link between the two victims is her husband, Roarke, and a dark secret from his past involving Summerset's murdered daughter. Now Eve must walk the thin line between protecting her husband and finding justice for the dead, before another life is lost!This book will draw you in right from the start and keep you captivated until the end.

One of my favor series and authors"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I love this series! This is one of the earlier entries. We find out a lot about Roarke's past and the revelations are not easy for Eve to deal with. I highly recommend the unabridged version. Susan Ericksen is absolutely wonderful in her characterizations, accents and all. A must have for fans of this series!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I loved the book and appreciated the opportunity to purchase it.Jeri Williams"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I did enjoy this book as well as all the others so far in the series. It took me a little bit longer to read though, I have to say, there were a couple of really \\"slow\\" parts, but when the book picked up....I mean it picked up in a hurry. We find Eve once again on the case of a killer. Roarke right beside her as her partner, not just in the marital sense, but right next to her throughout this whole book. Peabody, well you know Delia, she's always inquizitive and always working hard for Dallas. We get introduced to McNab who at this time is taking the place of Feeney since he's on vacation. We see our characters all get caught up in the past, and with the past muder and mutilation of Summerset's Daughter Marlena. The past which Roarke had thought he \\"buried\\" has come back to haunt him, as each friend of Roarke's who was invloved in the muder of Marlenas killers, start becoming killed themselves. Its up to Dallas to stop the killing before Summerset and Roarke become the next victims on this killers list! Enjoy the read, it was a good book!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"THis was my first J.D. Robb book to read and I definitely was not disappointed. I thought I had it figured out before the end but he managed to prove my theory wrong. That's what a great writer does, right? Anyway, I highly recommend the book and can't wait to read another one."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I have to admit, the 5 stars for this one is a sentimental choice. In fact, I've read this book so many times that I'm not even sure I really know what I think about it anymore. Granted, that's true of the preceding 5 books, too, but Vengeance is the most intensely emotional, and I'm all about intensely emotional books these days (as long as they don't have depressing endings, that is!), so I can't look at it objectively.Or rather, I can, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I can, for example, question how Eve can so calmly accept Roarke's past that's so vividly shoved in her face here. Or I can question how the killer latched on to those particular victims. And I can certainly read the part where Roarke gets all pissy about Eve locking a door on him and remember a later book in the series where he does the same thing and want to smack him upside the head. And yes, I can see the headhopping--Nora does it all the time.But in the end, it doesn't matter. It's a 5-star read."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Vengeance in Death is the sixth and, so far, best book in the In Death series by J.D. Robb. The In Death series stars Detective Lt. Eve Dallas of the NYPSD and her roguishly handsome and ridiculously rich billionaire husband and soul mate Roarke.The events of the previous book in the series, Ceremony in Death, is still fresh on the minds of Eve and Roarke and those around them. Eve has insisted that her mentor, Capt. Feeney take his family to one of Roarke's many island paradise estates and unwind. Though things are quiet at first, they don't stay that way for long as killings once again fall into Eve's lap. These killings seem to have a ritualistic, or at least a purpose to them and soon she finds out why they're being committed. Once again her husband, Roarke, becomes involved in this new case whether she likes it or not.The killings are people from Roarke's past and who meant something to him in one way or another. I thought this installment was the best so far due to the handling of how to bring up info about Roarke's mysterious past without it being said through long-winded dialogue. Robb just took said past history added a healthy dose of Summerset's own recollections and then mixed it all into the current murder case Eve was investigating and you got yourself one great story. The fact that Roarke's childhood was as screwed up as Eve's though without the incestuous rape and pimping shows that he and Eve have alot more in common.Vengeance in Death just continues to make J.D. Robb's In Death series a must read for fance of fun escapism with a balanced diet of romance, mystery, and humor. It was also great to know abit more of Roarke's and Summerset's past. I'm looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"It's official. I'm addicted to the &quot;...in Death&quot; series. I was hooked after the first book, &quot;Naked in Death&quot;, but convinced myself that I could stop anytime I wanted. Yeah, right. I've even got my husband reading the series and he's hooked too. This is the sixth book in the series and, in my opinion, the best so far.Once again, Roarke is linked to a series of heinous murders Lt. Eve Dallas is investigating. This time, however, he's a target. In the process of keeping her man safe and tracking the killer, Eve learns more about Roarke and Summerset's past. This one kept me guessing until the end. Eve's relationship with Roarke is further developed. As always there's just the right amount of great love scenes but the fights are even better!This series offers a perfect blend of suspense, romance and even humor. Lt. Eve Dallas is such a wonderful character. She's got guts, brains, strength, wit and just a touch of insecurity. And what woman wouldn't want a Roarke in their life? This book won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I really liked this bood. It was another nice one in the series. I especially liked the foray into Roarke's past."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This was as good as the previous ones in the series. The reader learners more about Rourke and Sommerset's history and why Sommerset is so devoted to Rourke. Eve and Rourke's relationship is getting better -- more open, more trust."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This was a great book - I can't wait for the next one in the series. They just keep gettingbetter. I'm hoping maybe J.D. Robb will starta relationship between Peabody and McNab.I think they would be great together. I likedhow we got to explore Roarke's past."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"It is my opinion that the esteemed Nora Roberts has foun her niche in the crime novel genre. I have been a long time fan of hers and the IN DEATH series is, in my opinion, her best yet. She has developed in Eve Dallas a character that is both human and superhuman at the same time.Roberts has once again developed a cast of characters that readers can identify because like the rest of us they have flaws as well as traits that make them loveable and unique. I enjoyed the futuristic take on crime. Trully unique. I would highly recomend this and any of Roberts' other works to mystery and romance lovers alike!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I really enjoy this series a great deal. Eve and Roarke are two of the most intriguing people I have read about in a long time. I have read several reviews on this book. One problem I've heard mentioned is one that involves Eve's superiors believing her take on the reason for the killer going after Roarke. I don't think they believed for a moment that Roarke wasn't involved in the murders years before. But, they are willing to accept Eve's explanation because of the circumstances of the girl's death, and their faith in her. I think this installment gives us a view of what formed Roarke...his loyalty and his need to comfort. Not to mention why he keeps Summerset around. The love between these two charactors is nice to read. They are devoted to each other. Roarke is slowly teaching Eve to allow herself to love, trust and believe in another person. Her prickly, stubborn veneer is a shield to protect herself. But, she is finding it harder and harder to hide behind it with him. Because of that, she is also allowing others into her circle...Peobody, Feeney, Mavis, Mira, Nadine..even McNab. I highly recommend this series. I've read them all, and can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I'm ordering the Death series books two at a time, because I just can't get enoughof them. I'm 72 years old and can use all the cheering up I can get. The Robb booksare all sizzling thrillers with great, interesting characters, brought vividly to lifein the remarkable, luminous writing style of Nora. This book is no different, includinga fascinating trip to Ireland on cop business. Other than my harmonica playing nothing, even football, can thrill me more than these books do.

I do not enjoy reviews that give too much of the storyline away, suffice I should say this book does not let me down from the previous Lieutenant Eve Dallas series. However, it will stand-alone, you do not have to read any other book in this series to know what is going on with it. I would not spoil it for you if I were to tell you that the murders start off extremely grisly and get very personal to the investigator. You gotta' love this book because, Lt.

Book is well written. I have or am getting the entire series."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"One of my favorites so far, because it delves into Roarke's mysterious history. When two men and one woman are brutally murdered, all of the clues lead Eve to Roarke's stuffy butler, Summerset, as the killer. But the victims and the prime suspect all share a common past... and secret... with Roarke. He may be a seductive multi-billionaire now, but the former criminal/vigilante is also married to a cop. Now, he's forced to return to the land of his brutal childhood and deal with a deadly secret that could threaten his relationship with the woman he loves. Eve is forced to weigh her feelings for the man she loves and her own sense of justice when his illegal past is revealed."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I have read and kept every Nora Roberts aka JD Robb. I am just finishing up her newest and am loving every minute. She can't write them fast enough for me. If you like romance, complicated characters, humor, fast pace action and don't mind some violence, buy and read. Her story lines are always amazing and having the same characters, Eve, Roake, Peabody, McNab, etc., just makes the reading more fun. Roberts does'nt just write about a new murder, but she works hard to have her characters grow with each book. You and they understand more about them. I hope she continues to write as Nora Roberts and JD Robb for a long time."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Susan Ericksen's narration of the In Death series is outstanding and really makes the characters come alive. She reads the transcript with just the right emphasis on words and phrases. Eve, Peabody, Somerset, and Rourke are beautifully portrayed. I preorder all these tapes because I know the reading will be excellent."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"As with all the 'In death' series an enjoyable read. But there is one matter, which makes J D Robb's picture of the future rather confusing. It is a petty point but one which nags. What are the units used? Sometimes they are metres and centimetres, sometimes feet and inches. Only in temperature is there consistency, all in Fahrenheit, though surely by the middle of the next century, when there is some form of world government in place the move to metric measurements would have been complete. Then what is the currency? Sometimes dollars, sometimes that classic SF standby credits. Minor points but they jar when reading. Otherwise a great read, and a believable continuing love affair between Eve and Rorke"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Im lost for words when it come to this series of books - all I want to do is read"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This book was an excellent addition to the series. So far I'm loving the whole series. A definate must read."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"What can I really say beyond that this fits into an \\"In Death\\" fan's expectations. It's enjoyable as it really expands on Summerset's character, and you learn a bit more of Roarke's past, but other than that it is pretty much a run of the mill In Death book. It's nothing truly special, but it's an enjoyable weekend read - the mystery itself isn't overly complicated, and you know the motive, if not the exact perpetrator, early on, so there isn't a huge amount of suspense. It's a good read though, I'd recommend to any fan of the series."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Loved this sixth installment of the In Death series. These books just keep getting better. I love the way the characters and their relationships grow. This one had more than the usual tension between Eve and Roarke. Sommerset is featured, with appearances of Peabody and only a token visit by Mavis. I hope to see more of McNab, the young tech geek introduced. If there's a better futuristic cop/mystery/thriller with a healthy dose of romance, single, let alone series, I haven't found it."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I love J.D. Robb's books and the is one didn't disapoint. I enjoyed the riddles and the quick way Eve solves them. Would highly suggest anyone who like murder with a little sex mix in to read this and all of other in the group. Amazon is a great place to get this group of J.D. Robbs books and kindle books."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This is one of those books you stumble across and end up reading the entire book in a day or two. I believe this was one of the greatest in the series by Robb who portrays Eve as a hard-nosed detective. But she has another side to her that only her husband Rourke brings out in her. Sometimes in life you have to balance work and home life and Eve tries to do both. This is a must read book that should be at the top of your list."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"The serial killer in this book is a brutal, twisted religious fanatic who sees himself as an instrument of God's righteous vengeance. He is taunting Eve with clues that have her racing to the crime scenes only to arrive moments after the death of the victims. It is soon clear that the killer is purposefully playing Eve and plans to include Roarke and Eve as ultimate victims in his plan of revenge.I have always been a bit put off by the antagonism between Eve and Roarke's friend/man servant, Sommerset. I really think they should be getting/ trying to get along better since they both have such strong connection and love for Roarke. This story brings their animosity to a head as the killer twists the clues and events to point to Sommerset. And there is cause for Sommerset to become the primary suspect when the connection of the victims to Raorke's and Sommerset's past lives is revealed to Eve. Even though Eve is trying to do her job and trying to prove Sommerset's innocence, Sommerset is not particularly cooperative.This book is full of the great dialogue I enjoy between the characters. There is great sensual heat and growing emotional attachment between Eve and Roarke. There is growing comraderie too between Eve and Peabody. More and more of Peabody's quirky character is being revealed.I love how the emotions are \\"shown\\" by action. I can clearly visualize Eve's anger through this phrase: she...\\"closed her mouth, teeth first.\\" The narrator, Susan Ericksen, does a suburb job with the accents, including Eve's crisp tough cop persona, Peabody's nasally New York, Sommerset's uptight, prissy butler tone, Roarke's cheerful and passionate Irish, Dr. Mira's fresh and professional female, and various other, particularly Irish, accents of the characters in this story. Even more impressive is Ms. Ericksen's fine performance of the emotional action. She nails the expressions of trembling fear, snarling disapproval, chuckling warmth, frustrated weariness and twisted psychotic venom - just to identify a few.One apt quote I jotted down from this Audible was Eve's summary of the killer's twisted religious vengeful purpose:\\"And the seeds of his faith were sown in blood, rooted in vengeance and bloomed in death.\\"I thought this was the best of the series so far. I look forward to listening to book 7, Holiday in Death.This book was from my own Audible TBR list. Check the review before this one for a chance to win a used copy of Book 5, Ceremony in Death."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Love this series of LT. Dallas written by J.Robb(aka Nora Roberts). I plan to read the whole series. It's really interesting to see who the villian is and how she plans on catching him."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Have most of the other books in the series, needed a copy of this one. Love all of her books about Eve Dallas, can't wait for the new ones to come out."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"The book begins with Eve closing an open and shut case - just like she enjoys them. Unfortunately, on her way out she receives a call from an unidentified caller stating that he has just committed a first-degree murder. Then he proceeds to taunt Eve with a riddle. The name of his riddle is - Revenge.It doesn't take long for Eve to determine that this comes from Roarke's past or that Summerset is being implemented in the murders. As much as she should enjoy questioning and taunting him - knowing this came from Marlena's torture makes it difficult for her.I think my favorite part of the entire book is when Eve's driving though town, asks Peabody a question, and gets the response, \\"I'm sorry, sir, you're interrupting my praying\\"."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I have mixed feelings about Nora Roberts (aka J.D. Robb) books, mainly because of the rough language in them. But she writes so well and her stories are so engrossing that I find it hard not to pick one up and read once in a while.In this book Eve Dallas is still coming to terms with her marriage, when a series of murders are committed...all of which involved Irishmen that her husband knew at one time or another. She needs to find out why he knew these men and what connection he had to them in order to find out why this serial murderer is killing and why he is using the MO that he is. Eve comes to understand that her husband is at risk because of his bringing to justice several men who had horrendously hurt the young daughter of Summerset, Roarke's 'valet' and man-of-all-trades.These books go fast and furious much like the movie of that name. Makes me wonder why no one has ever tried to bring these books to the screen, except too often they botch the book up in screenwriting.Dallas solves the crimes at great risk to herself and to the others around her. She has to tred a fine line between the law and her husband's old world, so as to not involve him.Karen Sadler"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"The previous book in the series was good but left me with a somewhat bitter taste. The reason was the J.D. Robb plunged into the unnatural events genre alla Laurell K. Hamilton. Since I enjoy the work by both authors, I would rather see each one of them write about that which they \\"know\\" best. This is why I was pleasantly surprised when in this book I found no references to events outside the boundaries of the futuristic world of 2058.Finally, the year 2058 is coming to an end, and it is unbelievable how much has happened in just a few months: Lieutenant Eve Dallas and Roarke meeting and getting married, Eve remembering crucial events from her childhood, Mavis seeing her career surging forward, and many others. The current case involves a serial killer that punishes people that have strayed from the path of the Lord. The first victim Eve finds was not only killed, but also tortured savagely. To complicate matters further, the victim is an old friend of Roarke, from his time in Ireland, when Eve's husband was involved in certain activities that would not be appreciated by Eve.In the case of the second victim, the killer's intentions become a little clearer, since he calls Eve and gives her a clue useful for finding the victim before the time of death. So now it is personal, since the killer wants Eve as an opponent and the second victim is also a friend of Roarke. The relationship between Eve and Roarke is put to the test, since Roarke's secrets from his past may aid Eve in the investigation, but these secrets make him criminally liable. Is Eve more concerned about justice than about keeping her husband? Things really heat up when Sommerset, Roarke's faithful servant, becomes a suspect in the investigation.The quality picks up considerably compared to \\"Ceremony in Death\\", with Robb focusing on what she does best and also limiting the passionate scenes to more reasonable levels. These had gotten a little bit out of hand in previous works in terms of their frequency and lack of variation in their development. Now the author creates a much better balance, presenting the scenes for those that crave them, but not repeating them so much so as to make the book a little boring. Hopefully, the quality of the series will remain at this level until the end."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Anyone who enjoys reading crime tales, either fiction or non-fiction, will definitely love this book. Top notch writing weaves a suspenseful story about Police Lt. Eve Dallas and her mysterious husband Roarke. Another absolutely great book in the series of novels about the tough woman crime fighter and her world. Read them all. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"In this book, a brilliant and sadistic serial killer is targeting Irish immigrants in New York. His methods are sickeningly brutal, and each death is different. With the very first death the killer draws Eve into the mix, calling her to boast about the murder and to give her a riddle to lead her to it.Evidence points straight to Summerset, Roarke's devoted 'servant' and friend and the bane of Eve's domestic existence. While it quickly becomes obvious he's being set up, proving that in an official capacity is another matter.While there's a familiar theme here of Eve's cases bringing her into conflict with and causing her to investigate the very people she cares about, it's carried off far better in this volume than in some of the others. Summerset's reasons for distrusting police are extremely well-founded and far too deep-set for him to shake off. The reasons why Eve can figure out that he's innocent but can't easily keep him out of jail are clever and believable.A new and highly entertaining series character puts in an appearance (McNab, a flamboyant electronics expert with the police force). Eve and Summerset are forced to stretch (and break) their veneer of civility. And Eve and Roarke have to face, and embrace, more of his past than she's even been aware of up until now. There are no easy answers, and their only chance lies in being able to manipulate and outwit a killer who believes he's the instrument of God's vengeance.The character development is beautiful, the pacing and tension are gripping, and the mystery is fascinating. I highly recommend this volume of Robb/Roberts's in death series."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Vengeance in Death by J.D. Robb is the fifth book in this \\"In Death\\" series by this author who is the alter ego of Nora Roberts. This pseudonym is only used for her futuristic series (don't let that genre fool you - these books are fantastic, even if you don't usually like science fiction type stories!)It seems that each of the books in this series so far has the murders involving Eve Dallas' lover/husband, Roarke, in some form or another and this one is no different. If you've read these from the first book, Naked in Death, then you've followed the relationship evolution between the two strong main characters and you've been given a glimpse of each of their pasts. Vengeance in Death explores, in greater detail, Roarke's past and that of his butler, Summerset.A killer is loose and he's killing men with Irish links; unfortunately, that Irish link is Roarke and his past crimes. Summerset's daughter, Marlena, had been brutally murdered in Dublin, Ireland many years before and Roarke avenged her death by killing the six men responsible. Now it seems that someone is killing Roarke's informants from the past. It's Eve Dallas' job as primary homicide detective in the cases to find out who this mad man is and stop him before another victim is found.Sounds like a typical \\"who dun it?\\" type book right? Well with J.D. Robb, you can always expect to find a bit more intrigue, romance and humor thrown into the plot. The added character of Ian McNibb (Electronic Detective Division Wonder-boy) is a pure stroke of genius. And the undertones of a romantic entanglement between McNibb and Officer Delia Peabody (Dallas' able assistant) leaves the reader wanting more and not being able to wait to read the next book to find out if these two actually do get together.One of my favorite support characters, Mavis, is missing from this book - actually, she makes a very brief appearance, and that leaves a bit of fun out of the story line. But don't worry - the other colorful characters are all there - Commander Whitney, Police Chief Tibble, Summerset, Peabody, Dr. Mira, and of course Eve and Roarke.The identity of the killer wasn't predictable this time, and actually had me guessing up to the end of the book. The clues as to his identity were few and far between, but the outcome made sense once everything was in the open.Vengeance in Death is more sound writing from J.D. Robb and her versions of the future are impressive. I want a turbo car that can go from New York City to New Los Angeles in three hours just as they have in this book! (With gas prices the way they are now, I'm wondering what kind of gas and gas mileage they're getting in the future!) It will be interesting to see if the world is any closer to these creations in the year 2058 - only 57 more years to go and we'll see! But I'm first in line for one of those AutoChef inventions that cooks your meal upon voice command - no cooking, no cleaning - ah, paradise!Vengeance in Death isn't the best book in the series that I've read, but it is still excellent."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Do you believe in the saying, \\"An eye for an eye?\\" Well, some one in Manhattan does, and they are killing for that belief in vengeance. Eve and Peabody investigate a series of brutal homicides and discover that they are all linked to Roarke's past. Eve is torn between duty and family, because Summerset (Roarke's butler, and oldest friend) is the primary suspect.Feeny is away on vacation and Eve is forced to bring in a young and some what annoying e-detective named McNab. The chemistry between McNab and Peabody is quite amusing. They fight like cats and dogs, but underneath is a brewing sexual tension. The addition of McNab to Eve's team is refreshing. It is fun to have a new face that shakes everyone up.As the team investigates these slayings, Roarke is brought face to face with a past that he has tried to bury. This book really expands on the characters of Roarke and Summerset. Those of you reading the series know that Eve and Summerset are like oil and water, and now they have to put their trust in each other so they can work together to find the real killer. The suspense is back and better than ever. This book really heats up, so open it up and hang on!Jenny BoguePaper-and-LaceSpecializing in paranormal romance and fiction."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This is by far my favorite of the In Death series thus far. The plot is thrilling and well written full of the twists I have come to expect in these books. The great thing about this book is that I think it is vital to Roarke and Eve's relationship. I love that this series gives the reader a veiw of couples after they admit to being in love, as many of Robert's regular books don't. Up until this book their love was very hot and passionate, but they never really fought. This book puts a lot of obstacles in their paths and they have to work them out as a couple and learn that they have to except each other's differences. Also wonderful is the tirelessly stodgy Summersett whose relationship with Eve is also examined in this book. Why is Summersett so horrid to Eve? Read this book and find out. A fascinating, page-turner. I recommend reading these books in order though. My only question, how long until Eve is pregnant?"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This series is additive! This is the third time I've read Vengeance and I still love it.The plot is intriguing, and laced with religious vengeance. As with other J.D. Robb books, the suspense and conflict are first rate. And, the romance/sex is hot. Jeez, as women all of us would flutter and possibly faint if Roarke turned his considerable charm on us.If you haven't read the 'in Death' series, you're denying yourself hours of entertainment and enjoyment. Take the advice I was given, though, and read them in order so you meet the main characters as they come into play and develop into first rate characters.Thank you Ms. Robb!Shelley Dawn, author ofSweet, Sweet JessieandDark Nights"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"J. D. Robb is the pseudonym Nora Roberts uses for her futuristic \\"In death\\" series, set in the year 2058. Many things have changed, but other stay the same. There are criminals, and those who fight against them. Eve Dallas is one of those who try to uphold justice. \\"Vengeance in death\\", the 6th book in the series, starts by stating that \\"The business of murder took time, patience, skill, and a tolerance for the monotonous. Lieutenant Eve Dallas had them all\\".In this book, we will see Eve applying those skills to the solution of some crimes that strike close to her. Victims previously connected to her husband Roarke start to appear gruesomely murdered, and there are clues that tie their deaths to a vengeance carried out long ago by Roarke, in Ireland. When someone tries to frame Roarke's butler Somerset as the murderer, Eve knows for certain that something is afoot. The question is what, and why?.In my opinion, \\"Vengeance in death\\" is a book well-worth reading, even though it isn't the best in the series. You will enjoy trying to discover the mystery behind the murders, and learning more about Roarke and Somerset's past. The interaction between Ian McNabb (from the Electronic Detective Division) with Eve's faithful sideckick, Officer Delia Peabody, will draw sparks and make the reader smile and wonder about them. All in all, I think that you will like this book, specially if you have already read the previous books in the series. Happy reading :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Nora Roberts/J.D Robb writes the most amazing stories I have read in a long time!! When I'm reading one of her stories I feel like I'm actually seeing the characters come alive on the pages. Her Roarke character is the best. He doesn't let anyone push him around including his wife. I love the way her male characters come out in her books, rough around the edges, bossy, demanding, want things done their way, and just a little rough with their women. Keep the stories of Roarke and Eve coming! I have everyone of her books on these two and I can't wait for the next one!!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I am an avid reader and enjoy being able to buy my books so conveniently. Will return when I need more books."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This particular book is one of my favorites in the series. Fast paced, well written, intriguing plot line, character development, Roarke back story, Eve/Summerset snark-fest. Loved it. A must read in the series!"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Brought to you by OBS reviewer HeidiVengeance in Death is the sixth installment of Nora Roberts' In Death series that's written under the pen name J.D. Robb.The year of 2058 is wrapping up, but not before Lieutenant Eve Dallas deals with another sociopath. As the dead bodies start piling up Eve quickly notices a connection--her husband, Roarke! He knows all the victims from back when he lived in Dublin running scams and picking pockets to survive. The people dying are the ones that helped Roarke find the men that raped, tortured, and killed Summerset's daughter, Marlena. And now Summerset is the prime suspect in these new murders.As much as Eve dislikes Summerset, she knows that he is not her killer. Eve must act fast to find out who is though as it's obvious that the murderer's grand finale will be Roarke.This book captured my interest from the very beginning. I loved the intrigue about the secret that Roarke and Summerset had from their past and found it entertaining watching it all unfold.I was worried this was going to be another book where all the evidence pointed to Roarke, but that wasn't the case at all. Instead, the victims were all old acquaintances of Roarke who helped him find the people that he eventually killed to avenge Marlena's death.This novel delved into Roarke's past which has never really been touched upon that much in the previous installments of the series. We start to understand the things he had to do to survive. We also get to see just how Roarke loves and stands up for those he cares about. And of course I loved seeing his protective side (again) when it came to Eve. How he was upset when she tried to get the killer to come after her instead of him and how he wouldn't leave New York without her because he was afraid of what would happen to her in his absence.\\"You had no right. No right to stand in front of me.\\" He turned back now, his eyes vividly blue with temper that had gone from frigid to blaze. \\"No ****ing right to risk yourself on my behalf\\"\\"Oh really. Is that so?\\" She stalked forward until they were toe to toe. \\"Okay, you tell me. You keep looking me dead in the eye and you tell me you wouldn't have done the same if it was me in jeopardy.\\"\\"That's entirely different.\\"\\"Why?\\" Her chin came up and her finger jabbed hard into his chest. \\"Because you have a penis?\\"Vengeance in Death does hit on a touchy subject to some though--religion. The killer thinks he's on a holy mission from God and even leaves a statue of Mary at all his murder scenes. I thought it was a bit strange that Eve didn't know who Mary was though. I guess that Roberts is speculating where our world is heading if things progress the way they currently are; we won't have religion at all.There was a part of this book in the middle that did start to get a little dull, but overall the book was a decent read and now I'm on to the next!This review and more at openbooksociety dot com"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"Has everything.

I can't get enough!!!singingahe"},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"This to me was a great and typical Robb book. I had started reading her books a couple if years ago and wanted to see how she met different people. So I have started at the beginning of her books."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It seems to be molding the character personalities and introducing characters that will be entertaining in future books. I almost felt like Eve was being to hard and didn't show her soft side that she is known to have, it was as if she was struggling to show (or hide) her true emotions. It was a real challenge to guess the killer before the end of the book which makes this book even more exciting."},{"Title":"Vengeance in Death","review":"I am a long-time fan of J.D Robb and have read all of her books. I am now re-reading them on my Kindle so that I may enlarge the font. This story, like all of the in death series, is exciting, suspenseful, and hard to put it down. The characters are all independent and yet have a close and fun relationship with each other."},{"Title":"Renoir: Painter of Happiness (Jumbo)","review":"This is a very nice volume. The reproductions are first class; the essays are excellent.However, a strange thing occured as a result of having procured this book: now that I've seen a great many Renoirs together, I find that I admire his work less. It's a very cruious thing. I've always loved Renoir--or thought I did. But as a result of this book, I now see that while some of his work is great, at least 25% is kitsch. Even the essayist Gilles Neret acknowledges that this is the opinion of a number of critics.Some of Renoir's late work is incredibly gaudy and tasteless, with monstrous female figures and garish colours.For an artist who had much more firm control of his technique, check Paul Signac."},{"Title":"Renoir: Painter of Happiness (Jumbo)","review":"Wow, book much better than I expected. Wonderful full color pictures and great explanations and history. How delightful. Would use this company again."},{"Title":"Renoir: Painter of Happiness (Jumbo)","review":"This book includes images of most of Renoir's great works. Many color images printed on high quality heavy paper. This book will be on my coffee table for a long time."},{"Title":"Jan Tschichold: A Life in Typography","review":"First the good. &quot;Life in Typography&quot; is a beautifully illustrated paperback containing gorgeous, intriguing scans of pages and illustrations from the work of typographer/illustrator Jan Tschichold. Fortunately, a number of reprints in the book are reprinted actual size, to give the viewer a distinctly real vantage point into what the originals actually looked like. So unless you've got the cash to buy out-of-print books, this is by far the most sane route. And it's not too expensive either.But the only problem I had with the book is that I wanted to learn more about the artist himself. Tschichold's bold, at times abbrasive tone comes out in his pen sketched notes on a number of reprints and in-house drafts, leading the reader to believe he was probably one obnoxious, colorful, temperamental character. Instead, &quot;A Life in Typography&quot; sheds little light on the 'life' of Tschichold, and focuses instead on images with little explanation.Were there no interviews with Tschichold that could have been reprinted? A larger window into his persona would have really helped understand his persistance and drive for typographic perfection.But of everything reprinted in the book, quite possibly the most stirring, worthy part is a four page reprint of &quot;Composition Rules&quot; written by Tschichold and distributed to employees of the Penguin Book company. It's forceful, blunt, and essential reading for anyone involved in typesetting. He explains in detail how to treat capitals, italics, paragraph indents and punctuation marks. His thoughts and opinions about typography leap off the page.So if you need a quick reference of his work, or are someone who just discovered the name Tschichold, this is a must have for your design library."},{"Title":"Jan Tschichold: A Life in Typography","review":"The late Ruary McLean has deligted the world of typography with many seminal books on the subject. \\"Jan Tschichold: a life in typography\\" is but one good example of his prodigious output. McLean uses his personal acquaintance with Tschichold to good effect in a delightful essay about this important 20th century type designer. The essay evaluates the work of this controversial figure who started as a convential designer, espoused a radical change, and then reverted to a more classical view of typography. The book contains many examples of Tschichold's work from all three stages of his development. An excellent reference."},{"Title":"Hasinai: A Traditional History of the Caddo Confederacy","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. This book is very easy to read. The late Vynola Beaver Newkumet, a respected Caddo Tribal elder wrote this book with the assistance of a talented non tribal member writer. It is full of easily absorbed interesting information about the Caddo Tribe and its people.You will find yourself returning to favorite passages in this book to re experience them. This book is a traditional history but it isn't mainstream American traditional history. It is explained from a distinctly Native American point of view.Hasinai provides narratives of Caddo Tribal business council and cultural leaders. It also provides information about Caddo tribal words and language. This is a living history book. There are very well taken photographs in this book. Some must be extremely treasured by their owners.This definitely is a must have book. You and your children will enjoy it. It will be a conversation piece."},{"Title":"Life As Creation: A Jewish Way of Thinking About the World","review":"This is not so much a review of the book as a brief description of it. I am making this description because no such description is provided on the ' Amazon Site'.I simply want to tell any potential reader what the book is about.The book is a book of ' thoughts' or ' aphorisms' on the subject of ' creation'.It takes the conception of ' creation' and pairs it with other central concepts of Judaism, for instance the concepts of ' redemption' and 'freedom' providing thoughts on each such pairing.The basic idea of the book is one given in Tannach and taught by Rabbi Joseph Dov Baer Solovetchik of Blessed Memory. It is that God the Creator has commanded Mankind to walk in God's way. This walking in God's way has its primary meaning in terms of moral action, in our striving to be compassionate and kind to others. But as Rabbi Shubert Spero has also pointed out it also means that God the Creator, wishes us to be 'co- creators in perfecting the world in scientific, artistic and other aspects of human activity.As I have been a writer, involved in ' literary creation' or the effort at it, all my adult life, this aspect of Creation is given particular emphasis in the book.The idea of ' creation' is explored and developed in the book as a central Jewish concept by which Jews make their own lives meaningful, and work to co- create the world with God in the direction of greater goodness and well- being for all of Mankind."},{"Title":"Life As Creation: A Jewish Way of Thinking About the World","review":"I recieved this book as part of the the then Aaronson Jewish Book Club. I didnt know then that this book would not only be full of interesting aphorisms regarding creation but full of the authors human and loving insights into the meaning of many things as relates to the jewish people, mankind in general and people as individuals all using the theme of creation to bring out a diamond buried with it. A book that once started will be treasured and makes me wish the author had given more in other books done along this line of thought.I envy Shalom Freedmans intuitivness on so many levels as regards the world. This is a great piece of Dvar Torah."},{"Title":"Memoirs of Mary Baker Eddy,","review":"It's an interesting little book, but a bit flavored by Dickey's profound admiration for Mary Baker Eddy. This is a memoir written by a man who was Mrs. Eddy's personal secretary for many years. (Eddy was the founder of the Christian Science Church.) Dickey also wrote \\"God's Law of Adjustment\\" (which is also offered here at Amazon) and that is a powerful and empowering and inspirational piece of literature.In our day and time, self-publishing is no longer that unusual. But Mrs. Eddy was a self-published author during the Victorian era (late 1800s) and that was a remarkable achievement for too many reasons to list here.In the early days, she sold her book door to door. She tried placing ads in newspapers. She tried other venues, as well. (This was before amazon.com, remember.) By 1881, five years after the first printing, she'd sold about 2,000 copies. Pretty abysmal. It must have seemed unspeakably discouraging.With that as a backdrop, let me say that my favorite part of \\"Memoirs of Mary Baker Eddy\\" is on page 59. Mrs. Eddy was quite elderly at this point and a package arrived at her door. Adam Dickey brought it to her. It was the very first edition of her book, Science and Health (first published 1875) and now an antique. Dickey records what happened next.\\"She took the book in her hands, opened it, read a few lines, turned the leaves fondly, read again for a little and as she did so I could see that past experiences were filling her thought...At length, she closed it slowly, gently, and placing it in my hand again, said with deepest feeling and tears in her eyes, 'Take it, and put it away, Mr. Dickey, - no one will ever know what it has cost me to write that book.'\\"In the intervening century, Eddy's book has now sold more than 10 million copies.Rose"},{"Title":"Memoirs of Mary Baker Eddy,","review":"This is a treasure of times past of a truly great woman, recorded by one of her dedicated workers.

Good examples and resources, too."},{"Title":"How to Open your own In-Home Bookkeeping Service 2nd Edition","review":"The author has an amazing story of how she got significant help from CPA's and Payroll companies and judges to start her business while working full time. Well about 10 years ago when Quick Books was the hot new tool when anybody could make money installing this with no accounting knowledge, today is just a Good Story. As I read the excellently written tale I had this image of a beautiful woman in the right place at the right time. I was right. Unless your very attractive to get everyone helping you and it's the 90's when CPA's didn't have their own bookkeeping businesses and payroll companies also had no interest in bookkeeping, today is a different story. I wish you the best of luck if you start a bookkeeping business with this book as your inspiration. Unfortunately buying this book has only left me with one true fact, \\"If it's sounds too go to be true, it is.\\" This book is not worth $10."},{"Title":"How to Open your own In-Home Bookkeeping Service 2nd Edition","review":"I bought this book as part of my research into setting up my own financial services consultancy.

It covers everything you need to consider and do to get your business up and running. It is not full of hype about how successfull you will be, it is meat and potatoes this is what you need, this is what it is about. And therefore worth its hefty price. If you could sit down and ask a few bookkeepers pertinent questions on every aspect of bookkeeping, this book is an accumulation of the answers you would recieve. It actually talked me out of starting my own business and convinced me to work for someone else. To lessen the ebb and flow of being in business for yourself. But that was worth the thorough thought process the book took me through. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"How to Open your own In-Home Bookkeeping Service 2nd Edition","review":"I purchased this book based on the reviews and I have to say I was disappointed.

A more reasonable price would have been like $24.95."},{"Title":"How to Open your own In-Home Bookkeeping Service 2nd Edition","review":"When I purchased this book, I was a staff accountant but had a client \\"on the side\\" so I had to file income taxes as if I also had a business. Honestly, I needed a deduction and thought this would be a good \\"wishful thinking\\" book. I'm now only working for myself. Did I read this book and immediately resign? NO. But, when a year after I read it, my situation changed, I'm glad I could refer to this great reference to guide me. The sample documents in the back & on CD are very helpful. You'll appreciate that when you read this book it's as if she's sitting there next to you giving you her advice and recounting her experiences, perhaps because she was with her ill mother when she wrote it. Maybe a better title would have been \\"This is how I did it and you can, too!\\" It definately is not a stuffy \\"textbook\\" or a just-skim-over-the-basic-idea startup book.

I have read lots of accounting books and since I'm interested in starting my own business, I have researched numerous resources on this subject. Without a doubt, this is the best book I have read on this subject. Not only is it a good read, the author gives the \\"reality\\" of doing this business and the information is authentic and reliable. Julie comes across as a \\"down-to-earth\\", \\"say-it-like-it-is\\" person. She gives you her brain in an understandable way.She presents the technical side of accounting without the intimidation factor. We all know that this stuff can be dry, but Julie makes it somewhat fun and desirable. Her sarcasm is wonderful and non-offensive at the same time. Not everyone can write with that kind of expertise. If you do your research, you will find lots of resources that promise you the world but deliver very little (in content).

I researched what I needed for weeks on end before making any purchases. Her books were not only informative and illustrated...they were easy to understand. As I read her books, I felt more confident in what I already knew about bookkeeping and so much more. Her books gave me the added confidence to pursue my dreams. I started at home which only cost me $1,000 out of pocket before I landed my first client just one month after. It's now been a year and I work for 17 mid-sized companies. My confidence is poured outwardly in my work and my time is being demanded more and more by old, new and future clients. Unfortunately, I had to refuse a few customers because there was not enough time in my day to work on everyone's accounts. I have had CPA's compliment my organization and knowledge of Quickbooks. I am even now cleaning up companies that were destroyed by CPA's. To this day, I refer back to Julie's books for information or guidance and 9 times out of 10 her answers were in print. She also communicates immediately to emails which is always refreshing. The pages on her books screamed \\"You Can Do It\\" and I pursued my dreams with both feet. As a result I am very successful today. Had it not been for her books and comfort, I honestly feel I may still be an employee earning $400 gross a week. My success is because of Julie and to her I will always be grateful."},{"Title":"How to Open your own In-Home Bookkeeping Service 2nd Edition","review":"This book tells you everything you need to know to start a bookkeeping or small accounting business.

Since, in addition to Accounting and Finance, I have a background in advertising and sales, I had an idea of what would make a practice grow. However, her marketing suggestions were not what I was expecting, but she was right! Since reading the book, I have left my full time job and now support myself with my bookkeeping business.

I have the e-book from Julie's website. I read it all in about 2 days and got inspired. Now things are really beginning to happen for me. I completed the 2007 QuickBooks ProAdvisor Program certification about 1 week ago. I would not have had a clue about this program if it hadn't been for Julie's book. You get over $1000 worth of software and benefits for under %500 and once you complete their program you get listed on their website and get your own free website, plus many other benefits.That being said, I am now also beginning to get referrals from clients and working with a local CPA (as recommended in the book). I have checked out many of the links and resources Julie recommended and found them invaluable. I currently choose to work out of the home only 3 days/week, and I don't have to ask anybody's permission to do this - it's my choice.I have also purchased Julie's other 2 books on QB and budgeting and when I get a chance to read them and review them I will. But my current success has sort of limited my time at the moment.

With this book, you could get started tomorrow (assuming you know bookkeeping, of course). It is honest and chock full of really great ideas and advice. I can't believe she is sharing this with all of us- it feels like talking to a good friend who is willing to tell you all the advantages and pitfalls of her line of work.

Why are women more involved with the caretaking of children than men?Is there evidence that gender differences emerge before socialization can occur such as in infancy?Dr. Geary attempts to explain gender differences from an evolutionary framework by integrating compelling evidence from many social fields such as anthropology, psychology, and sociobiology. Unlike the watered down &quot;Mars and Venus&quot; books, this book is scholarly and offers scientific evidence to support the claims. A must read for any serious student or scholar of the social sciences."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"This an extremely comprehensive book. With a bibliography bigger than some books, no one can say that Mr. Geary hasn't done his homework. His ability to distill a vast amount of information into a comprehensible, concise and compelling theory of the reasons for gender differences is remarkable. His writing style, although academicly oriented, is very readable. No words are wasted, and no thoughts are half-baked. Agree with him or not, his arguments are well concieved and well documented. A virtual one stop shop for all the documented differences between the sexes. A great book."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"I wasn't sure at first, but after reading this book I was convinced that human sex differences are related to sexual selection. In all, this was the most interesting and thoughtful book that I have ever read on sex differences."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"When it comes to human beings, the differences between males and females is not restricted to just their biological 'plumbing'. All of us have observed gender differences and distinctions with respect to emotional maturation, communication, problem solving predilections, and more. Even when taking into account culturally imposed gender roles and expectations, there is an underlying difference in how males and females perceive and interact with the world and people around them. Now in a significantly updated and expanded second edition, \\"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences\\" by David C. Geary (Curators' Profess and Thomas Jefferson Professor, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri) provides a comprehensive introduction to the biological basis for gender-based differences between males and females and the biological basis of natural selection and sexual selection upon which this evolution is founded. Of special note are the chapters addressing the germane issues as sex differences in infancy and in social development. Enhanced with extensive reference citations and a comprehensive index, \\"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences\\" is an accessible and thoroughly 'reader friendly' text, making it very highly recommended for both academic and community Human Sexuality and Psychology reference collections."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"This is the most comprehensive book on sex differences--period. The book is objective, thorough, and fair. Further, it synthesizes everything from children's play to sex differences in STEM fields. Anyone, and I mean anyone, who is interested in the topic of sex differences needs to consult this tome.It would be unfair of me not to point out that the book is not for the faint of heart. It is long, nuanced, and academically written. Geary's goal is not to popularize the topic (a la David Buss) but rather to summarize and synthesize the subject for scholars and interested lay-people. Thus, it is not bedtime reading. However, the issue of sex differences is so intrinsically interesting that the material is often riveting. Let me put it this way: If you've ever gone to an undergraduate party and wondered why men and women behaved so very differently, I would recommend that you consult this book. You don't have to read the entire work to be enlightened. Find the chapter corresponding to your query and read away.For scholars or graduate students, I would highly recommend reading Male, Female from cover to cover. This is especially true for those who are either not familiar with evolutionary theory or are convinced that evolutionary arguments are wrong. If you still believe that after consuming this book, I am not sure what to say. For scholars who are too busy to read the book in its entirety, the bibliography is invaluable. It contains over references to vital work in the various fields Geary synthesizes.It is unfortunate that the last chapter (on how sex differences play out in the modern world) was truncated due to constraints of space. However, other scholars have written about this topic at length and the material in the book should allow you to form your own informed opinion on this issue.Ben Winegard."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"Professor Geary uses Darwin's theory of sexual selection to organize and explain a vast empirical literature on behavioral differences between males and females. He cites over 1,500 studies. This is an impressive synthesis."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"Professor Geary provides the most thorough discussion and explanation of gender differences I have ever read. His descriptions make sense in terms of my personal experiences and his theory and explanations are compelling. This is a must read for anyone who wants to really understand gender differences."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"I say 'magisterial' because the book draws authoritatively on a vast amount of prior research for its conclusions. Though not a textbook, it could be used as one. The author approaches the key questions with regard to human sex differences posed by contemporary psychologists and summarizes the relevant research (all of the relevant research, it seems). Rich in references, the book is not ponderous or unwieldy. It neatly summarizes its conclusions and lays out all of the evidence for those conclusions. It is also scrupulously honest with regard to scientific consensus. It does not overstate its own claims or lean exclusively on those studies which validate its conclusions. The author gives the reader a clear and explicit sense of the degree of consensus, issue by issue. Its strengths are its lucidity, its completeness and its fairness.Personal disclaimer: the author is a friend and colleague. I would not review the book if it argued for a narrow or highly controversial point of view. Its value is in its thoroughness and openness to multiple views. It was useful to me as a non-psychologist. I wanted a sense of the state-of-the-art knowledge regarding sex differences and this book provided just that."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"Taking a strictly evolutionary approach to sex differences this book offers a great summary to date (1998) with adequate references to a whole host of research.

This book is a good source for current information."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"This is a classic and contemporary book about human behavior in an evolutionary approach.

If your writing an essay to show that men and women are different based on evolutionary approaches then this is your book. It might be worth pointing out I would consider it up there with claims that blacks have a lower I.Q than whites. Most of the studies cited and approaches used have all been questioned scientifically in the past, there is reasonable doubt for me at least that this book contains any truth and merely moulds societies present gender structure views in a way that is hard to disprove, something any first year Psych student will know is true of socio-biology and evolution theories."},{"Title":"Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences","review":"After reading this, read Angier's &quot;Woman&quot; to find the real biological nature of women.To quote Barbara Ehrenreich, &quot;Basing your answer on the [sexual] behavior of women in recent times is a little like studying giraffes in a zoo and concluding they can't run.&quot;"},{"Title":"Shadows of Death","review":"Good, cheap collection of some of Lovecraft's best stories, including The Shadow Out of Time, The Tomb, and the Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath."},{"Title":"Shadows of Death","review":"A good collection of short stories by Lovecraft, building to a climax with The Dream-quest of Unknown Kadath.

Welcome to the real west, where cowboys are not noble herdsmen or romantic leading men but dusty, manure-splattered, underpaid, overworked hired men. This is a memoir, not a novel, written by a man who lived the life he describes. Set in central Nevada in the 1950s, Ulph creates a vivid portrait of the land, the people, and the work as he experienced them. He is not attempting to please some real or imagined \\"audience\\" for his book, he is simply telling his story, the way it really happened.The opening paragraphs of the book encapsulate his style and approach: a group of cowboys, camping on the open range, are awakened in the pre-dawn hours by a loud explosion and a sudden burst of light over the mountains to the east. So far, so good: we've been introduced to the characters and the setting, and an intriguing, unexplained event has just taken place that will surely set some sort of a plot in motion. Right? Wrong. It's 1953, and a nuclear device has just been detonated on the Nevada Test Range, a couple of valleys over from the ranch. The cowboys yawn, rise from their bedrolls, and set about another day's work. This scene (a 19th-century pastoral lifestyle bumping up against the Atomic Age) lets the reader know, right away, that the story is about the end of an era, just as the post-World War II \\"boom\\" was beginning to transform the West and overrun its traditional land uses and occupations.Hey, I love \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and \\"Red River\\" and all those other books and movies we're all familiar with. I know the fiction, but I find the reality far more interesting. Owen Ulph presents us with a book that is driven by character and setting, not some sort of artificial plot; that provides us with an unblinking look at one of the most famous yet least well-understood professions in America, that of the working cowboy (not the rodeo or drug-store variety); and sets it all in the enormity and heart-stopping beauty of the Basin and Range country at a time of fundamental social and economic change. His is one of the few authentic literay voices of the American West: a sagebrush Norman MacLean, perhaps, or (in his feel for character and comic dialogue) a modern Mark Twain. Dramatic, witty, incisive, powerful, elegiac for a vanishing way of life but clear-eyed and unsentimental, \\"The Leather Throne\\" is a modern classic of Western literature in general and cowboy life in particular.Reading this book is a bit like trying chipotle sauce for the first time. It's not what you were expecting (no matter what you were expecting), and it may not be to everybody's taste. But there's no denying its strong, distinctive flavor."},{"Title":"The Leather Throne","review":"Reviews of this book tell an interesting story on their own; one of the wonders of the amazon.com review system. The reviewers who can put more than two sentences together, spell, conjugate, and (likely) think give high ratings for good reasons; the negative reviews are their own worst enemy. But as for the book, well, let me put it this way: The chapter titled &quot;A Knight on Bald Mountain&quot; is one of the funniest chapters on human life imaginable; it out Dave Barry's Dave Barry, it's funnier than David Sedaris, it's just flat out hilarious.There are many great moments in *The Leather Throne*, if you can find a copy, and there are some bad ones, too. That's pretty much to be expected. The author, a recluse of sorts on his Lamoille, Nevada, ranch nested on the edge of a glacial lateral morraine along the Ruby Mountains, lived an incredibly full life, not least of all for his friends, neighbors (but he was a recluse), and his former students. His life in central Nevada (a remote place) in the 1950s is the subject of this novel, but it goes beyond that, to look at relationships in an essentially all-male community (except for cows and horses), and excepting the sublime Emma Rogers, who owned the ranch involved, offered it to Owen at the end of his working career on the &quot;Fiddleback,&quot; and when he turned it down (that itself is a story) sold it to someone else, ending a chapter in Nevada ranch history.There's great description, more linear than in the case of *The Fiddleback*, Ulph's first novel. The action isn't bad, and reading this book is a suitable commemoration of an interesting, self-indulgent, but definitely picturesque life. Try reading it; you might learn something."},{"Title":"The Leather Throne","review":"I understand all of the reviews. I can only agree with those who understand what a cowhand is all about. 'The Leather Throne' is written by a cowhand who cannot leave his education behind. It is a blend of scholastic education, a sharp eye for the terrain, a journeyman's unpretentious view for his fellow hands and five years of experience riding for the brand.If you have never rolled a smoke with Bull Durham, or Bull Durham and Prince Albert you cannot 'smoke' the story. If your experience is all cow/calf operations without the occasional wild five year old 1,200 pound steer to break up the monotony, or the six foot high burro fences that they can jump over flat-footed, your cow camp education has been neglected.It is a long read, but those who can appreciate the historical aspects of Ulph's work, will find a serious addition to punching cows in the early 1950's of Nevada. If you can cold-shoe a horse, work a hoolihan inside a corral or read brands and earmarks at a distance, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Leather Throne","review":"Grab your dictionary. Throw out your sleeping pills. This has more words I have never known and you will never need pills to sleep again. A waste a=of paper, though I read the hole thing thrugh. Obviously, Ulph is an academic, but he doesn't know very much about the west. I recommend you pass on this one."},{"Title":"The Leather Throne","review":"This volume is a pedantic and tremendous bore by a self-indulgent author. A total waste of time."},{"Title":"The Leather Throne","review":"This attempt at a great American novel by a former humanities professor from Reed College strikes out. It is not great. It is not good. It is self-indulgent, illiterate and ae-entertaining.

There he finds another job teaching science at a local university and even love with Janine (a near Mary Jane lookalike).Eventually though, circumstances forces him to use his spider-powers to fight a local crime mob but discovers that people he thought were allies turn out to be enemies and vice versa!As I said, I hated the clone saga BUT if I had to recommend a story from that line, this is the one!"},{"Title":"Spider-Man: The Lost Years","review":"The Spider-clone saga was a waste of everyone's time.

DeMatteis also write a sequal to this story called &quot;The Final Redemption&quot;, which ties up some loose ends in the Lost Years but is not much better.

The photographs are superb technically, but it is the subjects that will remain in your memory long after you close the book. Evans's subjects are captured with dignity, and although you might be inclined to feel sorry for them, you are inevitably touched by the strength of these people. The book is a good introduction to Walker Evans and his feel for the human condition.

Written in the 1950's and 60's, the stories depict life for children as it used to be. My 8 and 10 year olds (boy and girl) and myself enjoy this series of books."},{"Title":"The Happy Hollisters and the Scarecrow Mystery (The Happy Hollisters, No. 14)","review":"It is increasingly difficult to find the Happy Hollisters series of books. There were 33 books in this series, written between approximately 1953 and 1970. This particular edition is the fourteenth book in the series, written by a man named Andrew E. Svenson in 1957. Mr. Svenson was a ghostwriter for the Stratemeyer Syndicate with the fictional Jerry West receiving the credit.The Happy Hollisters are somewhat of a relic of an era gone by. The family consists of five children, Pete, Pam (Pamela), Ricky, Holly, and Sue, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Hollister. There are also Zip, a collie, and White Nose, a cat, who has five kittens. Mr. Hollister runs a store called The Trading Post, which is similar to what was once called a general store in days gone by.Throughout the series the children solve mysteries, usually as a family. The mystery in this story begins almost immediately. The Trading Post is robbed. About the time the store was robbed Mr. John Hollister was in the process of testing a new folding canoe. When the Hollisters first discovered the store was robbed they suspected that the target of the robbery was the folding canoe. However, they quickly discovered that one of the stolen items was a quantity of Geiger counters, used to located radioactive materials and the folding canoe prototype was fine.The Hollisters encounter a Mr. Tucker soon after the robbed. Mr. Tucker offers the use of Spruce Forest, a preserve he owns. The preserve is next to Fox Lake, and a river running from the lake has rapids suitable for testing the folding canoe. Soon after Mr. Tucker offered the use of the preserve to the Hollister family the police discover clues that indicate the robbers may have headed to the same area!Once at Spruce Forest the family encounters signs that someone does not want them in the area. A scarecrow placed at the entrance road warns the family to leave. After the family sets up their camp and begins to explore they meet a boy who also warns them to leave. Later they meet a man called Scarecrow who also warns them to leave. It seems as though everyone in the woods wants the Hollister family to leave!As the mystery deepens, the family learns that someone may be impersonating a forest ranger. They also learn of a boy and his father who have been missing for some time. Yet more adventures wait as young Sue is swept into Fox Lake on a runaway raft, a bear threatens the children, and the people who warned the Hollisters to leave disappear. As the book draws to an exciting end the Hollisters face a fire in the woods and a trio of dangerous criminals!Several of the more recent Happy Hollister books I was less than enthusiastic about. However, I enjoyed this mystery thoroughly. The story was nicely plotted and the action was brisk from beginning to end. My only hesitation in recommending this book is that it is so good that many of the other stories suffer in comparison. I am sure there are interesting anachronisms that I missed in this story, but the one that stood out the most is how one of the children is thrown out of the car as it goes into a ditch. With modern shoulder harnesses and the diligence we use in wearing them, children should remain firmly within a car during an accident. Please wear your seatbelts!The Happy Hollisters series remains a reasonably good, if somewhat outdated, read for younger children, perhaps from ages 4 to 9. I suspect that by age 9 most children are entranced by more modern pursuits. Also, many children may consider families of five children to be somewhat unusual and that may take some explaining. These books may be an excellent way to introduce children to the changes that have taken place in our society over the past half century.One last word of caution. These books are becoming very difficult to find, and thus their price varies substantially. If you are interested in reading this series you may find editions without covers that sell for less than editions with covers.I hope you enjoy The Happy Hollisters. They are a reminder of a simpler age that was only a short time ago."},{"Title":"The best of Jenny's kitchen: Select vegetarian cuisine","review":"This is the first vegetarian cookbook I got when I started living on my own.

I've only made two of the icings so far (chocolate and vanilla buttercreams), but I can't wait to combine some of the many different flavors and try some of the decorating ideas."},{"Title":"Cupcakes Year-Round: 50 Recipes for Every Season and Celebration","review":"\\"Cupcakes Year-Round\\" was a gift to myself, as I love sweets! Who doesn't like cupcakes?!Sara Neumeier is a food writer, food stylist and recipe developer. She works with the Martha Stewart kingdom, and it is evident when you see the gorgeous color photographs of her food styling.The recipes are easy-to-follow. There are cupcake recipe and decorating ideas for each season. Plus, Neumeier helps explains the reason behind baking techniques, such as sifting flour. I feel these tips are magnificent at helping educate the new baker to understand what is going on in the kitchen! Also, the book can be set up as an easel for easier use while cooking! That was a cute idea.I, recently, made her Easter cupcakes for my son and his friends. They loved them.This cookbook is fun, easy and tasty. Her recipes are great for adults and children."},{"Title":"Cupcakes Year-Round: 50 Recipes for Every Season and Celebration","review":"Here's the dealio: this ain't no coffee table book, but if you can get over the format, the recipes rock.Looks like a number of people have expressed some frustration over the top-bound format of the book. I confess that this well-intentioned format (which operates as a stand so you can put the recipe up on the counter as you cook), was also a little frustrating for me. But wait, there's more! Here's what I like about it:Her recipes work perfectly every time. I've now tried several of them and there's no messing up. That's \\"key\\" when you've got obligations outside the kitchen (it just has to work the first time). Moreover -- and this is what's important for a cupcake book -- the batter recipes are all \\"thick\\" batters, which makes them completely scoopable. This saves time, a messy clean-up, and consequently, my nerves when I'm baking.The Swiss meringue buttercream recipe is the most stable and delicious buttercream I've made and it doesn't call for a candy thermometer, which also makes it pretty easy. People literally rave about the frosting when I make it, and I can take it to a Summer picnic or a Winter party and not have to worry about it separating, tasting gritty, or bending to the will of the weather.She also gives little extras that you can choose to add to your cupcakes to make them sophisticated. For instance, she suggests (and gives recipes for) flavored glazes that can be brushed on the cupcakes warm from the oven, and for curds that can be used to fill the cupcakes. I don't waste these on kids, but for adults, wow, it takes them over the top.Her decorating ideas go from very simple to highly stylized, but in all cases, they're completely doable no matter what your skill level. For instance, she has these beautiful little petit fours for which she uses a pourable glaze instead of a frosting. They take only minutes to decorate and they look like they came from a French pastry shop. Another one (I used for my kid's birthday last year) was a cupcake baked in a flat-bottomed ice cream cone and piled with stabilized chantilly cream so they looked like soft-serve cones. Easy and delicious. Even the parents were impressed. There are lots of books with more impressive decorations, but these are all decorations that, when completed, will look like the photograph.I also like her concepts for cupcakes as being a dollop of a good thing. If you think about cupcakes, they're really just a \\"bite\\" of something. Neumeier really gets that, I think. She has cupcakes like PB&J; (where there's a jam filling, and PB frosting, giving you a wonderful taste sensation. I like her linzer cupcakes (where there's a cookie on top of the raspberry jam glazed cupcake), because it's soft and crunchy at once.In short, yeah, I hear all those people who don't like the format, and I did give it only 3 stars because of that. It's really tough to find the recipe you want. But once you find them, they work logistically and taste great."},{"Title":"Cupcakes Year-Round: 50 Recipes for Every Season and Celebration","review":"This book caught my eye and that of my daughter who loves to bake.

The recipes so far have been great, and who ever said the book was worth the price for the one bowl vanilla cupcakes was dead on. Those cupcakes were legendary in my book. I still crave them. However, I have to agree with everybody else about how the book was made. It's nearly impossible to find the recipe you want... I usually have to search thru the book page by page twice to find what Im looking for... luckily it's a slim book. The problem is the whole flipping the book around and reading from back to front for the 2nd part after you've read it front to back on way.... It's habitual for most of us to turn the page and read the back of the page to get the next recipe or get the next set of directions, and here the back side of the page is a different recipe... when you're in the middle of a recipe it can be confusing and disorienting, but like i said, those vanilla cupcakes were worth it."},{"Title":"Cupcakes Year-Round: 50 Recipes for Every Season and Celebration","review":"Because of the many rave reviews for the one-bowl vanilla cupcakes, I bought the book.

Also most recipes are for 24 cupcakes but I ended up with more batter than what the recipes said. And what size cupcakes anyway?? Regular, large, Xlarge??

Thought the information was good, recipes look good - both for the cakes and for the icings. HATE the easel format. It isn't a book, its a little flip-chart on a shakey easel with weird flaps and folds. Might be useful if you want to sit the book up on a counter and look at it while cooking but it really detracts from when you just want to sit and read it. It has a lot of text not associated with a specific recipe so you'd really want to just read it - the pages are head to head so you can't even read one page and then the next.

You learn digital logic design *AND* have fun, too!The added bonus is the included software. The book comes with Xilinx Student Edition 2.1i, which you can use to draw schematics and simulate them. So you can apply what you read in the book. More advanced users can use the Verilog/VHDL synthesis tools (no simulation, htough) to practice FPGA design (which is beyond the scope of this book.)

The two copies of the book seem to be very similar, the advantage of this one is the Price, of course. :) This book is full of examples, but it would help if there were more exercises in the book, I like Herbert Taub's book regarding good exercises.

I am thoroughly impressed! The material is very concise, accurate, and applicable, and also sheds light on the historical aspects of the development of Logic Families. The necessary equations to apply the material to real-world applications are presented and explained in detail, and are easy to find in the text.The book/author has a website that is quite useful. Not being a student, I wrote to the author to gain access to the \\"worked problems\\" for the version of the book I have, and he was very congenial and helpful, providing me with the password and login info necessary to obtain copies of them.The only drawback was that the software that came with the book (3rd edition) is for a Windows 95 Platform. I am currently in the process of re-building a machine with the Windows 95 OS, as the books software is no longer available, nor is it upgradeable. The other option is to purchase the 4th edition with newer software (which I am contemplating), but be careful to verify the compatibility with your specific machine's OS before doing so. (One could always go back to the tedious \\"old-school\\" method of \\"graphing out the timing\\", but it is neat if you can do it both ways, and also provides a \\"check\\" of your work. The adventure is the best part of the task, yes?!?)All in all, it is an excellent reference/tutorial book for anyone just learning about Digital Design, as well as an excellent refresher for those like me who have not done any digital designing for several years. The book brought me back up to speed with just two weeks of earnest effort. It also plowed new ground on more up-to-date advances in the field, as well.I am pleased to have this book in my library."},{"Title":"Digital Design: Principles and Practices and Xilinx 4.2i Student Package (3rd Edition)","review":"As a computer science student I had no background in this material what so ever and I must say I passed the class and still know nothing of it.

Furthermore, it seems that the author has a sick desire to tell everyone how smart he is by taking a simple subject and making it as hard as possible. There is no intention of teaching the subject and its only purpose is to tell you that it exists. With the exception of a few good tables/examples, much of the writing and diagrams are crammed in an endless, sloppy soup of paragraphs and over inflated jargon. Concepts are NOT taught in a structured, simplistic, thorough, or systematic approach, so using this book as a quick reference would be difficult as well. Problem examples are few and are buried within the text. I did NOT find any humor in the pages but did find the material to be as exciting as watching paint dry. Concept instruction, which seems simple at first, quickly degenerates to the point that the rest of the chapter no longer makes any sense. Freshman students in Computer Science, who are forced to use this book by their university, will find it difficult to comprehend to the point of becoming discouraged and thinking this major is not for them. I highly recommend finding a supplement to this book and purchasing a used copy if its use is mandatory."},{"Title":"Digital Design: Principles and Practices and Xilinx 4.2i Student Package (3rd Edition)","review":"Reading through the reviews that are available as I'm composing this post, I note that all of the foreign readers give it 5 stars, and all the bad reviews come from America.

You actually get a chance to learn something useful, like binary arythmetic and switching algebra, as well as how to build some basic circuits (although I often had to search the web for the additional explanation). After that, however, the material becomes so complex and confusing, that after reading it I usually was like &quot;Uh, what did he just talk about?&quot; All in all, I think that the ECE class was a waste of time and I wander why we had to take it in the first place."},{"Title":"Digital Design: Principles and Practices and Xilinx 4.2i Student Package (3rd Edition)","review":"This book skips from topic to topic and the author's CORNY jokes interupt difficult parts of the book.

I actually learned something though, but this was only because my instructor was an EE guy who could filter out the low-level stuff, so that it was only logic left(which actually makes sense to me). I didn't try the software, but most people are using Electronics Workbench anyway, thus making the included software a very nice frisbee. I should know; mine is sitting on the top of the business building right now.

I had this text as a student and have found it to be helpful in understanding Logic Design. I agree that the jokes were CORNY. However, the depth of material provided by Mr. Wakerly are excellent. Not many text discuss and provide timing diagrams and how such diagrams relate to the device. The concept of timing analysis and diagrams are far more important than the design methodology, besides Wakerly also does highlight the design process better than other text I have read. The only problem is that he does not state whether it is an example or not. I have used this text in class and at work, and I have found it a VALUABLE REFERENCE MATERIAL. I have used it several times as reference in CPLD and Logic Design.If you believe any negative comments, I suggest that you try borrowing the second edition and skim through it...I WAS WORTH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT.

We all cursed him for teaching us transistors and CMOS logic, but it was well worth it, and I'm happy Wakerly has included it in this book. All you have to do is read every word in Chapter 3, and you'll have a great idea.The scope of this book is excellent. Taking you from Binary numbers to RAM in one book is quite an achievement and it just flows. Also a good source to pick up VHDL.

This book shows it is possible. It covers all that is necessary to master the digital design and contains answers to many questions that are usually not discussed in other similar books - e.g. why a latch and not a flipflop is used to store address in a microcomputer, and a lot of others. The ABEL and VHDL languages that are explained here help the reader to keep up with the modern design tools. Many examples illustrate the theoretical exposition that is (up to several minor exceptions) clear and comprehensible. I think it is the best book I have ever read in this field.Inspite of some reviewers' opinion, I have read the 4th edition again with great pleasure, the comment boxes first. Previously, I tried several books to learn Verilog because I felt it as a gap in my knowledge of HDLs - ABEL and VHDL am I using already for years. Wakerly's book is the first that, after reading it for a day or two, gave me feeling that I am able to write descriptions in Verilog nearly as well as in VHDL.Of course, some objections can be made, no such book would avoid them - for example, a more up-to-date FPGA type could be chosen as representative for explanation of its principles, and the details of CLB interconnect are not just the most important information for a FPGA novice. When I made my first steps in this field, I gave a lot of time to this subject but without practical implications. Nevertheless, similar objections can only be raised to a minor part of the book. I am convinced that the clear, straightforward and many times enjoyable style of this book will more than compensate the reader. If it would be possible, I would give it four and half star, but, to avoid metastability, I prefer rather five than four."},{"Title":"Digital Design: Principles and Practices and Xilinx 4.2i Student Package (3rd Edition)","review":"Excellent introductory text!!!

I find it to be an invaluable refrence"},{"Title":"Digital Design: Principles and Practices and Xilinx 4.2i Student Package (3rd Edition)","review":"First and foremost, this book is definitely not a good introductory course book. It is a reference book because of how it covers the conceptual material.This book provides an extreme amount of detail in the many aspects of the field. If you have basic knowledge of circuitry, you should be fine in understanding this book. If you do not have any experience at all, however, this book will be difficult to manage.On the positive side, as a reference, this book is superior. The book starts with introductory concepts such as working with number systems and how to perform arithmetic (simple and complex) in binary. I was confused by the placement of Chapter 3. Immediately following number systems, the author jumps to electrical behavior and layout of transistors to comprise CMOS logic. While a necessary topic, I felt that it could have been delayed to a future chapter.Afterward, standard topics are covered amidst advanced topics. I felt it would have been easier for the reader to master the simple, ideal designs before having to worry about timing characteristics and other non-ideal concepts.The book discusses simple logic gates all the way through sequential logic design, which is a nice touch. It is good to have all of the material in this book in one place and definitely recommend the book to anyone in logic design. While not the most advanced book, its wide array of topics and coverage will help to fill in the gaps that other books create."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"Loved Loved Loved it!

But her gorgeous best friend Greg tells her he's in love with her, and she decides to give it a shot. The conflict is whether or not Amber will be able to overcome her fears based on a less-than-perfect childhood and fall in love.For fans of the Bridget-Jonesian, neurotic-English-girl style of novel, this will be a fun read, although it isn't as funny as many of its comrades in that genre. Amber is a self-aware, rational heroine (except about men), which makes for a more meaty read.I did enjoy the way Amber compares everyone to chocolate (the ultimate insult appears to be calling someone \\"toffee\\")- Jen, her best friend, is high-quality white chocolate; Greg is compared to all manner of sweets. It will make you want to go out and buy See's or Cadbury's. Its also interesting that despite the chocolate obsession and some vague acknowledgement of a curvy figure, Amber is not hung-up on her weight. A refreshing change."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"Dorothy Koomson is a wonderful character writer, and humourous to boot. In Chocolate Run she introduces you to Amber Salpone, and Greg Walterson (named after Gregory Peck), now it's your typical plot. Girl meets boy, girl knows boy is a man .... and he so is, and for three years life is good. Greg after all is the best friend of her best friends man, so what if one night she and Greg get to taste each other's sweets.It's not going anywhere after all...she's seen him flirt, and how's that going to change. Well Koomson has Greg give it his all for a real relationship the man parted with his 'black book', the scene was hilarious, you could almost hear Greg's heart palpitating at the enorminty of the moment.Life is like a box of chocolates (Forrest Gump), you never know quite what you're getting, and the story takes off. A one night stand leads to relationship entangled in friendships, and secrets which will be revealed. The heart of the book was Greg, the bloke did stupid, but I found I could'nt stay mad at him because he was just a man....and the petals on the bed, well that melted my heart. I'll give this book five stars for plotting, romance and angst, and how real you felt the character of Amber was as she muddled through with chocolate, her past family relations which impacted her present in so many ways, as did the Greg's past. Now was I satisfied after the read, well it definitely was a chocolate marshmellow treat with a few added nuts of angst, what's not to enjoy. Totally did."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"Where to begin? I have all of Koomson's books except for The Cupid Effect (waiting for the price to drop). Everyday I monitored Amazon hoping and praying that someone would put TCR up at a cheaper price. Oh happy day! I got an import for $1.87! Yay me. Everyday I checked my mailbox and then suddenly...it was there. Wrapper torn off...a gift for me!I loved My Best Friend's Girl. Loved it. Marshmallows for Breakfast...I'll give it a 3 and a half. Not enough love. But this book took the cake...or chocolate so to speak.The characters were completely realistic. We have our main character film enthusiast Amber who runs from commitment because she is terrified of being left. Her bestfriend Jen who is yearning for commitment from her borefriend Matt. Then there's Matt's bestfriend, Amber's second bestfriend the delectable Greg. Greg is a playboy who sleeps with random women and never looks back. Then he and Amber share a moment. And suddenly all he really wants is for Amber to take his intentions seriously.The main plot revolves around Amber and Greg (fine by me) with supporting roles going to Jen and Matt. This is a story I think everyone can relate to--parts at least. While Amber is trying to figure out if Greg is the real deal, she has to face the fact that she and Jen are drifting apart. A huge secret looms between the two girls. The reader finds out pretty early in the book but I won't ruin it for you.The only downfall--there were way too many references to chocolate. Way too many. Cannot stress that enough. Koomson saw parallels with chocolate and people that I would never have thought of. Hard and brittle like toffee? WTF! Very random.Overall though, I still give it 5 stars because at the end of the day it's a realistic romance that reminds ppl that while the past is forged in stone...the future is still up for debate.Next book please, Ms. Koomson!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"I really liked this book. I found it fun and funny. Amber Salpone is a complex character, though Greg is more so, in my opinion. There were some twists I didn't see coming, and except for a few words more familiar to British people (owt and nowt,)a very good read. Well written first person fun."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"As usual another wonderful book by Dorothy Koomson. This one different from the others. I really cared about the main character and what happened to her and her family. A real page turner which I didn't want to end."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"Found this a good book overall, had a great depth to the main characters. Once I started reading I wanted to keep going but could not give it 5 stars as it was slightly frustrating and a tad boring in parts"},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"Compared to other books, The chocolate run isn't bad. Compared to other books by Dorothy Koomson, it just doesn't stand a chance.Having read all but one of her books (Marshmallows for breakfast), this one is my least favorite. It has been a while since I read it and it's not very memorable. If I'd read this one first I don't think I would have been so disappointed but unfortunately I did n't start with this one."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"I admit I read the ending first.After my last Dorothy Koomson bookGoodnight, Beautiful, I really wanted to read more work by the author but I did not think I could handle another emotional ringer like that book was. So I deliberately looked to find something that was much lighter. With this book I can see why she is classified as a chick-lit writer because this is pure chick-lit.Amber has been best friend with Jen for just about ever. So when Jen invites Amber to meet the new man in her life Amber goes for dinner determined to like this guy. Jen's new guy Matt brings along his best friend Greg as well, wanting him to get to know Jen. When Amber first sees Greg she is struck by 1)how incredibly beautiful is and 2)how much he knows it. Although Amber doesn't take to Matt very well, she and Greg strike up a great friendship. It is an immediate friendship that deepens as if it has been going on for years. It is the type of friendship where one would call the other to bail them out of jail -- a very funny bit in the story that had me smiling out loud.The two manage to tumble into bed together. This is fraught with problems as Amber has serious issues with commitment -- she thinks everyone will leave eventually. And Greg is a slut. He is good-natured, fun and beautiful and a sex magnet. But Greg is determined to change his ways for Amber. She desperately wants him but doesn't trust him. Is she right? Will he revert back to his old ways? Can she believe all the things, all the right things, he's telling her.I got a real kick out of this book. I think I loved the fact that Greg was so completely flawed. He could have easily come off as a jerk but somehow the author managed to make him charming. Amber has major issues and I think she sabotaged her relationship a bit with him. I totally got why she had trust problems with him in particular but it will turn into almost a self fulfilling prophecy to constantly ask your boyfriend when he's going to cheat on you. I do have to give the writer credit though that even given Greg's colorful past i never felt that he would betray Amber. It was just the vibe and the way he was written.Friendship is a major theme in this book. Jen and Amber's friendship is a central aspect and plays a huge part in the unfolding of Amber's relationship with Greg. But there is also Greg and Matt's friendship as well as Amber and Greg's friendship. These four are all negotiating a maze of interconnectedness that both reveals and conceals. The comfort and necessity of friendship is explored as well as the darker aspects of the bond -- how far people will go to keep secrets and how too much dependency can be destructive.All in all a very good read. I am not a chick lit person, per se but I do enjoy this writer."},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK! It's the first book I've ready by Dorothy Koomson, and I can tell you it will not be my last! This book is going on my keeper shelf.This book starts off with a bang and then doesn't let you go. I don't want to give too much away but it has one of my favorite premises, which is friends becoming lovers, but Ms.Koomson does it such a way that it's fresh. She also does an amazing job with the characters. Both Amber and Greg have their issues, but it's those issues that have kept them from settling down with any one. And each has reacted differently. Amber has decided she will never marry and to stay single, while Greg has turned into a man-slut, for the lack of a better word. (Sorry if that words offends anyone!) So you've got an unlikely couple, add their respective best friends Jen and Matt, who have been involved with each other for three years, and you've got a very juicy story.I'd recommend picking this book up when you've got free time, because once you start, it's extremely hard to put it down. You'll want to know what's happening next. I'm off to see what other Dorothy Koomson books I can read next!"},{"Title":"Chocolate Run","review":"I have read this book in its entirety at least 10 times in the year since I've owned it. I love almost everything about it. I loved the humor, I loved the progress and build of the story, I LOVED the characters and I love the writing. This was my first experience with Chick-Lit, but it's got me wanting to read more. Great job!"},{"Title":"John Graham,: Convict, 1824;","review":"When read alongside &quot;Mrs Fraser on the Fatal Shore,&quot; numerous contradictions are noticeable. For instance, this book claims that Eliza Fraser was &quot;raised in Scotland.&quot; However, other sources have said she was originally from Ceylon.The first half is fabricated to fill in the undocumented details of how Graham came to be in Brisbane, Australia. The second half is basically a transcript of Fraser's report upon rescuing Eliza and the rest of the shipwrecked crew. The second half made it worth purchasing this book used.For a more thorough, balanced account, read &quot;Mrs. Fraser on the Fatal Shore.&quot;"},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"If you're new to computer graphics and really want to gain a strong foothold and understanding about most of the subjects in the field, then I can't think of a better book to start with.Professor Hill really does a fine job of explaining the concepts and theory behind all of the subjects he delves into.Most of the text deals with your typical computer graphics material- transformations, modeling, texturing, hidden surface removal, etc.-- but the explanations and examples are very, very well done, and not &quot;dumbed down&quot; in the least. Anyone who's tried to learn computer graphics with, say, Foley and Van Dam's book will be pleasantly surprised by the comparison.I should also mention that the book has a fairly comprehensive chapter on ray tracing that will give anyone new to the subject an excellent understanding of what it's all about.My only complaint concerns the fairly large number of &quot;practice exercises&quot; at the end of each section. Not that there's anything wrong with testing your knowledge of course, but the sheer number and frequency of these things start to hurt the flow of the book and it's readability. Just a personal observation on my part.If you don't know very much math, or have forgotten most of it, don't feel too concerned-- along with the graphics discussions there's a solid tutorial on all of the linear algebra needed to get you on your way.All this, plus the examples in the text use OpenGL-- can it get much better?"},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This is one of the better books on computer graphics theory I have so far come across, but please be aware: there are many holes in this hefty and pricy book.Francis Hill has provided a very thorough book on computer graphics with numerous topics that will appeal to many readers. It is one of the only books to really cover ray-tracing to the detail that I like. While the book title implies the use of Open GL as one of the main concepts, this is misleading. The vast majority of all of the programming is simply in C++ which just uses Open GL to paint the screen. If you are looking to learn Open GL, pick yourself up the Red Book (OpenGL Programming Guide) or look on SGI's web site for all of the text free online.While the text has a very broad scope, it is entirely lacking the organization, completeness, or concistancy to even approch an acceptable text on any computer subject, let alone a very complex one. Computer Graphics Using Open GL is riddled with errors. There are a great deal of typos in the code provided, and some code is just plain wrong. To add to the confusion, the small subsection of code that is available on the companion web site doesn't even match the code in the book; it is a single file with all kinds of code concatentated together, which itself won't compile.Hill has also provided with his book one of the most frustrating things I have come across in ANY computer book I have read: half of the code is marked with such helpful comments like \\"To be implemented\\" or \\"students do here\\". The book is FULL of functions and variables that come out of nowhere or are never defined. As a result, you are left to fend for yourself, and are trying to piece together Hill's code into something that will compile. The pieces of code are presented as excercises, but you are never told how to actually do the things asked of you. Never, ever have I seen a book that basically says \\"Figure it out for yourself\\" and moves on. Additionally, Hill just loves to use one set of variables for a general example, and then a whole different set for the code (or pseudocode; it's often intermixed)Basically, it's as if Hill had written a skeleton guide to graphics programming, and midway through fleshing it out, he simply stopped. The rest is up to you to figure out.I elected to mention all of that because I want anyone who is considering the purchase of this book to know what is expected of them. This book has a very steep learning curve at points, and unless you are willing to put in a the effort, you will lose track of what's going on - Hill's text won't fill in for you. All of that said, you will be hard pressed to find a more complete book on graphics that even gives you a code-based presentation. The text, where complete, is very well written, and give you a number of things to consider while reading the material.Three Stars."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a really good book. One of the other reviewers had given it a poor review because s/he felt that the book was misleading in that it was more about computer graphics than OpenGL. This is very true, but the title of the book is &quot;Computer Graphics using OpenGL.&quot; That means that it claims to teach you the subject of computer graphics using OpenGL as its main tool. But, if that title does mislead you, be forewarned that there are much better books at teaching you the OpenGL API.This book, in my opinion, does a great job covering all the standard topics of computer graphics and leaves you ready to tackle some of the more advanced texts on the subject. I also really appreciated the gentle approach to the mathematics involved. The author has a good appedix to help you brush up on any math-related topics you may be rusty on. Overall, this is a great book and comes highly recommended as a means to start into the field of computer graphics."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"Like most of the books I buy online, this one was also for a class I'm currently taking. The instructor for this class is fresh out of the box and this is his first semester and class ever. Needless to say, any learning I have to do in this class is taught to me by reading the book. It is more of a teaching book than a techincal reference book, but the good news is, they offer a free online techincal reference book. The best of both worlds. If you're starting off in graphics like me, this is a great investment...."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"If your a student or teacher of computer graphics this a great book to use. I've been teaching opengl (WSU Virtual Worlds on the Web) for six years and find the vast variety of ideas and problems to solve very interesting. The author explanations are clear and easy to transfer to students. Student response to the book seems to be very positive. I also recommend purchasing the Opengl Superbible 2nd edition as a reference book (the code samples are great). My only suggestion is to provide a CD with a cross sections of opengl code samples to be used with the book. But, bottom line this book rules."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"I bought this book then jumped to the last chapter. With its help, I wrote a fairly decent ray tracer in under two weeks (which is no small feat considering I'm a full time mom of a two year old!). Of course, OpenGL is not used much for a ray tracer. As a result, I did not use the book for OpenGL purposes but rather for its logic and instruction. The code design is object oriented and very clear and easy to understand. The book uses GLUT which is platform independent. However, I transformed the concept to Windows with no problem (I do have prior knowledge of the system though)."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This is an excellent book. I was coming from a novice OpenGL user and wanted to branch out from OpenGL, to understand more impressive CG techqniques. He uses OpenGL, but it's the underlying techniques that make this book impressive. He goes beyond the API and delves into a number of interesting areas. Good overall introduction, with a fair amount of code examples and discussion of how to modifiy what he gives you. Not perfect, I would have liked another chapter about radiosity, or more ray tracing, but really excellent."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This was my first book on computer graphics. It is extremely detailed - the chapters on modelling, rendering and ray tracing have a huge wealth of information. It wont teach you OpenGL but will do enough to get you going with the it's API. A lot of math is invloved and you must be prepared to hand solve a lot of equations to understand them. Also your coding has to be top notch to implement the more challenging topics - know your programming and know it very well to get the most out of this bookP.S. There is a mistake in the refraction equation at one place in the ray tracing chapters - drove me absolutely nuts for a while. Otherwise this should be your first book on graphics."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"For many programmers, the jump into full-blown graphics programming is always a great pain. Starting into 3D programming is even worse. Thankfully, for those who are in school there is this text. While not entirely complete on the workings of OpenGL, Hill's text thoroughly covers implementation as well as theory for students of computer graphics. This text provides an excellent introduction to those who have never done any graphical programming, allowing them to have an extremely solid base from which to continue their graphics programming.With that having been said, I give this five stars for its utilization in the classroom. Hill often blends programming assignments and explainations seemlessly, teaching the student concepts more thoroughly through experience. This, however, raises the problem for individuals who are either studying independently and have no experienced OpenGL programmers to whom they can turn. For them, this text can still be a great asset but may leave them &quot;high and dry&quot;, so to say, if they have problems with some concepts which are solidified in Hill's often difficult assignments. For these individuals, I give this text three stars. Since there are many independent studying individuals out there, I have averaged the two ratings together to get four stars."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"I am not through this book yet, and no it is not an openGL manual... nor did I notice it claimed to be. It is a useful, fun book for learning how to do grahpics programming...What parts I have done so far have made me feel pretty good about my purchase, I never get so stuck I can't code my way to some solution. In addition, the book leads you on to better ways to do things starting from simpler, brute force stuff.Then there's the bits of math review and exercises... useful but not overwhelming so far.For me the parts about self-affine curves and golden ratios were things I skipped or skimmed.... but they can be useful I am sure.Better than many out there."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This book contains a good description of OpenGL primitives and it is a good theoretical introduction to Computer Graphics. Unfortunately, it is NOT suitable as a programming guide. The author's examples use a canvas guide, which poses additional difficulties to the beginner. The theory behind OpenGL is presented quite thoroughly, however."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a great book for getting to grips with programming 3Dgraphics.My one major complaint is the source code contained in thebook is supposed to be on the website mentioned in the book..., butthe source code on that site is only a tiny fraction of what'sactually in the book. Which can lead to a lot of monotonous typingfrom the book. Also, I know the book is geared towards collegecourses, but for the hobbyist (like me), answers to the excercises andcompleted case studies would be very instructive.-p"},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"There are a few caveats to anyone who is interested in programming in graphics: it's pretty difficult and it's based entirely in mathematics; you need to know a few things about physics, not just computers; and you need to be prepared to spend a lot of time learning.I have used this book for two courses. It was a required textbook for my introductory graphics course in which I built a ray tracer. To the best of my knowledge, the book's coverage of ray tracing is substantial and excellent. I also found myself using this book as a reference for a geometric modeling course; the coverage on different curves and surfaces is rather short, but what's there is superb. The explanations provided include discussion on the mathematics, which is a great boon for anyone who's actually trying to understand what's going on under the covers.From what I have read, this is not a great book for OpenGL programming. (I attempted to learn a bit of OpenGL from this book.) It should be noted, however, that the title is \\"Computer Graphics using OpenGL,\\" not \\"Learning how to use the OpenGL API.\\" There's a pretty substantial difference. Hill's concentration is definitely on computer graphics, not on OpenGL.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in learning about computer graphics from an implementation-oriented perspective."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"I just recently bought this book and I've been blown away with it's quality. I feel excited when I start to read it because the topics are covered interestingly and thoroughly.Anyone looking for an OpenGL manual is not looking in the right place. It does cover OpenGL some, but I would recommend getting the OpenGL programming guide as a supplement to this book. Absolutely nothing beats the red book as an OpenGL learning guide.Anyway, back to this book... What I'm so excited for is that it teaches you how to do all the things that OpenGL does for you... Want to learn how to do back-face culling? How about building a camera system? Maybe you want to build some model classes? It's all in here (in some form). The book helps you build an entire library of usefull classes as you read through it.As a note, another reviewer mentioned that the gigantic amount of exercises hurt the flow of the book. I have to agree somewhat. If the exercises were all clumped together at the end of the chapters it may be easier to read, but just barely. The exercises (over 400) are definitely not memorization or regurgitation either. Many of them are &quot;level 3&quot; difficulty (supposed to take a couple weeks to complete).All in all, a great book and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This was used in my introductory course in 3D graphics for undergrad Computer Science. The author demonstrates his expertise in the subject by his thorough coverage of the material, as well the lucidity of the content within the book itself. What truly amazed me is how well he explained the Linear Algebra concepts (albeit basic) to those who have never taken Linear algebra. After reading a good portion of the book, I hav come to a few conclusions: the book does not focus on the OpenGL API simply because one must first understand the underlying math behind the API, I've noticed that having a good grasp of the mathematics helps w/ the construction of 3D applications regardless of what API you are using (there may be some slight retraining, but nonetheless, the math is the same).The book merely uses OpenGL to demonstrate the concepts, but it is not meant to serve as an OpenGL tutorial - there are plenty of other tutorials out there, some are free, go read those instead. However, if you want to understand the mathematics behind the 3D components, then this is the book to read.So now, why 4 stars if the book seems perfect? I would have given it a 5, but the exercises are too long, Chapter 6 contains an inordinate amount of exercises, some take over 20 minutes to finish (for one problem). Because the book doesn't focus too much on OpenGL, you'll find yourself reading another book for OpenGL itself. So if you're doing exercises in Chapter 5, and some later Chapters (7 and up), you'll find yourself hard pressed for an OpenGL reference.Anyhow, the book is noteworthy and will make it to my library. I forgot to mention that as you read each chapter, the author stops and asks in parentheses (why?) to a certain topic. Again, it helped reinforce a lot of the concepts from prior chapters into my brain. This book is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Computer Graphics Using Open GL (2nd Edition)","review":"This is a good textbook for computer graphics, all the theory are well described.

It was a shocker. I was living this book &quot;in the flesh&quot; even as I read it. Originally titled, &quot;Sarkhan&quot; it could easily have been Viet Nam, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, or Burma. While I wasn't a major player I experienced much of what was written by Msrs. Lederer and Burdick. I was stationed in northern Thailand, had a Hong Kong Passport, and spent many days aloft with Air America (CIA) flying to train Laotian and Cambodian troops on repair and maintenance of T-28 aircraft armament systems. I only wore a uniform while on base. This book seemed to have vanished from the bookshelves for many years (actually the U. S. Government had it removed.) First printed as &quot;Sarkhan&quot; in the fall of 1965, it didn't show up again until it was reprinted as &quot;The Deceptive American&quot; in 1977. I didn't run across a copy until December of 1998 in the Rockford, IL Public Library. Of and on I searched for &quot;Sarkhan&quot; for more than 30 years. For anyone who is a student of the Viet Nam series of conflicts this book summarizes the deception of the American public that took place under both the Johnson and Nixon Administrations. While still a novel, it would fall awfully close to &quot;fact&quot; if a few of the names were changed. I enjoyed it the first time I read it and my suspicions (concerning our Government pulling it off the shelves in the interest of security) were confirmed in the Preface of the 1977 version. Thank you Mr.Lederer."},{"Title":"The Deceptive American","review":"Unfortunately, the main and multiple plot lines of this book remain almost as applicable today as they did when the book was published in 1965. Sarkhan is a small and very peaceful kingdom in Southeast Asia, while the country is not wealthy; the people are doing reasonably well, as they have for generations. Unfortunately, Sarkhan is being placed in the middle of the global struggle between the expansion of Communism and the free world led by the United States. A small group of brutal Communist insurgents have just started their attempts to destabilize the nation and the United States is concerned.It is also a time of transition for Sarkhan, the current and popular King Diad is about to abdicate in the traditional manner and his equally popular son Prince Lin will succeed him. Both are neutralists in the global struggle, seeking only to further the ends of their nation and keep it peaceful.Two Americans, a businessman named Coldstream and a Professor named McAuley have lived in the country for a long time and understand it well. Both are veterans of the U. S. military and speak the local languages, even to the point of being able to use the regional dialects. McAuley is the foremost American scholar on the country, having written books on the history of Sarkhan that have impressed Prince Lin. The American ambassador is a well meaning man, but he is not up to the task of truly understanding what is happening. Hobson, the director of the American intelligence agency, is a ruthless man who sees only Communist threats in a strictly us-versus-them situation. Cogswell is an old hand at the global political game and has the ear and confidence of the President of the United States.The Communist agents in Sarkhan stage a mock invasion of the country by North Vietnamese troops, they manage to keep the Prince in seclusion and in his absence the Sarkhan government requests massive American aid. Even though the American intelligence community knows that the invasion is phony, they welcome the chance to save the nation from Communism. The meeting in the American embassy where Prince Lin, Coldstream and McAuley present their eyewitness accounts of the phony invasion is an amazing and depressing story. Even though high-ranking American military people and Cogswell take their side, nothing can stop the forces in play and in the end, Prince Lin, Coldstream, McAuley and Cogswell are all destroyed.Reading this story in the light of the American invasion of Iraq and the subsequent revelations of deceit, faulty and outright deceptive intelligence, the ultimate outcome and the way the careers of some good people have been destroyed, you see how accurate it is. Although the story is fiction, Lederer and Burdick understand all too well how things can go wrong when people take a ruthless and simplistic us-versus-them mentality when looking at the world."},{"Title":"The Deceptive American","review":"I first read this book under the title of &quot;Sarkhan&quot; as a college student in 1970.

As a political science major I was particularly interested in the steps that drew us into the Vietnam war. I have been frustrated for years about what happened to this book and why it literally disappeared from existence. If you are a history or political science buff this is a must read and if you have not read these authors other book&quot;The Ugly American&quot; I suggest you read it also.

Yes, the Introduction is flashy, and a Master's Class in and of itself, for aspiring writers, but the entirety of the book, chapter by chapter, incident by incident, is a demonstration of what English prose can do well: it entertains as it informs. If one's taste has been corrupted by the Gee Whiz, Buzz-Word and media-clever sound bite slangadellic scribbling that passes for, well, writing nowadays, this simple book may come as a surprise and a heathy cure for bad reading habits (or addictions to trashy faddistic stuff) and may prepare the reader for a new direction in book-buying.

Taking a break from writing fiction, he filled his journal with interesting stories of people he met along the way. I especially marveled at the former monk's recollection of collecting food in his begging bowl and the man who had to marry in a hurry in order to get a job. The beauty of his writing shown through each page; for example: &#34;The coconut trees with their disheveled heads were like old men suddenly risen from sleep.&#34; Written from his heart, the journal felt like a way of getting a look inside Maugham's soul."},{"Title":"The Gentleman in the Parlour: A Record of a Journey from Rangoon to Haiphong,","review":"On the face of it, it seems like a fine concept - one of the best writers in the world writing a travelogue of his journey across South East Asia in the early 20th century. But once I got into it, I was a bit disappointed with what was actually written inside.Somerset Maugham is one of the finest writers I've ever read, \\"Of Human Bondage\\" is honestly one of the best novels I've ever read, more of the most memorable and soul wrenching stories ever set down on paper. His other works have been no less spectacular - \\"The Moon and Sixpence\\" and \\"The Painted Veil\\" are masterpieces both. That said, I've read a few books by Maugham that have been less than satisfying - I couldn't finish \\"The Razor's Edge\\" or \\"The Magician\\" while \\"Up at the Villa\\" and \\"Cakes and Ale\\" were both quite dull reads. Every so often though I see his name and remember how \\"Of Human Bondage\\" kept me going through an enormously long journey in Japan a few years ago and decide to try him again.\\"The Gentleman in the Parlour\\" is very descriptive, going into detail on the buildings and surroundings, the clothes the people wear, the food they eat, the weather - if this is your thing then you'll enjoy the heck of out this book. For me, description is probably the thing I least enjoy about reading. I simply don't care what people wear or how someone describes a sunset, and frankly it reads like a dull travel program minus the visuals.Strangely, the parts where Maugham digresses and talks about the books he's reading are the most interesting and reminded me of the essays that form his book \\"The Vagrant Mood\\". There are a couple of personal stories from the people Maugham met on the road which I'm sure were once scandalous and racy but sadly in the light of the 21st century merely pale into dreariness.That said, I did finish the book instead of setting it aside with a sigh. It's immensely readable and Maugham's style in this book is very chatty and amiable. It feels like you're being told a story by a human version of Carroll's Cheshire Cat. But overall I would rate it quite low in this writer's list of great works and would instead implore the curious reader to pick up his more accomplished and beautiful books \\"Of Human Bondage\\" and \\"The Painted Veil\\", the latter of which is set in South East Asia and is a far more entertaining book."},{"Title":"A Guide to Field Guides: Identifying the Natural History of North America (Reference Sources in Science and Technology)","review":"Delivery service was good.

One would think that this genre was over done and that nothing new or better could done with this theme--and you would be wrong! J. T. McDaniel has a great tale to tell through a fictional sub and its crew in his novel called \\"Bacalao.\\" This one will eventually join the ranks of old naval classic submarine stories like \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and a very short list of others that are considered classic war stories.McDaniel has captured the emotions of the sub crews and what seems to me, as a technically accurate portrayal of what these subs were really like. He paints with his words visual images that are mixed into real historic back drops of time and place to create a feeling that this all could have happened. I believed in the story line and the people and the sub itself.The writing is brilliant and the reader will have little trouble following the plot. The book takes you from the construction of the submarine in Connecticut, through Pearl Harbor and onto patrol in the Pacific. The author allows the story to unfold from the view point of Laurence Miller who rose from junior officer to the commanding officer of the Bacalao. This works very well for telling this story.The book is a good read and will keep you interested from the first couple of pages to the ending. It is given the MWSA TOP RATING - FIVE STARS!2005 Distinguished Honor Award from the MWSA!"},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"Bacalao may just be the best World War II submarine novel published in the last 30 years. It is certainly the most technically accurate. From diving procedures, to torpedo firing, to the way orders are given and executed, everything is done right.The technical stuff will certainly please the submariners. But what about the other readers, who may not know a TDC from a growler phone and just want interesting characters and realistic situations? You get those, too. The main character, Lawrence Miller, is introduced as a retired admiral arriving at a reunion, but by the third page he's back in 1940 as a young lieutenant watching his new boat being built in Connecticut.A lot of characters are introduced in the first chapter. There is Morgan, a year older than Miller, and a born engineer. And Kenneth Ohara, an electrician's mate who will become a key character. Carl Hammersmith, U.S.S. Bacalao's prospective commanding officer, appears briefly, but is killed in a car wreck before the boat is launched. His replacement, \\"Andy\\" Morley, will command the boat through the end of her first war patrol. Also introduced in this chapter is Fred Ames, the executive officer and Morley's old Academy roommate. Before the story is over Ames, Morgan, and Miller will all find themselves in command of Bacalao.With Bacalao completed and in commission, she is sent to Pearl Harbor, where she is tied up at the Sub Base during the Japanese attack. The boat is immediately sent on her first war patrol, after being rearmed with new, top secret magnetic fuses for her torpedoes. An attack on a Japanese troop convoy, ruined by defective torpedoes, is followed by heavy depth charging. During the course of that battle Morley wins a Navy Cross, and Ames a Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Ohara, risking his life in a flooded motor room, literally saves the boat and everyone aboard, also getting a DSM.A lot more action follows. In the midst of all this, Miller meets his future wife, an Australian Navy officer called Sarah. When Morgan unexpectedly gets command of Bacalao, Miller becomes his XO, later leaving for his own command, an ancient S-boat in Alaskan waters. When he returns, a year later, to take over Bacalao, he is able to marry his Sarah during an overhaul in San Francisco before returning to the war.Bacalao has just about everything you could want in a sub story. The characters are believable, with even the minor players fully fleshed out. The technical details are right on, and there's plenty of action to keep the story moving. I read a lot of sub books, mostly non-fiction, but I read my share of novels, too. This is one that sets the standard others will have to meet."},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"In a word, this book is brilliant. Join the crew of USS Bacalao for adventure on the high seas. J. T. McDaniel takes us from the builder's yard in Connecticut to white hot combat in the Pacific Theater. McDaniel's writing has the human understanding of Edward L. Beach, and the technical precision of Tom Clancy. Don't miss this one. If you're a fan of naval combat novels, this is as good as it gets.Jeff Edwards, Author of \\"Torpedo: A Surface Warfare Thriller\\""},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"This is the story of an American submarine, the USS Bacalao, taking part in the WW2 Pacific war theater. We follow the birth of the boat and - but, we don't want to give away the spectacular ending. If you're a submarine fan, you'll enjoy it to your heart's content.J. T. McDaniel has proven himself with his second submarine novel, after \\"With Honor In Battle\\". There are not that much novels about American submarines fighting in the Pacific, and anyway not describing in full detail how a boat is conceived and how life aboard develops, from the maiden trip to its exploits against the Japanese empire. McDaniel is not a former submarine sailor; he spent his tour of duty with the 101th Airborne, which is totally the wrong experience to tell about submarines. But he does it like he has been a commander all the way, and perhaps he has been in a former life.You will experience love, war and death as it happened and along the way you'll enjoy places like Hawaii, Australia and the northern hemisphere. You'll be part of the Pearl Harbor attack as well, so climb on the Bacalao and read that ever exciting book. And if you're lost with the technical stuff, at the end you'll find a nice glossary!"},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"Bacalao is the name of a fictional Gato class submarine. McDaniel brings us inside the sub. He gives look at what it must have been like to fight the war against the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the frustrations encountered.This is a very credible read about a war that is fading into history for many these days."},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"Mr. McDaniel may not have served aboard an active-duty fleet boat but you certainly can't tell it from his book. He knows submarines and when you read \\"Bacalao\\" so will you! He entwines fiction with historical fact in a manner that is very similar to the way W.E.B. Griffin does. You very quickly begin to care about what happens to his characters. A \\"page-turner\\"! As a former Navy man, I'm pretty critical of the \\"technical stuff\\" in books of this nature and Mr. McDaniel has it right. I recommend it highly"},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"The action is a bit long in coming, but it's pretty hot when it does kick in. But even before the shooting starts this story is interesting. The author gives his submarine a human face and he makes us feel the hopes, fears, and pain of the men who crew her. Nicely done! I'll be watching for more by Mr. McDaniel."},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"I wish I could give this very good book five stars, but there were enough flaws that I felt it deserved less than that. My biggest complaint was that about the first third of the book was overly concerned with all the hardware on the sub, much of it poorly explained as to purpose. It also bogs down in endless and often useless abbreviations and somewhat pedantic writing. I get the impression that the author is very proud of his knowledge of subs and wants to impress readers who might have served on WWII subs. Okay, with that out of the way, after the encyclopedic pages, the book suddenly takes off and becomes exciting. The author covers a lot of ground and the sub sees a lot of action. The book enters can't-put-it-down territory and by the end, you know that you haven't wasted your time and have read a very enjoyable war thriller. So, though somewhat flawed, Bacalao is a book I would recommend to others."},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"A great read for fans of WWII Submarine warfare for those who appreciate the extra technical details that give you a sense of being on board."},{"Title":"Bacalao","review":"J.T. McDaniel's Bacalao is not a heart-pounding submarine action story or a fast moving pot boiler; instead, there is a definite \\"feel\\" of authenticity in its story-line. McDaniel respects his characters: they are decent men all, and Navy to the core. (I was surprised that McDaniel himself has never been in the Navy but is a Vietnam veteran aviator. Interestingly, he has his characters rant about the inability of American pilots to tell, or care about, the difference between enemy and friendly subs...). The novel is a deliberately paced old fashion story beginning with the fictional laying of the Bacalao's keel at the Electric Boat Company yard in Groton, Connecticut. After trial runs, a passage through the Panama Canal to Hawaii, the Bacalao enters the Pacific War with the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor. Her war action takes place over twelve patrols. Occasionally, McDaniel is pedantic (especially about sub technical details); and a few of his action scenarios seem familiar. However, these criticisms are minor. I recommend Bacalao as a thoughtful look at the operations of a WW II submarine and her crew, as well as at the Navy itself.The detailing of submarine construction, and of the gradual coming \\"aboard\\" (at nearby New London Sub Base) of the crew during different periods of construction, and of the shake-down cruises, all are told rather leisurely. There is a great amount of technical detail given to the reader. I found his analysis of the magnetic torpedo problems (failures) to be lucid and to the point. He also gives interesting side-commentaries about the America of that period. But the focus is always upon the character of the novel's individual crew members (primarily the officers and chiefs), and upon the culture of naval professionalism. Either you will squirm with impatience (perhaps boredom) or you will enjoy this \\"calm before the storm.\\" Indeed it is this careful building of the story that explains the emotional impact of the novel. Since you will have already identified with the characters, the \\"action\\" descriptions do not have to be at fever pitch to be effective -- it is simply the story of duty, of heroes, of those \\"not up to it,\\" of sailors killed and injured, of torpedoes awry, of ever closer depth charges being dropped, of ships torpedoed and breaking apart, of men in the water...and of men fearing they will not be returning to their loved ones. -J.

McShane, 1981)is repeated in this book. Maybe I didn't do my homework, but I don't recall this fact being mentioned in promotions or reviews. When you're paying (as I did) [price] for a book, it's disappointing to keep coming across previously published letters. Chandler's writing is still great, but I'm sure he'd have something to say about this practice."},{"Title":"The Raymond Chandler Papers: Selected Letters and Non-fiction, 1909-1959","review":"What a fun collection this is! Another book of letters by another famous author I read recently was embarrassingly boring--it never should have been printed. But Chandler's style and pithy observations make this collection a treat. Though a loner and a lush, he maintained cordial relations with his colleagues, and his comments on the passing scene are keen. From acerbic observations on life in southern California, to wry descriptions of his cat's habits, to sometimes generous and sometimes acerbic appraisals of agents, publishers, and fellow writers, his prose is absolutely sparkling.His coverage of Oscars night in the mid-Forties for The Atlantic magazine is a masterpiece of scorn for the glitterati. Around the same time he accurately dismisses the new medium of television's supposed threat to the book industry. People who tune in to watch &quot;fourth-rate club fighters rub noses on the ropes are not losing any time from book reading.&quot; Just as frequently, Chandler comes across as thoughtful and a good friend--not at all Marlowe-ish, though you get the feeling he could be a tough guy if need be.

I believe I would have appreciated Chandler's observations even more had this been the case."},{"Title":"The Raymond Chandler Papers: Selected Letters and Non-fiction, 1909-1959","review":"Raymond Chandler wrote his letters, for the most part, late at night after a day of drinking. The letters provide an insight into the man who created the quintessential fictional PI, Philip Marlowe, and elevated what he called formula writing into a class of literature recognized by his contemporaries as art. The letters range from his laugh-out-loud take on science fiction--\\"Did you ever read what they call science fiction? It's a scream. It's written like this: I checked out K19 on Adabaran III, and stepped out through the crummaliote hatch...\\" to the sadness he experienced when his wife of more than thirty years passed away.

Not just for writers (though anyone who writes will be comforted and instructed).

Written with a pitch-perfect ear for the American vernacular and the grammatical fastidiousness of a man born, bred, and classically educated in England, Selected Letters is an omnium gatherum of blunt, bleakly funny bon mots. On California: \\"There is a touch of the desert about everything in California, and about the minds of the people who live here.\\" \\"We are so rootless here. I've lived half my life in California and made what use of it I could, but I could leave it forever without a pang.\\" On his fan mail: \\"...[A]nother letter I had once from a girl in Seattle who said that she was interested in music and sex, and gave me the impression that, if I was pressed for time, I need not even bother to bring my own pyjamas.\\" On himself: \\"All my best friends I have never seen. To know me in the flesh is to pass on to better things.\\" Written in the dead of night with a Dictaphone and a bottle of gin, Chandler's letters are an inexhaustible fund of insights into the noir aesthetic, the sublime agonies of the writer's life, the American Language (as Mencken called it), and, forever and always, the sunbelt existentialism that shadows the California Dream."},{"Title":"Getting Your Children Sober","review":"Chapters include: Parents are not guilty -- the genetic facts about alcoholism; Suicide, therapy, and other teen issues; Intervention; If your child is also mentally ill; When adult children of alcoholics are also parents of alcoholics; If your spouse AND child are alcoholic; If you are a recovering alcoholic AND your child is addicted; much, much more.Even if you do not have children --- or do not have children who have alcoholism --Toby strongly suggests that you read the book.

So many things happened so quickly in Lisaveta's life that it seemed that she was almost blindsided. As the reader, even, when she landed on the Hacienda, I thought to myself, \\"What just happened here?\\" I had trouble really understanding what made her fall in love with Jaime in the first place. That was never exactly clear to me.I was shocked at how different life was on the Hacienda. I'm sure it seemed to Lisa that she had traveled back in time when she arrived. She did a good job of expressing what it was like to show up and have to learn to function in a completely different culture. Again, the days at the Hacienda felt decidedly surreal.My only real complaint about the book is that it seemed somewhat choppy. The author was prone to tangents and did not really seem that concerned about the organization of her chapters or about a segue between topics. I would occasionally get to the middle of a paragraph and think, \\"What? Why are we talking about this now?\\"I was surprised at how much free reign Lisa had over matters on the Hacienda. Even though she was the Don's (or whatever) wife, I would have expected that she'd really be more of a figurehead and the agricultural decisions left up to the foreman. But she was the one who made many decisions about what was grown and how things were done regardless of the fact that she had absolutely no training in the matters.An interesting memoir about a woman forced to grow up quickly and face (a very foreign and strange) reality. It wasn't my favorite ever, but I don't regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"This is a modern version of the ancient story of blue beard to me. A woman doesn't want to see the obvios signs of danger, and decides she wants to live her fantasy anyway: an handsome and welty man promises the life of queen to Lisa. The thruth is much different from her dream. But there is no escape, and she is forced to act, to become the care-taker instead of been taken care, and this is a tremendous story for any woman of any time. Despite her difficoulties she becomes not just a woman but a sage in dealing with life. I actually know Lisa personally and I can say she is one the most positive and strong person you can meet, and her account is absolutely real. This is what makes the book great, because the author has really lived the experiences of her book."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"This book is very uneven and slightly dispersed. When I started to read it, I found it a bit boring, and thought some of Lisa's narrations were heavy-handed and with a slight touch of drama. The time in England and Italy, where she lived in a sort of fantasy land with her husband and friends, and the first couple of years in the hacienda seemed especially so. One example of that is when her husband's cousin tells her that she needs to push her authority in order to get results, and pretty much blackmails her into doing so. Another example is her furtive trip into Los Pollos de Eladio. Both scenes, as described in the book, look staged, almost out of a soap-opera. She also used a very self-deprecating tone when describing herself in those early days, and in the distance that time brings, I wonder why she has not been able to forgive herself somehow. After all, she was so young, how could she know what she was doing?Midway through, the book started to take shape and develop into a very focused memoir. I think the break point was the episode with the green boy. After that, the flow changed and I found myself flipping pages anxiously, rushing to learn more and more. I was very taken by the letters to her mother interspersed here and there. They give the whole book a human and tender touch. I was less impressed by her poems, though. Some of her Spanish might have rusted out, or her translations lost some accuracy, like La Noche Buena (it is not Christmas, it is Christmas' Eve). But much of Lisa's writing is brilliant, like the story of the dying eaglet. That was beautiful, skilled writing, awesome. I also liked her very subtle references to physical abuse in hands of her husband. She describes these beatings in a way that could be described as elegant, which makes them even more horrific. I very much enjoyed the farming bits, the sheep, the avocado and sugar cane stories. I also enjoyed her transformation from a starry-eyed teenager into a woman assuming full responsibility for everybody and everything: her family, her farm, and the welfare of hundreds of people in it. I wouldn't go as far as describing her as a \\"powerful matriarch\\", like the book jacket does, but she certainly obtained a power that was more than anything emanating from herself.I was tremendously disappointed with the ending, though. Throughout the book there are many references to her seven years in the hacienda, so you know that at some point she leaves. The end was cliff-like: there is some elaboration to the circumstances that pushed her departure, and some of the obstacles she was facing. And then, that's it. She left. I was hoping for an epilogue, a mention of what happened to her, her daughter, her husband, la gente, no matter how brief. I was left yearning to know more, to wrap it up, because just by physically removing yourself from a place, you just don't automatically close that chapter of your life.In any case, this book is very much worth your while.

I was eager to like this book. The underlying story is bizarre and wonderful: Teenaged London girl marries mad Venezuelan and moves to the tropics, bears a child, falls in love with the earthy local peasants, learns about avocados...and eventually is forced ot flee gun-wielding, totally insane spouse. Lives to write about it. Great story. Terrible book! It read like Teran sat down, started typing everything she could remember about her marriage, produced a rambling, illogical, unstructured scroll of writing which she promptly mailed off and which, due to its vivid subject matter, is now an unsatisfying, weird, poorly written, insufficiently edited book. Why did Teran marry the creepy Venezuelan? Why did she stick around for so many years? What was she thinking? Those are big questions she never answers! There's something very unreal about all of this. To me, the gaps in the narrative don't make the book more poetic or beautiful. They make it seem vague, incoherent and rushed. Big disappointment."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"An account of personal growth and survival set against the background of the people of the Venezuelan Andes. Poor editing and the author's failure to learn or understand the history and the spirit of the people she encounters makes this a work of mostly fiction. The inconsistencies glare through the narrative. What brings a 17 year-old english girl to marry a foreigner twice her age and to scurry to the Venezuelan countryside, where she leaves a precarious and dehumanized existence? One can not fail to express admiration for the survival part of the story; but the book is a source of constant irritation, as one bears the naivete and ignorance of this courageous girl. She has failed to understand La Gente she so much celebrates, neither has she learned anything about Venezuelan societies (upper or lower) or Venezuelan history. Neither is she upfront about herself, so her left leaning political persuasion (which is probably quite extreme) has to be inferred. The same for the relationship with her husband, and for that matter, even the paternity of her child. Read this book as an account of a courageous journey of survival and self-discovery, set in the background of a fictional place loosely based on the geography and the people of Venezuela and of the Venezuelan Andes."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"What happened to the review sent in earlier?"},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"Make that a negative three stars.

I'm not nearly so outraged by the inconsistencies and improbabilities that suggest it may be partly fabricated. I quail less before the unlikely depiction of a whole culture devoid of intelligent adaptations to cruel conditions -- less than I recoil from the simple fact that this memoir was published and is acclaimed. The writing is clotted and nonsensical not magical or fascinating. &quot;...mostly I lazed like a lizard escaped from its prey.&quot; Think about it!

Since I read it I have not checked the place out but found some people that actually corroborated part of the story. This is why I reluctantly give it 5 stars. In spite of a certain inconsistency through the book, a few misplaced left leanings comment, a hard to believe naivete, the books stands firm as a good representation of Venezuelan rural mores, and a heartfelt memoir. Now, I do not want this to mean that Lisa Saint Aubin de Teran is an accurate reporter. She tries her best and only God knows how difficult it is to understand Venezuelan society. However she is very successful at conveying the spirit that moves things there, for good or bad. She is at her best when she shows how in spite of every hardship that falls on her, the country slowly gets into her and she cannot help but love it. I can relate with that, she is not making it up. And last but not least, in light of recent political turmoil in Venezuela, I can recommend this book highly: it will explain why a phenomenon like Chaves came upon Venezuela better than any long political analysis you might find around. Although Ms Saint Aubin kept her patrician acquired Teran she was unto something when she describes the \\"absentee landlord\\" mores of Venezuelan old elite families. Her comments on them are rather damming. But the reader needs not to worry, this is still a very strong personal memoir, that can also serve as a political memento."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"It's a beautifully written book about the hacienda living in Venezuela.

No Mayas in Venezuela. 2) The &quot;Gaita&quot; music she describes as coming from the plains (los llanos), has its origins in Zulia State. 3) The founder of the socialist party was Jose Vicente Rangel and not Rafael Rangel. 4) The head of the family, that she calls &quot;padron&quot;, is the &quot;patron&quot; with a p. 5)Presidents are elected every five years, not every four years.

Teran takes an unimaginable scenario of a young girl completely isolated from the world in an unknown and, to her, backward cultural and shows her transformation into a strong and independent woman from the lonely ineffectual child she was. Yet gaping holes seemed apparent in the narrative. The impenetrable character of Jaime is never fully developed. The fact that he is a shadowy figure in the book as he appeared in her life, you never fully realize the terror and frustration she must have experienced at his hands. It would be a more complex and ultimately more rewarding book if the narrative did not hide the ugliness of this relationship (or rather describe superficially) the same way the character of Lisa did in her letters to her mother. The parentage of the child Iseult is never explored either but for one paragraph early in the book. While there may have been reasons for Teran to hide the truth of paternity from her community she hides it from herself too - a strange and articifical literary conceit. Nevertheless the book is full of vivid characters and a nice narrative framework of the letters to her mother glossing over the loneliness and pain of her young adulthood. I was engrossed and throroughly enjoyed Teran's journey through a metaphoric and literal foreign land. If you like stories of personal growth and change you'll enjoy her prose."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"With two chapters to go, I feel confident recommending this to anyone who wants to know what life in South America is really like - or was really like in the 1970's. The author was just a teenager when she found herself as a new bride on a sugar plantation, trying to survive the family, the farmworkers, and the forces of nature. The anecdotes recounted truly communicate the flavor of rural Venezuelan life and the privations that went with it. Read it for the cultural exposure, more than for outstanding writing. The author maintains a certain distance from her subject, even as she immerses herself in the hacienda's daily life. She alludes to her marital woes, and her husband's probable insanity; she begins by saying she is sterile but bears a child early on, then hardly mentions her (except for hospital emergencies). &quot;La gente&quot; provide the most interesting reading, with their superstitions and simple wisdom. The author's self-education in the ways of life on the farm, her gardening and growing menagerie, and her resilience despite setbacks kept me turning pages. My favorite characters were the twins who become her protectors! The areas that could use more detail perhaps were intentionally vague to protect Don Jaime's privacy and not make the author seem too pathetic as she endures the seven years of silence that he seemed to give her. Any fans of Garcia Marquez or Allende's House of the Spirits will enjoy this non-fiction foray into Latino living!"},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"When nave, 16 year old Londoner Lisa St-Aubin married Don Jaime Teran, a charming yet enigmatic Latin twice her age, a descendent of the conquistadors & heir to an Andean sugar plantation, it appeared she had entered the pages of a Harlequin Romance.What she got was Gothic Horror with Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde at the House of Usher.Upon arrival at The Hacienda, an overgrown feudal estate in the vertiginous back country of Venezuela, Lisa was virtually abandoned by her husband, left to fend for herself for weeks at a time in a ramshackle, vermin-infested shack. As she struggled to manage the affairs of the antiquated cane plantation which was the sole income for herself, its illiterate peasant workers and their destitute families, all the while she was determined to keep up appearances and hide the appalling reality from her family back in England.As Lisa coped with hunger, storms, snakes, poverty, pregnancy and childbirth, it became increasingly obvious to her that her husband was mentally unbalanced and possibly homicidal; that rather than her relying on the assistance of family retainers, they looked to her, as the wife of The Patron, to solve their problems; and that Don Jaime, his family and the estate workers would rather see them dead than allow Lisa and her daughter to escape this jungle prison.The Hacienda is the all-too-true story of Lisa's survival. Not only does it read like a novel, but it is better than \\"The Keepers of the House\\", her earlier roman-a-clef, a story of an enigmatic Venezuelan heir to a crumbling sugar plantation who brings home an English teen-aged bride..."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"What could have been a truly wonderful book, by clearly a good writer, is written with a detachment that leaves one feeling cheated. Important details are utterly ignored, large chunks have been left out -- I was very let down. The setting, however, is rather wonderful, just that we never get to really know the people, so the story falls flat. Emotions are ignored, left out -- even the relationship of the protagonist with her baby. A shame, it really could have been a first class book."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"I absolutely fell in love with this book, despite the fact the reasons behind Teran's actions were sometimes hidden...so why did she marry this guy anyway? As a young woman, I was inspired by her strength, tenacity, kindness, and creativity. Not only did she strive to make daily life on the hacienda better for herself and Iseult, but also for the workers, their children, and of course her beloved pets. A few incorrect historical facts may be the result of bad editing, but they do not detract from the true heart and spirit of this charming, magical novel."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"For a memoir, the author is very removed from the experiences she writes about. She conveys little if any emotion about what must have been a very lonely and often frightening existance (especially given her age) in a strange land with a mad and eventually abusive husband, a young child who was often extremely sick and with the responsibilites of running a hacienda. Although her writing is beautiful at times, the author never really connected with me."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"This is a book which warrants reading twice. This is because the first time you find yourself so anxious to learn the outcome of its human drama that you don't thoughtfully absorb the vivid descriptions of rural Venezuela.&quot;The Hacienda&quot; is a memoir that reads more like fiction than the actual experiences of a young woman. The author's naivete and the reality of her husband, and the other central characters both seem implausible and from another era; one could imagine this story being written by Emily Bronte. It is hard to believe that a contemporary from London could have gotten herself into such a situation, and I found myself checking several times to verify that what transpired actually occurred in the '70's. Additionally, it was hard to imagine that any part of Venezuela would remain this feudal, much less an affluent, &quot;aristocratic&quot; family largely anchored in Caracas.This is a tale of ongoing abuse, brutality, resilience, and survival. One gets the impression that the author must be made of granite; however, the reader also feels incredible frustration that she could have allowed herself to remain mired for so long in such an oppressive, primitive, and menacing environment. The author depicts her daily plight through oblique correspondence to her mother in England, and reveals a stoic, pragmatic approach of day to day coping, while ignoring and indirectly enabling the ugly brutality of her schizophrenic husband. Perhaps this is primarily a memoir of how victims sustain the conditions which subject them.Her descriptions of &quot;el gente&quot; at Hacienda Santa Rita are a fascinating glimpse of feudal rural Latin America. This is an interesting book, but a tense read. It is interesting and rivetting, but not a relaxing experience."},{"Title":"The Hacienda: A Memoir","review":"A smooth, rich mixture of magical surrealism and Andean earthiness. Not one for the psychologists - so go pick yourself something from psychology. This one is definitely for St Aubin de Teran fans who have travelled with her on the slow train to Milan and love her relaxed dreaminess and tolerance of extraordinary people and places. This transports you right to the Hacienda with its harsh beauty. Would have liked to know la gente a little better but love the weave of sumptuous and simple language. Was enthralled by my stay on the hacienda!"},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"... The Europeans seems indeed to be merely \\"a sketch\\", a practice piece, worth reading only for James's masterly prose and for occasional sparkles of wit. Or perhaps it should be taken as James's effort to 'cash in' on the perennial market for romance novels for women readers, a market that was a lucrative in the 19th C as it remains today. That latter interpretation, I confess, is hindered by the absence of passion exhibited in any the four entangled 'love stories' of the narration. Marriages do occur eventually; I hope that's not too much of a spoiler, since I won't disclose how many or whom.One could also interpret The Europeans as a study of miscommunication. The title characters, a sister and brother whose mother was American but who have 'grown up' as thorough Europeans, come to visit their American cousins whom they've never met or known, who live quiet, sober lives in a Massachusetts village. The reader is 'encouraged' to suppose that the sister is both fleeing a milieu in Europe that has gone sour and seeking a 'fortunate' matrimonial opportunity. The American cousins and their social set are people of substantial means and insubstantial culture. Perplexed in every way by the arrival of such exotic relatives, nonetheless they generously welcome the travelers into their quaint puritanical family circle. What ensues is a minuet of misperceptions and miscues.James seems to have learned a good deal about the structural mechanics of novel-writing in the short time between \\"The American\\" and \\"The Europeans\\". Whereas in the former, he sometimes labors over describing a character in excessive external detail, in the latter he allows his characters to portray themselves through actions and dialogue. It's a subtler style of narrative, on a par with the polished best of Jane Austen or George Eliot. But of course the 19th C British 'novel of manners' was the model of all of Henry James's novels, a form he never abandoned. It's also quite plausible that James consciously intended \\"The Europeans\\" as a sequel to \\"The American,\\" a thematic coda. It's not as exciting or insightful as its immediate predecessor, and it's barely a prophecy of the brilliance James would soon achieve in \\"The Bostonians\\". But it's too artfully written not to be entertaining as a display of craft."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"Written in 1878, this short novel is set some time earlier in the century, in Boston and surroundings. A pair of siblings from Europe, brother Felix and sister Eugenia, have come to America to visit their relatives, hoping to find them rich. The two can be called adventurers, gold-diggers. He is a sort of bohemian, while she is married to a German prince, who is about to get rid of her. (At the time, Germany had an abundance of princes.)They find their relatives a large, reasonably well to do, well established family in the outskirts. The Wentworths are puzzled by the unexpected visitors, and behave with decency. There are some unmarried young cousins in the family. Felix is a charmer and reacts positively. Eugenia is a more difficult character and for her the cultural shock is a problem, as it is for the father of the Wentworth family. He is the brother of the visitors' mother. Relations were not close in the past. Eugenia's mother had run away at 20 into an unapproved marriage with a European.Like with James' previous novel about an American in Europe, the main subject here is the loss of meaning in cross-cultural communication. That is always good for various amusements of the mild to the hilarious kind. This book is more of the mild kind, which is not meant as a criticism.All in all, we have an interesting but not a great little novel about social affairs of the better classes in the 19th century. It lives mainly by the master's sparkling language. The people in the story are not all interesting. I would single out the two main women for being \`interesting': Eugenia, the baroness, is a thoroughly discredited person who works hard at keeping up appearances, even to her brother, and probably even to herself. She lies shamelessly to everybody. While she rarely tells complete lies, she is also seldom completely truthful.The other interesting woman is Gertrude Wentworth. She puzzles us mostly through James' handling of her. She appears early like a person that makes you wonder if she is capricious or simple. She is certainly not shown as a particularly attractive woman, not by looks nor by her acts. Then during the plot, descriptions by the wise man in the off stop and Gertrude seems to become a totally different person: smart, attractive, headstrong ... the point is that these impressions are all given by other protagonists and we don't need to believe them. Has James planted mistrust in his people's statements and opinions?The last chapter is a roundup of characters and it ties up open ends, providing satisfaction to some and frustration to others. It is not convincing as a narrative device, to me. It reminds me of James' later failed attempts to become a stage writer. Chapter 12 here is like a less than interesting romantic play. I can do without those."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"The Europeans is a classic tale of two worlds colliding. On one side we have the bohemian Europeans; on the other we have the puritan New Englanders. It is the conflict of language as well as culture which is evident throughout the book. I believe the sympthay lies with the New Englanders as after all their guests were vistors to New England. Although it was later acknwoldged that James did not intend the character of Getrude to be good; i nevertheless rejoiced in her rebelious nature but felt concerned she was being manipulated by her european suitor. A very good and more importantly short read."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"This minor work by James is another brick in the tall wall of his obsessive study of the cultural and behavioral differences between Europeans and Americans at the turn of the Century (XIX to XX, of course). The prose is, as always, elegant and intricate, with a rich and sophisticated language that every admirer of James enjoys so much, but it is no doubt much lighter than his masterworks. Eugenia and Felix Young, children of Americans but raised in Europe, arrive in Boston to look for their uncle Wentworth and his children. He has few memories of her departed sister, the Youngs' mother, and doesn't even remember she left two kids when she died. So the Youngs are well received but naturally elicit all kinds of suspicion. What are the refined Eugenia, married to a Baron of M&uuml;nster, and the artistically inclined Felix up to? What's the objective of their visit? The members of the Wentworth household react differently, according to their own expectations, attractions, rejections, and delusions. Brother and sister become an exotic attraction, a couple of rather decadent noble people playing king and queen of a rural, puritan, and prude environment. In particular, Felix elicits the total admiration and infatuation of the young and independently-minded Gertrude. It's a funny and pleasant read, which prefigures future, more complex plots and characters by James."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"Europeans presents a quick summation of why Henry James is among the most illustrious and celebrated American authors. His writing in this book surveys the interaction of European society with early, austere, and moralisitc American culture. For historians and sociologists alike, as well as avid fans of lit., James illuminates interactions of the respective characters with poised rhetorical grace, and his sketches are highly readable, understandable, and enjoyable. James can be an intimidating author to approach for people like me (a college sophomore), who are beginning to appreciate the pleasure of reading such fine authors; reading a short, yet engaging, work such as Europeans is an excellent jumping off point to a later appreciation and enjoyment of the author's more prodigious epics, such as The Portrait of the Lady. I can say that after reading Europeans, I have more confidence and comfort taking off the shelf a longer work by James, simply in knowing that I can comprehend his shorter designs. I also recommend for those like me to try out his short fiction. Concluding, reading this work has made me very excited to read further works by James, as I plan to read the entirety of his literary output. It is the brilliance and charm of Europenas that has instilled in me this excitment."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"The Europeans is one of James's earliest efforts, and it shows. It lacks much of the complexity of his later works, and there are times when the language seems a bit stilted, when he is obviously \\"telling\\" us about the characters instead of \\"showing\\" us. There is a bit of the feel of a Shakespeare comedy: some convoluted scenarios that resolve in the end with a neat little bow and the overwhelming majority of characters demonstrating themselves to be kind and good (with the exception of our one obvious villain). Having said that, it is rare when one can describe James as charming and light. The book is optimistic and the characters, which a bit simple, still show some of the complexity that James develops later. His insights into human nature and motivations are still thought-provoking and have the ring of truth. I give it 4 stars because even a more limited James is still superior to the overwhelming majority of writers. An enjoyable and quick read. Well worth your time, and a good option for those who want to give James a try without wading into the depths of Portrait of a Lady or Wings of the Dove."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"The edition I had (Bibliobazaar) is so full of spelling mistakes (Eg.

James' novels were shaped by this immigrant experience, the predominant them of his writing being the interaction between Americans and Europeans. \\"The Europeans\\" is one such story, though, contrary to what the title might suggest, it is set in America.My introduction to James' work was a pair of his novellas, \\"The Aspern Papers\\" and \\"The Turn of the Screw\\". The former featured an American literary historian travelling the Vnice to seek a sort of treasure in the possession of a local British expatriate. \\"The Europeans\\" sees a pair of Europeans (from some German principate, seemingly, though Felix makes a point of cosmopolitanly disclaiming nationality) travel to antebellum Massachusetts (around thirty years before James was writing in the 1870s). Eugenia (alternately referred to by her first name, or as \\"Madame Munster\\", or as \\"the Baroness\\") has come to make her marital fortune, faced with the dissolution of her morganatic marriage to a German prince, while her brother Felix is just tagging along as part of his Bohemian existence as a portrait-painter. They plan to visit their American cousins (their mother's brother and his children) of whom they have only heard report of. The Wentworths are a family of devout Puritans, in contrast to the more cultured and worldly Europeans; the arrivals are particularly intriguing to Gertrude, the younger of the family's two daughters, who finds the Baroness a striking example of a different kind of womanhod, and Felix a man wholly unlike her father's candidate for her hand, Mr. Brand.\\"The Europeans\\" does not have a great deal in the way of plot. There are no antagonists in any real sense, just character interaction where some people have contrary objectives. Felix and Gertrude are the most developed and appealing of the characters in the story, and everyone else is generally well-drawn. James is an expert examiner of human nature, thoug he is here bound by editorial contraints to supply predetermined happy endings for several characters, though he sneaks in his more customary downbeatness in the resolution of Eugenia's story.All in all, this is an entertaining if not special short novel, one that James himself did not especially regard (excluding it from the multi-volume \\"Collected Works\\" he published in the early 20th century). It is enjoyable and worth the time of those seeking a broad understanding of the author's canon, but for people looking to see James at his best it would be more advisable to try \\"The Portrait of a Lady\\"."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"When I found out that \\"The Europeans\\", by Henry James, could offer more than just a wonderful film, I couldn't wait to order the unabridged \\"The Europeans\\" Audio-CD, read by Lloyd James, as well as the complete soundtrack CD \\"The Europeans\\", with composer Richard Robbins' arrangements.The film is a James Ivory's masterpiece with a New England autumn background, the Audio-CD matches the film wonderfully, where you can picture the film characters through Lloyd's interpretation, and the Soundtrack CD starts off with breathtaking Clara Schumann's \\"Andante\\" Opus-17."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"This is a 4 or 5 star novel but not a great work of literature.Somewhat surprisingly the Europeans is set in rural Massachusetts, not in Europe. The book is a few hundred pages long. This length is longer than Washington Square and much shorter that Portrait of a Lady, the latter being a much better novel than the present work.Without giving away the plot, it has that Henry James characteristic of an uncertain final outcome hence the novel lacks a completely satisfying ending. There is some happiness and closure for the protagonists, but as we read in Washington Square, James sometimes leaves the future a bit uncertain, and he does so here.In any case, it is the story of a European brother and sister, who are linked to European nobles through marriage, visiting their wealthy relations outside of Boston. The story is set some time in the early 19th century. Many claim that the dates and events mentioned in the book are confused and these errors introduce elements of confusion. In general, this does not distract from the story.I found the novel to be an interesting but not a compelling read.This classic is recommended reading, but it is not a novel or classic that one \\"must read.\\""},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"I believe that James has created another of his wonderful novels, but this one in particular contains some sense of greed.

It's a very strange novel that already shows some of his main themes, such as a clash between American and British -- or European -- culture and moral, but it lacks character development and in psychological analysis .The main characters, the Europeans, Eugenia and Felix are weird, and I could never get them across. All acts of them seem to come out of the blue, and nothing they do seems to be justified. Maybe I was expecting a couple of sinical and looking-for-money people, but what I got was two boring people. All the time I had the feeling that they came to America in order to make profitable marriages, but it was never confirmed. Felix's marriage to Gertrudes is silly and I was not convinced that he loves her; he does nothing but laughing and painting all the time. And Eugenia affair with Robert is so quick and meaningless. Why does she not marry him? It's never really explained.I see it could have been a better novel if it was writen by a more experienced Henry James. There are many points that want to be developed but -- I don't know why -- the writer just left them with an easy solution. Many events could have gone a bit further, such as Clifford's crush on Eugenia, or Brand's love for Gertrudes, or even the relationship between Eugenia and Robert Acton.Please don't get me wrong! I like James's works very much, but I couldn't connect to this novel. It didn't make me care for the characters or what happens to them. Moreover, the marriages that happen in the very last pages of the book sounded very meaningless, or something like &quot; let's give a happy end&quot;. Anyway, it is a nice book to start reading Henry James, but move on afterwards. I mean, no matter how hard &quot;The Wings of the Dove&quot;, &quot; The Portrait of a Lady&quot; or &quot;Golden Bowl&quot; can be, read them, so that one can fully get James's style and greatness."},{"Title":"The Europeans","review":"This is not one of my favourites (and it was not among the James' fovourites, either).

She has a distinguished career as a consultant practitioner and subsequently at Queensland University of Technology, in Brisbane. She holds a masters degree from the University of Melbourne, and a doctorate in design from the GSD at Harvard, USA.For many people, Australia is somewhat of an enigma- seemingly generously endowed with natural resources, enjoying a mild climate and fine cities, yet it is left conspicuously \`unpopulated'. When asked about this, my best response is to say that the enticing shots of Sydney Harbor in the tourist brochures are but one aspect of a wondrous and intriguing landscape. I suggest they venture further afield, out west, beyond the package tour sites, and imbibe some of the quotidian landscapes of Australia- the suburbs, the country towns, the surf coasts, the eucalypt forests: these are places of every day landscapes. But exactly where: Australia is such a huge country?With this book by Professor Bull in your backpack, and with sufficient time and resources, you could make a grand journey of revelation- and find in every corner of the Australian continent, some revealing place to explore. The book shows and discusses a very diverse range of landscape design projects, from Darwin in the north to Launceston in the south (but don't miss out on Hobart- arguably one of the most captivating urban settlements in the world), from Perth in the south-west to Palm Cove in the north-east, and many places in between.One particular aspect of these projects is that most of them are about public use areas, in the \`public realm', that is, free and open to the community. Certainly there are private gardens of merit in Australia, but arguably the projects shown in this book represent a far more important aspect of Australian culture: the quality and amenity of public spaces. This reflects a fundamental attitude and belief, that the ordinary lived -in public places are important, cherished and worth protecting. Despite contemporary pressures for reduced government spending and privatization of public assets, this commitment is generally being maintained. Perhaps for visitors, this is one of the joys of visiting places such as Sydney Cove, illustrating a principle that is not irrelevant to Korean cities.There are certainly some gaps in the coverage of the book. It under-represents the influence and value of recent immigrant cultures from south-east Asia, which is very apparent in the larger cities. Aboriginal cultural traditions are minimally represented. I doubt that these omissions reflect the overtly retrograde mode, recently seen in contemporary Australian social and political processes! Some of the more remote locations, such as the Kimberley region in the north-west, or the west coast of Tasmania, regions where there are significant landscape projects, would have been valuable additions. But this is a small quibble, there are so many possibilities, and the projects that are included are many and varied.From this book, it appears that Australia is seemingly and somewhat belatedly finding its bio-social \`space'; and this through landscape projects. By this I mean that, in many of the projects, both \`natural' space and \`social' space can be discerned as melding and complementary. It may even be said that, in many of these projects, landscapes are prompting or initiating a pivotal re-orientation in Australian's cognition of itself.The quintessential project that illustrates this point is the Riawunna Aboriginal Studies Centre, at the University of Tasmania's Launceston campus (p. 148). This tiny space, as much community facilitation as a design, by Sinatra Murphy and Urban Initiatives, exposes an essential primordial relationship of culture and environment. The design was developed with the Aboriginal community. But, as importantly, it addresses the wider immigrant community. We see a landscape of rocks, stone, shells (middens) and plants. In lesser hands, this may have amounted to a parody, but here it elicits recognition. We understand a representational space about extended time (dreamtime?), adaptation and subsistence with resources, and opportunity for social connections.On the other hand, at the National Museum of Australia, Canberra, in the Garden of Australian Dreams, there are a plethora of memetic signs, but not much signified. (p. 144). There is a cacophonous assemblage of words and objects- representations of the settlement of other places; the intent however is obscured by reliance on semiology which engages the viewer through metonymy, a trompe-l'oeil of signs, which verge on mere verbiage. The \`marking out' of the garden also downplays a pivotal aspect of the process of occupation of land in Australia, then and now, and that is the overt \`ethnic cleansing' which was and is a fundamental aspect of the European occupation of Australia. In this context, the naming of places, which is emphasized in the garden, whether using European names or under official policy employing Aboriginal names, is relatively unimportant. I am also drawing a direct analogy between the historic \`ethnic cleansing' of Aboriginals and the current incarceration of recent immigrants; both processes directed at ensuring a white (only) occupation of preferred localities. But I guess that's an argument for another day.For these reasons, Professor Bull's book is far more that an inventory for a tourist, and I really should not suggested that. The fundamental value of the book is the way in which it points toward designed landscapes as a vital aspect of self-cognition for Australians and along the way, it captures the knowledge and innovation, at the hands of landscape practitioners and clients, which make it possible.This can be seen in the final chapter in particular. Professor Bull concludes the book at a high pitch indeed. Between the lines of the placid prose there is an impassioned plea, for what the author lays out is a challenge. Professor Bull asks for - and seeks positive answers through designed landscapes- a society that understands and enjoys its diversity and capacities, its natural processes and cultural adaptability."},{"Title":"Stanley, Flat again!","review":"This was my first time reading a Flat Stanley book.

When his brother made him round again by blowing him up with a hose, Stanley thought he was through with flatness forever.And then one ordinary morning, Stanley suddenly goes flat again, and this time, the hose won't work.

This one is no exception."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"This Roberts novel is in the true picaresque tradition with action beginning in New England, moving on to Revolutionary Haiti, and ultimately to the very Shores of Tripoli. Albion Hamlin is captivated by a portrait and the adventure is on.Roberts' formula, employed so strikingly in Arundel and its sequels, is evident here again: a young American man, a bit of an innocent despite his education, falls victim to an evil woman (Harriet Faulkner, the Mary Malinson/Marie de Sabrevois figure of this book), is thrown into a swirl of epically dramatic but mostly very accurate historical events, picks up a larger than life comic-relief sidekick (King Dick, the Cap Huff figure here), encounters many adventures and grave hardships, and wins his true love in the end (Lydia; a far more demure Phoebe; much more reminiscent Ellen the 'female lead' of his novel Rabble In Arms). [Note: also like Cap Huff, King Dick serves the role of sidekick more than once in Roberts' fiction. He makes a subsequent appearance in The Lively Lady, Roberts' novel of the War of 1812.]Almost all of Roberts' books are dramatic page-turners, and this one is too, in most places--especially in the upheavals of the Haitian Revolution. But later in the book, as Albion is the captive of Barbary Pirates, the story--to me--actually bogs a little; at least until his rescue and the ensuing adventures.Among the Roberts books, this is among my least favorites (I emphatically cannot sympathize with the Tory Oliver Wiswell, but I think that's just prejudice), but yet I like it very much. High praise for Roberts the story-teller.Some complain Roberts' wriring is overwrought and his histories nothing but hopeless romances. Be this as it may, he was a master of crafting extremely exciting fictional but historically quite accurate accounts of important historic events of early American history.If you only read one Roberts book, go read Arundel, his first and I believe best novel; or Northwest Passage, a true epic. But if you get hooked on either of those, please treat yourself to reading the rest of the Roberts oeuvre, Lydia Bailey emphatically included."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"It's been more than thirty years since I first read &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; and I'm glad to see it available again after years out of print. Kenneth Roberts was a terrific writer and he has a terrific story to tell, with action ranging from New England in the early 1800's, to Haiti during Toussaint L'Ouverture's rebellion, to the Barbary Coast. This novel is a little bit detective story, a whole lot of rousing adventure and just the right amount of romance, mixed in with plenty of pointed observations along the way about political shenanigans and the highs and lows of human nature. They really don't write 'em this way any more--which is a shame. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"Wow! This book covers more ground in a mere 500 pages than I could ever have imagined before reading it. The adventures of Albion Hamlin are postively Odyssean. Our protagonist is at various times a farmer, a lawyer, a prisoner, a soldier, and a slave. And the action takes us from New England to Haiti, France, and North Africa. Somehow, in the end, it all makes complete sense. The successful integration of so many stories and characters is remarkable.Albion's companion, King Dick, is especially interesting, a more heroic though still light-hearted incarnation of the Cap Huff character from the Arundel series, always to the rescue. And the historical characters, dozens of them, are captivating (sometimes quite literally). Unlike the Odyssey, there are no fantastic multi-headed homicidal creatures to fend off, but some of the humans are reasonable substitutes.If I had to cite a shortcoming, it would be that here and there Roberts strains plausibility almost to the breaking point, most notably in the rapidity with which Lydia Bailey and Albion Hamlin fall in love. Ironically, it is the title character, Lydia, who is perhaps the most superficial of all the personalities who make appearances in this novel. But this is a minor flaw that is more than compensated for by extraordinary character development elsewhere.In the final analysis, this is a great, grand book that has a lot to say about human nature, about war, about politics, and about humanity. It gets better with every page and has the power to capture the reader and whisk him away, never to return.Lydia Bailey earns my highest recommendation for those lucky readers who can occasionally suspend disbelief. Others will find it enjoyable, too."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"I'm particularly fond of this novel as it was the cause of my being suspended from high school ca. 1960... (My history teacher declaimed that \\"the United States is the only country in the world that has never broken a treaty!\\" Having just finished this book, I asked, \\"What about the French Spoliation Claims?\\" and was promptly sent home.) The depiction of the Haitian revolution and its main characters -- Dessalines, Christophe, Toussaint -- is based on a thorough understanding of C.L.R. James' analysis, The Black Jacobins, i.e. it is a very progressive, somewhat left-wing view. I think that the even-handedness of Roberts' evaluation of the characters -- that \\"goodness\\" and \\"badness\\" are not confined to one \\"race\\" or another -- is admirable. Also, for people who want to understand some of the roots of Haiti's historical and current devastated conditions, this is an excellent way to connect."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"I never thought about the contrarian viewpoints of early American history, and how mainstream these ideas seemed back when the issues were still being thrashed out. Roberts opened my eyes to the history that disappeared after one way of life triumphed over another. His other books are good too, especially \\"OLIVER WISWELL\\".Who knew that Benedict Arnold was a patriot, and could be seen as a betrayed leader rather than a traitor? I'm going to get out my Kenneth Roberts collection and start over again through the best fiction out there on the Revolutionary War!!"},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"Lydia Bailey is another great historical novel by Kenneth Roberts. The story begins around 1800 in America. The first part of the book examines the attempt of the Federalists in power to stifle all opposition through passage of the Alien and Sedition Act. The Federalists under President John Adams were afraid of Thomas Jefferson's Republicans who they believed were overly sympathetic to the French Revolution and were plotting something similar in American.The action then moves to Haiti where the protagonist goes to search for a young lady, but is soon caught up in war. The Haitian black slaves have revolted against their French masters and driven them out. The Revolutionary government of France had freed the slaves, but Napoleon comes to power and sends a huge army to put them back into slavery. The nature of Haitian society, race relations, the war, and the relationship with France are all covered in depth.The story continues in the Mediterranean with the American war with the Barbary Pirates. The hero and the young lady he was searching for, now his wife, are captured by the pirates and held in Algiers. He escapes and joins the Arab expedition under the American General Eaton who raises an army to march from Egypt to Algiers to depose Joseph Karamanli, the tyrannical ruler there. However, they are betrayed by the American envoy Tobias Lear, who negotiates a separate peace when the Arab army is on the verge of winning, and allows thetyrant to remain in power.As usual with Kenneth Roberts, the events and historical characters are based on real happenings. This is true in Haiti, and also in the Mediterranean, where General Eaton, his campaign, Joseph Karamanli, and the devious American diplomat Tobias Lear who betrayed Eaton are all historical figures. I presume the part of the story about the Federalists and the Alien and Sedition Act is also true, but I have not studied that history."},{"Title":"Lydia Bailey","review":"This novel was in excellent condition along with a dust cover also in excellent condition.

Harvey, a professor of management science, offers a series of essays on various management topics, such as backstabbing, betrayal, deception and work environments. To make his points, he uses a kind of discursive, reflective approach that includes a mix of stories, fables, metaphors and considerations of language usage. Some might find his approach a refreshing narrative, complete with the feel of discovery you'd get from reading someone's diary. Others may find that the essays ramble and repeat themselves. We at getAbstract.com agree more with the first line of thinking. However, we do post the cautionary note that - although Harvey raises some generally unmentioned, intriguing issues in the politics of management - he does need to be more concise. In other words, perhaps he could have used that knife in his back to trim his prose a little."},{"Title":"How Come Every Time I Get Stabbed in the Back My Fingerprints Are on the Knife? : And Other Meditations on Management","review":"As you've probably noticed from the other reviews, J.

However, I do require a speaker/writer to at least propose their answers, so I may compare and contrast them to my own views.I recommend this book if you prefer an open-ended discussion with no suggested or implied solutions.For new managers with their first inkling they might have a few misconceptions about what they've just gotten into, I recommend &quot;Becoming a Manger: How New Managers Master the Challenges of Leadership&quot; by Linda Hill."},{"Title":"How Come Every Time I Get Stabbed in the Back My Fingerprints Are on the Knife? : And Other Meditations on Management","review":"In a discipline filled with pseudo-scientific gurus, Dr. Harvey offers a fresh perspective through his insightful 'meditations'.

Work is a political place, but most of the time, we see problems coming. If someone stabs us in the back, usually we get a warning, but are complicit by not assertively contacting the person doing us in. This idea of defeating poor office behavior through open and honest discussion is developed in depth throughout the book.There are two downsides. First, this book perhaps has too much text for such a simple concept. Although this is good reading for a fan of Jerry Harvey (I am one!) the Abilene Paradox is a much more efficient (more ideas, less words) introduction to his material. Second, Jerry is perhaps oversimplifying the world.

A professor at Biola University, and then at American Baptist Seminary of the West, he was a prolific writer. His book on hermeneutics remains a useful textbook on the subject.In the present volume he explores the purported incompatability between scientific reason and biblical accuracy, and shows that the illusion is because of improper interpretation of scientific evidence and/or the Biblical texts. Although some of the scientific data he cites are somewhat dated (e.g. supposed age of the earth), his reasoning still stands. The strength of the book is in its ability to sweep away the controversy and clear the way for intellectual honesty on both sides.As the list of books referencing this work demonstrates, \\"The Christian View of Science and Scripture\\" is a seminal work. Reaction to this book was evidently the impetus for the writings of Henry Morris, who shortly thereafter published his first major works on so-called \\"scientific creationism\\". Thus, it may have been the opening volley in the current \\"war\\", but as Ramm points out, the debate goes back to Augustine's time. While Morris' work is meant to exclude and divide, Ramm's book paves the way for those trained in the sciences to approach the Bible without having to \\"check their brain at the door\\". It also allows the Christian to approach science without a sense of guilt or heretical treason, free to explore its wonders, and yet, understand its limits. But most importantly, it opens a dialogue between serious believers and serious scientists that can lead to salvation on one hand, and greater appreciation for the works of the creator on the other.It is obvious that Bernard Ramm had a great love of the Bible and science. His most cogent point is that we, as Christians, must be cautious when we speak of scientific subjects, and we must be sure that we really understand the scientific method and the field of which we speak. Otherwise we will be dismissed as ignorant, and even more tragically, we may exclude honest seekers from coming to the Bible for reconciliation with the Creator. Also, as scientists, we must not impose a scientific framework on the Biblical texts. It will almost always result in misinterpretation and obscure the intended message.That however does not imply that the Bible cannot stand up under scientific scrutiny. While it was not the intent of the Biblical authors to write a scientific treatise, Ramm points out many instances where statements in the Bible have proven far ahead of their time for scientific and historical accuracy. And when viewed from a phenomenological perspective, even the creation account violates no basic tenants of science, a remarkable accomplishment for such an ancient text.This book remains a classic on the subject. I recommend it to all who honestly seek to reconcile science and scripture, not merely compromise one or the other or both."},{"Title":"The Christian view of science and scripture","review":"This book is an all time classic on the relationship of scientific knowledge to Christianity. Bernard Ramm bemoans the fact that there are so many books of this type and his is just another. But his stood the test of time, while the others have largely been forgotten.This book is timeless. Although some of the information on specific sciences such as geology, astronomy and biology is dated, much of the discussion could have been written yesterday.Ramm illustrates many ways of reconciling science and the study of scripture. He sometimes gives his own position on a particular issue. We may not agree with him on any particular issue. But Ramm stresses the important thing is that Christian scholars should take seriously the findings of science. Although we Christians accept the Bible as authoritative, there are sources of knowledge outside the Bible and it is not acceptable for the Christian to dismiss these if they seem to conflict with our understanding of scripture. Our understanding of scripture is every bit as contingent on fallible human reason as scientific knowledge.Ramm is a villan to the young-earth movement because of his \\"accomodationism\\" and critisism of \\"flood geology\\" and young-earthism. He is cited heavily in Witcomb and Morris' book The Genesis Flood, and in fact may have partly inspired that book.Some of the information on specific sciences is quite dated. But that illustrates the ever-changing nature of science (and theology) and the unchanging nature of scriptire. Just as our understanding of nature is always changing, so is our understanding of scripture and how it relates to science.Ramm does indicate that he does not personally accept evolutionary theory and is not a theistic evolutionist. He characterized himself as a \\"progeressive creationist\\". I have to admit I don't know if his opinions changed over the years as science progressed. Although my personal opinions may not be in total agreement with Ramm's, he displays an appropriate respect and honest consideration of scientific knowledge."},{"Title":"The Christian view of science and scripture","review":"Bernard L.

He has written important and influential books such asVarieties Of Christian Apologetics,Protestant Christian Evidences, andProtestant Biblical Interpretation: A Textbook of Hermeneutics.He wrote in the Preface to this 1954 book, \\"In research for this book I discovered that there are two traditions in Bible and science both stemming from the developments of the nineteenth century. There is the ignoble tradition which has ... used arguments and procedures not in the better traditions of established scholarship. There has been and is a noble tradition in Bible and science, and this is the tradition of the great and learned evangelical Christians who have been patient, genuine, and kind and who have taken great care to learn the facts of science and Scripture... Unfortunately the noble tradition ... has not been the major tradition in evengelicalism in the twentieth century... It is our wish to call evengelicalism back to the noble tradition...\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"...the Holy Spirit conveyed infallibly true theological doctrines in the cultural mold and terms of the days of the Bible writers, and did not give to the writers the secrets of modern science. It is a misunderstanding of the nature of inspiration to seek such secrets in various verses of the Bible.\\" (Pg. 136)\\"The amount of material carried by a water stream varies with the sixth power of the velocity of the stream. There is little deposit far out on the continental shelf where a few feet may represent thousands of years of deposits. Flood geology has no means of accounting for this.\\" (Pg. 184)\\"A local flood would come and go and leave no trace after a few thousand years, but could a universal flood be a traceless flood? (George McCready) Price's view we cannot but emphatically reject.\\" (Pg. 243)\\"The mixing of the waters and the pressure of the waters would have been devastating. Many of the salt water fish and marine life would die in fresh water, and many of the fresh water fish and marine life would die in salt water. An entire marine creation would have been necessary if the waters of the earth were mixed, yet no such hint is given in the account.\\" (Pg. 244)\\"Getting rid of such a vast amount of water would have been as miraculous as providing it. If the entire world were under six miles of water, there would have been no place for the water to drain off. Yet the record states that the water drained off with the help of the wind (Genesis 8:1). A local flood would readily account for this, but there is not answer if the entire world were under water.\\" (Pg. 245)\\"There is the problem of the special diets required for the animals, and the problem of special conditions for the animals. Some animals need a moist environment, and others a very dry one; some need it very cold and others very warm. Again, there is no question what Omnipotence can do, but the simplicity of the flood record prohibits the endless supplying of miracles to make a universal flood feasible.\\" (Pg. 247)"},{"Title":"Joseph: A Story of Divine Providence : A Text Theoretical and Textlinguistic Analysis of Genesis 37 and 39-48","review":"After teaching myself a modicum of Biblical Hebrew (BH) from the standard texts, I came to this book via B. Rocine's Learning Biblical Hebrew. Rocine's textbook (hard to obtain even from Amazon) itself is a good introduction to both BH and Discourse Linguistics and owes a lot to the work of both Alviero Niccacci and Robert Longacre. The categories and methods of Discourse Linguistics has greatly enriched my understanding of the verbal system of BH. Although the results of Discourse Linguistics investigations are still controversial and may not be accepted by all grammarians whose approaches are mainly tense, historical-comparative or aspect-based, they have added nuance and simplicity to the tangle of conflicting opinions on the uses of of verbal forms, e.g. wayyiqtol, qatal, weqatal, etc. , in Hebrew narrative.Longacre's Joseph: A Story of Divine Providence manages to convey as clearly and concisely as possible its author's methods, intent and conclusions as he applies discourse analysis to the Joseph story.

That is where I am at, with this book and others, ie Doyle v1/2, Solie v1/2, etc.I am in network ops so don't get anywhere near the hands on, so its all pretty much on my own gear/time.At this point, I hope Cisco comes out with more Pix labs later, though that may have already happened, with ccie security practical and ccie security practice which I have. Could use more VPN and IDS configs but what they have is ok as I have plenty to practice. While I spend time with R/S, work is also doing PIX so have to spend a year getting my CCSP, while still practicing for R/S, and MCSE stuff as well. IT doesn't stop....Anyway awaiting the solutions which were not in book but still gave it 5*. I could babble more...Would be nice in a year or so to talk to more ccie to be, for now practice, ....** next interviewer said did not get CD with solutions, same here so I emailed amazon and they mailed me another book with CD solutions; they also asked for old book back:) which I returned.** Also if you are like me, I went out and spend a ton of $$ on older gear but can still learn a lot; I've taken the CCIE written passed but no way I have time 18 months to get enough hands on, if you are into many certs ie ccie is NOT only one, then suggestion would be to forgo ccie written a bit; Since I passed CCIE written 2 years or more ago, just work labs over and over while studying theory that will be on test; Then when your hands on is fairly up to speed, your knowledge of the written will be at least ccnp, routing, switch should be second nature, atm, frame, voice, etc. So do the hands on over a period of years, get harder cisco tasks. So books like CCIE practice labs, Solie's, etc will give you plenty to practice. If you are like me, who does not get enough hands on, then start with the CCNA/CCNP practical books which is what I am doing. LOLFeb 7-2011 Well its been awhile, never got that practice, so now just about in a position to actually almost use the book. What is funny is back when book was written, the 3550 catalyst were not cheap, now you can for $2500-3300 bucks buy 4 3550's and a decent Cisco lab and maybe in awhile 6-12 months maybe the 3560's will be affordable. Funny I need to see if the my book even has a cd:) getting senile. So guess I do basic practice, finish up my last ccnp wireless, then its just CCIE r/s practice:)"},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"This is an awesome prep guide for anyone studying for the CCIE exam."},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"After waiting 2 months of the delivery I still have nothing.

Pretty expensive renting an on-line rack to practice technologies not on the exam any more. It would be alot of work to re-write the labs yourself to take out the stuff no longer tested.

The lab requires you to have a solid understanding of numerous technologies in order to pass. Add to that the fact that you have a time limit and other little favors from Cisco and your having a blast. You need to know what to expect and if you are up to speed on technologies that can appear in the lab.This book is written by CCIE's from Cisco Systems that are an integral part of the CCIE program. This book provides the reader with 6 lab scenarios that help test the knowledge. The book tells you to read the entire lab before beginning, this is pretty much one of the golden rules of the CCIE lab. The labs contain points for each section of the lab to allow the reader the option of picking what needs to be accomplished in order to pass the lab. The point system alone makes this book worthwhile.The Ask the Proctor section in each lab is ok. It tries to direct your thought process in the correct direction. I'm not a big fan of this section it reminds me of the real Proctors in the lab. They can help in some instances and keep you confused in others. The addition of this section while probably not the most popular is what sets this book apart from other lab preparation material.The Lab debrief sections at end of each lab is an incredible tool that helps the reader fully understand what was being asked for each requirement during the lab. This has to be the most indispensable part of this book. It helps separate this book from the rest of the preparation tools on the market. You should buy this book just for this section.In closing my review this book is a valuable tool that can help the reader see if they are up to CCIE Caliber. I am glad that I added this resource to my personal library.BrionSenior VoIP Engineer"},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs by Martin J Duggan and Maurilio P Gorito (Cisco Press, 2004) leads through a half dozen labs that are representative of Cisco's day-long routing and switching exam. Each lab has a slightly different slant but they all relate to the objectives covered on the exam.I set up the first lab with a friend according to the topology of Lab 1 and found a number of typos (interface identifiers mostly) but also found it to be a great learning experience.Each chapter begins with an equipment list and instructions for setting up the lab. All labs require about 8 routers and a switch; in general, the popular 3550 Catalyst switch is used and Cisco 2600 routers are considered adequate. Often these routers are made to emulate a frame-relay switch to help with the remote access portions of the exam. Both logical topologies and cabling diagram are shown to assist you in this process. The descriptions include explicit instructions as to how to set up the basic connectivity that will allow you to configure solutions to the problems. After you've set up Layer 2, you then are given the Layer 3 IP addresses and you're ready to jump into the lab.All the labs cover the main requirements-Frame Relay and ATM, switching and IP routing, router redistribution and autonomous system routing, along with services and solution such as multicast, QoS, security and VoIP. You should note that DLSw+ for routing SNA over IP is still tested.The configuration instructions for each section are the same level of detail as in the actual lab: that is to say they are very sparse. For example, an EIGRP instruction might tell you that a particular router is running low on memory and high on CPU utilization, and ask you simply to accommodate this knowledge within your configuration. This is typical of how the labs help you develop the critical thinking skills to solve similar problems in the field and it is also why the CCIE is such a sought-after certification by employers.To help you prepare for these puzzles, each lab also includes an \\"Ask the Proctor\\" where you can ask for more detail (probably much more than you can get in the exam, but then this is preparation) on a problem. The \\"proctor\\" will tell you that a cleaner solution is intended, but it is only in the \\"Debrief\\" section where you find out that the intention was (for instance) to make it a \\"stub connected\\" interface since it doesn't need to summarize routes, but does need to continue reporting changes in directly connected interfaces (which wouldn't occur with a passive interface).The CD contains not only complete configurations that should be on each switch and router at the end of the lab, but also the expected output of verification (show) commands. This is especially useful because these are the same show commands that the proctors use to grade the actual lab. Being aware of this can help you pick up extra points during the test; for instance, if you are instructed that certain dynamic map entries not show up in a configuration, you can check your work and take whatever action is necessary to remove them.Where this book really fills in some useful gaps is in the landmines and the sparse instructions that come in the CCIE lab. For instance, it will ask you to unicast some routing updates (from, say, RIP) but not to use the neighbor command to do this. This is an application for static NAT using the UDP port for RIP and the RIP multicast address-a seemingly obscure way to do this but knowledge of obscure features and the ability to do the same task in different ways is a large part of what the CCIE lab is intended to test. The difference between a network engineer who knows one way to do things and one who can choose the best between several options can be difference between a gasping network and a solid one.A lot questions will ask for the \\"most efficient\\" way of doing something. In a requested voice configuration, for instance, you may be tempted to jump right into a VoIP configuration, but if the routers that will be transporting the voice traffic are already frame-relay connected, then VoFR is in the intended method. You also have to be careful not to break the data connectivity when you configure the interfaces for VoFR. Then, you might have to ensure that voice is still available if a connection between the routers along the main path fails; this is where you need to configure dial peers for VoIP over ISDN.There are \\"easy\\" requirements in the CCIE lab that break previous configurations, and while you should always be mindful of rechecking your earlier work to make sure it's standing up under the later configurations, you should especially be careful about this when a questions seems like a giveaway.Throughout, the book tells you how many points you might get if you caught this subtlety or that one, and tells you where you might lose a few if you leave off something.Although these labs are geared specifically to the CCIE exam, they speak to issues and best practices that can be applied in the day to day working of a network engineer. (For instance, there are appendixes on Frame Relay and ATM switch configuration, and troubleshooting.) That's why working through these problems has value even if you're not ready to climb to the top of the CCIE pyramid: you can still be that much more confident that you're keeping your network healthy."},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"The CCIE is a moving target.I may be stating the obvious, but before you plunk down this kind of money and spend that kind of time, you might want to check the Cisco web site and see how many chapters are still relevant. At this point the chapters on ATM and DLSw are not."},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"This book is the first actually written by a CCIE proctor so I was really interested more in the comments and de-briefs rather than the actual questions, as there is real ambiguity with some of the wording in the lab.The layout is great, firstly the equipment list, diagrams &amp; instructions then the scenario. Each of the scenario sections are allocated points but I would have liked the author to have been more granular with the points so instead of simply stating BGP 12 points, he could have had:Section (a) Configure EBGP............ 3 PointsSection (b) Configure full mesh IBGP...4 Points, etcAs anyone who has done the lab knows, there is no partial credit.Otherwise the scenarios are right on. I like his Note style whereby he interjects with informatory comments as you progress through the labs. He does explain little tricks &amp; gotcha's along the way.The next section is the Proctor Q&amp;A Section where he answers various relevant questions that may be posed by the candidate.I do feel that he is sometimes a little generous with his repliese.g. Lab 4 Section 2.2 Do I need Mutual Redistribution between EIGRP &amp; OSPF?Ans. A mutual redistribution is not required.Would a proctor really confirm/deny redistribution required in a section? Perhaps I am knit picking.Finally the Lab de-brief section.This is the real gem of the book and absolutely superb. The style is similar to the Internetworkexpert and DoIT Scenarios so really detailed - I was really fascinated with some of the ISDN explanations, which traditionally have always been a killer in the Lab.Conclusion: The book is excellent and a must for any CCIE candidate - Maurilio has done a great job!Final Note:The book consists of 6 Labs not 10 as per the description. The opening 3 labs only have 1 3550 whilst the remaining 3 have dual 3550 [as per CCIE Lab] however this was the authors intent. Finally the book came with no CD! Hence no solutions! I'm sure this will be resolved by Cisco Press at some stage!Stephen Bowes CCIE Candidate [Lab scheduled for 10/2004]"},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"This book was very useful in preparing for the exam and very unique compared to other workbooks that you find on the market to prepare you for the CCIE Routing and Switching Lab. It consists of 6 labs, with the first 3 being the toughest but also the ones that you will learn a lot from.The reasons the book is different are a) The questions are worded in such a way that the solution to the problems is not obvious unless one knows the underlying concepts very thoroughly. That also sharpens the problem solving skills tremendouslyb) The ask the Proctor section is very unique and helpful in more than one way... Firstly, if you do not know the solution to the problem right away, you could turn to that section to see what other hints you have to solve the problem. Secondly and more importantly, it makes you think of various ways you could ask the Proctor questions, when you think that the question is not fully unambiguous to you.The other thing I liked about this workbook is that it is all in one book and you dont have questions on one book, solutions on another and diagrams on another. The only drawback is that the topology diagrams are very small and hard to read, but of course you could always make a blown up photocopy of the diagrams...I highly recommend the book, and at the price, I think it is a MUST buy for anyone attempting the R & S exam.Please note that the book should come with the CD, as it would really be a waste of precious time if you do not have the initial configs."},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"Cisco's CCIE Routing & Switching Lab has always been one of the most coveted certifications in the Networking industry. While CiscoPress publishes a wealth of material concerning the CCIE and the different areas of testing IGPs, BGP, QoS, security, etc..., the same cannot be written of labs to test one's knowledge of the various subjects. I feel \\"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs\\" by Duggan and Gorito is an excellent reference and valiant effort by CiscoPress to resolve this gap.I have studied most of the major 3rd party vendors study aids for the CCIE lab (InternetworkExpert, NMC, IPExpert and ccBootcamp). Even considering the 100s of labs I have studied, I believe this book does something none of the other study materials do - and that is mimic the questions that are asked on the CCIE lab. Each chapter is broken down in two areas - the test and the answers. The difficulty of the exams is not as complex as you will see on the exam - but it is close. If the CCIE had a difficulty rating of 10, I would place the difficulty of this book at about a 6 - 7 (I would place most 3rd party vendors advanced study material at an 11 - yes, harder than the real lab).The book does have some noticeable typos, and you may have to verify your configs on GroupStudy if you are confident that your configurations are correct. For example:-on page 50, the 2nd route-map in example of 1-40 should be set to 20, not 10.-on page 59, example 1-60's last ACL should use 0.0.0.7, not 0.0.0.255-on page 197, example 3-93 should include to deny tcp and udp 445 as mentioned in the first paragraph.There are many books a CCIE candidate will need on his shelf to help attain their digits. This is the rare CiscoPress book that the candidate should use only when they are near the culmination of their studies.I give this book 5 pings out of 5:!!!!!"},{"Title":"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs","review":"This is a good book for general practice studying and feel the format of the real test.

The title \\"CCIE Routing and Switching Practice Labs\\" (ISBN: 1587051478) by Martin J. Duggan and Maurilio de Paula Gorito has opened my eyes to the challenges of obtaining the certification.I have found this title to be the most useful resource I have found to date. The title goes beyond technical details and into the actual nuts and bolts of what makes obtaining the CCIE certification such a worthy feat. I liken the CCIE Lab as well as the CCIE written similar to a series of brainteaser.The title is comprised of six different labs which each lab has a particular focus to fine tune your understanding of the \`focus' technology. It's one thing to know how to implement a technology, but the labs take you beyond normal implementations. After working through a lab, you'll gain knowledge of the technologies that you may never have considered otherwise. These labs help you intimately understand the technologies.Some people focus on learning intricate details pertaining to a technology. For example, what a protocol structure looks like for a particular feature and how it functions, which is truly needed knowledge. As this title proves, you can know all about the technical details of a technology, but being able to apply the technology using all the applicable possibilities to accomplish a certain task is where the rubber meets the road.One of the best sections that I've found useful is the \\"Ask the Proctor\\" section. The reason this section is so useful is that the labs are presented as if you where given the assignment in the actual certification exam. In other word, the labs are initially present to challenge you to accomplish the lab with no other assistance or information. This is where \\"Ask the Proctor\\" comes in. It gives you a taste of what to expect when seeking out clarity for a particular task. In a nut shell, your question need to be very well thought out and don't expect answers from the Proctor to be revealing. This is what makes this title so great because it gives you a true taste of what to expect.Each lab has a supporting diagram accompanied by several configuration and command screen outputs, at the appropriate times. The book comes with a CDROM that has each lab configuration for each device. The labs are well organized through a GUI application that makes the labs easy to find and implement.I would highly recommend this title for anyone that is either considering pursuing the CCIE certification or gung ho to get certified. If you're considering pursuing the CCIE certification, this title may save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars and possibly humble you at the same time. If you're gung ho, this is great economical resource. If it helps you make an extra 20 points, it may be the only thing standing in your way of passing the test and achieving your goal.After reading this title, I feel better prepared for the CCIE Lab. The biggest thing I've gained from reading this book is an understanding of the rules of the game."},{"Title":"Katharine Hepburn","review":"Upon reading this book, one gets the unmistakable impression that Edwards has gone a lot further than just trying to demystify Hepburn with &quot;objective&quot; opinions. While it never explicitly ridicules Hepburn, I think the tone is subtly anti-Hepburn. Indeed, praise for the great actress comes almost reluctantly, and often after the author has already expressed her own negative opinion, which permanently detracts from the Hepburn persona. (For eg, (1) The author's reasoning for Hepburn's defiance of contemporary fashion, (2) The strange correlation of the presence of (girlish?) stuffed toys in Hepburn's house with the idea that Hepburn might not have thought of herself as a strong woman.It is quite clear that Hepburn has not been interviewed for this book. The title &quot;A Remarkable Woman&quot; itself seems contrived and shallow, when we read the last paragraph of the book, where the title is (unsatisfactorily) explained. I fear that a reader with no prior information about Hepburn, will come away with an incorrect picture of Hepburn as just another Hollywood actress, (with some redeeming quirks) who had her share of ups and downs. In my opinion, Andrew Britton's work (Katharine Hepburn, Star as Feminist), though not biographical, is the best critical appreciation of Hepburn's film roles and, by extension, of Hepburn, who was often described as transferring her own qualities to her roles, rather than completely adapting herself to them."},{"Title":"Katharine Hepburn","review":"A wonderful light and enjoyable read. The book was in top notch condition. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who shares the same interest in Katherine Hepburn."},{"Title":"Katharine Hepburn","review":"I found this book to be quite an in-depth view into the life of Katherine Hepburn, an elusive star. It offers a back-stage view of the life of an icon and the struggles and triumphs that are associated with that responsibility. I would definitly recommend this book to those interested in the genre."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Yankee: The Tale of a Country Girl Who Became a Princess","review":"This gem of a book deserves to be read by more people. Ostensibly this book is the story of a woman born in New England who goes on to become a princess in Germany and along the way play an important role in both the US Civil War and Mexican Civil War.But this book is more than just a simple biography of a remarkable woman. It gives the reader a very good sense of the US as a young Republic and the type of society it was then.It is interesting to read, for example, that on the eve of Civil War, the US, a Republic which was suspicious of a large standing army, had an army of only 50,000 men and had to depend partly on imported professional soldiers from Europe to sustain its war effort.Or that The White House was not an imperial place in those days and had open house parties for its citizens, some of whom were in the habit of snipping off bits of curtains as souvenirs.Robert White has done his research well, telling the story of a girl who from humble beginnings makes it to the top by sheer force of personality and a bit of luck, and doing it all in a racy, page turning, style. The story is well anchored in the social and political currents of the times, which were very much in turmoil.The book describes in detail a cast of colorful characters ranging from a pretender to the throne of Mexico to an assortment noble and evil people from the military and the aristocracy of both Europe and the US.The author, who hails from New England himself and who has travelled to the far corners of the world, writes with a keen eye for details of the locations and characters. One can discern in the book a sense of regret at the passing of an age, which for whatever its faults, was a more gracious era than the one we live and where people took their duties and responsibilities seriously, instead looking for reasons to evade them.The maxim for a good story teller has always been that he should &quot;show and not tell&quot;. This book, by weaving the story of a real woman, educates us in conditions of nineteenth century Europe, America, and Mexico more than any history book that I have read.Readers who are interested in the formative years of the American republic, as well as those who are looking for a good story are well advised to go out and buy this book.N.

The themes Will addresses in the columns -- the role of government, the coarsening of culture, etc. -- continue to resonate. This is an excellent resource for anyone trying to get a feel for American culture from 1977-81. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Virtue and Other Tory Notions","review":"\\"The Pursuit of Virtue & Other Tory Notions\\" is George F. Will's second collection of columns, covering the time period from the beginning of 1978 to the first days of the Reagan presidency in 1981.The size and role of government is a perennial topic for debate in our national life, and Will describes his views on this important question. He asserts that capitalism, while certainly a necessary facet of a free society, does tend to undermine traditional social structures and values, and draws a distinction between libertarian conservatism and a conservatism that believes that government should be used as an instrument of conservative values. Will thought that virtue was indispensable to ordered liberty, and urged that liberty should never be allowed to degenerate into license.The Cold War looked bleak for the West in the late Seventies, and Will encouraged America not to be nave concerning the Soviet threat. In addition to the standoff with the Soviet Union, inflation and the Iranian hostage crisis were troubling the nation in 1980--this led to Ronald Reagan's election, and the author has several columns describing that historic event.Some of the individual figures that Will wrote columns about in this volume are John Wayne, Hubert Humphrey, John Paul II, Alger Hiss, Strom Thurmond, Harold Macmillan, and Ray Kroc. There are a couple of baseball columns and some columns describing Will's family life. Will even takes up the issues of semicolons and the dearth of bells in our lives today.The book is yet another home run by a top-flight political and social commentator."},{"Title":"The Pursuit of Virtue and Other Tory Notions","review":"A readable collection from the early career of today's dean of Beltway Republican columnists.George Will is an honest man. He wore the big-government conservative badge without shame even as other Reaganites, arriving fresh to the Imperial City in 1980, still had stars in their eyes about rolling back the welfare state. Will's half-smiling realism is the key to his longevity and success.\\"The Pursuit of Virtue and Other Tory Notions\\" helpfully corrects misconceptions that equate conservatism with the free market and limited government. Sorry, Rush Limbaugh, they're not the same things.Will's critique of capitalism is on target yet incomplete. The author writes from an altruist/collectivist perspective that causes him to attribute vices to inanimate systems rather than human actors. \\"Capitalism\\" and \\"liberty\\" may open the door to vice but the responsibility for the existence of vice belongs to its human practitioners. Although ideas do have consequences (as Richard Weaver famously wrote) \\"socialism\\" isn't responsible for the mass murders committed in its name; the human agents who carried out the atrocities are. Ditto Christianity. Ditto Islam. Ditto nationalism. Ditto (fill in the blank).In supporting and defending an ethos that \\"true conservatism demands strong government,\\" Will underestimates the role the growth of government has played in undermining traditional institutions including the family. When parents have to work ridiculous hours to pay ridiculous taxes that support ridiculous government spending -- inevitably leaving less time for child rearing, spiritual pursuits, and general reflection -- then tradition is in trouble.Will's collectivism pops out again and again in that he can't seem to grasp that the pursuit of virtue must be a largely private matter. Thus statements like \\"...A capitalist society requires an especially elevating political leadership that summons citizens from private pursuits to public spiritedness.\\" Will seems to believe that government can re-moralize society. John O'Sullivan, then-editor of National Review, rounded on this Ivy League-brand \\"conservatism\\" when he once told Rush Limbaugh Show listeners that \\"the government's idea of morality is to prohibit adult smoking yet pass out condoms to pre-teens!\\" And for those who think the Democrats are solely to blame, we have Rabbi Mayer (Craig) Schiller in 1997: \\"Republicans and conservatives have won and lost elections over the years but our steady slide into the abyss has never been halted.\\" Without limited government, Will will continue to find widespread pursuit of virtue elusive.Back to Will on capitalism -- he calls it \\"an inflamer of appetites.\\" Nice try but the yeast in the dough is -- as Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihin documents so well in \\"Leftism Revisited\\" -- envy. We must stop coveting our neighbors' goods. And we must learn to say \\"no,\\" especially to ourselves.Pat Buchanan writes in an upcoming book (\\"Day of Reckoning\\") that the essence of conservatism is \\"preserving the true, the good, and the beautiful.\\" That's actually Step 2. Step 1 is learning to say \\"no\\" to bad ideas. If your reflex is not \\"no\\" then chances are you're not a conservative regardless of how you may vote or perceive yourself.Sadly, Nancy Reagan didn't take the \\"Just Say No\\" campaign beyond illegal drugs. Had she we might be celebrating a real Reagan Revolution today instead of the false one that delusional Republicans comfort themselves with. Perhaps 2008 presidential candidate Ron Paul (a.k.a. Dr. No) will pick up Nancy's fallen batton.Capitalism could certainly do with more ambassadors like the Chofetz Chaim, the Jewish sage who closed his store at precisely the time he had enough money for sabbath provisions and weekday sustenance so that neighboring merchants could do more trade. This is what is meant by \\"Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself.\\"Today's it's against the American Religion to close a store for more than a few hours. Is capitalism or libertarianism the reason for this? No, it's the fault of low-character business operators consumed with envy, fear (of being different), and the inability to say \\"no.\\"Will's logic (at my own, at times) leads one to think another Great Depression might stimulate people's moral fiber. Some would slow down, take stock of themselves, and climb spiritually. But many would go the other way.Will, an astute observer of human nature, understands this on a practical level. Accordingly, the author of \\"The Pursuit of Virtue and Other Tory Notions\\" never completely dismisses morally-neutral capitalism.It's interesting to read dispatches from the beginnings of the Religious Right, the burgeoning of government-sanctioned gambling and other matters in full political bloom 25 years later. As always, our columnist brings learning, sobriety, and wit to the subjects. Amid a multiplication of hammerheaded fellow travelers, George F. Will continues to be the best advertising for big-government conservatism."},{"Title":"A Grand Man","review":"Little Mary Ann and her family are poor and live inMulhattan's Hall.

Her father is an alcoholic and her mother is thinking of leaving him. But Mary Ann truly believes her da is a grand man and in between fighting with Sarah and sticking her tongue out the window, we see how devoted Mary Ann is to her father and very much in denial about his problem. Towards the end, however, Mary Ann sees the truth and she makes one last attempt to keep her parents together. Can this eight year old girl attain her father a job and a cottage and keep her parents together while she does so??This is not up to Cookson's usual flair. It has a childish feel to it. I do not think the young adult crowd would quite understand the humor injected into tho. Thus, three stars."},{"Title":"A Grand Man","review":"I loved this book, Mary Ann and her worse enemy Sarah Flannigan kept me laughing out loud.

His novels cover much of American history, both in time and place, from Alaska to the Gulf, from colonial days to the jet age.

He joins Caesar's army and rises through the ranks gaining respect and the friendship of the lowest decurion to even the great Caesar. There are some great battle narrations, diagrams of roman bases, and tons of latin words and phrases.

It tells the story of a young man whose family was killed by bandits and is left alone in the world. He joins the Roman Legion, serves under Julius Caesar, and has exciting adventures. I reread it many, many times. In the story, virtue (including courage, industriousness, and resourcefulness) is rewarded, which gives it an uplifting message. I recommend the book highly: not only does it have a good story, but the author had researched the ancient Romans extensively and it goes a wonderful job of presenting history and Roman life in a palatable fashion.Fortunately, this is but one book of a series!

I thought it was really cool because my grandfather wrote it -- no kidding, I really am Paul L. Anderson's grandson.Then I read it, and I discovered just what a wonderful story it is. Mandorix is a credible hero, and as the first-person narrator he weaves a tale at once compelling and educational. Along with the companion volumes in Anderson's Roman Life and Times series, this book motivated me to study Latin, a pursuit I still enjoy some 50 years after I first read of Gaius Iulius Caesar and Dumnorix, of Quintus Rufus and Carnifex, of the foppish Quintus Cicero and his magnificent stand against Ambiorix.Hmm, I think it's probably about time for me to read it again.

It drew me in from the first page - I could not put it down easily. I was there when the main character was playing dice in the camp, I was behind him in the battles.

Although I eventually failed the class, much of the \\"Omni Gauli dividindes tress partes\\" and other Latin phrases seemed to ferment in my memory banks. However, I never...never, forgot... \\"With the Eagles.\\" It initially, took me about twenty years to locate a copy of it long before the advent of the internet.

My father gave it to me, since he had read it as a boy. Knowing Roman history makes it all the better, although I imagine it would still be good without. Definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"With the Eagles (v. 1)","review":"Paul L. Anderson's \\"With the Eagles,\\" appears to be the first book published in his marvelous \\"Roman Life and Times Series.\\"The book inserts a fictional character, a young Gaul named Mandorix, into many of the true events depicted in Julius Caesar's \\"The Gallic Wars: Julius Caesar's Account of the Roman Conquest of Gaul.\\" As in most of Anderson's books, the hero tells his tale in first person.As the story opens, a young Gaul named Mandorix is beset with tragedy and decides to follow in is father's footsteps by joining Caesars legions. Mandorix' adventure starts from the first page and doesn't let up until the story ends. The young warrior encounters many physical and moral trials as he distinguishes himself in battle and advances through the ranks because of his heroism, audacity, and gift for strategy.As winter falls, the legions are short of grain and the subject tribes are restless. Caesar divides his camps and grain stores across Gaul in order to conserve resources and quell any attempts at rebellion. But dividing his forces leaves him open to attack.In 54BC, on the Belgian frontier, a clever, double-crossing chieftain named Ambiorix wiped out a legion and united local tribes to lay siege to another legion camp. Rebellion is in the air and the normally independent tribes are beginning to see the benefits of working together. The situation is grim and messengers seeking help from Caesar are unable to get through the enemy territory. Mandorix volunteers to don native garb and undertake the dangerous mission.The period covered in this story precedes the famous rebellion led by Vercingetorix by two years. (I believe the Gaulish uprising is covered in Anderson's next book, \\"For Freedom and for Gaul\\".\\"). This is a very pivotal time for Rome and the events in Gaul provide Gaius Juluis Caesar with the power and impetus to become emperor.As always, Anderson's writing is elegant and his sense of time and place is gripping. The battle scenes are riveting and Mandorix is both clever and compelling as a narrator.On its own or as a companion piece to \\"The Conquest of Gaul,\\" this novel is a great read."},{"Title":"With the Eagles (v. 1)","review":"I read this years ago when I was in Junior High.

It features a pair of supporting characters from the 'Spawn' comic book series, but there's nary a superhero or super-demon in sight--save for a brief but humourous appearance by Spawn himself. Instead, we have Sam and Twitch returning to the police force... and immediately becoming embroiled in their strangest case yet, while having to fend off crooked cops and I.A. officers with unknowable motivations.Bendis has woven an excellent story with this work, and Angel Medina's art has come a long way since I first saw him working with Barry Blair on the Nightwynd line of comics. I still see some Blair-like influences here and there in Medina's work (not a Bad Thing... I was quite fond of Blair Aircel material years ago), but Medina is coming along nicely as an artist with his own style.I've never been much of a Spawn fan, but this is an excellent graphic novel, and I'll be looking for future volumes. Sam and Twitch are a pair of nice additions to the crime genre. I would, in fact, have given the book Five Stars if not for some poor production value... sometimes, the dialogue (which is presented without the traditional comic book bubbles) get lost against the toned art, and at other times it is lost in the gutter of the binding. It's a distraction that pulls one out of the otherwise engaging read."},{"Title":"Sam and Twitch, Book 1: Udaku","review":"Ever since my first viewing of the Spawn HBO animated series, the seemingly mismatched NYPD partners Sam Burke and Max \`Twitch' Williams have topped my list of favorite comic book characters. Naturally, when TMP/ Image released a \`Sam And Twitch' ongoing comic book, I snapped up the first issue in a heartbeat, and enjoyed just about every panel of action and words. Brian Michael Bendis's writing and the eerily McFarlane-esque renderings of Angel Medina and Jonathan Glapion really gave the series' first story arc, \\"Udaku\\", the look &amp; feel of a hard-boiled detective story with conspiracy intrigue reminiscent of the \\"X-Files\\" and a bit of \\"NYPD Blue\\"- style attitude. The pacing is unbelievably swift at times; although the TPB runs for about 180 pages, I find it to go by quickly. The dialogue that is depicted- the little halts and bits of stuttering here and there, the emphasis, inflection- is remarkable when \\"seen\\" by the minds' eye (heard by the minds' ear?). The captions aren't couched in word balloons, so you're able to see more of the art behind the words.As this caper unfolds, the in-jokes and gags written and illustrated into this story become apparent. One scene in a pawn shop features a certain home-run ball \\"formerly\\" owned by a certain comic-book mogul. One of the chapters starts out at a Kiss (who have a monthly Image book ) concert. In one scene, our heroes begin looking through mafia case files featuring the names of the books' three collaborators- Bendis, Medina, and Glapion- on the subject tabs. Their names pop up again on a few newspaper headlines at a Grand Central Station newsstand during one of the books' climactic moments. Also on display at the stand are issues of the Kiss comic and \`Jinx', one of Bendis's earliest comic book gigs. There's even a brief appearance by Spawn, in a scene that takes a jab at the gimmick of using guest-star super heroes in other super hero books. It's also a message to the reader that the S &amp; T comic series is not another Spawn franchise book. This is the less-than-dynamic duos' show all the way, and don't you forget it!But now you're probably wondering why I gave the TPB three stars when I enjoyed the story, art, and the silly sideline moments so much. The problem I have with this collection is in the presentation. The powers that be at Image/TMP (Todd McFarlane, \`natch) decided to give this collection more of a Sam Spade \`crime noir' movie look by reprinting it in greyscale black and white instead of its original full-color format. The many subtle shades and contrasts that were apparent in the single issues are now obscured in the black and white conversion, and a few of the more vital visual elements are harder to see or can't be perceived at all. And since McFarlane has stated that he stands by his decision to present the collected Udaku chapters in this manner despite fanboy complaints, it's doubtful a color Udaku TPB will ever be released.Another problem: the binding is set a bit too deeply. I take a look at one of the many two-page splashes or other similar actions that take space right in the middle of the book, and a little bit of the art and captions are hidden in the deep binding. It's like an Al Jaffee MAD magazine fold-in gone horribly wrong.And my last gripe, albeit a weird one, is a very small change of dialogue. One of Sam's lines in the original book has been \`corrected' in the TPB. In the third issue, he says in one panel, \\"I had to take a squirt. Shot of Barbara\\". The \\"Shot of Barbara\\" line was actually a description of the panel from a rough draft of the issue's script that somehow got added into the character dialogue by accident. But even though it was a mistake, I felt that the line fit perfectly, and gave the scene the right tone. It was one of those one-in-a-billion moments where the error worked better, and should've been left alone instead of being corrected. Heavy sigh...If you're looking to check out this amazing crime drama in full color without the art being obscured or dialogue changes, I recommend you grab up the original issues 1 through 8 instead of the TPB. And you better get \`em quick! Thanks to his writing efforts on \\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\", \\"Powers\\", and other titles, Bendis is on the fast track to comic book stardom, and just about any earlier works of his are sure to be in high demand. And you fanboys out there know what happens to the value of suddenly-in-high-demand funnybooks...\`Late"},{"Title":"Sam and Twitch, Book 1: Udaku","review":"This was an awesome graphic novel!

My name's Sam, so I said, hey, I'll buy it. It was really interesting, so when I saw the TPB for sale and happened to have the correct amount of money in my pocket, I picked it up. And the book amazed me.The characters are interesting, and are far from the standard &quot;two badass, muscular cops laying the smackdown...on crime.&quot; Sam is a fat, disgusting bear. Twitch is a little twig, with a kind of mad scientist/stick figure look. But the two really complement each other well. Their dialogue and interaction was well done, and surpisingly real at points. Great writing throughout.The art was great and the panels were laid out in a manner that was slightly offsetting at first, but laid out an logical path for the eye to follow.Although some have complained about the series being printed in black and white, I honestly enjoyed it more than the color form. It really made it feel much more like the grittier crime noir movies and old-school comic books that inspired this book.So, it's a great book, but nonetheless there are problems. The first is that there seems to be no margin on the sides of the paper, and thus the binding takes out some of the middle of pages. This is only really a problem with the full page spreads, but is really upsetting since it can totally ruin the flow. The fourth page features an awesome spread of Sam and Twitch, with Spawn in the background...and Twitch's face is totally distorted by being set in too deep. The second and last is that it seemed to me two often that panels in a succession zoomed in on a character's eyes up to the pupil.These complaints don't take away from the book, though. Get it, and you'll almost certainly enjoy it."},{"Title":"Sam and Twitch, Book 1: Udaku","review":"This is another production from Todd Mcfarlane, maker of the famous Spawn. The concept is based on a intrigueing down-to-earth, no super hero setting. The story is a standard cop plot, nothing new, however the characters are very interesting and distinctive for their own unique qualities. The art of this graphic novel is superb, even for black and white. The style of spawn is easily reconizable while new aspects bloom from the cold and dark New York setting. The comic scenes are well drawn and set up so action and movie cinema can play fluidly in your mind. Action scenes will make you want to play with action figures like when you were five years old. The pictures are very discreptive/detailed, with a heavy dose of expresion in every street and police officer. The story is geared to action while comedy spurts in every once in a while. The main characters are a duo of misfit cops which enrich the story considerably, with their unpredictable behavior and action. Conclusively, I'd give two thumbs up for the visuals (you actually might need a third thumb for this level of work). And the story... eh, not much. Characters were good too. I would definitly encourage all comic enthusiasts to buy this masterpiece (ya get the bang for your buck). I'd also recomend this comic to anybody who has even heard of the name \\"spawn\\"."},{"Title":"Sam and Twitch, Book 1: Udaku","review":"I HATE SPAWN. Absolutely hate him. I've read a few Spawn-related books, and haven't liked one of them. I picked up Sam and Twitch: Udaku because of writer Brian Michael Bendis alone. I'm a big fan of his work on books like Powers and Ultimate Spider-Man. So.....For the first half of the book it seemed like the &quot;Curse&quot; would hold true for Udaku. It just didn't hold my interest. I fixated on the numerous production problems, like- A)- Art being lost in the binding. This was especially troubling in the double-page spreads. In addition, the art itself doesn't flow smoothly; Page after page is crammed with 16-panel grids, and when you put pages like that side by side, the eye doesn't know which way to read- side to side across both pages, or one page at at a time. It got irritating after a while. I mostly blame that on problem B)- The black-and-white format. McFarlane says in his foreword it's to preserve the &quot;Film-Noir&quot; feel, but I think it's just cheapness on his part. For a Black-and-white book, Udaku is WAAY too pricey, and as with other books that were meant to be presented in color, the art in the book, not being drawn specifically FOR the black-and-white medium, is hard to follow at points; It's too cluttered and busy. Too many fine lines all blending together. And finally, C)- Word baloons didn't become prevalent for nothing. The dialogue floating around in the panels, with a squiggly line pointing to the character who is speaking doesn't work in a panel with five or six characters. I often had NO idea who was saying what to whom. Bad idea.The story picks up in the fifth chapter, as we find out just who or what Udaku IS, leading up to what may be the most cinematic finale I've ever seen in a comic. I thought the revelation of the killer proved to be a little too Sci-Fi for my tastes, and I still don't really understand the signifigance of the body parts at the crime scenes. Bendis might have been better served by leaving the more far-fetched aspects of the tale on the cutting-room floor, but overall, Udaku had SLIGHTLY more pro than con going for it."},{"Title":"Ashes To Ashes","review":"The cardinal has made the decision to close St. Bernadette's Parochial School.

And indeed the heroine of &quot;One Good Turn&quot; is a truly a very extraordinary lady.The Duke of Knaresborough is trying (but not really succeeding) very hard to come to terms with the fact that Libby Ames has not only rejected him, but has found happiness with her splendid but ordinary husband, Dr. Cook. In an effort to take his mind of Libby and his current unhappiness, the duke has agreed to take his young neice to his country estate so that she will not contract chickenpox form her infant brother. However while on the road, the duke discovers to his horror that his niece has contracted chickenpox after all, and he's not sure if he can cope with a sick, fractious child. Fortunately for the duke, Miss Liria Valencia and her young five year old son appear on the scene. And although he takes Liria to be no more than a Spanish camp follower, who had given birth out of wedlock, her ability to deal with the crisis at hand and her calm manner impresses the duke no end, and impulsively he offers her a job as his housekeeper. The more contact he has with Liria, the more he is intrigued by her. Who is this mysterious Spanish woman who seems more than able to run a duke's household and who possesses the dignity and demeanor of one far above her station? What brought to England? And why does she refuse to return to Spain? Ever curious, the duke sets out to discover the secrets that Liria harbors in order to help a lady who is becoming of increasing importance to him.I know that I've said this about quite a few Regency romance novels lately, but this time it's really true: this is a romance novel that is out of the ordinary! After a steady diet of flirty heroines and rakish heroes, this book was a novel experience. Liria is certainly unlike most heroines that one would expect from a Signet Regency romance novel: she's a heroine that has had a truly hard and horrendous past (her war experiences do not make for easy reading), but who because of her inner strength and indomitable spirit, managed to survive. Some readers may find this novel a little disappointing, because romance-wise, not much happens until the last two chapters. The bulk of the book deals with the duke coming to terms with himself -- his strengths, his weaknesses, his inner demons, and how he wants to go on; as well as the mystery that surrounds Liria. It's a sobering book, as well as a cathartic one -- it runs the gamut from pain and horror to tears and joy. This is definitely a romance novel for readers who need some substance to their 'cream cake' romance diet.Personally, I loved this novel, and will be holding on to it for some time."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"One Good Turn has been a long awaited book for those of us who greatly admire Carla Kelly so, first of all, a simple and heartfelt thank you to the author for this book - one I thought she might never write.It's been interesting to read the comments about it. I won't go into the plot because it has been well summed up elsewhere. I would, however, like to make a few brief comments about other matters.First of all, yes, as a &quot;reader from Europe&quot; says, there are a few inaccuracies and &quot;Americanisms&quot; in this book. This is something I myself am often critical of as an American living in England for it really annoys me when authors make what appear to me as very obvious blunders. However, I have to say I didn't see the errors here as particularly significant as when Edith Layton has made similar. Kelly, like Layton, creates characters who are so strong and believable that you just don't care because they shine through any mistakes.This is a book about growing up, in essence. We met Benedict Nesbitt, Duke of Knare, in Libby's London Merchant. Again, this was a book which has a flaw in research but which Kelly magnificently owned up to in the recent reissue. In LLM, Nez did not get his lady; she instead gave herself to a man who had fully matured, was comfortable in his own skin and knew where he was going. In LLM, and at the beginning of OGT, Nez was still looking for a life path.The reader who said that the historical setting seemed unreal perhaps is not familiar with the history of the Peninsular War. Those who are will know that Badajoz was a turning point in the struggle against Napoleon. By 1812, the British troops were hardened from a long and hard campaign, the seige of the city was grim and losses on the allied side incredibly high. I have been to Badajoz and Cuidad Rodrigo (site of another difficult seige) and have seen the places the British Army fought. Descriptions I have read of the fight before the glacis are horrible; layers of still warm bodies as others climbed over them to get ladders to the walls and bastions. It was, as Wellington himself admitted, unforgiveable what the troops on entering the city did but it does not compare with some of the things the French did. And, Kelly describes it and the feelings it left in some of those involved so well. I have read memoires from survivors and she has truly let us have an informed look at the whole event. So, hats off for this; she has done a wonderful job.Nez grows up in this book. He looks at his relationships with his fellow Army officers and his troops, with his father, mother and sister, his former love, Libby and her wonderful husband Dr Tony Cook. What he does is learn to accept the past knowing that he cannot change it and then to look forward by giving love and support to another victim of the past, Liria and her little son Juan. The relationship between Nez and his wonderful butler, Luster, is very well drawn; rather like the wonderful servants in Gayle Wilson's historical books. Who can help but fall in love with Nez, a man who finally learns his self worth and is capable of offering so much.All in all, this is a wonderful, superior read. When I compare it with some of the other regency fiction around, it truly transcends some of it. Carla Kelly creates high tension, adult relationships, strong characterisations and draws settings which for the most part are believable and accurate. I love the way she often tells her stories from the male perspective, letting us share their thoughts and emotions. Please, please, Carla Kelly, keep writing. Please, please, please."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"It has been a bad year for me for finding good romance novels. Typically, I make it 100 pages into one and find the book so unbelievable that I pack it in. Kelly's book delivers all the way though. If possible, she tops herself, and renders a solid A or A+ romance novel. &quot;One Good Turn,&quot; contains not a single clich&eacute; and that is a rarity indeed in romance publishing 2001. Jane Austen would certainly be glad to see Kelly carrying on her legacy. I suspect that she might be horrified to see some of the products which emerged in 2001 from her kicking off things with P&amp;P, however. I know I am. Although Kelly typically does not write about dukes and earls, she does so in this novel. Nez is a duke who fought during the Napoleonic Wars in Spain. Although he has his own problems recovering from those battles and decisions, his woe is nothing compared to a woman and her son that he meets one night when a carriage breaks down. This is Liria and she is a survivor of a Spanish town that the English looted, pillaged and rapined after finally bringing the French partisan town down. Nez was one of the officers in that siege. Kelly's publisher also brought out two earlier books of hers, &quot;Libby's London Merchant&quot; and &quot;Miss Chartley's Guided Tour.&quot; Those novels have been selling for $10-$20 apiece in online auctions used before this reissue, the demand for Kelly's work was so high. My advice is to snap up all 3 of these books at once. I think many readers may enjoy reading the books back to back. Of the 3 Kelly books available right now, I'd recommend reading them in this order: &quot;Libby's London Merchant,&quot; &quot;One Good Turn,&quot; and &quot;Miss Chartley's Guided Tour.&quot; I think the readerholic could have a heck of a reading weekend with this trio of books. I was not planning on voting in the All About Romance website romance novel poll this year but Kelly's book changed my mind, if only because I must vote for her book in a number of key categories. I sure hope she wins."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"If you're looking for a lighthearted romance and the typical heroine with nothing more to worry about than which dress to wear to Almack's, look elsewhere. This book with its flawed hero and resilient heroine shows us the other side of the Regency era: the poverty that welcomed the common soldiers as they returned home after their sufferings on the Continent, the psychological scars that lingered in the minds of every man, woman, or child who lived through the horrors of war, regardless of rank. And frankly, this is the first I've ever heard of the atrocities committed by BRITISH troops at Badajoz. The British are always the GOOD guys in these stories, after all. How easy it is to forget that war is, by definition, an ugly thing!Having only recently been introduced to the hero in &quot;Libby's London Merchant,&quot; I must admit that I was disappointed to discover that his heroine was a Spanish camp follower with a son--certainly a far cry from Libby, whose marriage to another man had left him broken-hearted in the previous story. But I had to find out what happened to Nez because--I admit it--I fell in love with him myself and wanted to make sure he was well taken care of!As I finished the book--through a veil of tears--I can truthfully say that Liria and Nez complete each other in a way that Libby and Nez could never have done if they had married. This is more than a romance; it is a meeting of souls who have survived deep pain and become stronger because of it. I'd give it TEN stars if I could, in spite of the numerous errors in Spanish grammar that I noticed.Brava, Ms. Kelly! Let's have more like this one!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"If you read Regencies for escapism only, skip this! If you like a well crafted book, with an excellent story, THIS IS FOR YOU! The story has depth and substance. These are real people, who have been to hell and back. Any one who knows any history, knows that Badajoz and Waterloo left terrible marks on those who were there.There is, however, nothing depressing about the story. There is some sadness, but a great deal of hope. The people tie themnselves to you so that it is a hard book to put down. There are also two charming children to bring joy to the lighter moments.This is definately a well written book and one to savor. I can not tell, how much I enjoyed it. I hope Mz Kelly has a non-Regency in her future! A real book that will make the Times Best Seller list!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I have read every Carla Kelly book published, and this one does not disappoint. But be prepared: This is not your standard regency -- a comedy of manners, the marriage mart or the foibles of the &quot;ton&quot; -- this is a real example of the other side of the period, one we read so little about. The fine thing about Ms. Kelly is that her characters are so human you want to invite them to dinner. I wish I knew a Nez or a Liria, or even a Luster or Gussie, people who come alive in the pages of this really fine book. I used to read Regencies all the time but got a bit tired of the 17-year-old, bubble-headed heroines and they ceased to be interesting to read about because the plots were all the same. This book will make you think, bring you a different perspective of the period and give you a glimpse of people with depth. I cannot recommend this book any higher -- out of a five-star choice, this book is a 10. Ms. Kelly, I could read one of your books every week all year and never get tired of them. Please continue giving us moments of pleasure...."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"While I enjoy the works of a variety of authors, only two authors (so far) are on my auto-buy list, and for slightly different reasons - Carla Kelly, and Madeline Hunter. Let me explain why Kelly is an auto-buy (that means I buy her new, immediately). She is one of the few authors willing to write about the darker side of Regency life consistently, without being explicit. That does not mean her characters do not feel passion or desire (or any of the other emotions). Such emotions are part of their backstory (their past history). But Kelly's books are almost PG in their content. The only reason they would be rated PG-13 is that terrible things have happened in the past (or will happen in the course of the story) to the hero or heroine.One such book, which I strongly recommended in the past, is MISS MILTON SPEAKS HER MIND. Another is THE LADY'S COMPANION. Both books are warmly appreciated by Kelly's fans, although the former is a very dark book at times. And now, Kelly comes back to the Regency fans with a sequel (long-awaited) to LIBBY'S LONDON MERCHANT, a book still in print as I speak, in one of Signet's new double titles. What a wonderful build-up to her latest novel!The story has been beautifully described by another reviewer. To say more would be to give so much away. Run, don't walk, to your bookstore or order this from Amazon. [I love the fact that Kelly's title is at 1,000-something in sales, well above Julia Quinn's and the others - as much as I respect them. Who says traditional Regency fans don't buy books? Note to myself - buy a couple more copies to send to friends I have newly converted to really good Regencies, along with LLM].Among the titles I have liked and loved over the past few months, this will stand high. It is not an easy read. Kelly is not a light amusing read (usually); she explores darker (but not necessarily deviant) sides of human action and inaction. In this book, she completes the partial redemption of a man who was incapable of appreciating the true worth of another good woman, and how! Liria's story will bring tears to your eyes. [Fans of Georgette Heyer's THE SPANISH BRIDE, beginning with a scene in Badajoz, will appreciate this all the more].I do hope that Kelly - and the editors out there - are encouraged to continue publishing good traditional Regencies. Recently I have been trying a variety of new authors, and have only found a few promising gems. While I came late to Kelly (after discovering Balogh), I was quickly converted. For the record, most of her books are out-of-print and very hard-to-find. Look up her back titles in your public library, try to buy them through Amazon and other sources, or badger the publisher to print more double titles."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"ONE GOOD TURN is absolutely the best regency I've read this year. In fact, it's the best book I've read this year. It may be the best book I've read in several years. Not only is it a rivetting read, it's ennobling. When very, very bad things happen to good people, how do they survive? How do they pick themselves up and go on? How do they refuse to carry the evil forward? How do they retain kindliness of spirit? The strength of hope and human compassion shines in this book. It's so much more than just some here this month, gone the next paperback romance. And yet it doesn't hit you over the head with &quot;message&quot;. It has been a long, long time since I read something so moving. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"The heck with the terms hero and heroine! This was a REAL MAN and a REAL WOMAN pitted against one of the most horrific battles of our time; even though that was mostly backstory, it was sooo important. This was just an amazing, heartbreaking story with a most poignant ending. I was also impressed at how Ms. Kelly was able to insert just enough appropriate humor without belittling the characters OR the storyline. The emotion of the characters overrode any inconsistencies in the story for me. I was so deeply involved in the happenings between the key characters, I didn't notice much of anything else.I would certainly read Ms. Kelly's work, again!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"This was the first book of this author that I have read and I liked it so much (although I did wonder how Liria could end up as such a together person after what she had been through - though I am glad that she did) that I am now collecting the rest of Ms. Kelly's books (and have read several more, of which The Lady's Companion was especially a &quot;keeper&quot; for me). The characters were very vivid and the writing was quite enjoyable and interesting. Hopefully Ms. Kelly will, indeed, write more of these very appealing regencies (one of Nez's friends, perhaps, so we can hear how he and his new bride are doing)!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Wow, this book is one of those you either love or hate if you read all the reviews. I liked it very much. The writing was excellent and the story compelling!It is a dark and disturbing tale which might be good to know before you read it. This type of story causes those of us used to light-hearted tales to do some soul searching. Most books do not show the barbarism of war or mention the violence perpetrated against the innocent. Benedict and Liria are both victims tortured by their war experiences. Their journey to love is a path strewn with self-hate and denial. We catch glimpses of their torment along the way. There is not a tremendous amount of romance in this book, but there is a tremendous amount of love! Amazingly, this story centers completely around the duke unlike other Regencies. There was so much caring shown between the men which is very rare to see. I enjoyed reading about the devotion of the butler Luster to his employer. What a good man to have on your side! All the other characters are well fleshed and you are invited (maybe sucked!) into their lives.Benedict lacks the realization that he is truly a good man. He believes that any good he does is because of someone else-it takes a long time for him to understand it really WAS his nature to help others. But he was no paragon. There were enough demons in his past and some selfishness to make him human. It was very nice to meet old friends from Libby's London Merchant. Liria, of course, carries six years of bitterness and guilt in her heart. You will be heartsick when her life story is told but rejoice to know that life truly is what you make it. She was proud enough to move on. The children are a wonderful balm to both our hero and heroine. There are reminisces and reconciliation along the way.Wonderful reading; read Libby's London Merchant first if you can - Carla Kelly is a great author and you are always in for good reading when you see her name. Just remember all books are not light reading and look at this book in that light."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I am in the process of reading all of Carla Kelly's books. I find them all wonderful, and this one is no exception. It was weaker than the first book in the story, \\"Libby's London Merchant\\" but that is probably because Libby's London Merchant was so good that it was hard to live up to it. I loved all the characters, and enjoyed running into Libby and Tony again, as well as Scipio and Jane from \\"Miss Milton Speaks Her Mind.\\" Another reviewer mentioned that this is a novel for those who prefer some depth in their romance novels. I agree - it is nice to have some meatier reading with more depth in the relationships, not only the ones between the hero and heroine, but between all the characters.Now is the time to buy/read Carla Kelly books, as many of them are out of print! I have already spent way too much money on buying used copies that cost 3 and 4 times as much as they did when they were first published. But it's worth it!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I enjoyed watching his transformation starting in \\"Libby's London Merchant\\". He's not perfect, even at the close of the story he still has a ways to go but he was believable to me. I enjoy it when the main characters, especially the hero, have flaws like real human beings. We see him at the opening still holding onto his feelings for Libby, still hurting from her rejection and by the end finally letting her go. When he comes across the girl and her son by the road in the poaring rain, he doesn't want to help but he finds himself wondering, and not for the first time either, 'What would Libby do?' which becomes his mantra whenever similar circumstances arise. And the relationship between him and his valet is very tender, more like father and son the way his valet dotes on him.And the rape scene wasn't as graphic as some reviewers make it out to be. It was tame in comparison to some others I've read."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"What a lovely, lovely story!

The realness of Nez and Liria and their humble goodness just makes me want to scoop them into my arms and bless them with all that is of the greatest good. And little Juan elevates them even further. Carla Kelly writes so convincingly that I clearly see Juan propped up in front of Nez on his horse riding through the golden fields. I can also see into their future and how they will treasure every blessing that would come their way. Some characters are simply hard to leave; these certainly qualify."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I just wanted to add my vote to the positive things everyone else has written. Carla Kelly is an accomplished writer, and her characters just grab hold and don't let go. I re-read very few authors, but Kelly is one the ones I do. These re-issues from Signet are giving me a wonderful opportunity to catch up on all that I've missed."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Bring on the kleenex please. I was bawling like a child by the end.What I liked about Libby's London Merchant was that it touched upon the very serious issue of the emotional aftermath of war. One Good Turn follows that theme. There is pain, there is suffering, yet there isn't any of the explicitly gory details that I find sensationalist and unnecessary in Carla Kelly's more recent Harlequin novels.In the prequel, Libby's London Merchant, Benedict Nesbitt falls in love with Libby but she ends up marrying somebody else. Libby was a wonderful woman so you know that the woman that Nez eventually ends up with has to be pretty out of the ordinary herself in order to allow him to move beyond Libby. Liria Valencia is just that woman.It is a beautifully told story with real heart and sincere emotions."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"If you have read the previous title and want to watch a man resurrect himself, this book is a gorgeous read. Post-traumatic stress syndrome hadn't been conceived back then, but this poor guy is a classic example. And to watch him find a way to live with his war experiences was a wonderful tribute to all soldiers then and now. And the same for our heroine, who had some harrowing experiences of her own to come to grips with. Obviously a couple made for each other. :-) Don't miss!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I have read Carla Kelly before, but nothing I read had prepared me for this book! I hadn't read the prequel, but it was absolutely not necessary.I loved Benedict! One of the most affecting heroes I have read in a long time. His is a wounded soul, trying to find peace in his life through small acts of kindness. He is quirky (he talks to himself constantly), witty, and readily acknowledges that he is spoiled and selfish. However, it is gradually revealed that he has been helping many of the people around him in small, and grand ways.He is trying to recover from his experiences at Waterloo, and what helps him the most is meeting someone that is struggling with their own - much more agonizing - past war experiences.I laughed at his antics, and I cried at his despair. Benedict suffers mightily from the guilt and depression of many a soldier,but comes through it with grace and love for Liria and Juan.A beautiful and memorable story elegantly written!"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I enjoyed this book but some of it was hard to read.

Not in my opinion.This is the only book I've ever &quot;pre-ordered&quot; through Amazon because I knew that if it was written by Carla Kelly it would be among the best.Please may I have another?"},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"The historical details were very wonderfully drawn, but the characterization felt flat. Maybe it's because I didn't read the 'prequel' first, but I found it hard to relate to the hero of this book at all. Most of what he thinks and feels is 'told' to us, not shown. This is especially true when he changes into a better man -- we hear \\"he sat down and had several long talks with his sister, his butler, and (some other character who escapes my memory)\\", with none of the details or content of their conversation given. I ended up feeling that the hero didn't really change.Another problem was that after the heroine runs off, the hero knows where she's gone, knows that she might be being abused by some mill owner, he waits for DAYS before going after her -- and when he finally does, he browbeats her in a very cruel way in my opinion. I didn't like this hero at all.I also didn't care for the graphic description of rape, and not just rape of women, but rape of children. I know war is ugly and all that -- which is precisely why I choose to read traditional Regencies. I don't want a heroine who is only concerned with balls and gowns, but this was just too much to stomach. I'll read \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" if I want that kind of reading. This was a graphic description and not entirely necessary. It showed what the heroine had survived, but there was little in the book to show how she'd become the woman she was in the story.In short, I felt like the most dramatic events in the characters' lives took place in the past, not during the course of this story.I've read at least five of Kelly's books and find every one disturbing in some way, probably because she insists on having horrific things happen to good people, and I feel like the characters aren't rewarded for their suffering. The hero in this book doesn't \\"complete\\" the heroine or remove her pain, and the heroine certainly doesn't make him a better man -- she merely makes him feel ashamed of himself, not determined to do better.I hate to post a harsh review, but I was very disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"First of all, let me say that I love Carla Kelly. MISS WHITTIER MAKES A LIST is among my favorite Regencies ever. Usually I buy her books without hesitation, and read them with the utmost enjoyment. But this time, with ONE GOOD TURN, Ms. Kelly actually disappointed me.She does not disappoint in her writing, which is as first-rate and emotional as ever. Nor in her heroine, Liria, who is another of Ms. Kelly's fabulous \\"heroine-with-a-past\\"s. My problem was with the hero.Although I was heartened to see that Nez had matured somewhat from when we saw him in LIBBY'S LONDON MERCHANT, by the middle of ONE GOOD TURN I was about ready to smack him over the head with a two-by-four for being a clueless oaf about Liria and her son. All the information is there, but he just doesn't put it together. When he finally realized Liria's secret, all I could say was \\"Well, DUH!\\" And that deflated most of my enthusiasm for the rest of the book.As much as I enjoy Ms. Kelly's work, I was not impressed by ONE GOOD TURN. For the author at her best, try one of her earlier books instead."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I absolutely love Carla Kelly, and have all her books except this one, which I didn't keep. I didn't like the hero when he was in Libby's London Merchant, and my feelings didn't change. I couldn't get a good feeling for why he and the heroine fell in love. The thing I disliked most was the graphic description of the rape and ultimate murder of the heroine's sister. I don't think I am particularly squeamish, and I can handle Kelly's descriptions of war-time trauma, but after I read about the assault, it kept haunting me. I think it would have been sufficient to leave more up to imagination. As it was, it was very disturbing. That incident, and my lack of feelings for the main characters made this not \\"a keeper\\" for me. Maybe I am just too sensitive, but that's how I feel."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"When I brought Carla Kelly's With this ring, I couldn't wait for another of her books, and here in Adelaide, there is only one stockist, but I bitterly disapointed.

Appologise to those who loved it."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Carla Kelly's books are usually warm and witty. I was looking forward to this new entry and found it to be subpar at best.

The resolution in the end was too easy and the conflict of the book handled poorly."},{"Title":"One Good Turn (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"I seem to be the only person who did not like this book, poor me. I had liked a lot a few of Kelly's other books, particularly Mrs. Drew Plays Her Hand and The Lady's Companion, so I was quite happy about the new reissue of two old novels and this new novel. But I found it quite disapointing. Part of the problem was inacuracies which dragged me out of the story things like &quot;candy&quot; or &quot;calamine lotion&quot;, which sound like americanisms to me. Other problems were small continuity things like the women the hero is courting having an old fashioned hairstyle in one ocasion but in another a fashionable hairstyle - did I miss any makeover on the way? And most serious of all inacuracies was almost everything to do with Spain, the bits of so-called spanish are almost always inacurate (dama? menina?) but mostly the history and motivations which feel very unlike the real history.And then there is the love story which just doesn't work. And there are a a few clich&eacute;s and coincidences which had me rolling my eyes. It's very difficult to speak about it without giving away spoilers, so better avoid this paragraph, but was it truly necessary to make Liria a noblewoman so she would be more acceptable? By the way the author does not understand what a grande de Espa&ntilde;a is, it is not a title on its own, it acompanies another title. I also needed to know more details, had Liria (what sort of name is that?) ever considered letting people think she was married? If not, why? Masochism? What would happen to these two people after this book ends, when they had sex?In all this was a very disapointing book, maybe part of the disapointment is because I was led to expect by unanimous reviews that this was perfect or nearly so, and it did not came even close to me. If you do read this book, hope you like it better than I did, good luck."},{"Title":"Stand On Your Own","review":"Stand On Her Own takes an unusual heroine, combines her with a to-die-for hero and sends them off on a suspenseful journey.

Everyone seems to be scheming against everyone else. No one knows who's a friend and who's an enemy. Which side is the girl really on? What sort of secret weapon keeps blowing people up? Why are people disappearing from Europe? What, exactly, is the CIA up to? Who killed the computer geek? Who blew up a powerful politician? Who is doing what to who, and why are they doing it?Set a few years in the future, The Mecca Connection's primary world is a Europe that has been conquered by militant Islam. Christian Europeans are subject to Sharia law, and the same Sunni/Shia factional differences that divide the Islamic world today continue in this future. The hero, a British/Egyptian intelligence officer sent to ferret out some of the byzantine conspiracies, spends much of his time on the run from the powerful men who have framed him for a murder, while others are bent on starting another world war.If you like Robert Ludlum's books, you should love this one. It would make a great movie."},{"Title":"The Mecca Connection","review":"What a page-turner! Once you get started, its very hard to put this novel down. Unlike the popular, over-hyped books with ridiculous plot twists and, frankly, dumb characters, The Mecca Connection is everything but a let down.The book is set sometime in the future, where Islam has conquered Europe, like it says on the cover. The characters are compelling. You will often find yourself rooting for the charismatic protagonist as he gets tossed from conspiracy to conspiracy, never quite knowing for which agenda he's playing the pawn. The action is fast-paced, and keeps you constantly engrossed.The Mecca Connection doesn't embellish or romanticize the behind-the-curtain world of espionage. This book is no James Bond; don't expect shiny muscle cars, gorgeous women (well, maybe one) and shaken Scotch on the rocks. The world in this novel is a more realistic depiction of what is essentially one of the darker aspects of the men in charge.Be sure to check outLost Army, another wonderful pearl by this unfortunately obscure talent."},{"Title":"What I Believe:A Young Person's Guide to the Religions of the World","review":"&quot;What I Believe: A Young Person's Guide to the Religions of the World,&quot; by Alan Brown and Andrew Langley, is overall a well written book. The book includes several chapters, each of which is dedicated to a major religious tradition: Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Shinto. There is also a &quot;catch-all&quot; chapter which gives limited information on other traditions: the Jain faith, the Baha'i faith, Rastafarianism, etc.The various chapters describe certain aspects of these religions: the founding figure, customs, festivals, rites of passage, holy books, etc. The articles also describe some of the diversity in each tradition. The book also has a helpful glossary at the end.The book is not without flaws and inconsistencies. For example, the authors mention &quot;new cults&quot; without really explaining the term. Also, they seem to leave out any real acknowledgment of secular humanism, atheism, or religious liberalism.Overall, the book presents a rather sanitized look at world religions. The authors write, &quot;As long as we respect each other's beliefs and allow people to practice their religion freely, the world should be a happier place. Religion can help us to live like brothers and sisters.&quot; A nice sentiment, but often far from harsh reality. Despite its flaws, however, &quot;What I Believe&quot; is an admirable achievement overall."},{"Title":"What I Believe:A Young Person's Guide to the Religions of the World","review":"What I Believe is a brightly illustrated \\"first-person\\" introduction to various world religions, including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Shinto, and Taoism. Each major belief system is told through the eyes of a cheerfully drawn child who compare and contrast the major tenets of their faiths. Color photographs are interspersed with drawings of the children describing what it means to be of their faith, traditions, festivals, and practices around the world. This is a simple introduction to comparative religion, and it would be nearly impossible to try to describe all of the variants of each religion, so it comes as no surprise that there are a few details that have been left out. For instance, no mention is made that while Jews remember the near-sacrifice of Abraham's son Isaac, Muslims believe that the story is told about his son Ishmael - a minor differenc to some, but obviously not to Jews and Muslims. Much of the section on Christianity focuses on Catholic and Anglican worship, describing special garments that priests wear, saints, candles, and other trappings not traditionally found in many Protestant services. Finally, there are a few editing mistakes that obscure meaning: is the Buddhist meditative cloth a thanka or a tharka? Other than those glitches, this is a nice addition to any library for children, as it seems to be written from an ecumenical point of view, encouraging children to learn about and respect one another's faith systems. From a non-expert point of view, it does not seem to contain offensive or questionable information, and the fun illustrations are an easy way to introduce children to a variety of cultural and religious practices."},{"Title":"What I Believe:A Young Person's Guide to the Religions of the World","review":"This book does a great job of covering a variety of religions today, but fails to mention - as most books in this category do -anything about the modern pagan movement. In North America alone, there are millions of practicing pagans. Our beliefs are of no less value than any other religion. I'm sirprised that Wicca isn't even covered in these books; as Wicca is officially a santified religion in the United States.Paganism is an Earth-centered spirituality and focuses on love and reverence for All Life and our Mother Earth. It deserves recognition. How will my children feel, as we read through books on religions of the world, when even the most obscure religions are covered, but not their own?I don't care what religion you follow or what preconceptions/misconceptions you have about paganism. For a complete and tolerant world view, it's a crime not to address this prevalent form of spirituality."},{"Title":"The Circle of Healing : Deepening Our Connections with Self, Others, and Nature","review":"The Circle of Healing is an inspiring book that encourages growth on many different levels. Breathing, communication, emotional growth, listening to your body's wisdom, and nature as teacher and healer, are some of the rich topics explored. This book is a combination of deep insights and practical exercises. Holt is a holistic health educator and environmental activist. In addition, she's an experienced biofeedback therapist who has helped clients recover from stress-related disorders and occupational injuries.The section on body posture is filled with practical wisdom. Holt talks about a medical condition called &quot;forward head syndrome&quot; where the head is held too far forward. This causes pain in the neck and shoulders. Holt equates this posture with &quot;leading with my head instead of my heart. I'm going too fast, trying to think my way out of everything, instead of being willing to feel.&quot; I highly recommend savoring the healing opportunities that come from reading this excellent book.--Trina Swerdlow, author of Growing Free and The Heartfelt Guide to Emotional Intimacy Newsletter"},{"Title":"The Circle of Healing : Deepening Our Connections with Self, Others, and Nature","review":"This book is a terrific reference for those who are seeking healing and improvement in their lives.Author Cathy Holt provides us with a kind of primer on becoming more grounded by sharing personal stories and by describing the teaching of many well-known spiritual practitioners such as Thich Nhat Hahn and Sun Bear, and the study of works by other medical and holistic experts.With a reminder to us of the importance of our being connected to nature, Holt outlines the tools essential for finding peace through personal awareness. First, she underscores the importance of and how to go about healing oneself by making intentions, finding support and forming healing community. Then she describes the steps required for physical healing such as honoring, communicating with and relaxing the body, and breathing properly. She follows this with invaluable guidance on emotional healing including identifying and dealing with the &quot;inner critic,&quot; cultivating gratitude, becoming less judgmental, being open to differing perspectives, and the importance of engaging in work which is truly satisfying.Finally she tells us how to &quot;complete the circle&quot; by connecting most fully with natural guides invoking sacred space, getting beyond materialism, and identifying and fully connecting with our own best community.All of these topics are discussed both technically-as based on the author's experience with medical practitioners and on her own work as a biofeedback therapist- and spiritually-as based on her research and experience with teaching and healing circles, personal vision quests, etc.The book contains an impressive list of recommended readings, videos, and audiotapes, as well as contact information for self-help organizations.I highly recommend that anyone looking to make changes in his/her life start with this book and use it as a reference before visiting the self-help or spirituality sections at the local bookstore."},{"Title":"Vibrating Universe","review":"This is an excellent book on Advaita Vedanta in relation to modern science.Difficult topics such as Various Cosmological theories and modern Quantum field theories are presented clearly and convincingly.

Published over seventy years ago, John Hicks' book remains one of the seminal works on the history of this movement, tracing its origins and following it through to its demise at the end of the century.One of the keys to understanding the Populists as Hicks sees it is in understanding the role that the American frontier played in America during the late nineteenth century. It was to this vaguely defined, constantly changing area west of the Mississippi that thousands of farmers flocked, setting up farms in the upper and central Midwest. Lured by the massive advertising campaign of the railroads and local promoters, these people came in search of cheap, bountiful land that could be purchased with easy credit.This massive spurt of growth came to an end with the crop failures of 1887. As the rains disappeared and the land dried up, the price of real estate dropped precipitously. The effects were felt not just in the Midwest, where tens of thousands fled the region, but the South as well. Here, the region was still recovering from the aftermath of the Civil War, with many farmers working as tenants under the crop-lien system, which gave merchants a powerful hold over them. Their resentment of the system added to that of their counterparts in the Midwest, who felt victimized by the economic system. For many, their crops never brought in enough revenue to meet their needs, and blame was increasingly directed at the banks, railroads, and grain elevator operators which seemed to be profiting exorbitantly from their misery.These farmers sought organization as a solution to their problems. The Farmers' Alliance, a loose organization initially founded in the 1870s, grew as members sought to protect themselves from their economic situation by organizing business cooperatives and pushing to use the power of the government to address their concerns. Though tactics differed - some organized independent political movements, while others sought to take over the dominant political structure from within - by 1890 the separate Midwestern and Southern branches of the Farmer's Alliance were actively involved in politics, enjoying successes that emboldened their membership.Initially the Alliance sought enactment of a complex \\"subtreasury\\" plan of government-managed cooperatives designed to alleviate the farmers' plight, but the constant political obstruction resulted in frustration. Faced with the combined opposition of both the Democratic and Republican parties, many members sought to overcome it by forming a party of their own - the Populist Party. This new party put forward James B. Weaver as presidential candidate, wining six states in the Electoral College and scoring a number of victories in down-ballot races across the country. The depression created by the Panic of 1893 led the party to adopt the \\"free silver cause,\\" only to be undercut by the Democrats' nomination of William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election. Though signaling the demise of the party, Hicks argues that the Democrats' adoption of many of the Populists' ideas was proof of the ultimate success of the Populist revolt.Even today Hicks' argument for the origins of Populism must be taken into account when studying the movement. Using the wealth of publications that the Alliance and the Populists produced, as well as other primary and secondary sources, he makes a persuasive case for the importance of the economic background to the movement, one that remains generally accepted today. As such, this book continues to be required reading for any student of American history, though one that needs to be balanced with more current scholarship on the subject."},{"Title":"The Populist revolt: A history of the Farmers' alliance and the People's Party (A Bison book, BBLLL)","review":"John Hicks wrote this, the original classic, of the populist movement.

Mikolaycak's paintings are more realistic than Beck'sPeter & the Wolf, and they express a brave and dramatic mood very fitting for Prokofiev's wonderful musical creation. They are just a little more frightening than Beck's, but still aren't very scary. Carlson's translation of the piece is quite smooth, but it will fall to an adult to explain which musical instruments are represented by each character. It is, however, more widely available than Beck's version."},{"Title":"Peter and the Wolf","review":"My wife read this to our granddaughter while I played Prokofiev's beautiful music on the piano. What a magical moment! The book arrived promptly and in good condition, as advertised. AND, in time for Thanksgiving!"},{"Title":"Peter and the Wolf","review":"I grew up on this version of Peter and the Wolf. The music is so amazing and wonderful but in combination with the hard cover book it is fantastical! It teaches children about musical instruments and tells a great story at the same time. Genius. I recently helped my Mom purchase a new version of the book and a CD separately but it is not the same caliber that this one was. I only wish they would redo this so that it was the same book with a CD or mp3 files instead. I know I would purchase several copies! What makes this combo is the fact that they were made for one another. The book lines up with the cassette perfectly.The pages are soft and smooth and the colors of the illustrations are so vivid. The illustrations themselves are wonderful and detailed. The music is perfect - no volume mishaps with not being able to hear the dialogue as I've read with some of the newer versions. The combo comes in a thick box-like sheath with a pocket for the cassette on the side and another bigger pocket for the book as well just below it. This helps keep both in pristine condition. I still have my copy from when I was a child and I look forward to sharing the enchanting experience with my children in the future.Conclusion: The idea of teaching children about classical music and the classical instruments is wonderful enough without having a wonderful, colorful book to help feed their imagination. This is a wonderful combo and is well worth the small price. Even if you don't have a cassette player, the book alone would be well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Peter and the Wolf","review":"This classic is beautifully illustrated and the story is accessible to young children.

(\\"What the Horses See at Night\\")The title of the collection, Swithering, implies doubt or indecision. While the words find purchase in the constancy of nature, the shifting of emotions blends past and present, the choices taken, the loves lost, precious moments of ecstasy, each inscribed with a unique talent for the visual:The child's skipstill there in the walk,a woman's poise in her slowexaminationof the brightly coloured globe...Is there anythingmore heartbreaking than hope? (\\"Cusp)Tackling subjects great and small, Robertson's longer works take on the themes of history, \\"The Death of Acteon\\", \\"Acteon: the Early Years\\", \\"Holding Proteus\\" and \\"Crossing the Archipelago\\". Between these poems are the small jewels of introspection that seem to flow so effortlessly from Robertson's pen:I watch the day break downover the lake: windlooting the trees,leaving paw-prints on the waterfor the water-witch to read. (\\"The Lake at Dusk\\")and...White silkin her hands...drew me backto another ocean,another ravishing...That moment,When I found myselfCaught,Felt myselfBeing pulled in.

Luan Gaines/ 2006."},{"Title":"Swithering","review":"The definition of \\"swither\\" means to suffer indecision or doubt. Robin Robertson's book of poetry, Swithering consists of a broad range of subjects--and there is no indecision in any of the poems.Robertson is an adventurer and invites the reader along on his journey of realization, acceptance and wonder of the world, how it's viewed and the experiences people live.Robertson's imagery is at times raw and harsh, other times it is exquisitely lyrical and sometimes it is sad, filled with longing or acceptance of what is.Whether Robertson is writing about children, childhood, death, or desire, he invites the reader to join him in experiencing the everyday world in a new way.I must have read What the \\"Horses See at Night\\" a dozen times, I was so taken with the descriptive quality of his words. I read aloud \\"Heel of Bread\\" more so because of the visualization and the way the words fall off the tip of the tongue in such a pleasing manner. \\"New York Spring\\" is a spectacular piece. And \\"To My Daughters, Asleep\\" made my heart pound with its simple truth.Armchair Interviews says: If you enjoy precise and succinct poetry that speaks to your heart, you would do well to read, read some more and then read Swithering again, It is a most satisfying journey about life."},{"Title":"Swithering","review":"Harcourt must think they have the next Seamus Heaney, or better yet, Ted Hughes on their hands as they publicize Robertson with that New Yorker quote about \\"finding the sensually charged moment in a raked northern seascape.\\" Good luck to them! Robertson has been shortlisted for the 2006 TS Eliot prize, so he doesn't need any advice from me, but if this is the best they are doing over there, then here in the USA we are achieving positive miracles in comparison.I don't know about the Ted Hughes influence, but surely Rod McKuen must be big in the UK if Robertson's poem \\"Trysts\\" is any indication. \\"Meet me/ in your best shoes/ and your favourite dress/ meet me/ on your own, in the wilderness/ meet me/ as my lover, as my only friend.\\" Remember that Rod Stewart song about, \\"You are my lover, you're my best friend, you're in my soul\\"? Of course you do, you've spent 20 years trying to forget it. Robin Robertson excels at delivering strong metaphors with just a tip of the hood. In \\"Cusp\\" he glimpses the future woman's sexuality in the innocent skipping of a little girl. \\"Is there anything/ more heartbreaking than hope?\\" he asks.When tragedy strikes, he takes the stoic road. \\"I shoulder my pack and walk on.\\" There are dramatic monologues describing situations in the life of the dramatist Strindberg. Takes you right there, they do. \\"With every word he wrote, his hands bled.\\" The poems in SWITHERING seem to have been written at many fashionable writers colonies all over the map, and it was with a certain pang of anxiety that I pawed through the book, worrying that somehow I had missed what must be here--a poem celebrating the beauty of Tuscany. Over and over I flipped the book back and forth, and finally, right in front of my eyes, I found the poem about Tuscany.The poem that will be an anthology piece is the Lawrentian \\"Asparagus,\\" in which a close examination of the famous vegetable reveals its similarity to the phallus of a man,\\"Pushing up, hard and fibrous/ from the ground, it is said to be/ grown for the mouth:/ steamed till supple/ so that the stem is still firm/ but with a slight give to gravity.\\" There's more but I don't want to spoil the whole experience. In brief, this is a book for the ages, the crowning achievement of Robertson's career as a bard."},{"Title":"Swithering","review":"Robertson's a good poet, but this book is padded out with poems by Neruda and Montale, as well as some close reworkings of Ovid. The end result feels not very original."},{"Title":"Roar and More","review":"My mother started reading this book to me not long after its publication 55 years ago. (I still have the tattered original.) It's a sequence of charming poems about animals and the sounds they make. When someone enjoys reading a book, it's more fun to listen to; Mom had a blast with the barking and meowing and, of course, roaring. It's great entertainment for a very young child. When I got a little older, I was entranced by the playful line drawings. After that, it was the imaginative typography that got my attention.Years later, I read it to my kids. Last night, it made its debut with my 15-month-old granddaughter. She is not usually responsive to books yet, except to tear their pages.

She wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was 19 or 20, depending on which literary historian you choose to believe. If you approach this novel as the work of a teenager in the England of two centuries ago, it is impressive. If you treat it as a piece of literature, it is absolutely awful. As many other readers have pointed out, the basic story idea is great but it is very badly written. Shelley's language is flowery to the point of absurdity. She might be allowed to get away with wildly overwritten dialogue, considering the period in which the book was written, but just try to imagine the nine-foot tall hideous monster, who has deliberately murdered a small child, speaking these lines: \\"I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood by, nor herself understood, the cottagers. They made many signs which I did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists.\\" The plot, too, has some seriously nonsensical elements, the most basic of which may be Victor Frankenstein simply walking away from his newly created monster. The creation of the monster, incidentally, is not described. All of the lightening-catchers and pseudoscientific gadgetry was the invention of later dramatists. Mary Shelley's achievement was to create the Frankenstein myth, which has been dramatized and parodied repeatedly. Despite the glaring faults of her novel, \\"Frankenstein\\" is historically important, and the story itself does have some genuinely interesting episodes. The edition published by Everyman's Library is inexpensive, nicely printed and bound, and has an excellent introduction by Wendy Lesser. Shelley's early life, as described by Lesser, was so bizarre and socially irresponsible that it would make a good subject for a historical novel. \\"Mother of Frankenstein\\"?"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was never one for monster stories or haunted houses and such,being only nine,but I felt it was unfair to dock a star for that.Frankinstien is a wonderful work of art.Lots of modern day stuff houners Frankenstien.Some time in their program, Frankenstien is featured on almost every modern T.V. show.Now that it's free you have no excuse not to read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"just about everyone has heard the story of Frankenstein, so i'm going to skip that part of the review and go right on to \\"what is this story about\\".well, as far as i can tell it appears to be about a woman, who leaves the security-and watchful eyes- of friends and family, gets pregnant, has a child, then spends the rest of the book covering up while the child finds out just what it is like to be a bastard in the early 1800's. with no friends, family, connections, or money the child has no hope of a future and decides to take revenge on its creator.why do i think Frankenstein is a woman? having read quite a few gothic novels, i can say that victor is not a masculine character, he is a feminine one. he does not do guy things like shooting, hunting, hanging out with the guys riding horses. he spends his time at home with the ladies doing girl things.his decent into moral wrong is simple, he reads trashy novels that gives him ideas, when he is away from friends and family he has the opportunity to experiment with these dark ideas, with no one to check him he sinks deeper and deeper in to depravity until finally he creates a fully fledged monster and the sight of which suddenly causes him to realize all the terrible things that he has done, and no one must know about.now take this and turn it into a female's way.

Frankenstein is, in the words of Donald H. Reiman, \\"themost seminal literary work of the Romantic period\\". It is a work of profoundand radical ideas, written in poetically powerful prose. Frankenstein is notreally a gothic novel, although its author sometimes employs gothicconventions and language, and even spoofs them. Rather, Frankenstein is anenduring myth, a novel of ideas, and above all, a moral allegory about theevil effects of intolerance and prejudice, ostracism and alienation, both tothe victims of intolerance and to society at large.Since there are some good reviews here, I'll concentrate on thisparticular edition -- the Chicago edition edited by James Rieger.This is one of the two best editions of Frankenstein available (the otherbeing the Norton Critical edition). Most importantly, this isthe original 1818 edition, rather than the inferior, bowdlerized 1831edition -- which is the most common, and the only one that was available forwell over a century. James Rieger was the first editor to make the case for thesuperiority of the 1818 edition, and he did so convincingly enough that almost allscholars of English Romanticism now prefer the 1818 edition. Rieger took a lotof flak from feminist academics for asserting that Percy Bysshe Shelley was,at the very least, a minor collaborator. In my considered opinion, Shelley was the primary author, and Mary Shelley was merely his secretary.The appendices in this edition include the full text of John William Polidori'sstory, \\"The Vampyre: A Tale\\" and Byron's brief fragment of a vampire story.Rieger's comments on the 1831 Introduction (written ostensibly by Mary, but withmuch help from her father, William Godwin) are perceptive.Please check out my own book, The Man Who Wrote Frankenstein, whichmakes the case that Frankenstein was really written by Percy Bysshe Shelley,one of the greatest poets in the English language."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I grew up seeing Frankensteins on windows and as costumes during the Halloween season, but never did I know, until now, that Frankenstein in the novel is the man who created this abomination from body parts and some electricity, and this plot makes for an intriguing novel...certainly different than the popular images/movies of Frankenstein, and perhaps even better.Victor Frankenstein grows up thirsty for knowledge and with a penchant for the dark arts. He is studying at a university when he creates the monster that everyone knows today as Frankenstein, although in reality he is never named. The creature stands at eight-feet-tall and is grotesque in form. Horrified, Victor runs away, and soon the creature leaves the building to wander the earth. The creature is never far from Victor's tormented mind.Later, as the naive creature is repeatedly scorned and shunned by humans, he murders Victor's beloved friends and family, beginning with his brother William. Victor is guilt-ridden because the accused is innocent, and he knows that his own creation was the one who strangled the boy. Victor's health deteoriates so he retreats to the mountains, only to come face to face with the creature. There, he learns of the monster's isolation from humanity and its yearn for companionship, but Victor never really does anything about it, which leads only to more tragedy.The storyline is amazing; Shelley wrote this when she was only a teenager. Yes, the language is a bit too flowery at parts; for example, the monster has extensive, absurd vocabulary and conversations that I find a bit laughable, but flowery language was not unusual in the 19th century. I could definitely picture in my mind Victor's emaciated self (the mad scientist look), the monster's anger --he should be like Adam of the Bible but he is not--, and all Victor's beloved die off, one by one.

What is man? What is the responsibility of a creator to a creation? These questions are resonant themes as well as questions that are presented throughout the book. Shelley gives an answer to all three questions through the eyes of her main characters Victor Frankenstein and his \\"monster.\\"Immediately with Frankenstein's freakish human creation, the reader is quickly alerted to the wrongness of it. The shock and horror felt by Frankenstein at his creature sets up the moral struggle that was so evidently in the mind of Shelley. In her preface she mentions that the actuality of a creature being given life is not an impossibility according to Darwin and some physiological German writers. With this in mind, Frankenstein is a book intended to create fear and engender greater moral responsibility to the science community and those who regulate it. Frankenstein is shocked by the creature he created, and because of his selfishness, cowardice, and lack of compassion, Frankenstein's creature becomes a monster. In regards to what constitutes a man -- it is a more philosophical question - this question is addressed clearly in the conversation between Frankenstein and his monster. The monster had raised himself; he learned language and social skills by observing others, as well as the necessities of survival. The monster had emotions and feelings, and though he was horribly deformed and a frightful looking creature, he was most assuredly human -- not because his physical members were collections of dead human corpses, but because he demonstrated that he could learn, communicate through language, and reason. Shelley portrays this terrible dilemma for the monster that longs for human interaction, but because his looks are extremely frightening he is forced into isolation. And then the next emphasis -- what is the creator's (Frankenstein's) responsibility to his creature, the monster? It seems that is left ultimately up to the reader to resolve, but many passages lead one to determine that Frankenstein had a great responsibility for the creature and those around him. The problem was that he catered to one individual in a foolish manner, and lost both because of his fear of the monster.When should one refrain from experimenting? Well, interestingly Shelley seems to indicate that life is not something for the scientist to meddle in. The horrors of the monster bring evils upon everyone that is even remotely connected to the monster. The deaths of Justine, Elizabeth, and Clerval are terrible and gut wrenching, yet so is the pain of the monster and Frankenstein. It seems that Shelley is asserting that life is sacred, and developing it can be dangerous. Frankenstein, though with noble intentions, created and then abandoned his creation from fear, and it was from this act of abandonment that the monster blamed for his behavior. The order of the world is set off balance because of Frankenstein's creature in Shelley's book, and this is because science was not appropriated correctly, but was instead used selfishly which ultimately resulted in lethal consequences.In the portion of the book where the creature recounts his two years before meeting up with Frankenstein, there was a narrative of how he survived. The inhabitants of the cottage home that he observed became his unknowing teachers. The monster learned how to talk, and learned social interactions in that he learned what a mother was, etc. This even prompted a naturally human response -- kindness. The creature took care of the people in the house, cutting down wood for them and doing other outdoor chores. The creature surely resembled a man, yet his appearance in sighted so much terror that it is hard to grapple with the idea that he truly was a man because of his peculiar origins and the evil that he soon would embark on. However, Shelley gives light to the reader on why the monster spreads terror throughout Frankenstein's circle of family and friends, thus rendering him human, and the reason cited is neglect. Shelley devotes several chapters to the questioning of the creator by the created, and develops a rich dialogue between the two men.In the first chapter of the second volume, the monster lectures Frankenstein that Frankenstein's neglect of him was wrong, and that the bond between them can only be broken with one of their deaths. Now comes in to play the question of the responsibility of a creator over his or her creation? It seems Shelley would have the individual creator weigh the pros and the cons. However, this is not done because Frankenstein was rash, and it then fell to him to destroy the work his hands had made. The last part of the book is about Frankenstein unrelentingly pursuing the monster after he finally makes the good decision not to make a female monster. Thus the lesson taught by Shelley's gothic horror reaches its final conclusion to eradicate a horrible mistake.In the Pocket Books publication of Frankenstein, it puts forward several themes that the publishers believe are the main motifs of the book. The first they state is science versus nature. They explain that \\"there are some things man is not meant to know (Pocket Books).\\" It goes on to state that there is a struggle between what is natural and what is interference by man. Another theme is feminism and motherhood, because the publishers believe that this book provides an insight to a female mind, and gives a feminine interpretation of a gothic novel. It is argued here that gothic tales are typically a male oriented type of writing, yet the most famous of gothic tales is by a woman.The second to last theme cited is \\"monstrosity.\\" \\"The issue of what is a monster lies at the heart of the novel.\\" This main theme, according to the publishers, is what haunts the book through and through. At moments the story sets up an emotional conflict that has you feeling sympathy for the monster, and yet at once also feeling fearful and disgusted by the monster's actions. And the last theme is that of secrecy, because, of course, secrecy has a lot to do with the demise of the characters in the book. It is secrecy that eats up Frankenstein, and holds him hostage to help his fellow man.The Pocket Book publishers had it right. This book surely is about science versus nature -- it is the same theme presented in this paper that asks when has science gone too far? The question presented here is just a more blunt and simple form of the complex discussion of science versus nature. Truly, this overarching theme is in play from the creation of the monster, to the havoc and blood shed wreaked by the monster, to Frankenstein's contemplation to appease the creature by creating another, to finally his pursuit of the demon. It is a tale of people trying to achieve knowledge they should not. The publishers argue that it is both Frankenstein and Robert Walton that are acting unnatural by trying to create life, but end up in fact destroying life.The idea of feminism and motherhood really has little to do with this tale. There seems to be nothing classically feminine about this tale, nor does it have anything to do with motherhood directly. This tale is a great one because Mary Shelley was a brilliant and gifted writer -- just as many other women are as well as many men. This book is a token of her greatness as an author, but this novel's greatness has nothing to do with feminine themes or motherhood. It may be an interesting side note though, that at the time it was written very few women or mothers wrote books. So it is also interesting that she was only 18 years old when she created this story, but surely none of these were factors that led to the book's success, rather it was the talent and dedication of Mary Shelley, the person.The monstrosity and secrecy themes are extremely relevant. The monstrosity theme is linked to the other two questions presented in this paper -- what is man and what is the responsibility of the creator to the creation? The monstrosity is what raises a question about responsibility to the creation, because it is undetermined whether the creation is a monster or human - if he is a monster then kill it or if human then help it. Parts of this dilemma are briefly touched on in this paper, but are these links correct? The monstrosity is what keeps the reader reading. The reader is left with two decisions - is the creature a man or is it a monster? The secrecy theme is also relevant. Frankenstein refuses to tell authorities in the beginning about the monster, because he believes they will think him insane. He keeps all this to himself until he has lost everyone important to him. Only then does he finally start telling people. Of course it is too late then, and his initial instincts were right, in that the people he tells, other than Robert Walton, do think he is crazy. However, Robert Walton sees the creature himself at the end, so if he had any doubt it was displaced by sight. The secrecy was so powerful that it ate at Frankenstein, and in a way, the tale was told because it was his last way to release the agony of keeping the secret.Shelley's Frankenstein explores so many areas. The themes are abundant and the ideas suggested, and bluntly stated, are sprinkled throughout. Readers have been, and will continue to be challenged by this work. Challenges that become more and more relevant each day with the world of changing technology. When has science gone too far? When should society enact ethics laws to block some science? The questions go on and on ... the most important of all should be the resounding theme of the sanctity of life. What constitutes life and when is it society's responsibility to take it, nurture it, or create it? These questions are pondered and even given answers in Frankenstein. The book also gives warning to those who are ambitious and those who have great talent to be careful, because oftentimes those attributes can lead to disaster as was so tragically seen by Frankenstein.With our modern age full of amazing scientific discovery and meddling with the laws of nature (e.g. genetic engineering) this book will continue to fascinate. It is ultimately unimportant, and probably was for Shelley too, whether or not man could really ever create life in the way Frankenstein did, but it is the maddening pursuit, the gross abandonment of morality and blinding terror of disorder that punctuates this story. In an age that is wrestling with questions of science and morality such as embryonic research, abortion, life support, gender change surgery... this book serves as a strong caution...monsters may yet be created, and they may not be a work wrought just by medical doctors and scientists, but rather they could become the monsters themselves.No matter which side one may come down on the issues of today, there is one thing that no one can dispute -- Mary Shelley, a woman who lived in the 19th century wrote a marvelous book that seems to become more relevant as time progresses. A woman living in the times of Dr. Darwin, who contemplated his ideas and was challenged by her two friends and husband, wrote a novel that has invoked fear into many millions of readers. Shelley penned the words of Frankenstein in an era that was beginning to boom with the modern interpretation of science, will always be remembered for her masterful work of art. It most assuredly will continue to endure the test of time and will be a blessing to provide a conscience for modern science or a haunting reminder of what man was able to do, but shouldn't have.Work CitedShelley, Mary.

Throughout the book, Dr. Frankenstein deals with his remorse for creating such a wretched creature, and the monster abhors Dr. Frankenstein for the same reason.Hollywood representations of the monster known as Frankenstein, as well as the relationship between the monster and Dr. Frankenstein are very mistaken. Frankenstein does not arise from a table to act like a mindless zombie, Dr. Frankenstein does not scream \\"He's alive! He's alive,\\" and their relationship is not one of a mad scientist creating a beast that will do his destructive bidding.In fact, he is a very learned creature, and he received his education from Plutarch's \\"Lives,\\" Goethe's \\"Sorrows of Wurther,\\" and Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\" It is only after much scorn that Frankenstein turns into a destructive monster, perhaps best emulated by the transition in psyche of Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lechter.For those who want an adventurous read about rape and murder, Frankenstein offers no such thing. This book, which at times seems more like a prequel to common Frankenstein movies, fluctuates about as much as the sea from which Dr. Frankenstein writes it.

Frankenstein wasn't at the top of my list, or even near the top probably, but my best friend continued to encourage me to read it as it is one of her very favorite books.Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus (Penguin Classics)This classic book has inspired no fewer than fifty films. It definitely has a firm place in classic literature and in culture. I had no idea that Mary Shelley was the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. They married when she was age 18/19 years old, in 1816. It was upon a dare, by Lord Byron, to write a ghost story, that Mary Shelley wrote the novel. I like that she didnt just write a \\"ghost story\\" and developed a plot-line like no other before.The review I am in the midst of writing, here, is going to be a mixed bag. I must say that I was quite surprised that the story was written in such a way that it was not difficult for me to finish; not a drudgery as I read it. I somehow felt compelled to read it. I suppose I would say that her writing style is very agreeable. The story is written in the form of a person retelling the story he has been told, in letter form, to a far-off loved one. Writing a story in this manner required an additional back-story. Shelley gave this story the same attention to depth as she gave the main one. I like that; so many of today's authors just do not write in this manner.Overall, however, I do have issues with the story. The premise of the story is that Dr. Victor Frankenstein is on a quest to create life. I think that in order to indulge the story one must suspend reality and choose to believe that man can create life, even in the late 1700s. Done. I do, however take great issue with the fact that in the story Dr. Frankenstein has finally succeeded in creating life when, all of a sudden, he looks at the creature he has created and, aghast, decides he has created something too hideous to allow it to be. Does he destroy it though? Nope; that would end the story. He allows it to remain \\"alive\\" and falls asleep. This of course, comes back to haunt him. The monster leaves, unhindered.Frankenstein learns language and the ability to read through watching a small family without their knowledge. I enjoyed this part of the story. He views them with great longing. His only wish is for communion. Human communtion? Why, he isn't human. But at the very least, human communion would provide him with some form of relationship, his deepest desire. Even his own creator chose not to commune with him. One of the characters from this portion of the book is blind and that gives the \\"monster\\" an opprotunity to speak with him, hoping that he can gain favor with him and then with the rest of his family. This character quickly recognizes the \\"monster's\\" true circumstances and it is summed up well in his words here:\\"Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue.\\" Pg 91The next part of the story with which I take issue is that Frankenstein sets off on a long trek and somehow ends up in Geneva and on the property of the Frankensteins without any stated assistance in finding it. That's a bit neat, isn't it? Pretty unbelieavable; there again, it allows for the progression of the story.When the \\"monster\\" finally has an opportunity to speak with Frankenstein he says this:\\"God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image' but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire and encourage him, but I am slitary and abhorred.\\" Pg 88He pleads with Frankenstein to create a female for him, one as equally hideous as he, as a mate with whom he can share love and life. He wants only to be accepted and have a person whom he can accept. Love...isn't that the desire of all people? And wasn't he created in the image of humanity? He offers that they will go live in the farthest reaches of the north where they will bother and be bothered by no one.\\"It is true, we shall be monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more attached to one another.\\" Ppg 98\\"Let me see that I excite the of some existing thing; do not deny me my request!\\" Pg 99Frankenstein's monster is so adamant of his need for a mate that he threatens to take vengeance upon Frankenstein if he does not concede to his request/demand. At once Frankenstein agrees that he will create a mate for him; the story progresses a bit, and, voila, Frankenstein rethinks his impulsive decision and determines he will not create another being. Queue the scary music. The monster vowed vengeance if a mate is not created for him; he followed him from Ingolstadt to Geneva; can engeance not be imagined by Frankenstein at this point?Vengeance...it arrives. There is death, and more death. Eventually, Frankenstein ends up chasing the monster to far reaches of the north. Did I say \\"vengeance\\". It doesn't take a lot to figure out what happens next does it?It's easy for me to pick away at the threads of a story. I am not a writer, am I? And so, I feel it would be unfair for me to do so without also finding praise where it is worthy. As I said, the story was compellingly written. I did not avoid or put off reading it once I began. I am glad I read it.And the premise...the creation of life by man. What a premise! It is one that only has greater implications today; perhaps moreso than Shelley could have ever even imagined. She wrote this stunningly well for it to have been written in the early 1800s.What if man could create life? Just because one can do something it does not mean it is something that should be done. Truly, I only believe that God can create life, eternal life, life with a soul. Science has been used by man, to do many things that have direct connections to life. Transplants are just one of those things; there is also research in the lab, on the cellular level. Scary stuff. Yes, the result of some of these things can be great good; it can also be great devastation, as this novel, in great foresight, warns.My husband and I had an interesting conversation with regard to all of this. Frankenstein initially was only sorry he created the \\"monster\\" because of its hideousness. Really? Isn't that fantastic?! He was sorry he created something so ugly! That begs the question that my husband raised: \\"If you could create aesthetically pleasing, beautiful life, would it then be okay to do so?\\" I hardly think so. And that is wherein lies much of the inherent beauty of this novel; it causes great thought.Some of my favorite lines from the book are:\\"A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a tranistory desire to disturb his tranquillity. I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule. If the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human mind. If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections, Greece had not be enslaed, Caesar would have spared his country, America would have been discovered more gradually, and the empires of Mexico and Peru had not been destroyed.\\" Pg 32\\"Heavy misfortunes have befallen us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live.\\" Pg 133It's only been days since I finished reading the novel. While it was still very fresh in my mind I wished to watch a well acclaimed movie version of it. I watched 1994's release \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\\" starring: Robert DeNiro, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Hulce, Helena Bonham Carter. A bit of artistic license was taken with the story but not so much that the essence of the story was changed. In fact, I feel that it played out quite well. I was afriad it would be way too gory for me. It had its moments but I think it was handled well given the subject and necessity of including a certain amount of gore. The cultural significance of Frankenstein does not end with the questions it brings up. Immediately after watching the film our children and I were turned on an episode of The Dick Van Dyke Show and who was mentioned?

Mary Shelley's dark horror story is about a promising young man who decided that he had to discover how to create life. When he finally unlocked the secret to doing this, he constructed a body to spark with life. The moment he made his creation come alive, though, he was consumed with horror and remorse, and ran in shame. His creation ran, and lived in the woods for months, where he began to learn things. The monster discovered a family living on a poor farm and hid in an unused portion of their home for yet another few months, learning how to talk from them by watching. Finally, he worked up his courage to confront them, but it turned to disaster and he was sent running. From here his hatred for man grew, and he murdered an innocent boy whom he found out was related to his creator. Dr. Frankenstein found the monster, confronted him, and agreed to make him a companion so that the monster would have some one to confide in. The doctor destroyed the body right before he finished though, and his monster killed all his friends and family. Frankenstein chases the monster until he cannot anymore, and the monster kills itself out of remorse.This chilling story is a vivid reflection of Mary Shelley's Marxist-like beliefs. It is a twisted and gruesome story, but an entertaining one at that. It is a great work of fiction, and a classic. A good gothic horror read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read this book for an English class I had to take, and it was very helpful!!!The book not only included the text, but interpretation notes as well which were very helpful!!!So glad I bought this book!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Damon Medic says If you believe \\"Frankenstein\\" is a \\"Monster\\" story, you need to read this novel.

You will probably cry while reading. Don't trust me; find out for yourself. Read Frankenstein, and you'll see what I mean!-Damon Medic"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Maybe the most surprising thing about reading Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* is in discovering just how different--and how much more complex--the original is than the story as it has passed into popular culture. Here is one of the great myths of modern man and the Age of Science and Reason; it's a myth that in some respects is even more relevant today with the prospect of widespread genetic engineering. The dream of unlocking the secret of life--and the parallel fear that it might turn into a nightmare remains with us long after Shelley gave it form in this short novel.On the downside, Shelley's prose bears all the faults of the age in which it was composed. *Frankenstein* is almost unbearably overwritten, its characters melodramatically overwrought, and the whole production bathed in the over-the-top hysteria that often typifies Romantic literature. It's comical to hear long eloquent orations delivered by characters in the middle of scenes in which they're literally fighting for their lives--and, indeed, even more ridiculous to hear the monster himself speaking like a Shakespearean actor. To be sure, Shelley's monster is a great deal different than the green-skinned blockhead of the movies, no bolts in his neck, jagged forehead scar, or monosyllabic groans here. This is a pensive, autodidactic monster. Still, the way Shelley envisions him, he's actually far more horrific than Boris Karloff or Herman Munster. Here we have a stitched together assemblage of corpse-parts that the flesh doesn't always entirely cover, leaving the workings of tendons and the like grotesquely exposed to view. He's a wild, ragged, hideous-looking zombie, but not a shambling, sleepwalking, unfeeling drone; instead, he's super-strong, super-agile, super-fast--and he's as eloquent as Cicero.Certainly, Shelley felt it necessary to give the monster a brain and the silver-tongue to express its complex cogitations because *Frankenstein* is, in the end, more a philosophical novel than a tale of horror. What does it mean to be human? Do we overstep our bounds by encroaching on the miracles of life and try to play \\"god\\"? Is there a god? Do we not feel pity for the \\"monster,\\" which, by its appearance alone, seems to be the embodiment of all we loathe and fear...and yet, in fact, only wants for compassion and companionship to make it \\"human\\"? These are the kinds of questions that Shelley asks in *Frankenstein* and to do so she allows her monster to defend himself in the court of ideas like F. Lee Bailey.For that matter, it's somewhat hard to wrap one's mind around the fact that Shelley's Victor Frankenstein begins his work at reanimating corpses while still at college and--instead of the more appropriate middle-aged scientist familiar from innumerable remakes--Dr. Frankenstein in this novel is no older than his mid-20s throughout. Apparently, Shelley herself wasn't yet twenty when originally composing the tale, so that perhaps explains Frankenstein's age here, but it doesn't seem quite right to have him be so young.Still, if you can get past the various absurdities, the purple prose, the frequent repetition, and the more tedious travelogue descriptions of the countrysides of Switzerland, Scotland, the frozen north, etc. there are some genuinely frightening scenes and, more importantly, still-compelling ideas that make Shelley's *Frankenstein* not only the original, but the best elucidation of the myth of the mad man of science and the responsibility of the creator towards ((and for)) that which he creates. If for only the sheer importance and enduring influence of this work in literature and popular culture, Shelley's *Frankenstein* is worth reading, and giving four stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein conjures us lurid images of Boris Karloff in the best Hollywood version of the tale, However, the classic novel by Mary Shelley(1797-1851) is better than any movie version! She composed it while on holiday near Lake Geneva. She, her Romantic poet husband Percy Bysshe and their friend Lord George Byron challenged one another to compose a horror story. Mary's dream of 1818 became the novel we now know as Frankenstein.it tells the story of scientific genius Victor Frankenstein and the unnamed man he creates using galvanism and electricity in a horrible corpse. The creature becomes a murderer escaping from Victor. The creature murders Victor's wife, best friend, brother. Victor begins a quest to destroy his own creation but die in mortal combat with the horror in the icy wastes of the barren North Pole.Victor had earlier refused his creatioin's desire for the scientist to conjure up a Mrs. Frankenstein. Victor worried that the two monsters would create a race of horrible creatures who would wage war on humanity.The beginning and ending of the novel are written in an epistolary correspondence carried on by sea captain Walton and his sister back home in England. They narrate the strange and sad tale. Though almost 200 years old the prose is quite readable. The Penguin edition footnotes add insight to the novel.Mary's subtitle was \\"The Modern Prometheus.\\" Prometheus was the Greek god who stole fire from the gods giving it to mankind. As a punishment the gods imprisoned him to a rock. Prometheus (Frankenstein) may represent modern industrial society, rebellion or chaotic forces unleashed my humanity. One thinks of the Frankenstein-like atomic bomb era precipitating the Cold.Mary Shelley was well read and drew upon her expertise in gothic horror, ghost story and adventure tales to complete her little gem of a classic. Her book is well written, thought provoking and deeply disturbing. It is a parable of the modern age of angst, fear and chaos we all inhabit each day on our conflicted globe."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Shelley's Frankenstein is a really touching story, well-told.

Also introduces the idea of humans overstepping the lines of nature by creating life and the doubts end guilt associated with genetic engineering.This paperback, is difficult to read because of the closeness of the margins and the binding.

Although it has been included in the genre of horror tales it is not so much a horror story,but more a tragedy.It's a story of scientist who creates an artificial being in attempt to understand the secrets of life.However when he gazes upon the hideous countenance of his creation he rejects it automatically thereby avoiding total responsibility for his actions.This of course brings about some negative repercussions for Dr.Frankenstein as his creation seeks revenge for his rejection.Unlike the way that this creature has been portrayed in most of the movies,the creature in this book has some intellect for it had taught itself to read and speak.Which is impressive as this man-made being never went to school or had a tutor to help.Also this character displays a human sense of empathy when it is able to identify with some of the people in the books that it was able to read.Obviously the author Mary Shelley had portrayed this creature in such a way as to gain sympathy for it from the reader.Even after this creature kills the wife of Dr.Frankenstein one still feels more sympathy for his creation rather than Frankenstein himself.The creator it seems is not so god-like in this novel for after he creates the hideous looking creature he abandons it and any responsibility for it.One wonders seriously if this man ever thought about the consequences of his actions or whether he just did it to prove himself god-like? If so maybe his ego was more in control than his intellect. That's probably why when he saw ugly the creature was he turned away from it rather than face the fact that he had botched up his creation's appearance.If he was truely dedicated to his work than he would have or should have attempted some plastic surgery to remedy the hideous appearance of his man-made being.Because of it's hideous appearance the creature recieves a less than positive response from the few humans it encountered,which is why this creature became so bitter and misanthropic.This more than anything makes this tale a tragedy than a horror story.Rather than terrify the reader,this story appeals more to one's sense of sympathy instead,especially for the unfortunate creature who through no fault of it's own is brought into this harsh world to experience the fear and animosity of it's creator and the people that it had encountered.Although written in the early part of the ninteenth century this particular story is still of current importance to our times as well,especially when we are on the brink of genetic tampering and artificial intelligence.There are some among us who believe it possible to create machines that can think and maybe even feel like us.Which does raise some disturbing questions of whether we should really want robots or machines to think and feel like we do.After seeing the movie \\"Bladerunner\\" I seriously doubt that a race of man-made beings like the replicants should be a welcome idea or that it could be of any benefit to us when we come in conflict with such creatures.If anything this novel by Mary Shelley serves as a timeless reminder of what might be the result of creating something in our image."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley had no idea when she wrote this that centuries later it would be enjoyed, or that the idea presented in the book would actually be an issue. She presents the issue of \\"playing\\" God or creating life. This is the very issue that we are dealing with now as far as cloning goes. What are the consequences of creating a creature? According to Shelley we may be overwhelmed with what we have done, and be unable to control the outcome. Frankenstein is a book that everyone should read and think about long and hard. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction... A great read, don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If a reader was to compare the macabre gothic darkness in the novels of Frankenstein, Dracula and The Phantom of the Opera, one would believe that the element of horror and depravity in each book would be on an equal standing. But the reader would be incorrect, for in respects to horror, somberness, trauma, deprivation of love, empathy and respect, Frankenstein towers above the others. It has a hybrid of excessive melancholy despair and disturbing horror. It is a work of literature where the gothic element is pushed to the zenith. Where Dracula is a novel of lust and physical intimacy, at its core, it is still a novel of love-however warped and disturbing it may be. Where the Phantom in Gaston Leroux's novel is a more well-rounded representative of human needs, Frankenstein really isn't. If anything he is a full throttled representation of anger and rage. And that is only one side of human dynamics. His is a living organism, created and plunked into the epicenter of humanity, a walking, thinking experiment that goes terribly awry. Frankenstein is not a creature of God-and perhaps therein is where the problem lies-but a concoction of man's arrogance and man's wickedness for unrepentant self-glorification. One could easily say that he is the genuine embodiment of the true son of Satan, albeit a human one. And that is truely appalling. He is the son of evil who is able to see and feel the horror of his own birth. How ironic! His abomination is both internal and external. Frankenstein obviously addresses numerous contemporary issues: the medical ethics of cloning, the wanton lack of family responsibility and the dangers that arise as a result of it, and lastly-the sometimes subtle, sometimes not-emotional evolution of humans into self-proclaimed gurus or demigods. Is there really a stark difference between Dr. Frankenstein and say, the megalomaniac Reverend Jim Jones of the People's Temple or Marshall Applewhite of Heaven's Gate? Dr. Frankenstein untimately comes to his senses when it is too late, but his desire for historical immortality via creative and scientific recklessness is no different then the hunger of contemporary, psychotic cultist gurus or tyrannical dictators-evil doers who are willing to go at any extreme in order to be remembered. Religion often plays a part in gothic works. The idea of a higher authority isn't always blatantly addressed, but its essence is surely felt. Dracula was at one point a human being who casts God to the side, makes his own decision and evolves into a horror of his own making. The phantom was a deformed being who, because of his skeletal appearance, was cast into the scummy bowls of Paris. But there was something that both of these characters had-and without sounding like a preacher-simply, they had God, a force whom they could turn to for strength and persistence. And what did Frankenstein have? A god, a father, a force who turned his back on him. Frankenstein is an especially sad novel, because the monster is truly alone in every sense of the word. He is a genetic calamity whereby only suicide could be his salvation. Mary Shelly incorporated many possibilities in this novel for the creature to find happiness, numerous inroads for human acceptance; a case-in point would be the various scenes with the creature's 'beloved' cottagers, but just when you think you have the progress of the story 'licked,' you are deceived and led down another road entirely: from hopelessness, to hope, to hopelessness, back to hope. Elegantly written and truly thought-provoking, Frankenstein is a novel that can't be limited in the things it has to say. A true classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"A story does not become as well-known and a part of the culture as this book has become without tapping in to some serious veins of the social subconscious. It is a fascinating idea, with a balance that allows for many hours of debate as to the relative merits of the monster and his creator, as well as the relative merits of the options facing Dr. Frankenstein, and whether the option he ultimately chose was the most ethical one or not. Still, much of the writing style itself is rather weak; there are places where it really shows that Shelley was only nineteen when she wrote it. Particularly given that the story is essentially told in the first person from the perspective of Dr. Frankenstein, in his voice, the fact that Shelley's dialogue is stilted and awkward is a real drawback. I realize that by the standards of 19th century fiction, the dialogue is not as poorly written as it would seem in a modern book, (dialogue was in general not a strong point in 19th century fiction) but even by those standards, the dialogue here is weak. Still, the concept is too good to rate less than four stars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"According to Hollywood, Frankenstein is a mean, gory character who kills randomly out of pleasure. Although this may be exciting, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is by no means anything like this. Instead, Mary Shelly's novel depicts a more human and compassionate side of the Being. I loved this book so much. It introduced so many new ideas that make you think, such as the idea on how far you can actually take science and technology without interfering with life and death. I liked how she described the being as a human instead of a monster, but also left out some description so you can picture him in your own way. My favorite scene in the book is the turning point, when the Being is rejected by his neighbors. This shows why he started to kill and have no feelings for human nature. Mary Shelly's style of writing is interesting. Although it's a bit slow at times, the novel was for the most part, exciting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Romantic writing and also has a great imagination."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Can't sleep at night? Need something to rest your brain? Well, if you're looking for a nice, soothing book to read, I would not recommend Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. You may think, \\"Oh, it's just a story, it won't scare me.\\" Yeah, you think that now, but wait until you read it. This story is so freaky, it even scared me....and it takes a lot to freak me out. Everything about it-the creation of the demon, the creature's killing spree, everything-was just plain creepy. It was a good book, yes-but it was also just plain odd. So when you're reaching for a book before taking a little nap, I wouldn't recommend reaching for Frankenstein-unless, of course, you like being challenged and having a lot on your mind before bed."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The monster is the most interesting, well-developed character in the whole book. The monster doesn't even join the plot for several chapters but still, he is the center to all the themes of the book and the plot. The novel is pretty much only about the monster, and to a lesser degree, Frankenstein.The creature and Frankenstein each do terrible things, but I find the creature to be more forgivable and more worthy of compassion. Frankenstein brought his problems upon himself, whereas the monster's problems were thrust upon him. He tried so hard. In the face of rejection and utter loneliness, the monster kept trying and trying to make friends. For being the way his creator made him, his creator abandons him; for chopping much- needed firewood for an impoverished family he is screamed at and abandoned; for saving a girl from drowning he is shot. Just when he feels he can't take any more humiliation and feels he will punish society, he gives it another try. Eventually, he snaps. He makes a transistion from an angelic creature to a monster.The monster is \\"eight feet tall and proportionally large.\\" He can survive in harshly cold climates and subsist on coarse food. Even though Victor is well aware of the physical toughness and superiority of the monster, he decides to hunt this creature down. In the epic showdown between the monster and Victor, the monster wins hands down. In this sense, Victor's first name is ironic. In the ending, the monster finally achieves what he sets out to do. His original goal of peace was shattered but he managed to achieve the alternative goal of asserting himself with revenge and tormenting Victor to his death. He didn't kill Victor; he let him kill himself hunting him. It's not exactly a victory for the monster, but he maintained and decided to exercise what personal power he could. He succeeded in not \\"taking it\\" and standing up for himself. Throughout the novel, although he changes drastically in demeanor, he remains dynamic. From his creation he set out to explore his world and learn to read. Then he worked on the plan to become a part of the family in the woods. After his goals of peace and love had definitely, hopelessly failed, he redirects his drive in a new direction. He's always working on something; he always has a plan. His determination and perseverence have been corrupted, not defeated. It is this unstoppable drive that characterizes the monster as dynamic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein contains themes relating to Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis. Freud placed a high value on interpreting dreams for psychological insight. Right after Victor brought his creation to life and realized he made an abomination, the scientist raced to his bedroom and finally fell into a troubled sleep, but awakened \\"disturbed by the wildest dreams.\\" He dreamt that he saw his fiance Elizabeth and as he kissed her he beheld the corpse of his mother in his arms. He delayed his marriage to Elizabeth to create the monster, and passively allowed the monster to kill her on their wedding night. Victor's troubles began in college when his mother died and he rebelled against his father by reading books that he forbade Victor to read. Psychoanalysis might determine of Victor that he inwardly struggles with the \\"Oedipus Conflict\\" in which, as Freud established, children develop their first sexual desire for their parent of the opposite sex and therefore have hostility towards the other parent.Freud also contended that anxiety arises from \\"libido\\", or repressed sexual and aggessive desires. Indeed, Victor's anxiety of the monster on his wedding night is parallel with his anticipation of marriage to Elizabeth. As stated earlier, Victor even postponed his marriage to create the monster which would later kill his bride on their untried marriage bed. Freud said that each person has an aspect of themself, which he called the \\"Id\\", that contains antisocial desires which we repress and as libidinal forces, constantly seek expression in distorted, concealed ways. Freudians might say that the monster symbolizes the Id of Frankenstein, that hidden aspect of himself which violently desires to destroy all that he loves. The monster's ugliness fits well with representing this ugly aspect of Victor. The monster and Frankenstein are bound together as one. When Victor finally dies, the monster, too dies. The two hated each other passionately and each made it his life to end the life of the other. Freud said that \\"forgetting\\" is often motivated by a subconscious desire to repress some painful memory; but all that we repress seeks expression in all sorts of symptoms. After Victor abandoned the monster, he acted in such oblivion to his creation. But, like painful memories repressed, the monster would reappear very ugly in Victor's life and ardently express his fury. Victor tried to repress and control the monster only to find the monster controls him. Similar themes arise in \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\""},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Among the many themes of Frankenstein, one of them is that of friendship, ambition, and the conflict between the two. The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship.Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to \\"benefit all mankind\\" with his scientific project. His \\"selfless\\" ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father. In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a \\"most severe evil.\\" Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society. His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat. Likewise, this is where Victor's ambition leads him when he's hunting down the monster in futility. The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results. As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project. The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night. Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none and which is the very thing that turned him from good to evil. While observing an impoverished family, \\"the bitter gall of envy\\" arose in the monster. He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty. When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race, the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed. The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great , if not the greatest, need for man.I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive. At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort. Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our \\"native town to be the world,\\" he adds, \\"yet another may succeed.\\" You could interpret this as Victor not \\"learning his lesson;\\" that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions. Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous. After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein was a pretty good book. It was about a guy named Frankenstein who created a monster using dead parrs of dead people. The book was semi-interesting as the story went along.

You always here these stories about Frankenstein that did not happen in the book. As I was reading the book, I was a little shock at what was happening in the story. When the monster was coming to life, I was expecting something more than all of sudden he is alive. I thought the part about when the monster, whose name is not even Frankenstein which was another shock, was watching after the family for all those days. He was only trying to look out after the family and the children. The only part of the book that I disagreed with was how all the humans were treating the monster. He was only trying to find a friend. On the other hand if I saw a monster on the streets, I would probably run the other way. The book definitely brought out the issue of racism. Another issue in the book that was definitely gross was the thought of Frankenstein and Elizabeth falling in love with each other. Also, how she brought these feelings out that he had for his mother. Another part was when Elizabeth was murdered. You could see that coming. Why Frankenstein did not stop the monster from committing this crime blows me away. Overall, the book was not bad. I gave the book a three because it was not the greatest book I ever read but it was an interesting book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If your a horror fan you know the story, this is one of the originals. it's timeless and always a great read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Most movies are true to the basic storyline: A young scientiest, Victor, commits scientific hubris by creating a monster that would eventually murder all his loved ones. If you like horror, this wouldn't be so bad a premise, although the true message of the book seems to be more \\"take responsibility for your actions\\" rather than \\"ambition is evil\\", which Victor practically says in the end.The biggest problems I had about the book are the characters. It was almost ridiculous how one of them could have stopped what was happening or at the very least their own deaths - Henry might have come earlier, Justine needn't have given the necklace straight away to the authorities (if she'd lived there her whole life, shouldn't she have known how unfair they would be?), Elizabeth or Frankenstein's father would have noticed the string of unfortunate events and would have concluded that something very, very wrong was going on and ordered extra protection. Besides that, Victor tended to view them through rose-coloured glasses (understandably, I suppose), making them almost perfect in his eyes.How he introduced external pieces of information was a little hard to swallow, too. For example, Elizabeth's letter about Justine. The amount of story fixed to characters who don't really matter - such as Felix's family - is very trying. Maybe the author went on about them in length because she wanted to show how the monster could somehow talk like a Shakespearan actor; but no matter the way you look at it, it is a little ridiculous he managed to talk that way with just about a year's study, unless you accept the movie-verse information that it was more of the monster remembering than learning.Other than that, it was kind of interesting, though it would've been better if the characters were given more personality so the audience could care about them, too. It's worth reading, definitely; a tale of very serious consequences of an act not all too thought out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you love early 19th cetnury literature you will love this novel. Yes it deals with the creation of life but at its heart it is a story about love, lonliness and the struggles created by man's unchecked ego.For those reading this based on their love of the 1930's movie, know that they are not the same story. Hollywood took great liberties with the story in order to create their great movie. For modern readers this classic in no way resembles a Horror story; if you are reading it to be scared you will be dissapointed but on the other hand if you are reading this to expand your mind and experience true genius then you will be greatly rewarded.Concerning this e-book edition: it is just the novel and as far as i could tell it read true and it was also problem free."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"There are several good reasons for reading FRANKENSTEIN, by Mary Shelley.First, it's an excellent example of literature of the English Romantic period. It has the Gothic element as exemplified by its eerie monster; the detailed appreciation of nature with its descriptions of lakes, mountains, forests, and ice floes; and the idealization of the common man in its central characterization of the humble DeLaceys, who are at first so much admired by the monster.Second, it is the first example of science fiction in English literature, as science is used to create human life in the laboratory. Some may argue that the third voyage of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is also science fiction with its flying island, thus making FRANKENSTEIN the first complete novel in this genre.Third, the plot of the novel is an intricate frame story that contains not one, not two, but three narratives. The outside frame consists of the epistolary technique--a series of letters exchanged between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret. Walton is exploring the North Pole region on his ship when he sights first a giant who is fleeing across the ice and then shortly afterward Victor Frankenstein in a physically diminished state. Walton rescues Frankenstein, who was pursuing the nameless, eight-foot tall creature. Frankenstein then proceeds to tell his life story in an extended flashback.A brilliant student, Frankenstein's reach exceeds his grasp when he makes the decision to play God. Using recycled body parts of humans and animals and his knowledge of chemistry, he creates a monster with yellow eyes and yellow, almost transparent skin, so hideous looking that Frankenstein abandons his creation as soon as the thing opens its watery eyes. The monster disappears, and Frankenstein himself is ill for a period of time. Eventually he learns of the death of his young brother, supposedly killed by his caretaker, who is subsequently tried and executed. Frankenstein suspects otherwise and eventually confronts his ghastly creation, who confesses.This confession, which is the third narrative, will wring the heart of the reader, and this account is the finest part of Shelley's novel. The monster has frightening encounters with humans and so eventually hides near the cottage of the DeLacey family. He watches them, falls in love with their humble lifestyle, and does farm chores for them at night in secret. By listening to them, he learns to speak and by borrowing their books, again at night, he learns to read. Thus he becomes the educated creature confessing to Victor Frankenstein. Finally, the monster gets up the courage to reveal himself, first to the blind DeLacey grandfather, but when he is discovered by the adult children, all hell literally breaks loose.I cannot emphasize enough how poignant and heart-breaking this section of the novel is. After his rejection by the DeLaceys, the monster burns down their cottage and eventually murders his creator's brother. Now he asks Victor Frankenstein to have mercy on him--by creating a mate for him! It will be a new Eve for the new Adam, and Frankenstein reluctantly agrees. However, when the time comes to do the deed, he cannot bring himself to bring another monster into the world.What follows is a continuation of Victor's story and then Walton's--it is a tale of madness, mayhem, and murder that eventually ends in self-destruction on the ice floes of the North Pole."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I am not a big fan of horror books and movies, so I was a little reluctant to starting on this book. But after the first pages I got totally captivated and I couldn't leave it out of my hands. It is actually a very interesting story about how people don't always foresee the consequences of their actions and about men's creations that can go dangerously out of control."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This was a good used book at a good price. It arrived in a timely fashion. I was pleased overall."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The beginning of the great scary books. Read the old time original supernatural/horror story. By the best of the best"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Unexpected because: 1. I didn't realize that it would be like reading Austen - similar, flowery style from a similar era, and 2. I didn't realize how different the story was from the movies. This book has themes about the responsibility of the Creator, about selfishness. I enjoyed it and am glad I read it. If you read it, be sure to get an edition with a good introduction - the background is quite interesting."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Nearly everyone alive has seen at least one version of a story about Frankenstein. Nearly all of those versions are less than faithful to Mary Shelley's original, and phenomenally creative, version. Frankenstein was the creator of the creature, not the name of the creature itself.Victor Frankenstein studies science, seeking not only to learn, but also to understand the nature of the life. His desire for knowledge leads him to seek out discredited and outdated theories of science, which he seems to couple with modern knowledge. In essence, Frankenstein appears to combine pieces of the old and the new in his quest for deeper knowledge.Using his eclectic knowledge, Frankenstein develops a technique to reanimate dead things, eventually deciding to build a human being. Shelley leaves the details ambiguous, avoiding issues with actual science. The creature that Frankenstein creates verges on hideous, and Frankenstein flees his creation. When Frankenstein returns, the creature is gone.The remainder of the novel is devoted in portions to Victor Frankenstein and his travels, and the creature and its travels. We see events first from Frankenstein's perspective, and then from the creature's perspective. While Frankenstein sees the creature as a monster, the creature at first kills by accident. Later, the creature's rage at being unable to be accepted by humans leads to psychopathic behavior on the part of the creature.The creature gives Frankenstein a chance to stop the killing by creating for the creature a female bride. Initially, Frankenstein agrees. Later, Frankenstein considers the outcome of his original actions and decides that he cannot create a bride for the creature. It is Frankenstein's decision that leads to the final scenes of the story and the poignant, nearly inevitable, ending.This novel is extremely complex in its examination of morals and the role of science. Shelley seems to portray science as a potentially evil or deadly force. Shelley does seem to mute her criticism of science by distinguishing between the outdated theories studied by Frankenstein and the relatively benign modern sciences. Thus, Shelley appears to be saying that some things man was not meant to know or do, which is a very common theme in modern science fiction (e.g., \\"Jurassic Park\\"). The result of arrogant hubris on the part of any scientist who fails to consider the morality of his or her actions is death and destruction, often prolonged, and often directed at the people the scientist loves the most.\\"Frankenstein\\" is considered by some historians, e.g., Brian Aldiss, to be the first science fiction novel. Stories and novels earlier than \\"Frankenstein\\" tended to be more fantastic, freely incorporating occult and mythological sources as the basis of events. While Shelley uses outdated or no longer pursued branches or theories of science as a source of some of Frankenstein's knowledge, which might somehow be associated with the occult, or perhaps mythology, she maintains that this knowledge is science rather than mysticism.This story meets the most fundamental tenet of science fiction: make one assumption or hypothesis, a \\"what if,\\" as it were, and build the story about this assumption or hypothesis. The hypothesis in this novel is that there is a way for flesh to be animated. The creature did seem to have nearly superhuman powers in strength and endurance, but if you can assume the ability to create life, I suppose you can assume the created life contains incredible capabilities. None of the creature's capabilities appeared to be beyond the realm of what might be possible in a human form.Regardless of whether the novel is science fiction, the novel is gothic horror, and, because of certain aspects that I did not discuss, includes elements of gothic romance. Shelley clearly roots the creature's origins in science, but because science imbued the creature with incredible capabilities, including stealth, strength, and intelligence, the creature traverses terrain with ease in weather that would thwart most humans, providing the creature with almost supernatural capabilities, a gothic trait.Shelley also first describes the creature's murders in a way intended to elicit tension and apprehension because the creature appears to be either amoral or immoral, yet another gothic attribute. Only later does Shelley explain the creature's motivations in a logical way that removes some of the horror aspect, though almost bizarrely increasing it because the creature's motivations go from being unknown and apparently random to being defined and specific, giving the creature a psychopathic characteristic.Mary Shelley was quite young when she wrote this novel, and sometimes I got the feeling that the story was on the verge of escaping her artistic control. However, her unfettered creativity provided us with an incredible work of fiction that forms the basis for many of the science fiction and horror figures we know, and love, today. Among these are the mad scientist and the \\"alien\\" creature that escapes from the creator's control and either kills indiscriminately, or seeks to kill its creator. In addition to the \\"mad\\" scientist,\\" Shelley also created the conflicted scientist who is simultaneously fascinated and repelled by the very science the scientist controls.Fans of science fiction, horror, and gothic novels should take the time to read this book for pleasure. Portions of this book may be difficult to read, but in the end, I thought the story was well worth the effort, especially the poignant end.A word of caution: Amazon has mixed the reviews of multiple versions of this novel together, as Amazon tends to do. Thus, reviews for abridged versions, children's versions, and audio versions appear mixed on the same page, in addition to various editions. I do not know which edition I am reviewing (the information at the beginning is unclear), only that the version is unabridged. If you need a specific edition, I suggest obtaining a print copy with the version specified rather than trusting to an electronic version of dubious edition.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I purchased this novel for my son for his english class.

He is a whiny piece of s*** and I could not find any redeeming qualities in him at all. He caused the whole issue through his own pride and arrogance and instead of dealing with it goes catatonic instead. He then proceeds to gambol around and inflict his invention on those he loves all the while crying \\"woe is me\\" like a pathetic teenager.The only interesting part of the book for me was the monsters tale.

Eventhough I had a hard copy, I was able to lend the hard copy to student and continue to read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Well, this is only the second work of fiction I have reviewed and the first of its genre that I have ever read. As many may know, the novel is much different than the movie adaptation.In the novel, Frankenstein's \\"daemon\\" or \\"monster\\" is highly articulate, intelligent, and agile. A creature standing eight foot tall, he scales mountains with superhuman ease and endures temperatures and hardships that would fell a mortal man. Created by Victor Frankenstein from overly large parts (for ease of construction), the good doctor is instantly horrified by his creation and immediately abandons it. Forced to experience life without reference, and rebuffed by humanity, the creature experiences the psychological pain of being rejected for nothing more than his grotesque appearance. Over time he learns to speak and read by secretly observing a family as they teach a newly arrived immigrant the ways of society and language. He first introduces himself to the family's blind patriarch and performs many secret good deeds for them. But disaster soon follows when the sighted members of the family discover the monster and drive him away. This, along with other disastrous encounters with humanity, vow him to destroy his creator, Victor Frankenstein.However, in Chapter 10 we learn of the monster's harrowing life experiences through his own first-person narrative. And though he has unintentionally suffocated Victor's young brother, the monster vows never to kill again, if only the good doctor will make for him a bride to ease his loneliness. Although conflicted, Dr. Frankenstein reluctantly agrees and travels from Geneva to England to complete this work. However, in the midst of his second creation he sees the first monster jeering with delight in the moonlight. Frankenstein contemplates the horror he might unwittingly unleash upon mankind were he to create another terrible beast. At that thought, he destroys the half-made bride, enraging the monster who promises to destroy his creator on his wedding day. This he does by murdering his family members one by one, beginning with Dr. Frankenstein's new wife. At the last, Victor Frankenstein succumbs to grief and exposure near the arctic circle, where he has chased the monster with a view to destroy him.In the last pages, the monster encounters the ship's captain who has befriended Dr. Frankenstein in the last days of his life upon encountering him on an ice floe in polar waters. Indeed, the entire story is told through the captain's letters to his sister. The book ends with the monster confronting the captain and recounting his extreme sadness and conflict at the death of his creator. The monster leaves the captain unharmed after the creature reveals his intention to commit suicide by immolation for all the evil he has caused.By modern horror standards, the book is quite tame. Yet it leaves the reader to contemplate the unintended consequence of mankind's overreach into the affairs of God. The book is all the more remarkable considering that Mary Shelley wrote it after she turned 18 years of age, finishing it and seeing it published at age 19. Despite this, the vocabulary and polished textual style are those of a person easily twice her age, and her knowledge of the Bible, Milton and other works of literature and poetry are all the more remarkable. The book was originally written as a warning against 19th century galvanism; at the time electricity was being applied to animate corpses and many wondered at the possibility of artificial life and contemplated its theological consequences. This debate that has been renewed today in the wake of the abject failure of embryonic stem cell research (in contrast to adult stem-cell research which has shown many benefits). If good lessons are best taught through good stories, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein surely deserves to be read. All the better that the novel is less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was taking an online literature class, and almost all the books were in the public domain, but reading on screens strains my eyes, Dover was a life saver!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is Mary Shelley's best (only?) work.

Thus it has stood the test of time and is taught in schools even today. The story is profound with themes of bravery, adventure, unrealistic human aspirations and fundamental questions about good and evil. The most amazing thing to me, however, regarding the book, is that it was written decades ago by a teenager who was stranded in a house during a freezing winter is Switzerland. The book was actually written on a dare, \\"While we've nothing else to do, let's write a ghost story, the best one wins.\\" (I'm paraphrasing of course). But essentially this is what happened and the result was this profound, spiritual horror story about the aspirations of a man trying to be God with an inevitable but interesting Shakespearean ending of tragedy. There are lessons to be learned from this book. Profound lessons, and how a teenager, especially a female teenager could create such a masterpiece establishes that the human capacity for imagination and teaching in the context of a novel is something that simply can not be denied. It's sad that modern literature seems to lack this soaring imagination, originality of form and inevitable conclusions of right and wrong which beam brightly from this outstanding work of fiction. This book should be required reading for all English speaking people and perhaps for all people across the world. I give it the highest recommendation possible."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is not a scary novel. it is a suspenful one. all ages can read this clasic story by mary shelley."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Sometimes I read a book after seeing the movie. And, often the book's plot is heightened or better flavored - maybe because I hear the voices of the better actors who brilliantly perform roles of masterpieces.This is one of those books where I saw many versions of the book prior to reading. And, even spoofs of the book - whether it be Mel Brooks or Abbott and Costello - touched upon main themes which made me believe the previously seen movies followed the core concept of the literature.I was surprised.This book is a clever yarn by a brother who ventures to see and gets stuck in the polar ices and witnesses two men - one chasing the other - in the blinding white. The big one gets free, and the small one climbs on board of the brother's boat - and then delivers his tale for the next 40-60 pages. That tale is then woven with monster's tale of what happened to him when he escaped his creator's lab.Frankenstein speaks? Yes. Any good? Many languages. How educated a level? With great use of the vocabulary, no less.And, Frankenstein is not a nemesis to the villagers, who chase him with fire and so forth. No, he is the nemesis to the creator - who returns with his tale after the closure of the monster's account of growing in the mind: learning behavior, learning language and more.Ultimately, the monster demands that his creator make a mate or else. The \\"or else\\" makes the monster more a Dr. Jekyll than an innocent lout who walks about with large shoes, and responds in primitive fashion to other's actions. Oh no - this monster is devious, plotting, and controlling - intentionally killing innocent people affiliated with the creator to implore upon his creator of his seriousness in demanding that Dr. Frankenstein make him a mate.Wow.

I liked the messages about love,college, and family...even the message about not judging by appearences and not trying to go overboard with the science experiments.Because there are so many movies not at all like the book,I wish BBC or some genious would make a movie based on this classic...then many more people would get the shivers and the message in another beautiful genre...film."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I wanted to read much of the free books with my new kindle and I started with this edition of Frankenstein. It was a slow start to a book which I imagined would be amazing based on its popularity. It took me over a month to get through it because of the less suspenseful moments. I started two other books before finishing this one. However when the book picked up it was a great read. Also confusing at time to who was speaking and the dialect made me review much of what I had already read.This edition was free and I love free books.In reading this book you must remember it is taking place over 200 years ago and the dialect is far superior to most writings of today, so some dictionary searches may be necessary. Even though it was not as good of a read as I expected I would still recommend it to anyone who wants to read the classics."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I normally don't like books that are written in epistolary format, but Frankenstein is an exception for me. The book manages to squeeze a lot of pathos out of the viewer for the 'horrid' monster. And even for today's audience's, there are portions of it that are as nail-biting as a thriller. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"When I bought this, I thought I knew the story. You know, the overdone cliche of the dark, stormy night, the sudden flash of lightning and the evil cry of It\`s alive! as the shrouded figure rises from the stretcher. Buckle up folks. This is a dark, disturbing tale that cautions against overambition and foolish, willful persverance against nature. I love this story, and I know you will too. And seriously. Its free. Just read it.Hannah McLellan"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The story of FRANKENSTEIN is a tale that never seems to go away or get tiresome because it is a true literary classic that addresses fundamental questions about who we are, what we are capable of and how our choices generate enormous consequences. This beautiful 'INTERVISUAL BOOKS' leather-bound edition of the much-published adventure of the mad scientist who creates a new being out of pieces of dead beings is worth picking up and reading, even if you have a copy already or have read the story before. And if you haven't, you are in for a real treat. Not only is the story wonderfully inspired, the background about how it came to be written by Mary Shelley (wife of the much-loved poet; Percy Bysshe Shelley) is equally compelling. And the writing style of that period (1818) is like a time machine that takes you back to the period where the story is set. The book was first published under the title 'THE MODERN PROMETHEUS'."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"***This review may contain spoilers***Because the subtitle of Mary Shelley's atmospheric, gothic tale is \\"The Modern Prometheus\\", \\"Frankenstein\\" has traditionally been interpreted as a cautionary tale against seeking forbidden knowledge or \\"Tampering in God's Domain\\". Nonsense. In Greek mythology, the Titan Prometheus defied Zeus's edict against giving mankind fire. Yes, he did suffer Olympian torment by being bound to a rock and suffering an eagle's daily ritual of snacking on his liver. However, Prometheus's defiance DID benefit mankind, and Prometheus's liver grew back each night. Furthermore, during his legendary twelve tasks, Hercules killed the eagle and released Prometheus from his ordeal. Tampering in a god's domain ultimately paid off.Tampering in God's domain has usually benefitted mankind in reality as well. If we didn't, we'd still be living naked in caves and be vulnerable to severe weather changes and predation. Yes, but one might say that Victor's creation or reanimation of life inappropriately encroached on a function exclusively in God's job description. Nonsense again. Humans create life all the time by having sex. So no, Victor's true transgression was not seeking the amelioration of the human condition by creating life. Instead, his true sin was not taking responsibility for the life he created.Seeking knowledge about the world in itself is not wrong. Doing so selfishly and without concern for the consequences definitely IS wrong. To paraphrase Ian Malcolm's observation in the movie \\"Jurassic Park\\", sometimes scientists are so engrossed in finding out whether they can make a discovery, they neglect to consider how to, or whether they should, put it to \\"good use\\". Victor does exactly that. There is no sense in \\"Frankenstein\\" as to what benefit Victor will put his resurrection abilities. There is a sense that Victor wants to create life just so he can say he can. He is heedless. Instead of making a being of normal human proportions and appearance, Victor just rushes ahead to make an unsightly giant just because the bodily parts are easier to manipulate. When he succeeds, Victor flees in disgust and terror from the creature. When he returns to the lab to find the creature gone, Victor rejoices.As a result of his abandonment by his errant \\"father\\", the creature has to stumble through a second life alone through trial and error. His infant-like sensations gradually get clearer and he adapts. At least \\"deadbeat dad\\" Victor gave the creature one advantage (however unlikely) besides physical strength; an apparently brilliant, perceptive brain. The creature doesn't grunt inarticulately for long. As he seeks invisible shelter with the DeLacey family, the creature succeeds in becoming not only literate, but also quite eloquent. Nevertheless, no matter where he goes, or whatever good deeds he performs, humanity shuns the creature for its ugliness. This undeserved isolation inexorably drives the creature to acts of envious spite, deceit, and murder.I believe that despite his descent into malignancy, the creature largely maintains the reader's sympathy because as he himself says, \\"I am malicious because I am miserable\\". We are wont to blame Victor as the ultimate source of the havoc the creature wreaks. And yet, despite his anguish, the creature does not regress into a mindless killing id. He is introspective and remorseful for all the deaths he directly or indirectly causes. If only the creature had encountered Victor before his killing rampage, we feel, his philosophical reasoning would have convinced Victor to rehabilitate his creature and facilitate his entry into society. Alas, the creature also could have, but also fails to take responsibility for his actions and thus compounds his misery. The only thing that redeems the creature in our eyes is that he is at least aware of his failure to take responsibility, and will at least make some amends by presumably immolating himself so he doesn't kill any more. Victor, to the end on his deathbed on Captain Walton's sailing vessel in the Arctic, never does and even feels he has behaved honorably through life!Being irresponsible can make anyone a monster, some (Victor) more than others (the creature)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book was way ahead of its time when written. It is more about prejudice and not liking people because they look different, than a monster story. The \\"monster\\" created by Frankenstein is actually a very complex character with deep thoughts about philosophy and life in general. He strives for the acceptance of his creator who virtually abandons him. The book has virtually no similarity to the movie later produced with Boris Karloff.The only problem I have with the book is that Shelly never tells you how the monster is created (unlike the \\"it's alive\\" scene with lightening and electrodes that made up the movie). A true classic that will never get old."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"First off, let me get this out of the way - this is not what I expected. When one refers to Frankenstein, the image conjured up is always the square headed, green skinned Karloff with bolts through his neck (at least, for us non eggheads :P). I am so glad that I read this book just to see who and what Frankenstein's monster really was before Hollywood got ahold of him.There is a mysterious feeling surrounding this book when you know how it came to be. Read the Author's Introduction if you read nothing else. Their talks on the subjects of the day ring in the background of Frankestein and, since we are after all dealing with Byron and Shelly in the background, one can almost feel the mood that must have been present that summer.As for the content of the book, the main question I find interesting is that reviewer/critic Harold Bloom said that the greatest paradox was that Frankenstein's monster had more 'humanity' than his human creator. It is a good angle from which to read the book. Frankenstein (the creator) works feverishly to learn the secret of resurrection and once he succeeds, abandons his progeny to a cruel world that can not see his inner beauty for his gruesome appearance. The spurned creature turns to his creator and threatens him into helping him by creating a mate so that he can have some solace in the world. With this he would be peaceful. Are his acts the acts of a monster or of a man pushed too far? Honestly, the book itself brings up the questions but I didn't see that they were answered. Of course, I might be missing it. Regardless, it is fun to read and you owe it to yourself to find out what Hollywood jipped you out of."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is scary - in a good way. As set apart from the typical notion of Frankenstein as a green monster with nails sticking out of his head, the true daemon was pale yellow, with flowing black hair. While many people have interpreted the novel in different ways, I feel it depicts three main points:1) Excessive desire for knowledge is not a good thing, as it leads to a lower appreciation of the beauty of the world. As a child, Victor Frankenstein enjoyed looking on the beautiful mountains and hills of his native Switzerland, but then he got deep into science and the secret of life. And this led him to a gloominess in life, and a lack of wonder at the world. While working on creating the creature, he says, \\"It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest, or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage: but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.\\"2) Man's sinfulness always passes down to his creation, and the results are horrific. I am a Christian who believes man is sinful at heart, and I saw a dramatic illustration of this principle in &lt;i>Frankenstein&lt;/i>. The sins of Victor Frankenstein passed down to his creature, and eventually it destroyed his friends, his family, and even himself. Says Frankenstein, \\"I considered the being whom I had cast among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror, such as the deed which he had now done [his murder of Frankenstein's brother], nearly in the light of &lt;i>my own vampire, my own spirit&lt;/i> let loose from the grave, and forced to destroy all that was dear to me.\\"3) Man is responsible to care for the things he creates, or else the results are dreadful. Once Frankenstein breathed life into his creature, he immediately was struck with horror and regret at what he had done, and he abdicated his responsibility to guide it. The creature consequently turned into a miserable, vengeful brute. He says, \\"I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part, the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature; I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.\\"I believe this novel is worth reading to gain a sense of horror at these points. It should lead us to continually appreciate the world's beauty, to always repent of our sin, and to take care of our creations, especially our children.If you don't read the book for these points, then just read it for a good story. It's truly fantastic. :-)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The image that most of us have when hearing the name \\"Frankenstein\\" is a huge lumbering monster with little or no intelligence. This is the image I had when first reading Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein or the Modern Prometheus.\\" Nothing could have been further from the truth.The story starts with letters between a man and his sister over his choice to explore the artic region. While trapped in ice, this main and the crew of his ship meet with the infamous Mr. Frankenstein. From here, Frankenstein tells the horrid story of how is attempt to play God backfired.His story starts with young Frankenstein first leaving his home and the family and friend he loves so much. He is headed off to a university to study the natural sciences. During his time here, his reputation grows until he is one of the most respected members of the university. It is by chance that he happens to stumble upon the secret of creating life from that which is lifeless. After many months of solitude in his labratory, Frankenstein is able to successfully create a living being. The problem is that his creation is too hideous to behold. Frankenstein immediately shuns his creation as does the rest of society.From here, Frankenstein gives the long account on how the creature came to be his ultimate tormentor, shadowing him wherever he travelled, giving Frankenstein's heart no time for rest.What surprised me most about this story was just how human Frankenstein's creation was. He learned to speak and feel emotions just like a human being. He did not start out as an evil creature wanting to wreak havok on humans. It was society's reaction to him that drove him to vile actions. Even his \\"God,\\" his creator, Mr. Frankenstein, had forsaken him. A lot of references to \\"Paradise Lost\\" by John Milton were thrown into the story which added an interesting parallel between the Judeo-Christian creation of man and Frankenstein's creation.Before reading this book you should try to cast off any preconceived notions you have about Frankenstein. You won't find any dimwitted brutes in this story, only some extremely tormented individuals who are brought to the brink of madness."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you are expecting the novel Frankenstein to be like horror scenes depicted in the movies, you better think again. Instead, Mary Shelly allows the reader to create more images in his or her own mind. Today, we are so brainwashed to violence and gory images on television, that we sometimes forget what \\"real\\" horror used to be like. When you read Frankenstein don't forget that Mary Shelly wrote the book in the 1880's in a time of social unrest. The writing style is different, and the pace of the novel is not as up to date as modern books. Her descriptive words allow the reader to create the monster in his or her own mind, without actually seeing it. When Shelly writes, her words give such detailed images of what is going to happen next. For example, when something \\"bad\\" is going to happen, Shelly generates a spooky and mysterious setting.One of the major themes throughout the book is science technology. When Victor creates the monster, he is challenging science, and therefore challenging God. When the creature awakes, Victor realizes that he has just done a \\"horrible\\" thing. He is disgusted with the thing he created, which led him to feel extreme guilt and compete rejection of the monster. Is it science that led him to self destruction? Shelly wonders how far will technological advances go before a man becomes too dependent on technology? Science destroys his life because the monster dominates him, and Victor winds up being a slave to his own creation.What was also interesting about the novel was how Shelly made the reader feel sympathetic for the monster. After all aren't we supposed to hate this thing? She portrayed the creature as a \\"normal human\\", showing love and affection. The creature's ugliness deterred anyone from coming close to him, and made him feel like an outsider. This rejection from society made the monster sad and helpless. His only revenge was to engage in destruction. This is when the \\"real\\" monster is created. After reading parts of the novel I felt bad for the monster, in a way I never thought I would.Although slow paced, Mary Shelly's style of writing will allow you to take on different dimensions and force you to develop your own profound ideas about the topics discussed in the novel. I think Frankenstein is a great Romantic classic for anyone who has a imagination."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Written almost two centuries ago, Shelley's science-fiction/horror novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; retains its powerful messages and questions to this very day.A devoted scientist, Victor Frankenstein, attempts to return to life a body he has constructed from various human parts. He succeeds, only to realize the hideousness of his creation, and subsequently flee.Confused but sympathetic, Frankenstein's monster finds himself shunned by humans. Eventually, a series of tragedies turns him against humanity, and he turns his thoughts to seeking revenge on his creator for not providing him with either protection or companionship. Meanwhile, Frankenstein is determined to protect himself and his family, while removing his mistake from the world. The two spend the latter portion of the novel in a drawn-out duel, spiralling towards misery for both of them.Shelley's work raises profound questions about the limits of science, its requirements for wisdom as well as intelligence, the responsibilities of parents, and the nature of revenge - quite an accomplishment for a novel of only 250 pgs. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"There is no quantifying the impact of Frankenstein. Whatever it is about, it commands a heavy reaction about loss, tragedy, love, innocence, true Christianity, ethics and personhood.Cloning in this scientific age might not be as challenged as Shelley's world was. On one hand, we have a beast, sans a mother's womb to birth from, on the other, we have a wretched society of bigotry and anger... The monster's ardent natural morality mixed with ID-like needs and a child's tenderness tears at the reader. Is he real? Is he, despite his innocence, like an unborn baby, free to be aborted? Or, is he validly human, as human as you or I, or like that fetus moments after it leaves the womb, kind and gentle, yet ignorant?A great catapult toward discussion and analysis, or just a plain old good read, but not without impact.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In her classic novel Frankenstein, Mary Shelley creates a fascinating, thoroughly engrossing story about a young scientist who gives life to an inanimate creature. Through their relationship, Shelley explores the pinnacle of human achievement and at the same time the depths of degradation.It is difficult to precisely define the relationship between Frankenstein and the monster because Shelley presents the dynamic combination of a father to a son, a creator to a subject, a master to a slave and vice versa. Their relationship seems to evolve through time and through their associations with each other. Initially, when the monster confronts Frankenstein, we witness the creator/creation perspective. &quot;Yet, you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?&quot; In this exchange, the monster accuses Frankenstein of rejecting his own creation, but more importantly, he claims kinship with his creator, resolutely binding himself to Frankenstein and compelling Frankenstein to confront his own deeds and the consequences of his actions. It seems as though the monster is more aware of responsibility and devotion of one creature to another than the scientist. When the monster begins to describe his experiences with life, new sensations with nature, his fears and trepidation about associating with humans, his very survival against all odds, he takes on the role of a lost child. The relationship between Frankenstein and the monster resembles that of a father to a son, albeit a father who has neglected the parental responsibility to love, nurture and care for his offspring. The relationship even resembles that of a mother to a son, but in this context, it is Mary Shelley who is the creator of the monster through her incredible imagination. Shelley stirs our sentiments as readers, compelling us to feel for all the characters involved in this gruesome and powerfully moving story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I'm a long time fan of classic creature features. I grew up on the stuff. Saturday Monster Theater, my hometown station called it. Every Saturday afternoon at 2pm you could find me rooted two feet from the television, rods and cones soaking in the black and white flickering images of mummies and werewolves and monsters and creatures from boggy swamps. It was a genuine passion that resulted in many nightmares and a heightened imagination (and, I like to think, a warped sense of humor). One of my favorites was Frankenstein. The creature embodied the spirit of the boogey man that strode leisurely through my dreams while I ran against Jupiter's gravity. I watched it every time it played. I was around six before my dad told me that Frankenstein wasn't the monster's name. That is not truly the case in Shelley's novel - the monster moniker fits well on several characters. Hers is not the kind of gritty fright you get from The Evil Dead or the kind of nerve-fraying suspense Scream offered. In fact, it is a novel in the truest sense. It was written nearly 200 years ago in a time when it took writers years to perfect a masterpiece. It was crafted in an age when stories were told around campfires and not on the brain-sucking portal to the mindless world of programming directors and slathering yes-men. It is not concise and if you're looking for a relaxing, fast paced read to pass an afternoon, then you can stop reading now because this tome has meat. I do not believe in revealing plot in a review, so suffice it to say that this is a novel of love, obsession, vengeance and ignorance. It burrows into the psychology of a man and a \\"wretched creature\\" and you'll be surprised at what turns up. Though the most common school of thought seems to be that this novel is a twisted analogy of God and man, creator and creation, I believe it is almost a testimony against prejudice. I'm not a Shelley scholar, but this screams from the pages louder than Mae Clark from our Zenith console twenty-five years ago. A slighter lesson is that, if we confront our demons too late, we hurt the ones we love. But it is truly the story and not any theme or correlating allegory that makes this a novel worth reading. For me, it's always the story. And I will reveal none of this one here. I will say that there is no Boris Karloff lurking behind a tree within Shelley's romantically articulated pages. If you're looking for a literary companion to your childhood memories of the black and white horror staples, you won't find it here. But you're apt to find a lot more."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"There are, of course, umpteen book editions of this all-time classic. Why choose this one? Because it has a very well written introduction that does much to establish a sense of the personal challenges that Mary Shelly faced while writing this gothic, incredibly prescient tale.Mary Shelly had experienced her share of tragic circumstances, and she knew the pains of loss of life, and how our deeply embedded desires to overcome grief can lead us to hope for -- life out of death. And to think that she was only 19 when she wrote this book, one that is, if anything, more relevant to our times than to hers! I won't give anything away here, except to say that knowing something of this young author's personal circumstances really heightens appreciation for the book as well as her literary talents. I commend the New York Public Library for publishing this fine edition.The comperhensive introduction also traces the history of various adaptations of the novel, including of course, the James Wale films from the 1930s. It appropriately points out how many of these adaptations completely missed key elements of the story. In that respect, I must admit it is fun to read the young readers' reviews, and sense their excitement in discovering the deeper levels of meaning in this story.

My best friend altered my thinking of the book by giving me a brief description of what occurs as the scientist Victor Frankenstein tries to unlock the powers of creating life and then assuming responsibility for his tragic mistake. I've several novels under my belt since the reading of this majestic work of art. I can't imagine what my life might have been like had I not read this book and discovered the joy of reading. Did I mention that I really like this book?!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Everybody ought to read this book at some point in their lives. ITs such a part of our culture. Naturally the book has NEVER been represented by the movies, not even Kenneth Branagh's MARY SHELLY'S FRANKENSTEIN, tho the 1931 classic hits the mood right on. Anyway, the book will overwhelm you when you read it. Once you get past the ornate language, and the \\"romantic\\" literary influence of the German gothic movement's fascination by suicides, ghosts,and various vampire-like themes, the story really is affecting. (Shelly, Lord Byron and Mary entertained themselves when they were hanging out around Lake Geneva by reading translations of German gothic horror stories.) One wonders how a 19 year old woman pulls this book out of her conscousness. Well, read Mary Shelly's biographical information sometime. Her mother died giving birth to her. Then, while she had started to write the novel, her half sister committed suicide. Right after that, Shelly's WIFE committed suicide--WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT--due to Mary running off with her husband. Plus while she was writing, Mary miscarried her first child. Mary had three children by Shelly altogether, but only one lived for any time, tho he also died as a child. Post partem depression severely affected Mary, after her first still born baby. (Her depressions over these deaths became so severe, she'd stop writting for periods of time.)Given the confusion of guilt and depression, Mary could have very easily felt responsible for the death of her mother because of her own birth, then the suicide of Percy's first wife and their unborn child, Mary's own first child's stillbirth, and finally her half sister's suicide. (Who knows if Mary's half sister left some kind of note blaming Mary for ruining her social standing in London, for running off with Shelly.) Whatever the circumstances, guilt plays a part in every tragic death. Surrounded by so much tragic death, and Mary's depression, guilt over at least SOME of these deaths certainly consumed Mary's mind. Its not at all hard to draw a line between the severe, maddening guilt of Victor Frankenstein, for the people his monster murdered, and guilt Mary felt over the deaths just mentioned. Perhaps even the destruction of the female monster, was Mary's desire to tear her own self to pieces and bury them at sea, to keep any more monsters (ie tragic deaths) from occuring.One thing that strikes you when you read the book, is how much GUILT OVER DEATH is much more of a theme, than the typical theme you usually encounter. (If man tries to play God, he suffers the consequences.) Maybe by refusing the Church's moral stance against adultery, Mary's \\"alter ego\\" felt she was playing God with what 1819 society viewed as God's commandments. Out of divine punishment, Mary could easily have felt her first baby died at birth, because Percy Shelly's unborn child died, when his wife committed suicide.(India's religious ideas were popular at the time as well, so karmic retribution may have been naggin at mary's conscience, adding fuel to the flames of compunction.) Some people see FEAR OF STILL BIRTH as the central theme of the story. Giving birth to something dead, is certainly what Victor did by creating his monster, as well as Mary when her baby was born dead. For me, this story's theme is more about a mother's GUILT that accompanies still birth, as well as GUILT felt when other people die, as a consequence of one's personal decisions. Given that her first child's death, Shelly's first wife and unborn child, and her half sister all died while Mary was writing this book, it would be nearly impossible NOT to see Victor's guilt as a mirror to Mary's own guilt. IF this emotional realism were not present in the heart of the novel, it would not affect as many people the extent that it has, for hundreds of years.Mary's own destiny was just like the Victor/monster character. After Shelly died when Mary was 24, she never married again. SHe put herself into a cold, barren emotional wasteland, never marrying again or having more children. At the end of the story, Victor and the Monster end up in the frozen wastelands of the North Pole. (A symbol for Mary's own emotion distance from humanity.) By that time in the story, the Monster and Victor were emotionally indistinguishable. The monster claimed to feel as much sorrow, guilt and sadness, as well as emotional rage and anger, as Victor did over the various deaths of his family and friends. NO doubt Mary was feeling as guilt ridden, if not enraged at the vagaries of Fate, that the Monster and its creator felt as well. The monster reflects his creator Victor, and Mary reflects her creation, the Novel FRANKENSTEIN. And this mirror within a mirror works so well, because when it comes to tragic death, GUILT will always drive the survivors crazy. The REAL FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER is Mary's Guilt for the deaths she endured, and even caused by proxy, while writing the novel. SHe must have known this on some level, and therefore refused to give the monster a name. How can you put a name to such a hideous monster, that is essencially your own soul? (The PICTURE OF DORIAN GREY works the same way symbolically.)The power of guilt within all humanity, will cause this book to resonate for as long as there are people who will feel guilty over tragic deaths of those closest to them. That is the real fear of this monster...its not of defying God, its not fear of the dead, its fear of GUILT over the deaths of others."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This paperback, published by Simon and Schuster, is NOT a bowdlerized edition. Instead it is the 1818 version, one preferred by many scholars."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In the spirit of Halloween, I've sought out a piece of famous literature to review: Frankenstein.It starts off with Captain Robert Walton's expedition through the icy waters of the north. Lonely, unschooled and with an awkward affinity for men, Walton haplessly finds Victor Frankenstein near death on the tundra. He takes him aboard ship, EAGERLY befriends him and nurses him to health like Florence Nightengale. Frankenstein then takes over the story as he tells Walton all about how he came so close to dying as he pursued a \\"monster\\" over the freezing plains.Victor is a major outcast, antisocial and withdrawn. Though difficult to get close to, he does latch clingingly to those who manage to connect with him. He finds success as a student at the University of Ingostadt. There, author Mary Shelley lets us know in the vaguest way possible that, Victor discovers the \\"secret of life.\\" He develops a God complex and vows to create a new race of beings who will worship him. His only successful subject, patched together from dead body parts, is \\"The Monster.\\" Victor immediately abhors this wretch and casts him out, realizing that this was a really bad idea to begin with.Just when Frankenstein thinks he can just go on his merry way and live life like nothing ever happened, news reaches him of his little brother having been killed. When Victor returns home for the funeral, the monster seeks him out and takes over the story, eloquently spinning a dreadful yarn about loss and abandonment. The Monster is not happy at all with Victor, his god, creator, master, who sent him away out of disgust at his physical form. The Monster is expressed as being 8 feet tall, disfigured in the face and able to move at superhuman speed. None of this reminds me of Boris Karloff, making the novel a stranger story than the movies.The Monster reveals to Victor that he did kill his brother, that he learned to speak and read no thanks to him and that his benevolent nature had been twisted into something cruel and terrible thanks to society's intolerance for people who look differently. Pissed off at having to live life in hiding, the Monster says that he will kill everyone Victor loves unless his \\"god\\" does this for him:make him a mate - someone as gruesome as he is, to live happily with, refusing the rest of the world in peace.All three voices - Walton's, Frankenstein's and the Monster's are well done but Shelley doesn't step into the male role very well at all. Some of the dialogue between seemingly heterosexual men could come right out of a novel with Fabio splashed on the cover. But I felt sorry for the Monster and I think Frankenstein was a jerk and had it coming. I'm still very awed at how different the novel is from the movies, which were apparently adapted from the stage plays. I think I better appreciate the novel, an instant success upon publication."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Somehow, 175 years after it was first written, this story keeps holding our attention. Not just that, it says more to our modern world than it ever said before.Popularized versions of this story lack all the depth of Shelley's original. Yes, her monster was physically huge, powerful, and respulsive. In her version, though, he's a thinking, feeling, and deeply intelligent person. He is deeply hurt by the universal, unreasoning loathing that judges only his face - even from the man who created him. The creation has a majestic capacity for affection but, in a credible transformation of emotional alchemy, that whole capacity turns to rage. He is not an image of hate, but a mirror of it.The hubristic biotechnologist has an immediacy today that Shelley could scarcely have imagined. So, I think, does the vengeful lashing out by people who feel they have suffered grievous wrongs, leading to a deadly spiral of increasing hatred by all parties. I just hope that current readers will take the time needed to absorb this book properly - it was never paced for today's ADD-driven generation.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is recommended for anyone interested in contrasting the 'original' version of the story with the (mostly) better-known film versions from Universal and others. The novel is anything but a 'mad scientist' yarn, with a great deal of soul-searching from both the title character and his creation. As noted in other reviews, the language is the typically 'flowery' prose of the early 18th century, and there are several instance of paragraphs being restated just a few lines apart(presumably Shelley rewrote some paragraphs over the course of several years, without eliminating the originals).I thought there was a bit too much time spent on some of the minor supporting characters, all of whom seemed to have deep, complex backstories usually found in TV soap operas. Once Frankenstein and the monster finish their lengthy 'flashback sequence' storytelling, the action picks up, and the basic 'man vs. monster' conflict takes over, enhanced by each character trying to reconcile their actions with their own 'inner demons'.The scientific plausibility is questionable at best, and some may not like the less than clear-cut explanation behind Frankenstein's 'creative process'. I think the ambiguity can be set aside for the sake of an entertaining story. If you can make it through the middle chapters of the book(AKA, 'the bit with the family in the cottage'), you'll be won over by 'Frankenstein'."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written in 1818 is amazing in part because it is still so readable and enjoyable. Based on my vast experience with bad horror interpretations of monsters, I expected this book to be dull with a main character who was both slow and stupid. Not so. Shelly creates a monster who possesses a reasonable IQ and incredible physical abilities. This book has a good plot, dialogue and fast-paced story. It is easy to read, understand and has an unanticipated ending. Highly recommend for middle school and above."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is a little book that is a very creditable effort for a nineteen-year-old author to have written. It is not a masterpiece, per se, and it bears almost no relation to the famous Universal films. The style is very 19th century, with florid prose, melodrama, and epistles, but it isn't boring (nor is it particularly scary). You'll be better off having read it than not, however, and it'll take a day at most."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"... you create it, you name it, or else.Shelley's Frankenstein is impressively written. Frankenstein is just so much more than a tale of a madman's obsession with his ambition and his creation of a monster. This novel encompasses human life and philosophy. Not only is this a story containing all elements of literature, it holds hidden meanings and truths that apply to life. An excellent job is done in tying the novel into other matters beyond the actual storyline. The message is relatable and interpretable, which makes for good discussion and meditation. This novel is a beautiful example of popular and debatable questions being aroused in the form of simple literature. The overall theme was clearly brought out through the text. This book has a purpose. While reading, one is taught that all actions have consequences. If you step out of bounds, you will pay. Frankenstein is truly a classic. If you have not read it, you are missing out."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Like a lot of people who avoid this book because they think they are familiar with the story, I continually passed this classic over until I had to read it for a class.I was absolutely humbled and astonished that a girl of twenty-one could write such a fantastic story.This book is not about some monsterish ogre who skulks the earth searching for victims...not at first. This was a being given life by an overzealous scientist and then promptly abandoned because of his outer ugliness.Victor Frankenstein's monster lives in solitude and finds ways to learn language etc... but what he really craves is love and some kind of mutual contact. This book says so much about the importance society places on appearances. Every time the \\"monster\\" tries to reach out to someone he is beheld with the utmost horror and disdain. He begs his creator to make him a female counterpart so that he may no longer be lonely. It is when the creator, Victor Frankenstein, selfishly refuses this favor that his creation torments everyone Victor loves.This book necessarily makes one think about what they would do if they were the monster. There is logic, if not vengence in his actions. What he does to his creator is justified in his own mind, and you may very well find that you feel the same way.This is a quick one or two day read and I highly recommend it as a classic that will enrich your overall reading experience."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Much like Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story we all think we know, but really don't. Very few films have consciously attempted to follow the novel too closely (which shouldn't detract from the excellent James Whale/Boris Karloff film, or its masterpiece-sequel, \\"The Bride of Frankenstein). Thus, everything popular culture \\"knows\\" about \\"Frankenstein\\" does not originate from literature, but from films. This is a shame, in a way, because the novel itself is, if not the progenitor, an early vessel of so many archetypes found science fiction and horror.The basic plot remained intact when transferred to other media. Swiss medical student Victor Frankenstein discovers the secret of life (which he never reveals, lest someone repeat the mistake). He then puts together a body, essentially a man, from various corpses. He then becomes horrified by the creature he has built, and abandons. The creature, suffering a great deal of neglect and abuse, still manages to get a thorough education, and learns of his lineage. After murdering Victor's younger brother, and framing the family maid, the creature tells his (admittedly) sad tale to his \\"father\\", and then demands a mate. Victor, in a panic, agrees, then thinks better of it at the last moment, destroying the new bride. In retaliation, the creature murders all of Victor's loved ones (including his wife), and leads Victor on a merry chase across the world.Most probably know that Mary Shelley wrote this book in response to a challenge issued by Lord Byron, during a vacation at Lake Geneva. (Along with this story came John Polidori's \\"The Vampyre\\", the first English vampire novel.) Most probably also know that Shelley went on to write other works of imaginative gothic fiction. Still, her modern reputation rests with this book.As stated, numerous archetypes (themes, plot lines, characters) are present here. The basic fear of what evil technology may bring along with the good is a central theme, as is the warning against playing God. So is the implicit admonition to be responsible in all things, be it during innovation or being a parent. The creature is, for all intents and purposes, an android-everyone from Gort to C-3PO owe their existence to the Frankenstein monster. And the monster that slays all but one protagonist is a staple of horror, be it traditional monster movies, like \\"Alien\\", or more realistic slasher movies like \\"Halloween\\".But, as I noted at the beginning of this review, certain of these elements have been lost in most interpretations. The creature is actually intelligent, and well-spoken, quite different from the inarticulate grunts or slow, half-sentences of the movies. Further, while the films have made lightening a staple of the creatures creation, Shelley never really explains the process. Finally, one of the staples of the films is the explanation for the creatures \\"evil\\" nature. Often, the problem lies with the brain used, which almost invariably is a criminal brain, or is damaged before implantation. In the book, the creature is really a child that's horribly neglected, but with the strength and intelligence to strike back: id without superego, and without restraints.Thus, \\"Frankenstein\\" will be a new experience for readers who know the source exclusively from the films. Unlike \\"Dracula\\", there aren't any moments where a reader might look up and suddenly realize how quiet it is in the house, or how dark it's gotten outside. In that regard, \\"Frankenstein\\" has not aged particularly well. Throughout, however, it is a moving, disturbing, depressing, but also a touching and beautiful tale. Those qualities have withstood the test of time. While it is not always a rollicking adventure, it is a rewarding read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Modern readers must jump through a number of hoops to enjoy this legendary novel. Written between 1816 and 1818, this is very much a novel of its era, and both language and ideas about plot are quite different from those of today. That aside, and unlike such contemporaries as Jane Austen, author Mary Shelly has never been greatly admired for her literary style, which is often awkward. But perhaps the biggest hurdle is that of our own expectations: while it certainly sent icy chills down the spines of 19th Century readers, FRANKENSTEIN is not a horror novel per se.While Mary Shelly might have been stylistically weak, her story was not. Nothing like it had been written before, and the concept of a student endowing life upon a humanoid creature cobbled together from charnel house parts was unexpectedly shocking to the reading public. But even more shocking were the ideas that Shelly brought to the story. Having created this thing in his own image, what--if anything--does the creator owe it? And in posing this question, Shelly very deliberately raises her novel to an even more complex level: this is not merely the conflict of man and his creation, but also a questioning of God and his responsibility toward his creation.In some respects, the book is written like the famous philosophical &quot;dialogues&quot; of the ancient world: a counterpoint of questions and arguments that do battle for the reader's acceptance. More than anything else, FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of ethics and of ideas about ideas, with Mary Shelly's themes arrayed in multiple layers throughout: God, self, society, science; responsibility to self, to society, to the things we bring to society, to the truth; life, integrity, and death--these are the ideas and issues that predominate the book, and any one expecting a horror novel pure and simple is out of luck.Mary Shelly is a rare example of a writer whose ideas clearly outstrip her literary skill--but whose ideas are so powerful that they transcend her literary limitations and continue to resonate today. And indeed, as science continues to advance, it could not be otherwise so. Mary Shelly could not see into the future of DNA research, laboratory-grown tissues, test-tube babies and the like--but between 1816 and 1818 she wrote a book about the ethical dilemmas that swirl around them. And for all its flaws, FRANKENSTEIN is perhaps even more relevant today than it was over a hundred and fifty years ago.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This \\"enriched classics\\" is a bowdlerized version of Mary Shelley's original text.

Yes there is a scientist who creates a being and brings it to life. And yes there is a central \\"monster\\" that creates havoc. However, it is more than just a scary story. The commentary on the potential risks to society caused by technology can be taken into account today. You also learn that the \\"monster\\" is not some mindless being, but there is a back story. I'm only disappointed in the fact that it took me so long to pick up this book to read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Those who know Frankenstein only from movies and television may well be surprised to read the original book by Mary Shelley. Indeed, one may well look back to the cover to see if the book is in fact Frankenstein because the first pages consist of messages from an R. Walton to his sister concerning his expedition to the northern polar regions. Victor Frankenstein appears as a wretched creature stranded on an ice floe beside the ship. After he is rescued and recovers somewhat, he tells his incredible story to Walton, who in turn preserves the story in writing. Frankenstein reminisces about his happy childhood, particularly the close relationship between himself and his &quot;cousin&quot; Elizabeth, and then explains how his interest in discredited natural philosophy led him to create a living man of his own design. The creature is a hideous, misshapen, giant of a man who so disgusted Frankenstein upon his awakening that he fled his laboratory and residence. The creation process, it should be noted, in no way involved an elaborate machine powered by lightning such as is portrayed in the movies; in fact, beyond the fact that chemicals are involved, we are told nothing of the process. For two years, Frankenstein goes about life with a clinging sense of guilt and nervousness, hoping the creature has perished. When his little brother is murdered, though, he returns home and soon discovers that it was the monster who committed the deed. In an isolated mountainous area, the monster appears before him and explains his actions. Although the creature does nothing more than grunt in the movies, the original Frankenstein was possessed of great eloquence and intelligence, and he tells a moving story about his attempts to make a connection with a society that is revolted at the sight of him. He describes living in a small hovel at the back of a small house for many months, watching the interaction of the family inside, learning how to speak their language and eventually even learning how to read. When he eventually tries to interact with the family, he is assaulted and runs away, and it is at this point that his virtuous and peaceful nature begins to become inflamed into a torrent of hatred for mankind. When he rescues a girl from drowning, he is rewarded with a bullet in his shoulder. Each time he performs a good deed, mankind runs from him in disgust or attempts to harm him. Living in total isolation and loneliness, his one purpose in life eventually becomes tormenting his creator, and many terrible misfortunes ensue for Frankenstein, who himself eventually becomes dedicated to the sole purpose of destroying his tormentor.Both Frankenstein and his monster are tragic figures. The complete alienation of the creature makes him a very sympathetic character in many respects, and he does perform many kind deeds for humans early on. Frankenstein is an utterly pitiable character utterly destroyed by his mad decision to create the monster; he burdens his soul with responsibility for every crime the monster commits, and his inability to tell anyone his secret for so long destroys him in body, mind, and soul; everyone and everything he cares for is taken from him by his horrible creation. His tendency to bemoan his fate at every turn of the narrative can get rather tiresome, but one cannot question the depth of his turmoil. Both creator and created seem to be mirror images of each other in important ways, their fates clearly tied to one another, each soul deserving both blame and pity. There is much about human nature, both good and bad, revealed in the monster's life as well as Frankenstein's; the novel is a far cry from horror for the sake of horror. This is actually a very complex, compelling story full of human pathos; it is unfortunate that modern media have turned Frankenstein's creature into a simple, heartless, mentally deficient monster for the sake of scares and laughs."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I got the free Kindle edition from the link on the page for the Norton Critical Edition of the 1818 text. Mary Shelley made many significant edits to the book for the 1831 edition. I assumed it was the same edition because the link was from the same page. I didn't realize it was different until I went to write my assigned essay and went online to search for page numbers for the passages I wanted to quote. Many of the quotes I wanted to use don't even appear in the original version. This is a very important distinction, and I wish it had been labeled correctly so I would not have had to waste so much time looking for online versions of the correct text in order to replace the quotes I could not use from the later version. This edition is fine if you just want to read the book, but if you're reading it for school, you have more than likely been assigned the 1818 version, which is very different. The Kindle edition is also lacking in any kind of Kindle formatting, making it a hassle to find locations in the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I always avoided reading this book because it was one of those often assigned in high school - while I enjoyed some of the books we read, I am still scarred from the Red Badge of Courage and Tess of the D'Ubervilles.

Fewer people are aware of Mary Shelley's original intent. The literary &quot;monster&quot; is vastly different to the irradicable Hollywood interpretation. He is lucid, well-spoken, limber, and (at first) ripe with loving and moral intentions.Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a tragedy, first and foremost. Sophocles would have been proud of young Mary, only in her early 20's when she wrote this tragic tale of carelessness and consequences. Victor Frankenstein's tragic flaw is his wild thirst for knowledge, which develops into recklessness and disregard for life. He becomes consumed with exposing the secret of creation, a &quot;forbidden&quot; knowledge (thus the novel's subtitle, &quot;The Modern Prometheus&quot;). He discovers it and creates a living being, but is disgusted by the outcome and disowns his creation. Thus his original act of irresponsibility breeds another. He is ultimately condemned to pay for both.The monster (he is never given a name, a stigma of his rejection by human society) is tragically flawed as well. Born a naive with a good heart he is nevertheless hideously disfigured and monstrous. Although he yearns for human companionship, his appearance dooms him to bitter isolation. The agony of rejection ignites a hatred inside of him and he declares war on humanity. He focuses his rage on Victor, his accursed creator. But the monster is painfully lonely and thus willing to leave Victor in peace in exchange for a companion, one created from human scrap, just like him. I won't divulge any more of the plot; suffice it to say it just keeps getting better.&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is just as contemporary and significant now as it was back in the early 19th century when it was published. The grandiose themes that it addresses, such as morality in modern science, the meaning of humanity, racism, etc., are still ones that we struggle with today. But more importantly, this is a fascinating and entertaining novel! I raced through it like a Newfoundland towards water! I can't say that I was completely engrossed with every passage - there was an excedingly dull section when Victor retreats to the mountains, but it only lasts for 15 pages or so. And there is a pervasive (almost overwhelming) feeling of gloom and despair throughout the bulk of the novel, which may tend to irritate some readers. But these minor faults should not prevent interested parties from reading this novel. You're reading the review, you're interested, so buy it! You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"When I came across this book I had to buy it. If you're a fan of classic horror, you'll love the story that inspired the movies. But if you're looking for a couple hundred pages of grunts, growls, and \\"fire bad...arrrrggghhh!\\" don't buy this book. It's a more intelligent read than that. I won't go into the story itself, most everyone around the world is familiar with the basic premise of the Frankenstein tale.The book itself is beautiful. If you want eye candy for your bookshelf, this would satisfy any literary sweet tooth. It's a leather bound book. How can you tell it's real leather and not simulated? You stick your nose close to the binding and sniff. If it smells like a brand new pair of Buster Browns it's leather. Along with the leather binding it has quality end pages, the page edges are gilded giving them a nice sheen when the book is closed, and like a good quality bound book it has a sewn in ribbon book mark.It's been printed in fairly large print on heavy stock paper and is easy to read, but as this work of fiction was penned almost 200 years ago the reading may be a little slow until you get used to the vernacular of the early 1800's. However, there are footnotes throughout the book that define and explain certain words and references that might confuse the modern reader.This is a true literary classic, no library should be considered complete without this title in the collection. This particular edition would be a beautiful addition to anyone's book collection."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This was well formatted for Kindle. Dark, Gothic and broody at times. Shelley can still speak volumes to readers in this novel. Well written and and hopelessly addicted to this classic. READ IT."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"One of the hardest things to do when wanting to immerse oneself in some classic novels is to understand characters who react in ways that are incomprehensible to our modern sensibilities.Victor Frankenstein, the creator of the creature usually called \\"Frankenstein\\" by those of us familiar with the countless movie and cartoon variations of this tale (but called \\"the creature\\" in this book) is weak-willed (he changes his mind at the slightest provocation), fragile (every shock either sends him into an illness lasting months or into a fit of madness), thoughtless (he creates life and then leaves his creation completely alone), and almost astonishingly dumb (if somebody threatens \\"I'll see you on your wedding night,\\" wouldn't you at least consider that the threat might be against your intended and not yourself?).The book is very different than a modern reader might expect (beyond the distasteful main character). While modern science-fiction readers are accustomed to being flooded with details about the science of the book, Shelley presents Frankenstein's amazing accomplishment as a single step between inspiration and completion. He simply decides to create new life in his university appartment and does it.The creature is the revelation in this book. Incredibly articulate (he taught himself language by spying on a rich family fallen on hard times and reading books he found in the woods), he attempts to use language to forceFrankenstein to have pity on him. Unfortunately, language isn't enough to turn Frankenstein's head around. Thecreature responds by targeting all of Frankenstein's loved ones. The violence we expect from the tale is there -- it's just mixed with surprisingly philosophical discussions between Frankenstein and his creation.The book's structure isn't flawless. Frankenstein travels -- a lot -- and Shelley thinks we need detaileddescriptions of everything he sees. The narrative is a little clunky (I love an epistolary novel as much as thenext person, but why bother if every single document is going to be from the same person and in narrative style?).However, the fact that the creature is so different from what we expect is what saves the novel -- the delight ofdiscovering what he will say and do next is what keeps the reader moving through the novel.The Kindle formatting is perfectly acceptable. I read a couple of other reviewers fault the lack of white space -- but if that is very important to you, you aren't going to be happy with too many free public domain Kindle books."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This novel is one of my all-time favorite books. I was surprised by the humanity of the Monster; the traditional portrayal of Frankenstein is usually a bumbling stumbling monster, and Mary Shelley's real creation is nothing of the sort. The book is exciting, thought-provoking, and holds your attention until the very end. Read it on a stormy day."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Today the story of Frankenstein and his \\"monster\\" is thought of as a horror story, bringing to mind the performance of Boris Karloff and bolts in the neck. But the original Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's literary creation, is in fact more science fiction than horror, asking us the question of what is man in a world where science can work miracles, even with life itself? Or are there things mankind should best leave alone? The \\"monster\\" in this novel is therefore not the frightening thing, but rather a victim of the strange experiment, an involuntary resurrection, the tragic result of man tinkering with the provenance of God.It is worth noting that this question is one which is still with us today, in our world of medical miracles, and the fact that we still wrestle with questions about when to let death take its natural course shows that Shelley and her story were more than just idle speculation, but a deep examination of the question of what it is to be human. For death remains frightening today just as it was to our ancestors, and you cannot read Frankenstein without wondering if, given the same opportunity to defeat mortality, you might make the same decision these characters do."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Those of you who have preconceived notions about this story because you've seen the Hollywood film versions, read this book. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I guarantee it. This is nothing like the film and so much better. Shelley, in her brilliance, offers the hideous creature as the one to pity here. Not Frankenstein, not the townspeople, but the creature. A sad victim of his creator's selfish ambitions and the prejudices of a naive populace. In a way, a neglected and abused child, driven to acts of violence and rage as the only release from the agonizing rejection and isolation. His only real crime was his consuming need for acceptance...a friend...to love and be loved. This book was so ahead of its time when it was written. I highly recommend it.

If you put Mary Shelley & Bram Stoker together in the Boxing Ring of Horror, Mary would beat Bram with both arms tied behind her back.It is not like any of the movies, including the awful \\"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.\\" This Monster is huge, fast, intelligent, stealthy and ruthless. Most importantly, he is a Monster first and foremost. Except for some parts near the end, the story is almost entirely from Viktor's point of view, and the Monster, his nemesis, is a totally evil and horrifyingly unstoppable Enemy.All the movies make the mistake of adopting the Monster's self-pitying, self-justifying point of view right from the get-go, thereby turning him into a sort of tragic hero. While this material itself is not entirly untrue to the book, it has been presented (in the movies) at the wrong time and in the wrong context.It is, however, a thoughtful book.

The most fascinating aspect of the novel is the transformation of the monster - initially the reader is repulsed at the creature, and then as they learn the monster's biography, humanitarian feelings of pity and of sympathy is all that the monster deserves. Hatred towards Frankenstein grows - due to his selfish thirst for knowledge, the downfall of him, his family, and his creation is inevitable.

The moral of the story appears to be that the only reason Frankenstein's monster acted like a monster in the first place was that his creator abandoned him, showing no love, mercy, or compassion for his own creation. Because Frankenstein's monster was not accepted by humans, he decided to reject them completely, killing and harming innocents.If you can get past the meandering prose, I do recommend the story, but it is unfortunately a very badly written novel."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"\\"F***ing Frankenstein\\" is the way to go, by far! Don't take my word for it, take Jonathan L. Davis's word.In 1831, Mary Shelley created a monster when she published Frankenstein. Much like her protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, she did not know what havoc she would unleash with her creation, what social mores upended, what ideas rethought, what literary trends rebuked. A memorable lesson: when we finish creating our work, we become powerless; our creations have their own journeys of which we are no longer a part. Victor Frankenstein imbued life into something inanimate. He released a monster. And so too did Mary Shelley - with Frankenstein, a monster of literary endurance, living on for almost two centuries. But for how much longer?Enter writer Matt Allen. What Matt Allen has done here is revolutionary. He inserted the word \\"f***\\" and its gerund \\"f***ing\\" into the text. This is not sedition; this is galvanism. \\"Galvanism\\" is the term Victor Frankenstein used to describe his scientific method when reanimating life. Matt Allen - with the surgical precision of a cardiologist - galvanizes our interest in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, breathing new life into its barely beating heart with the scalpel of the crude.To dismiss Allen's placement of profanity into the novel as \\"blasphemy\\" or \\"sacrilege\\" is to miss the point. In 1831, critics denounced Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as a \\"horrible and disgusting absurdity\\" (Quarterly Review). Frankenstein has a long history of subversion and what Matt Allen demonstrates here is a coy understanding of Frankenstein's true scholarly tradition. Much like Mary Shelley's subtextual warnings of the evil of the industrial revolution, Matt Allen, in his profane Frankenstein, exposes the same dangers of the information age. While old Manchester coal mines sooted up the streets with black and phlegm, digital media perverts the literary landscape with cut/paste and search/replace.Matt Allen may not be the last to put his learned fingerprints on a literary classic, but he may be our most canny academe. To read \\"F***ing Frankenstein\\" is to read the real Frankenstein - a modern Prometheus, as Mary Shelley so artfully describes. For what is Frankenstein if not immortal, shifting, complex? Would Mary Shelley approve of Matt Allen's version of her text? Does it matter? She created a monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Let us compare two perspectives from which to 'see' this work by Mary Shelley---through the eyes of Victor Frankenstein's or through the eyes of that doctor's creation. Let's begin with the latter; and in the words (yes, 'he' speaks in the book) of that creature/daemon/monster/being: \\"I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion; the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall become a thing of whose existance every one will be ignorant. My vices are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which I am now excluded.\\"But, alas, it was not to be for Dr. Frankenstein's bodily creation, as 'he' admits to \\"...daily vows [which] rose for revenge---a deep and deadly revenge, such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had endured.\\"\\"Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind.\\"\\"Once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.\\" \\"...I desired love and friendship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this?\\" \\"But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.\\" \\"Am I to be thought the only criminal , when all humankind sinned against me?\\" And, akin to that berzerk kid in Virginia who went on a killing spree (in April of 2007) Shelley puts in the mouth of Frankenstein's creation the same words that that kid utilized after the fact: \\"You made this happen.\\"(Dr. Frankenstein's creation speaks well, does he not? Get a load of this sentence from the Doctor's creation, as the creation, in his own words, describes his seeing a young girl carrying a pail thusly: \\"As she walked along, seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose counternance expressed a deeper despondence.\\")Then we have the sympathetic Dr. Victor Frankenstein:\\"I had often, when at home, thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.\\" Actually, to be frank (pardon the pun), we not only have Victor and his creation's viewpoints, but Victor's viewpoint of the 1818 edition of this book and the 1831 revised (by Mary Shelley herself) edition. Likewise the Doctor's creation changes in some respects between editions. So we have 4 varying perspectives through which to view this novel, you could argue. While there were many stylistic changes made (I consulted the 1818 text---Frankenstein (Oxford World's Classics)---to see for myself what the differences were, just for curiosity), more substantive changes were also made, as well (substantial enough to give us another two takes on our pair of major characters). So, what were the changes? Well, for the 1831 version, Dr. Frankenstein's character was made more sympathetic, \\"who is partly absolved from blame for his early errors\\" (Appendix Oxford 1818 version). In addition, Dr. \\"Frankenstein's character is now built up as admirable\\" (Oxford again). And Dr. Frankenstein is given lines about 'the guardian angel of my life,' as well as referring to his soul. And, finally, Victor's love interest is made a non-relation in the 1831 version while the women in question in the 1818 version is his consistently identified and referred to as his (first) cousin. So, one could argue that Dr. Frankenstein was tempting fate in the 1818 version---the love interest with a first cousin and his being a scientist without an overly religious consciousness trying to replicate life; ie., attempting to play God---while in the 1831 version we get a far more sympathetic characterization of the Doctor: \\"I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thristed for the moment when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings.\\" Who can really say why Mary Shelley made these changes, but It seems hard not to credit some of the tragedies which befell her in the interim. The 1818 novel was written by a daughter whose parents \\"had been heavily influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution,\\" and her father, to boot, was a radical of the anarchist Left; \\"an ex-Dissenting minister turned atheist...\\" While the 1831 version, one could conjecture, was influenced by these tragedies: the suicide of her husband's first wife (after Mary had stolen away with the then already married man), the death of 2 (of her 3) children, and the drowning of her husband. (The latter---the Oxford edition introduction notes---put her in a more precarious financial situation (not completely relieved until her father's passing in 1844.)So, where does that leave us? Which version should one read? Well, that's your call. Both versions convey, in Mary Shelley's own words, how \\"Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.\\" But at the same time, both versions pretty much make Dr. Frankenstein's artificial creation sympathetic too. The two versions just reorder the stress between these two notions; the 1818 version (SeeFrankenstein (Norton Critical Editions)) leaning more heavily on the former (but nowhere nearly so as does the James Whale classic Frankenstein film---Boris Karloff'sFrankenstein - The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of); wherein the creature is not portrayed as sympathetic and Victor is portrayed as a 'Mad' scientist), and the 1831 version being more of a fudge. (07May) Cheers"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Too many \\"Monster Mash\\" ditties and cheap movie treatments (\\"Young Frankenstein\\") have made us forget this story's deep pathos and overwhelming sadness. Rewind to Mary Shelley's original. \\"Frankenstein\\" is about recklessness, man's inhumanity to man, and the potential idolatry of science.The creature's desire for friendship mirrors Dr. Victor Frankenstein's desire to confide his secret to someone \\"normal.\\"Our author, the wife of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, wrote \\"Frankenstein\\" when she was only 19 years old. Her story construction shows a remarkable sensibility that we'd find, if at all, in people much older. Some examples:Her choice of name for Victor's university instructor -- Professor Waldman. He encourages Victor's medical research to better diagnose and treat disease. Waldman represents the \\"wall\\" of ethical norms that no person, no matter how talented or well meaning, should go beyond. To do otherwise, a person may well lose himself and all he holds dear. Victor charges past the wall with disastrous results.Ambiguities of time and setting increases the story's power. Victor Frankenstein's faith tradition is left undetailed. Frankenstein sounds Jewish yet Victor and his family seem part of Geneva's gentile establishment. Perhaps VF is Roman Catholic and retains that religion's unhealthy fascination with the dead (with its disturbing statues of nailed-up Jesus and the habit of praying to deceased \\"saints\\"). Odd yet welcome that these people are in the vanguard of today's pro-life movement.It shouldn't escape notice that Geneva, while an international city at Europe's crossroads, was also home to John Calvin's experiment in Reform Protestant theocracy. So is Victor a Jew, a Catholic, or a Presbyterian? We aren't told and that's crucial. Shelley is showing us that spiritual blindness is an equal-opportunity malady.Negative reactions to the creature give us a glimpse of the violence lurking just below the surface of \\"civilized\\" society. Shelley's story is a signpost for how the manufactured men of advanced biology and other minorities-cum-servants come to be treated in a violent society. For prologue, see Alex Haley's \\"Roots.\\" For meditations on the future, view the movie \\"Blade Runner.\\" For contemporary applications, consider the debates over cloning and stem-cell research against a backdrop of a country where boxing, professional wrestling, the International Fighting League, and fisticuffs in hockey are taken to be normal instead of the abominations they truly are.The only weakness in \\"Frankenstein\\" is the creature's ability to speak. It's not clear how he received this power. The Vilna Gaon once told his most accomplished student, Rabbi Chaim Volozhiner, that it's not especially difficult to create a man if a person truly understands a book known as the Sefer Yetzirah. The creation is known as a golem. A golem can do everything a normal man can do including reason, the Gaon told Rav Chaim, the exception being the ability to talk. The speaking spirit that G-d gave Adam and subsequent members of the human race can only be bestowed by G-d.\\"Frankenstein\\" would have been even more terrifying and moving had Shelley withheld the power of speech (and some better movie treatments have handled it this way). Victor finding the creature's thoughts in a journal after his reign of terror would have been more poignant. Guess we can't blame our British Protestant author for not knowing Jewish tales involving golems.It's possible for Jews to become Frankensteins -- consider what Dr. Bernard Nathanson did to the unborn, including his own offspring, in the name of \\"women's rights\\" and \\"reproductive freedom\\" (read BN's \\"Aborting America\\") before his soul reawakened. Yet if Victor Frankenstein is Jewish he lacks the key ingredients in being an Israelite -- compassion and acceptance of responsibility.Failure to accept responsibility is what got the early fathers of mankind cursed (see the Book of Genesis for how G-d reacts when Adam tries to put off his sin on Eve and when Cain questions whether he needs to concerned about the whereabouts of murdered brother Abel). Noah moved the ball somewhat but only took responsibility for his own family. Our father Abraham, history's first prophet, was the pioneer in taking compassion and responsibility outside one's own tent, making converts and doing kindness to strangers. This set the pattern for Abraham's descendants and the spirit would manifest itself powerfully in his great-grandchildren Joseph and Judah, the sons of Israel.Notice in Genesis how the story of Judah taking responsibility for his children with Tamar (even embarrassing himself publicly in doing so) comes amid Joseph beginning a journey that will include stewardship of Egypt and a grand act of forgiveness. The Torah is showing us that the new ethic is blooming on two tracks destined to become one.The culmination comes when Joseph publicly tests Judah over the matters of their father (Jacob/Israel) and brother Benjamin. Judah demonstrates that his repentance and acceptance of responsibility are complete and immovable. Joseph's reservations melt and the brothers are tearfully reunited. Epilogue: Judah became the largest of the Israelite tribes and eventually become the identity for the entire holy nation -- all Israelites today are known as Yehudim, \\"Jews,\\" (Yehudah being the Hebrew equivalent of Judah). It became halacha (Jewish law) that all Jews are responsible for one another. And Joseph was given an extra portion of inheritance by Jacob mainly for his (Joseph's) ability to avoid the desire for revenge, something that consumed the main characters in \\"Frankenstein.\\" Israel must eventually forgive its/our brothers, the nations of the world, for the final redemption to occur.It's a pity Dr. Frankenstein didn't know the personal prayer of Rabbi Yehudah HaNassi (Judah \\"The Prince\\"), someone who knew a good bit about taking responsibility. Rabbi Yehudah, thanks to the good grace and cooperation of Edomite/Roman cousin Emperor Antoninus, was able to compile the Mishnah, ensuring Judaism's oral law would not be forgotten.Rabbeinu HaKadosh's daily prayer is found in the Babylonian Talmud (Berachos 16B) --\\"May it be Your Will, Hashem, my G-d, and the G-d of my forefathers, that You rescue me today and every day from brazen men and from brazenness, from an evil man, an evil companion, an evil neighbor, an evil mishap, the destructive spiritual impediment...\\"A few words from our author's husband in the heart of Victor Frankenstein may have saved the doctor and his creation from fates worse than death --\\"The winds of Heaven mix foreverWith a sweet emotionNothing in the world is singleAll things by a law divineIn one spirit meet and mingle.Why not I with thine?\\"(P.B. Shelley, \\"Love's Philosophy\\")"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In the book Frankenstein, the author, Mary Shelley tells a story about a monster that the protagonist, Victor Frankenstein, creates. Well at the beginning of the book, it leads off with the narrator, Robert Walton, writing letters to his sister Margaret Saville. They are summarizing what Walton did, when he met Victor Frankenstein and how he nursed him back to health. After Victor is becomes healthy, Victor starts telling Walton his story. Victor starts by telling Walton about his early life, where he was born and where he lived, just a little back round information. After this is when you start to learn about Elizabeth, Victor's lifelong companion. Later in the years he starts to make a new friend named Henry Clerval, their friendship blooms. At the age of seventeen Victor goes to a University in Ingolstadt. Before he leaves his mother catches scarlet fever form Elizabeth, who she is nursing back to health. While at the university he creates a monster, which has no name. The monster terrorizes Victor and he becomes ill. Henry nurses him, when he is healthy again he receives a letter from his father saying that his brother William has been murdered. Justin Mortz is convicted of the murder she didn't commit and is executed. But come to find out the monster killed William. Later you find out that Victor meets the monster and finds out that he can talk and he shows emotions. The monster tells Victor of his past and how he learned how to speak. But when Felix scares him away he promises to himself that he will reject all humans. He comes across William and William mentions the name Alphonse and is strangled by the monster to death. After the monster finishes his story he tells Victor that he wants a female companion, after an agreement Victor agrees to make a female monster. When Victor, his father, and Henry go on a two-year tour, Victor finds himself making the female monster. But when he has second thoughts that they will make a \\"Devil race\\" he destroys the monster. When the monster finds out that Victor destroyed the companion the monster kills Henry. Victor is found innocent of Hery's murder and goes back to Geneva.I found that the book was well written and that Mary Shelley, describes the characters with greatest descriptions. I believe that when the monster was telling his story that she put a lot of effort into letting people know what happened to him. That made me want to read the book more.I would suggest that all ages should read this book because it is great entertainment when you have nothing to do.

I mean sure the concept of the book is cool but only two out of so may parts were the only interesting part. Wait, I take that back, three. The part in the letter where Walden first saw the monster, the part when Frankenstein was making the monster, and the part when the monster was killing people. The rest was just unwanted details. That book literally put me to sleep and it's about a monster! Frankenstein's suppose to be an exciting Halloween story gives little kids nightmares! Instead it's a bed time story for a caffeine addict.I thought it would be cool to finally know how the monster really came to life, but I didn't even get that much out of the book. It doesn't say how it was created, or even what happened to him after he left.If you've ever read the book you know that long 50 page story of when the monster was stocking those people in the cottage. Instead of that how about this. After scaring a man out of his home, the monster finds a hole in the wall, looks through it and sees people. He watches them 24 7 while he learns more words, gets more food, and evidently, learns how to read. After so long he decides to meet and actually talk to them, but does it the wrong way so they beat him up and throw him out. Then he runs away ashamed of himself.

He created Frankenstein. He is a really friendly guy but at the same time he has a passion to get back at the monster he created for killing all of his friends and family. He has a thing about doing what he thinks is best too.The Monster is someone who doesn't understand the meaning of life. He goes around trying to find out his purpose, and he is treated badly by every human he meets. So he goes bad and starts getting back at Frankenstein for making him and not making him a wife.The story takes place in Europe, around the 17th century. It mainly takes place in Geneva.It is a mystery kind of story.He used a lot or describing words, he described everything really good. He used a wide viraty of words. He is a good author, and he kept the ending good. I liked it.The problem is that the monster starts killing people and Frankenstein has to stop him. The monster is going out of control just to get revenge at his creator.I think that people who like adventurous books would, but they have to be able to read a lot, and be able to read through some boring parts because there were a few.I liked the book and would rate it a 7 out of ten. But the author used a few words a lot. But the story plot was good, and was pretty easy to follow as long as you were reading it and not just looking at it. It grabbed my attention, but at the same time some parts were just boring. And if you were to read it you would have to be able to know what some of the words mean, there were a few weird words too.

She addressed the main issue of work force and salary in this highly praised dissertation about successful businesses and creating employees.The work ethics Shelley defined are still in vogue. She established the law that career comes before impact analysis, scientific experimentation, and love. Most technicians still follow the advice published in 1818 by working day and night to put together the right solution for their clients regardless of the work environment.Shelley points out that product based solutions fail while standards and protocols create the framework for a universal solution. Scientists embraced the philosophy to create simply because they could. Penicillin and the atomic bomb were born from the advancement of science. With the creation of stem cells, we see that Shelley's work has been implemented and that Doctor Frankenstein does indeed live.However, Shelley does not just address the issue of increasing the work force, but how to manage relationships as the jobs get more stressful. Donn Gash, editor of Deviant Minds, in his excellent analysis of the true impact Shelley sees regarding the ultimate options for love states: &quot;... what red-blooded heterosexual man would ignore his beautiful fianc&eacute;e in favor of creating another man?&quot;There you have it.

I don't believe I'm giving anything away by naming instances: 1) Dr. Frankenstein creates a \\"being,\\" 2) His creation meets up with a blind man.Even though I had to read many sentences - some 7 lines long - two or three times in order to glean their meaning, I cannot recommend this book enough. If you're looking for mayhem and gore, you'll be disappointed. If you enjoy plots regarding mans' faults, failures and struggles with choices and consequences - you won't be. That a book approaching two centuries old is still relevant is recommendation enough.I only wish someone would make a movie based on the real story, as it is so beautifully and meaningfully written.

It turns out I was completely wrong; this story was very surprising to me!Victor Frankenstein, a scientist, always wanted to make a mark on the world. When he was given the opportunity to do some research and experiments on his own, he applied some information he'd read in some books and reanimated a corpse. Or, possibly, a collection of corpses sewn together. Frankenstein is never completely forthcoming on how his monster came to be.Once the reanimation is successful, though, Frankenstein finds himself confronted with a huge, ugly, fully alive monster. While Frankenstein has a nervous breakdown and is ill for months, the monster is set loose on the world.By the time Frankenstein recovers and tracks down his monster, the monster has developed a startling self-awareness. He hates himself and his creator, and demands that Frankenstein somehow make things right. Frankenstein isn't sure that he can or should give into the monster's demands, though.This book was much less a scary horror story, and more a story of psychology. We are invited to think about the reasons why Frankenstein would feel compelled to create this monster in the first place, and then to think about what should be done with a creature who is self-aware and so unhappy about his place in the world.

It is a wonderful read. The monster is articulate, he doesn't grunt, he carries on conversations with his creator, he is menacing, misunderstood, disfigured, but he is self taught and speaks better than a lot of educated people. Amazing. Shelley's description of the surroundings, and the long travels the monster makes, in pursuit of his prey, puts the reader there. It is as if the reader is silently a part of the narration and eavesdropping on the innermost secrets of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster. Shelley eases her storytelling from incredible events to heart wrenching emotions, to intellectual processing of the information, to a battle of evil versus good intention gone hopelessly awry. In the end, it is up the reader to sort through the mad rants of Dr. Frankenstein, and to decide just where sympathy lies, with the doctor, or his monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"What makes Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein most amazing isn't the intensity of the narrative, the breadth of the science (for the early 18th century) or the fullness of her characters, for this book has all of those elements. However, Shelley's understanding that the creation of a \\"spiritual\\" (read: with a soul) being without thought to its emotional or spiritual needs is possibly one of the most inhumane acts a human can make. In the case of this story, it is Dr. Frankenstein (surely not the crazy mad scientist portrayed in the movies) whose sole passion of creating life engulfs him in a mission that turns first to horror and eventually dread and utter despair.But this book really is not about Dr. Frankenstein, but the monster he creates. A monster created with a blank slate. One that could have easily been motivated by virtue rather than evil had his creator (or any other number of people) not ignored his basic spiritual needs of love and kindness. Once this monster understands that love cannot be given to him by humans, he makes one last plea to his creator to make another creature like him, so that he will have someone to love.Frankenstien's decision on whether to create a second monster and eventual unwillingness to consent to the request is the second point of concern for the novel. Could Dr. Frankenstein have averted the disaster that was to come? Would he have prevented personal disaster at the expense of a curse on humanity? These questions the reader is left to ponder, making this one of the greatest novels ever written.The book would not be considered \\"horror\\" in the 21st century with our special effects abilities to create gore and disgust. It would be put more into the category of psychological thriller ala the movie \\"Seven\\" where the details of the actual acts are left to your imagination and the reasons behind the acts are explored more in depth."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was lucky enough to be assigned this book in my Modern Europe class. It's a quick read, moving along at a nice pace, but not jam-packed with too much action. Instead, this horror novel is one that reaches the reader on a deeper level. Victor takes an emotional journey, from the happiness and security of his childhood, to his fevered and single-minded pursuit of the creation of life, to the horror and despair at the realization of what his dream will cost him. He is the consummate Romantic hero: tragic, boldly and blindly following his own ambition, and agonizing over the loss of his own soul.There was really only one thing that bothered me about this book. One is the fact that every time something tragic happens to Victor, he falls into a debilitating fever. I know that this sort of illness was a favorite of the Romantics, but after a while, it seemed formulaic. Other than that, the book is nearly perfect: tragic hero, sympathetic yet terrifying villain, beautiful and innocent heroine, and a landscape that is just as important to the story as Victor and his monster are. I would recommend this book to any fan of contemporary horror fiction, and also to any fan of Romantic fiction or poetry. Also, if you're going to watch one of the many film adaptations of this book, I suggest watching Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Robert De Niro plays the monster, and you can't get any better than that.

Just a young college student seized with a fever to see what he is capable of creating. What he creates is a monster so terrible to look upon, that he is disgusted and horrified and flees from it. The creature is not yet a monster and only wants to be loved and cared for by its creator. But as it is attacked and maligned purely on the basis of its horrific appearance, it becomes a monster and strikes out to destroy everything its creator loves.

I'm a big classic horror movie fan, but after reading this and Dracula, I'm a bit appalled at how far they strayed from the original."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you haven't seen gimmicky Frankenstein paraphanelia strewn about every grocery store in sight then you've been living under a rock. Nearly everyone living in the western world is familiar with this story, at least in a Halloween movie, lame costume sort of way. Yet behind the commercial gimmicks is a genuinely human and insightful story. Ever since I've read the book(and I've read it several times) Frankenstein has kept its spot one of my favorite books of all time.In case you've been living under a rock: a gifted Swiss doctor named Victor Frankenstein creates a creature from corpses, hoping to prove that he can give life to dead matter. He succeeds in giving it the spark of life but is horrified when the thing(which is never named), awakes and reaches out for him like a child reaching out for its father. Frankenstein abandons the creature and flees, leaving the creature to its own devices. The resulting storyline follows the creature's desire for revenge on his creator, and Frankenstein's attempts to atone for what he's done. The creature, ridiculed for its horrific appearance, exacts revenge by slowly murdering those that Frankenstein holds dear.I started Frankenstein expecting a difficult read and was surprised by the ease of the passages. For a book written almost two hundred years ago this book is surprisingly easy to understand for the modern reader. Like Dumas's writing, the focus is on the admittedly awesome story, not the intricacies of the writing itself(though these are definitely there, they flow into your mind at an almost subconscious level).The sheer breadth of the issues it brings up merit reading it. Issues surrounding human hubris, the role of man as creator, and the appropriateness of man using science to play as God. That's only a short list. But thought-provoking themes aside, this is a good book. The strength of Shelley's prose lies in her characterization of the monster; though you see the havoc it wreaks, you cannot help but feel a sort of aching pity for the thing. She presents the struggle between Frankenstein and his creation as a genuine moral dilemma, handling each side with genuine sympathy. If you get this book, I hope you'll like it as much as I have."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Every time Frankenstein is mentioned, I'd always picture the huge green guy in the movies. When my brother-in-law introduced and encouraged me to read the book, I thought that it wasn't going to be worth the time after I saw the poorly done movies. My brother-in-law said it was one of the best books he's ever read. I told him that I'll try to find the time to read it. It has been six years and I've never touched the book. One day when I was assigned to read a pleasure book for my English class, I randomly chose whichever book that was lying around my apartment. The book was Frankenstein and I'll say that I'm glad I picked it up.The first thing that caused me to be sucked into Mary Shelley's novel is the style of writing. Frankenstein's narrative is in first person point of view. In the first part of Frankenstein, Walton, the ship captain who rescued Frankenstein, was the speaker. The narrator shifted to Frankenstein who told for the rest of the story. In other words, it was like telling a story in the story which Shelley did a great job at. In addition, I was amazed by the author's choice of words. Her vocabulary is fairly high which caused me to search in my dictionary every now and then.The greatest part about Frankenstein is the depth and analysis of the monster which Frankenstein created. Victor Frankenstein discovered the science to infuse life onto the unanimated and thus created the monster. The monster is powerful in strength and huge in size but his mind is that of a newborn. Abandoned by his own creator, the monster learned about his surroundings by himself. He learned the seasons and how to create fire. All this was done by observation. Also by observation, he noticed love and companionship are essential for life. But it was men who taught him to revenge and evil.Frankenstein an awesome book and I recommend it to anyone. There are a lot of themes that are covered in this book. After finishing the book, it gave me a deeper outlook on life. That is, don't judge a book by its cover."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is a very well presented view of how society did, and still does, view the unusual and different. Mary Shelley did an excellent job portraying the monster, and an even better job showing his human emotions and compassion. At first, you are led to believe that the creature is an abomination in the name of human kind, but quickly realize that he did not ask to be created, and that he is nothing more than what his creator's hands molded. This is also a look into the subject of human beings \\"playing god\\", and offers many viewpoints that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, it can be incorporated with modern subjects, where everything is not \\"black and white\\", but where there is a \\"gray\\" uncertain area (cloning, etc.). A must read for anyone who enjoys drama, especially those readers with ethical questions in a modern chaotic world."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The book is good and I recommend people to read it. Make sure you read the introduction and preface; and also the Letters before you get to chapter one because if you don't you will get a bit confused in the story. The story was well written, but one thing is that it never mentions how he created the monster so it was a bit confusing. It is much different than what I thought Frankenstein was, or how they show him in TV shows or commercials. Other than that the story was good and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"THis isn't the old Frankenstein story you think it is. THis is simply an amazing story written by a very young woman. I was blown away as to the emotional strings this book pulls. An absolute must-read!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you like horror, then this book is one you should strongly consider reading. Forget about your \\"ideas\\" of Frankenstein from the movies, and instead focus on the life of a man who plays god. Dr. Victor Frankenstein who creates a living human being all by himself. But, who would of thought that when the creature would awake, Victor's creation would turn out to be a horrible monster that even Victor himself rejects.The story opens in the frozen Arctic wastes during a sea-going expedition to find a passage through the ice to the East. Aboard the ship after a strange meeting, Frankenstein tells his story. As a young man he wanted to find ways to create bigger and better things in the sciences, and indeed figured out a way to create life. Having done so, he became alienated from the world, which left significant consequences for both Frankenstein and his creation. The two interact closely throughout the book, sometimes almost like twin brothers (in one sense as if the monster was a form of Victor) and like Creator and creation in another.While the monster's appearance frightens many he is still merely just human, and desires like all other humans for anyone's understanding, and loving to fulfill his need to be accepted. The theme of friendship and ambitions can be seen, and the conflict of each of these difference shows through each of Victor and his creations appearances with each other.This novel is memorable due to its depth, mood, descriptions of Victor's creation, and mostly of the dark, cold truth telling of the real monsters within others, and not just necessarily in Dr. Frankenstein's creature.This book may present some significant challenges to its reader's. The novel seems to take a long time to develop each of it's specific points, so patience is required to go through layer after layer in hopes of being able to see the underlying picture of the story told.Why, give the book three stars instead of five? The awkwardness of the story was an annoying setback, but well worth the read. While many may not fail to be drawn back by this, it was something that made it harder to push through. While the style of the book moves and develops extremely slowly, just when you feel nothing could happen, it does! That is what makes the book go on, and the reader becomes satisfied.After you have had a chance to absorb and appreciate the consequences of this book you find you are then asking yourself how you yourself relate with others. Then you start to examine future potential consequences you might make. This book can help you in a way to think about your actions before you take them, and make your decisions more worthwhile."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"\\"Frankenstein&quot; is Mary Shelley's first novel written in 1818 It is turned to everyone: young people, who are still in the search for their own identity, adults who will be called to reconsider some well-forgotten moments of their life, and all pleasure seeking readers. This novel is influenced by Mary Shelley's personal misfortune. The aspiration for writing the story appeared in a peculiar way, and so strange is the content. It is not an everyday chance to find and read such a novel. It follows the characteristic features of the novels of the nineteenth century--it is as if not directly retold by the author. Mary Shelley is hidden somewhere behind the story of the characters. And this makes the novel not only sound real, but also even-handed, and thus credibility is established. \\"Frankenstein\\" is in the form of letters, and the story sounds as though it is directed and created for the reader. The Epistolary technique brings the reader into the action. A letter is something extremely personal and dear, and by making the reader part of it, the whole experience is more than just reading a book. The fact that the book is still widely read and studied is because Mary Shelley addresses issues that are timeless. This is one of the basic merits of the novel. The monster is the embodiment of men's defiance and disrespect of Nature. So we are confronted with questions about the importance of human life, the responsibilities one should bear for what she does, the availability of happiness in one's life, and the prejudices of society towards the one who is different. But what is most valuable in the book is not posing questions, but rather lighting the way to find the answers. After reading this book, one is called to rethink her values and her place in the modern society. Mary Shelley's book imposes a philosophical issue of whom we really are -creatures learned to conform to society, living by its norms, with its consciousness. We subconsciously hide our feelings from the rest of the society. Thus we may lose them and become rational creatures, losing touch with our identity and individuality. Reading such books brings not only pleasure, but also acumen into our own psyche. So by opening the first pages of Mary Shelley' s masterpiece--Frankenstein, you are on the verge of savoring the authenticity and originality of this literary creation."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The first and final thirds of the book read as a fabulously tortured gothic tale full of unbridled ambition and tragic love. But it is the middle third of the book that transcends the genre, and exposes the reader to a beautifully touching demonstration of humanity.Frankenstein can be read as an allegory of the creation of man by God. Creation is delineated in this book and in Genesis, by exclusion or expulsion from community with the creator. The exsistance of both man and monster require rejection by their creator to become fully human.The middle section traces the monster's journey to personhood, and the development of his resentment. The monster learns by watching a rather ideal family through a crack in the wall, which presciently evokes our nostalgia for the life of idealized 50's families on television. Longing for a &quot;normal&quot; existence the monster poetically articulates his desire and his pain.Victor Frankenstein, as the creator, shows himself unworthy of his creation, of whom he is both terrified and repulsed. Having sacrificed to his ego all he holds dear Frankenstein flees to the far corners of the earth. The monster, obsessed with confronting his creator, follows him for a final icy showdown."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This was an excellent read with a twisting and turning plot. That made you afradi of the dark at night and found yourself looking behind your back during the day. But Mary Shelley tended to drone and she tended to turn an excellent plot into a boring one.

Overall this was a good book that would have been better with a more experienced author and less complicated writing."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. The only thing I didn't like is how she made the book third person (its really told by the sailor Robert Walton, and not Victor Frankenstein, which people seem to misunderstand.) Besides that, the book is very well paced, and I found it very easy to understand. For you readers out there who said they had diffuculty in understanding the book you should pick up Cliff Notes or go to sparknotes.com to help you aid your understanding of this book, instead of declaring its &quot;garbage&quot; because you have failed to understand this brilliant womans messsage. Anyways the book is about how the monster represents a modern Adam and how mankind in general faces the dilemma of how to cope with our existence. This book left me heart-broken and in tears at the end.

To summarize the book briefly would do it injustice; the entire book from begining to end offers so much to be learned."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"A great story about Frankenstein!I found it very interesting and easy to understand.

Then after Victor created this monster, he finally realized that it was a very bad mistake. &quot;That is what got me hooked&quot; Frankenstein was not known or understood by the villagers and the mean things they did to him was only because of the way he looked. This books makes you think about several things; one being don't creat something without putting a lot of thought into it, becuase it could seriously back fire on you and the pain you can bring to others as well as your self. And last don't judge someone by the way they look, because even Frankenstein had a heart that felt pain, anger, humility and sadness. Thank you.

If you can get past the idea that this book is about alienation from God (the product of sick minds that are into the perverted psychobabble) this is a good story that could be viewed as a warning against technology, and also as a warning against people rejecting others on the basis of appearance. I personally liked the way it was written; it was a bit wordy, but I like big vocabularies. It is fairly short and generates a moderate atmosphere of suspense, but don't expect edge-of-your-seat excitement and vivid accounts of mayhem and death.

This is a book that will affect your outlook on life and how you treat other people. It shows examples of many emotions such as curiousity, love, kindness, and revenge.

The true feelings of all of the characters can be felt throughout. Most everyone thinks of the monster as being just that, a terrible, hideous monster.

Just to explain what the product isn't: it isn't a book on tape. What it is: is a dramatization of the story with many different voice acters, sound effects and original music. The story is brought to life through the characters and the action. What you don't get is some English guy reading to you out of the book.Remember, this is an adaption, which means the story is presented in a media other than the original novel. Some changes, of course, had to be made. With Frankenstein, there were a couple unique problems. One is, the book does not tell the reader how the monster was created, which I believe is important in a dramatization. You will find in my adaption the science behind the miracle of re-animation. Secondly, Victor Frankenstein created the monster much in seclusion without other characters around with whom to communicate. The novel uses long passages and chapters of exposition to deliver this information to the reader. In my adaption, I've had to expand a minor character, Professor Waldman, to provide dramatization, suspense and rising conflict. Likewise, in the novel, the monster learns language by hiding in a wood shed adjoined to a house where he observes its occupants for many weeks. This information is skirted over very quickly in my adaption because the emphasis is--as it should be--on the relationship between Victor Frankenstein and his monster.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story, but has patience. I mean you must get through the beginning of the book to get to the interesting parts. Trust me it's worth it. Doctor Frankenstein actually created an artificial life form in a laboratory. We someday might be able to do this. The question this book made me think of is what would happen?

Recently, I realized that I am a bit ashamed that I have yet to read this book for myself since along with Dracula it is considered such a classic horror story. I was so surprised as I started reading this book to find that all of the things I had thought about the story were actually wrong. This book is not so much about horror as it is about the basic human emotion for love and acceptance that we continually search for, and while the movies touch on this theme a bit the book is mostly about this thought. In a sense it is not so much horrifying as it is sad and disturbing, but the brilliance of the story is that it really makes you step back and look at yourself and what it means to be human.A Swiss medical student, Victor Frankenstein, discovers the secret of life and decides to build a man from various corpuses. He becomes horrified by what he creates and runs away from what he considers a monster. The creature suffers from a fair amount of confusion and neglect and begins to see himself as a terrifying monster. He is incredible smart and is able to teach himself language and means of communication through watching a poor family. He discovers the truth about his identity and begins to seek revenge on his creator. Through a series of tragic events Victor Frankenstein chases his creation around the world meaning to rid humanity from it.It is easy to see why this book has stood the test of time.

Shelley, way ahead of her time, writes a story very different from those seen in modern horror movies. She uses the technique of reeling her readers in and then playing with them. In Frankenstein, the character Victor is a curious person; he yearns to learn the secrets of the earth. Attempting to fulfill his desire he comes up with the insane notion to recreate life after it has been destroyed. Of course, afterwards he sincerely regrets it since the monster he creates wreaks havoc. Shelley shows the horror of the aftermath of playing creator and sends a chill down the spine. Shelley forces readers to rethink their own lives and desires. I read Frankenstein not as a piece of fiction, but as a piece of Biological Literature.There is a very short amount of time in the book that talks about Biology, but when it is discussed, it is almost as if Victor is able to use his brief education in human life to bring a creature to life using electricity and parts that are pieced together. Conveniently enough, Victor never reveals his secret to life, in case someone were to repeat what he did and create another monster like his. This, we know, is completely impossible, and since Shelley herself had no education in biology, we know that she was using a literary device known widely as \\"black box science\\", in which something works because the author tells the reader that it does--a truth universally acknowledged.There are several scientists in recent years who are attempting to follow in Victor's footsteps and are trying to grow blood cells and skin tissues from corpses, in an attempt to prolong life or even cheat death. Their success rate will be questionable, of course, but their reasoning is seemingly much more noble than that of Victor Frankenstein.It was an excellently written book in terms of fictional appeal, but in the way of biology, it is quite lacking.

Its characters - the monster created through galvanism out of dead bodies parts and its creator, the \\"mad\\" scientist Frankenstein - have reappeared endlessly in other novels, films, cartoons, animated features, Halloween costumes, action figures, video games and everyday language.Many of its essential thematic ideas have become key issues in fiction and media, such as: the scientist's moral resposibility regarding his/her creation, the dangers involved in replacing God in his life-creating function, the important need to be accepted by a social group, the acceptance or rejection of \\"different\\" beings perceived as \\"others\\". Frankenstein will always be read with enjoyment for its being such superior entertainment and reverence for its being such an accomplished classic."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Why I have never read this book before I do not know. The fact that it was written by Shelley when she was only eighteen or so makes it an even more remarkable story. Very easy to read and access the language. The misery of Frankenstein and his monster is described so eloquently, sympathy is evoked by the reader. As I say above, I wish I had read this book a.long time ago."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Don't know how I missed reading this book all these years. Good story but I didn't think the monster's description was as scary as I thought it would be. Maybe I'm synthesized to present day vampires, zombies, and monsters, in today's media."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The Frankenstein I knew of from when I was a child was about a mad scientist who created a monster who wreaked havoc on the townspeople. With their pitchforks they hunted down the monster and his creator and seek to destroy them. I never read this version of the book let alone knew if there was any other version to this novel, sadly to say. When I was recommended to read this book I thought I would know exactly how it will be but I was surprised to see it the way it was. Frankenstein thinking before I read the novel how boring it will be was actually very interesting and kept me intune. I didn't want to put it down and I wanted it never to end. Victor Frankenstein was my favorite character in the beginning of the novel. He is very intelligent and has a love for science that I can not imagine. When he created the monster I thought he wouldn't be afraid of his own creation but actually be proud of what he created. Maybe even show it to the world, but he disowned his creation and for that he went to my least favorite. As the story went on I started to see how the creation by Frankenstein was never born a monster but made into a monster by the events that he had gone through. I feel for the monster, being brought into this world when he didn't want to, having to endure the troubles of the new world by himself. He was misunderstood, like a newborn child without parents having to deal with life by himself. Still he persevered keeping his self alive. As I read I see who is the real monster, I recommend this book for those who know Frankenstein as a mad scientist who created a monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I knew only that the old Boris Karloff movie was not the same as this original story. The Mary Shelley is far more fascinating and complex. The characterization of Frankenstein and his creation is much more interestingly portrayed and the story more complex. I recommend this enlightening portrait of the original story. It even has a different ending than the movie that starred Kenneth Brannaugh, Mary Frankenstein's Frankenstein. Read the original."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"When it comes to classic horror stories, this one tops them all. Even the most superficial reader could enjoy the thrill that swarms throughout this book, but it also contains many interesting ideas about what it means to be a monster, the pain and responsibility that comes with knowledge, and the emotional effects being an outcast can have on one. It makes you contemplate the power of love. I enjoyed this from start to finish."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"It often occurs that the movie version of a classic novel differs greatly from the book, but in this case the difference was astounding. The original B&W movie bears almost no resemblance at all to the book. The \\"monster\\" is actually benevolent and good-natured, and becomes violent only after being mistreated. The novel focuses much more on Dr. Frankenstein's personal struggles with his own actions. Worth reading just to set the record straight.

Not only am I amazed at Mary Shelly's imagination but those who took her novel and turned it into a play then movie. A true horror classic!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book was pretty good but for some reason it did not do much for me. When I would tell my friends and family the plot they would all say wow that book sounds great or sounds like a really exciting book. But in reality to me it wasn't. I think that it might have been because there was too much unnecessary writing in between the interesting parts. Other than that it was a great plot and I might be too harsh on the classic book since I do love classics!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I recently read Frankenstein and enjoyed it. She anticipated some of the themes in 20th century science fiction novels -- the danger of technology released from any ethical concerns and the unintended consequences of scientific experiments."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Like Dracula, this book did not tell the story I thought I already knew.Frankenstein is another one of those stories to have entered the Western consciousness so deeply that we're all convinced we know it. We see it in cartoons, in comedies, in serious movies, stories, and TV shows. We see the green-skinned monster with his arms out, shuffling along and moaning, the little girl with a flower, and the brave (if wrongheaded) townspeople bristling with torches and pitchforks. What we don't see is Shelly's monster, and whether I mean Frankenstein's creation, Frankenstein himself, or all of humanity is something you have to decide by reading the book.I was sympathetic to the narrator from time to time. Other times I caught myself saying internally \\"if you would have just reacted with kindness from the beginning...\\" In other words, I really debated who the monster was - he whose creation violated the laws of nature, or he who hated his creation.From what I understand, the former is the traditional reading of the book. Since Frankenstein played God, he was punished by his creation. He violated natural moral laws and he (and those around him) suffered the consequences. The references (both implicit and explicit) to physiognomy seem to point to this - the monster was simply a monster at heart, despite any hope we might hold out for him.I'm not sure I'm convinced that it wasn't just a literary tool in her hands. If so, she wielded it to great effect - I can easily imagine that my internal dialogue, my occasional sympathy for the monster's situation, was anticipated long ago. In my reading, there is no intrinsic evil in the monster's existence, even if Frankenstein himself sinned in bringing him into being.Instead, Frankenstein's primary sin was in casting out his creation based on physical appearance and on his place as a creature of a creature. Frankenstein's sin was a lack of love for the one he owed a duty of love to. Is this a purely modern reading, or is this what Shelley intended? I don't know, but I like to think she intended me to see it this way.Either way, the Frankenstein I thought I knew never forced me to ask the question. I'm glad I read this book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is Mary Shelley's frankenstein. What else can you say. It's a story that has launched several movies as well as giving the world a theme for many more tales and stories. I donated this to my local library."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"A very popular word, Frankenstein has become an important part of Western pop culture. I found the book to be very different from my preconceived ideas about Frankenstein. The general thinking about Frankenstein is one of horror but this is not the focus of Shelley's novel. This novel is about much more than just horror, and in fact, the horror aspect of the book was weak. Some themes of the book include the relation of creature to creator, the darkness of human creativity, the selfishness of mankind, and the futility of human existence. Overall, the book is very dark. This edition of the book has a great introduction that explains the background of Mary Shelley's life which gives good insight into the book itself. It seems as if the book reflects some of the author's own feelings and experiences. Being such an important part of literature and culture, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"It seems to me that Mary Shelley's famous novel gets more relevant and more important as time goes on. As the original tale about how mankind's creations can get dangerously out of hand, \\"Frankenstein\\" is known the world over, though interestingly (as is often the case with famous novels) the basic concept has been reshaped and re-imagined so many times that the source material becomes somewhat ignored. Like J. M. Barrie's \\"Peter Pan\\" (which isn't actually a children's story) and Charles Dickens's \\"Oliver Twist\\" (which isn't really about Oliver Twist), thousands of people proclaim that they know the story well of Frankenstein well - and yet on reading the actual text they discover that it is radically different from their preconceptions of it.Thus one of the most interesting things about reading Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is in realising just how many misconceptions surround the original story. For example, few realise that the name Frankenstein is not the name of the monster at all (who remains nameless throughout); but rather the doctor who created him. Likewise, the monster is not brought to life in the midst of a lightening storm, at no point is the doctor assisted by a deformed hunchback and never does he cry the words: \\"It's alive! It's alive!\\" More remarkably, our notion of Frankenstein's monster as a hulking, lumbering monster of a man is completely at odds with Shelley's description of him as a quick and agile wraith of a figure. Thanks Hollywood.It is an ideal illustration of how the surrounding mythology of a concept can warp the true content of a classic story. If you have seen any of the famous movies (whether the old black-and-white films or modern retellings such as the latest Kenneth Branagh version or [groan] Stephen Sommers' \\"Van Helsing\\") or laughed at one of the thousands of \\"Frankenstein\\" references that permeate our culture, or read similar stories that are based on the \\"Frankenstein\\" conceit of man's creation escaping his control, then do yourself a favour, make yourself a little smarter, and read the real McCoy: Mary Shelley's original story.During a holiday in 1816, Mary Shelley and her group of friends were each challenged to write a ghost-story (by none other than Lord Byron himself). Drawing inspiration from a nightmare and encouraged by her husband who saw potential in the unfolding tale, Shelley began to work diligently on what would become literary history. \\"Frankenstein\\" is a surprisingly slim novel that begins with letters from young explorer Robert Walton to his sister, describing his voyage into the Artic and the unexpected rescue of a near-dead man out of the icy sea. Walton recounts the circumstances surrounding the man's condition and rescue, and proceeds to record the strange tale that Doctor Victor Frankenstein tells him. Doctor Frankenstein once had it all; an illustrious career, a loving family and a wealthy home - all of which he threw away in the pursuit of knowledge and power.After discovering the secret of how to bring to life inanimate matter, Frankenstein is horrified by his own success when a living being emerges from his laboratory. Shunning the poor creature, it bounds away into the wilderness where the continual loathing and hatred that the human race expresses toward it turns its innocence into madness. After Frankenstein denies it a female partner with which to life out its life, the monster turns to cruel revenge and systematically begins to destroy all that Frankenstein loves. Now the two of them, creator and creation, have fled to the Artic wastelands to finally put an end to one another's misery.The book fits the genre of \\"Gothic\\" like a glove, with all the trademarks and pitfalls of what one expects from such novels. \\"Frankenstein\\" is not without its flaws, with character motivation and sensibility being skewered in order to serve the plot. For example, Frankenstein's refusal to act against his creation (especially when innocent lives are at stake) is frustrating to the point of being despicable, and the monster's acquiring of language and general knowledge simply through watching a family is a stretch of credibility to say the least - yet both these things must occur if the story is to be pushed in the direction Shelley wants it. She will often gloss over elements that are not important to the development of the plot, and as such I could not help but smile when Shelley avoids the question of how precisely Frankenstein managed to create life by having him proclaim that the information is too dangerous for him to share.But such moments are easy to accept considering the time period, the genre and the dense atmospheric horror that Shelley embodies in her work. \\"Frankenstein\\" is an immensely rewarding read that is necessary for anyone who claims to known and like the Frankenstein mythos. And in these days of cloning, stem-cell research and genetic manipulation, Shelley's cautionary tale about the dangers of playing God and meddling with life is more crucial than ever."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is definetly a lot deeper than I imagined it to be. Of course I wasn't frightened by it at all, not that I expected to be, considering today's \\"scary\\" standards, but it made me feel like the monster. Frankenstein's monster, which is an \\"ugly\\" man (to put it lightly) is capable and willing to give unconditional love, something so \\"powerful\\" and \\"beautiful\\", unlike the townspeople, \\"beautiful\\" (not monster-like) who are the \\"ugly\\" ones by attacking the monster with no reason, simply based on his appearance. Even his \\"creator,\\" who would be his master, his idol, rejects him and disregards him and his needs. Who wouldn't become a monster, if your \\"creator\\" turned their back on you?! The idea of this story is so powerful, even if the story wasn't written that great-- some gaps, like how quickly Frankenstein brings the monster to life then quickly rejects it and goes to sleep?! And the writing is a little long in the tooth, but I don't think the vocabulary is particularly difficult. A great and quick read for those interested!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I think that Frankenstein is an instructive book. It was fun reading it, and the story is very well written. You read that the monster is very ugly and therefore everybody is scared of him. I think that you shouldn't have prejudice based on looks. You should get to know someone first, before you judge him or her."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?The Thirteenth Floor"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I love this book, and I love everything Frankenstein, even the cheesy movies. But this book is where it all started, and I think it is one of the most profound examinations of the relationship between God and man I've ever read.The creation, the \\"Monster,\\" represents humankind. The creation is constantly questioning why he was created, especially created with such deformities and faults. Haven't we all felt that way? Anyone who has ever cursed God (\\"Why did you create me this way? Why did you make life so hard?\\") would related to the creation. Eventually, the creation meets his creator, and demands to have what the creator has; here, a wife. But doesn't that represent our wish as people to overcome our hardships and have what our creator has? We humans yearn to be so much more than human!Dr. Frankenstein represents God, but unlike God, has (in the view of his creation) neglected his responsibility to his creation. He created the creation just because he could, then couldn't follow through. The Doctor is, afterall, only a man and not up the challenge of being a creator.In what ways do I feel like the creation, let down by a creator that I think has forgotten me? What do I think God's responsibility is to his creation? Is that realistic? Stuff to meditate on sometimes."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I started reading \\"Frankenstein\\" because I needed a book to read for school. I didn't know much about it except for what's in the various movie versions. It turned out to be a very dark, depressing, sad story about man with many problems, and a misunderstood outcast. When you watch the movie \\"Frankenstein\\", the monster that Frankenstein created was made out to be evil. This is not necessarily true in the book, however. In the book, you hear more of this outcast's story, as well as more of Frankenstein's story. In reading the book, you find out that the creature Victor Frankenstein created wasn't at all what the various movies presented him as. In most of the movies, the creature was presented as this illiterate, bumbling, stupid, ragefull, evil killer, but in truth, he was a kind, gentle, loving, smart creature. You also learn more about Victor's family, past, schooling, etc.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was depressing, yet insightful. It was deep as well as enlightening. I also like how the book was set up. It was made up in letters from a man to his sister. The man was captain of a ship, and he found Frankenstein dying in the ocean. The man took Victor onto his ship, and Victor told the man his story. The book is Victor's story, written down by the man in a letter to his sister. I liked this book because of what I said as well as it giving me a new view on the story, because you see, all I had known of this story before was what was said in the movies. Now that I have read the book, the movies anger me. The movies anger me because they take the book out of context. They turn a wonderful, yet depressing, tale of a man and a creature into a story about a stupid killer of a creature and a crazy doctor.All in all, this is a fantastic book that I recommend to anyone in high school or older. It is depressing, in some ways unrealistic, in some ways very realistic, but it's still worth reading. I gave it four stars. Definitely a very entertaining and interesting book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Though it must surely be impossible to choose the greatest horror story ever written, \\"Frankenstein\\", along with Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\", is certainly near the top of the list.

I need not say more-if you like horror, or are looking for a great female author, you should already have read this."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Shelley's novel is so much more than a story about a monster. The whole mood of her novel is electrifying and startling. The sensation is similar to arriving at the very edge of a mountain precipice, gazing down, and feeling the enormity of life rush over you. This sense of vertigo is one of Shelley's gifts. She has the wild writer's mind and she can deliver the chills. One could argue her shocking sense of life was very similar to the later wildly popular french philosopher Jean Paul Sarte, and the theme of his sudden realization of the horror of existence. Shelley's gothic novel written in the age of romance has elements of both styles. But, it's her wild mind that makes this novel eerie, extraordinary and amazing. (Read intently and thoughtfully for best results.)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley starts off very uninteresting. In the beginning, a man writes letters to his sister in England but the story soon begins to pick up. Don't be discouraged when you read the first page or two. Give it a chance you will learn to love this story.This novel is definitely not the same as the black and white movies you may have seen. Mary Shelley shows a whole new side to the monster in her novel. There are many conflicts and themes in this story. There is love, hate, and the most obvious rage. This is a classic story of a gothic monster gone mad and even though it was written well over 100 years ago it can still scare the pants off of people today.This book touches on the main problem in society, acceptance. There are so many people out there who will change their look, their attitude and their entire lifestyle just to be accepted. This relates to me because I am now in high school and I have observed people who will do anything to be accepted. In my opinion it is ok to want to be accepted but when a person is willing to harm themselves, just to have more friends, that is not ok with me. Mary Shelley shows us the reality of life in this wonderfully touching story."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein by Mary Shelley is a fabulous novel of suspense, horror, and love.

Shelley's story of a man set upon creating a being of his own is undaunting and horrifying, suspenseful and emotional. There is no doubt that this novel has received many praises by countless amounts of people, praises for its incorporation of naturistic and societal themes, the emotions of Victor Frankenstein and his creation, and a storyline that never stops moving. One will not soon forget its words after reading it, which marks this novel as a great literary achievement."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS offers a gripping portrait of the horrible suffering of a man who dares assume a god-like function. By giving animation to lifeless tissue Victor Frankenstein ascends to a peak of biblical and mythological proportions: he becomes a Creator like the God of Genesis, and parallels the Greek Prometheus in giving humankind a gift that has both marvelous and catastrophic consequences.The furor of the Being after Frankenstein abandons it in disgust and horror sharply contrasts with the lovely Alpine village setting. Shelley paints the countryside of Frankenstein's homeland with such warm and green colors that the reader longs to live in such a paradise. A family ardent in their devotion to him further enriches Victor's world. Only doom remains, however, when the Creature knows it cannot enjoy this love and beauty and determines that Frankenstein is to blame.Shelley, herself the creator as author, generates an organic whole by depicting the Being as more than just organic matter: she stresses the juxtaposition of creator and created, engaging them in dialogue together about the responsibilities one has toward the other. This face-off is one of the most memorable in literature. FRANKENSTEIN is a novel of both immense beauty and horrifying ugliness, and, as in life, it's all more than skin deep."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is the simple best book ever written (in my opinion).

Many students found the story of the creature to be truly heartbreaking. In conclusion, they give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is probably the story which has been the most mangled in the transition from book to film. The book is much deeper and more philosophic than the traditional Boris Karlov-type movie. Victor Frankenstein is not a mad scientist and his creature is not a grunting, stiff-limbed automaton. Victor brings his creature to life and then abandons him. All other humans which the creature encounters treat him cruelly (with the exception of a blind man who can not see him.) The creature is initially pure and gentle, and becomes evil only as a response to mankind's rejection and brutality towards him.As in all great stories, the characters here can represent many things. Victor can be read as a symbol of God, a creator who may or may not at times abandon us, or of mankind itself as we acquire ever greater scientific powers, the results of which we may not be able to control. The creature may symbolize Satan, who resented and challenged his creator, or Adam, who fell from grace because of his sin, or man himself, who may become evil in response to his environment.This book is perhaps the best story of good versus evil that I have ever read. Having seen some of the movies made in the horror genre from this story, I can definitely say that &quot;the book was better.&quot;"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Read this book, everyone else has!

Upon reading the book, I failed to see how it has stood the test of time so well, with so many people proclaiming it a masterpiece. On the other hand, it saddens me to see that some people are so narrow minded as to decry the book merely because it does not live up to its reputation as horror novel.However, in the end one must observe Frankenstein as a literary work in general and not a horror novel whose plot and story have been so twisted and mutilated since its publication with countless inaccurate films and a lack of people who have actually read the book. When I look at it in this sense, I'm afraid I must still look upon this work with poor esteem. I stumbled upon a review crying out for people to recognize the depth of this book and not write it off as a horror novel, and I agree with that reviewer; the book does have depth, exploring the human condition in a truely unique way. However, there is no point in praising a literary work based simply upon the depth of the themes. No matter how deep a novel it, in the end you still have to read it, and that is the trouble with Frankenstein. The themes presented in the book can not be assertained because the execution of it is horrendous. Whether you want to view it as a book of horror or not, one can't help but notice how incredibly bland and drawn out this book is. It is difficult to stay awake, let alone be captivated, by a book that is so saturated with hyperbole and displaced emotion. Perhaps if Shelley spent more time developing her characters rather than simply focusing on the exaggerated emotional states of Victor and the Creature, story might actually seem plausible; instead, the character are uniformly formily immaculate and possess the same emotional expressions as Victor. The only two character that show any distinction are Victor and his father.Also, the plot itself is detestably unrealitistic. Of course a common complaint is that the creation of the monster is not described at all in detail, and, although the actual process of creation is not important for the developement of the themes of the book, I would have to agree that it wouldn't hurt the show the reader some plausibilty. Also, it is difficult to grasp the concept that as a human being it takes the average person about a year to learn how to read on a seccond grade level, yet the monster is able to teach himself how to read without the aid of a teacher possessing the knowledge of the fundamental concepts of written language and comprehend works by Ovid and Aristotle in a matter of months, not to mention speak more articulately than I can.In essence, Frankenstein is certainly credible for its depth, but anyone can be a philosopher. Unfortuantely, literature is an art, and, therefore it takes a talented author to create a reabable and enjoyable vehicle for such insight. If you can't read a book, it's not good."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The book (that was purchased) wasn't in the condition stated by the seller.

More like they've got some sort of tumor that needs looking into!Also, how can you write a THIRTY page intro to your book, explaining that it was an attempt to match the spooky campfire ghost stories you heard on vacation... and then create a monster who's demeanor and diction put shakespear to shame!Call me old fashioned by I'll take my Frankenstein monster with a side of Grandpa Munster!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"As I read the novel I thought always of how much better it could have been. Mary Shelley wrote that she originally conceived \\"a few pages -- of a short tale\\" but that Percy urged her to develop the story at greater length (p. 283). Mary should have stuck to her instincts. The book is way too long; it would have been much better as a short story.Moreover, the entire tale of the monster is ludicrous. We never learn anything about how the monster is created, but he certainly is a fast learner! The monster runs away from Victor Frankenstein and hides for several months, living off the land. From where he hides he observes a family's comings and goings. While hidden, he somehow gains the equivalent of a university education, reading Paradise Lost, Plutarch's Lives, and the Sorrows of Werter (p. 151). Then he flies into a murderous rage and demands that Victor create him a mate. When the monster realizes that Victor is stalling in the girlfriend-production department, he turns his rage toward Victor, follows him across many lands, and carves long, threatening messages into trees and rocks (pp. 253-254).The silly monster story might have been easier to take if the novel had left open the possibility that the monster did not exist. For most of the book, such a possibility is open. The entire novel is a series of stories within stories. Robert Walton, the Arctic explorer, writes letters to his sister. The reader's vantage point is that of Robert's sister. Victor tells Robert his story, which Robert passes on to his sister. Victor hears the monster's story and passes it on to Robert, who passes it on to his sister; likewise, with letters Victor receives from his father and sister; and so on. For almost the entire book, all that Robert knows about the monster is what he has heard from Victor. The better ending to the novel would have been for the monster never to appear except in Victor's version of events. In that way Robert, his sister, and consequently the reader would have been left with a choice about whether to believe Victor's kooky monster story or instead to believe that Victor either made it all up or is delusional. Unfortunately, that choice is foreclosed when the monster makes an appearance on board Robert's ship at the end of the book (pp. 270-275)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I'm probably biased, because I hate the romantic period for its namby-pamby emotional fireworks, and I think Frankenstein epitomizes that.

It was an interesting story line but horribly and not understandably written and is one of the worst books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Let me get this straight: I came to this book expecting a lot. Here is a book that has informed the science fiction, fantasy, and horror genres for nearly two centuries; here is a book whose premise is deliciously provocative and brimming with moral and ethical dilemmas; here is a book which, I assumed, given its plot outline, dealt with such thorny questions as how far humankind must go when it comes to wielding the power of science, should a line be drawn at some point, or do we unbridle science and let it shape out society as we move forward into the future. Yes, I expected a lot from this book.Dr. Frankenstein is a young student who works hard for years to discover the ultimate secret: how to breathe life in a body devoid of one. How to animate a corpse. This is surely one of the grandest, most ambitious projects a scientist could ever embark upon. He spends his days and nights obsessed with his work and, finally, cracks the code of life. One stormy night, his creature, made of body parts obtained from various dead bodies and stitched together to form a single, giant one, comes to life.Dr. Frankenstein has achieved that no human being in the history of mankind has even come close to: he has the power to bestow life. He can revive the dead. What is our good doctor's reaction when the creature opens his eyes for the first time ?Before I tell you about his reaction, here is what the doctor has to say about his education and background:\\"In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. I do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit. Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become food for the worm.Now I was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnel-houses. My attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings.\\"So, our intrepid scientist is neither squeamish, nor superstitious. Keeping that in mind, here is his reaction when his creature comes to life (in his own words):\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs. How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart.\\"Ladies and gentleman, after achieving a break-through of stupdendous proportions in medical science, after breathing life into a dead body, our good doctor's first reaction is to describe the event as a \`catastrophe.' Do you notice that instead of talking about his accomplishment, its mechanics, and how it can change the future of mankind forever, he describes at great length the physical features of the creature.For Christ's sake, can somebody explain to me the significance of this ? How is the creature's physical beauty or lack thereof of any import whatsoever ?Wouldn't any scientist be dancing in the streets if he could merely bring back a cockroach to life, let alone a humanoid body ?Here is a scientist who has obsessed over his work for years and we have no explanation why he considers his success, when it finally arrives, a catastrophe. No explanation is ever provided.The doctor further tells us:\\"Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.\\"Sleep ! The doctor went to his bedchamber to sleep ! Am I the only one who sees the ridiculousness of the situation here ? He has animated a dead body and instead of communicating with the creature, studying him, finding out about his brain, his mind, his thoughts, his physical and mental status, our good doctor wants to sleep.Once the doctor retires to his bedroom, the creature runs away. Throughout the book, the doctor refers to this unnamed creature as a fiend, a brute, an animal, the devil, a wretch, and we don't know why. I mean, within months of his creation, the creature is reading Greek historians such as Plutarch and writing critiques of such works as John Milton's \`Paradise Lost' and he is considered an animal. Why ? Why ? Why ? No reason is ever given except that the monster doesn't look like Brad Pitt or George Clooney.Maybe Dr. Frankenstein was in the wrong profession, instead of a scientist, he should have been a cosmetic surgeon ?The creature then goes to Geneva and stumbles across, by pure chance, the younger brother of Dr. Frankenstein. What were the odds of this coincidence ?The population of Geneva circa 1780 was around 20,000 and our creature comes across a child who happens to be his creator's little brother. And on top of that, after he accidentally strangles the child, he roams around, enters a barn, where, again by pure chance, he encounters the child's governess who happens to be sleeping in that very barn. Coincidence upon coincidence. The creature had found a necklace on the child's person, which he places in the governess's pocket in order to mark her as the killer.And here is the best part, in the morning, the governess is caught with the necklace and sentenced to die. I mean, here is someone who raised the child, lived in the same household for years, she had ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted, but she decided to one day strangle the child in a public park, hide his body, keep the necklace in her pocket, and then let herself be caught with it in the morning.People, are you laughing with me already ? Do you see the stupidity of this travesty of literature ? I am glad that Mary Shelley never decided in her life to write a legal thriller.The whole novel is full of such ridiculous co-incidences and logical inconsistencies.Later in the story, the creature confronts Dr. Frankenstein again and asks him to create a wife for him or else he would kill everyone in the doctor's family. The doctor reluctantly agrees, but later decides against it. Why does he decide against it ?Because the creature would have children with this female and the future generations of these monsters might take over the planet. The creature promised to take his wife and go to the jungles of South America where they would never come across humans again. This is a great chance for our doctor to get rid of the creature, he could have created a female creature, missing one or two organs vital to childbirth, and all would end well. His family wouldn't be threatened by the monster anymore, he wouldn't have to worry about the human race being taken over by the progeny of the creatues. But, no, the mind of our good doctor works in really mysterious ways, as we have seen, so far.Throughout the book, the creature expresses his desire to be among humans, he talks like a philosopher and a scholar, he makes it clear that he is not violent, all he wants is some comanionship, but the doctor refuses to hear any of this, and continues to refer to him as a wretch, a beast, and an animal. The only explanation ever given for this treatment is that the creature is not handsome.This was a laughably terrible book. Mary Shelley writes two, three sentences describing the most important event of the story, the birth of the monster, but she dedicates pages after pages describing the Swiss Alps, the weather, Lake Geneva, and other such nonsense which has no bearing whatsoever on the story.She leaves a thousand questions unanswered about the monster, his body, his brain, his mind, his thoughts, and goes on writing about irrelevant stuff which makes it a drag to get through a single page of the novel.The author was supposedly eighteen or nineteen when she wrote this book, and it shows on every page. She describes all the characters in her book as beautiful, handsome, charitable, generous, understanding, and generally being great human beings.Not counting the monster, there is only one wicked character in the book, who happens to be a Muslim Turk. His daughter was born off a Christian mother and wanted to be a Christian. The Turk was imprisoned by French authorities and rescued by a Christian man who fell in love with his daughther, but the Turk betrays his rescuer so that his daughter wouldn't end up marrying him, a Christian. Mary Shelley writes:\\"The young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother, who...instructed her daughter in the tenets of her (Christian) religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of Muhammad.\\"Shelley is not only a terrible author, she is also an ignorant and prejudiced one. Her novel, hailed as a classic for two centuries, is infantile dross and lacks any imagination or creativity. Mary Shelley was the Stephanie Meyer of her generation, and her novel should be shelved with the chic-lit vampire romances and other such fare read avidly by teenage girls."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book was so boring I threw it out my window.

Not a bad book if you want to hear the real side of Frankenstein and his twisted thoughts in the Dr. Jeckle - Mr. Hyde relationship, but also the realization that man is almost entirely greedy and selfish."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I chose the title of my review especially for those who are interested in the background of stories and the way things eventually turned out. We have trilogies and trilogies of trilogies (\\"Star Wars'), prequels and sequels galore.In this work Mary Shelley set out a great deal of exposition about Frankenstein, his family, his friends, his passions and obsessions. Some of the relationships revealed may seem strange to the modern reader -- it is not much of a spoiler, set out early in the novel, to tell you that Victor Frankenstein's long intended bride, Elizabeth, was brought up virtually as his sister; the suggestion of constructive incest even being mentioned in the course of the book.It is a very long time before we see the \\"monster,\\" but once he appears we learn his life from his creation, his feelings, his sorrows, his opinions, his hopes and dreams, all in his own words, which are mostly lost on his creator. In the end, in fact, the monster delivers a touching soliloquy, appropriate to the feeling of tragedy that pervades the story, and we're left to wonder whose tragedy it was, Victor's or his creation's.I found Mary Shelley's Frankenstein startling in the extent to which it differed both from the movies and the popular conceptions of the story. The differences go way beyond what we usually expect from turning a novel into a movie. Tod Browning took a number of liberties with Dracula, but re-reading the original doesn't cause one to feel he is reading a different story.Frankenstein is a morality tale, and the sinner throughout is Frankenstein first and his creation second. It could be called a study of what happens when someone is driven to follow his passion (to create life) and then to reject it as soon as the desire is fulfilled. The creation (I hesitate to say \\"monster,\\" though the creature self-describes himself that way) is brought into a world not knowing who he is, what he is or, importantly, why he is. He wants to be loved, or at least accepted, and is rejected top to bottom, first of all by his creator. He is intelligent and moral, and asks only another of his kind (his \\"bride\\") and he will leave Frankenstein and the human world in peace. Unfortunately Frankenstein has all the complex moral qualms after his creation lives that were completely overlooked beforehand.The creature could almost approach total sympathy if not for his unfortunate habit of murdering completely innocent people because of his anger at Frankenstein.There is a modern spin that can be placed on the story; comparing this or that scientific manipulation of life has long been compared to Frankenstein's work. Perhaps the problem is that the concept of treating life as a commodity, as Frankenstein clearly did, no longer shocks as much as it used to."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I think like almost every American kid, I grew up \\"Frankenstein\\" on the movie screen. And I think I've seen them all: Boris Karloff, the silent version, \\"Young Frankenstein,\\" \\"Bride of Frankenstein,\\" \\"Frankenstein vs The Mummy,\\" etc. I really thought I knew this story - the monster and the creator.Turns out, I didn't know anything. Mary Shelley was very young woman when she wrote this piece, and her immaturity in writing does reflect within the pages. More on that later. This novel is important, as it ushered in a genre never before experienced: science fiction. Although this genre would become more advanced and developed, this novel broke ground, so to speak. What is unfortunate is Mary Shelley had a concept (such as re-animating a corpse), but didn't have the knowledge or understanding of how those concepts might be realized, so there are gaps. For example, the reader goes from A to C and is never truly given an explanation for B.However, that's where imagination comes in, and the greater part of the story is not how certain concepts are realized, but a much larger moral issue. The question is: if humans have the capacity to defy the laws nature and play creator, should humans take on that role or should there be a code of morality to be considered? I do think this moral issue is also addressed in the movies I've seen, but not to such a large degree as it is in the book.The variances between the book and the movies are astounding. If you've seen the myriad movies made of \\"Frankenstein,\\" and believe you know the story, think again. The movie is really nothing like the book. The book offers so much more understanding of the \\"monster\\" - what he thinks, what he feels, and why he does what he does.The writing style is a bit obtuse and outdated, but then, this was written during the gothic period. Also, Mary Shelley was quite young, and was not as seasoned a writer and it shows. Still, the novel is short and fairly easy to read, and the character and personality Mrs. Shelley gives the \\"monster\\" is well worth it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"It is most unfortunate that this was the height of frightening literature then.By todays standards however it would be considered laughable.Older folks can still appreciate the beautiful way Shelley wrote her masterpiece.The use of language and the victorian way of speaking is quite charming and took some time to get used to.I should have read it years ago but only got to it recently.I felt I had to and was glad I did. Of course when one does actually read it one finds nothing of what Hollywood turned it into and now I know why. Deep down it is a story not of horror, even though one can feel the distant and at times rather close sense of dread the monster instills in Dr. Frankenstein but moreover it is a story of love.All this creation wanted was to love and be loved,to trust and be trusted, to live some semblance of a normal life. Alas, his horrific countenance proved his undoing,repulsive to all and even to himself. His want for normalcy,his ability to educate himself and to think in terms of future goals yet was forced into murder to obtain it is a lesson to be learned by all.I fear that with the exception of english majors and the literary curious, books like these are destined for extinction.What typical kid today would want to read it and if begun would finish it without going to cliff notes. This novel must be read cover to cover to be properly understood.It is and will always be a classic.I enjoyed it and highly encourage others to read it too especially the younger generation who might dismiss it after a few pages but should stick it out. They just don't write them like this anymore.I know there are other editions out there with more to offer the Frankenstein expert but this edition was just fine by me.Plus it begins and ends in the deep, dark,frozen wastes of the Arctic which was also a plus for a guy who digs the polar regions as much as I do."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I am an ardent cynic when it comes to \\"classics.\\" I think many people will read a book or hear a song, and if it is old, they will call it a classic. Then this \\"classic,\\" whether it is good or not, must be respected because of its age. I feel this way about the pioneers of Rock, who all made horrible music, but paved the way for good modern Rock and Metal. I feel this way about old movies, which were all terrible, but paved the way for today's movies. And I certainly felt that way about Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was a painfully boring and pointless book. Classics, in my opinion, must stand on their own in modern times. If have to start make excuses for a book, as if it is a senior citizen crapping the bed, it isn't a classic. It's crap. Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is a book worthy of this label, \\"classic.\\" Before reading further: SPOILER ALERT! There aren't any twists which I'm going to reveal, but SPOILER ALERT nonetheless. The book is told in three tiers. First is present day (for when the book was written) on a vessel in the arctic. A man writes to his sister while on a years-long journey of discovery. He stumbles upon Victor Frankenstein, a gaunt, emaciated and emotionally destroyed man, whose fatigue should have killed him. The second tier is told through Victor Frankenstein's story of his misfortune, beginning with his wonderful childhood, continuing with his creation of the Monster, and ending with his chase of the Monster in the Arctic. Within Frankenstein's story, the third and most revealing tier of the story is laid. Frankenstein's Monster tells of his unfortunate beginnings when he was innocent and harmless inside.The book tells a tale of love, ambition, adventure, obsession. She delves into the nature of humans and why we do good and bad things. Unlike many writers of her time, she does not inject her book with meaningless religious crap, save some understandable references. Where in Bram Stoker's Dracula, prayers may as well have been used in place of punctuation, Mary Shelley uses spirituality and the supernatural not as Deus Ex Machina tools to make her job easier, but as a way to reveal her characters' state of mind. When is a man more desperate than when he starts to believe that his dreams are windows into Heaven where his poor loved ones reside? I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone who wants to try some classics on for size. Out of the classics I've recently read, including War of the Worlds, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Alice in Wonderland, Frankenstein is probably my favorite."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Alright, I'll admit it - up until roughly a year ago I was a complete literary ignoramus. Then I started reading books and since then I've found a new addiction, classic literature. I was one of those people that thought Frankenstein was the monster and I figured the original story would be as laughable as the old clips of those classic Frankenstein movie with the mad scientist (\\"IT'S ALIIIIIIVE!\\"). As it turns out, his is a very harrowing tale and it's completely different than I imagined it to be. Thankfully.This is one of those occasions where I really don't want to sum up the plot because you might be like me and I'd hate to spoil anything for you. The plot twists come early and the line between who is the 'good guy' and who is the 'bad guy' are quickly blurred. Until about half way through (maybe a little further) I truly didn't know which way this tale was heading!Here's a tiny bit, just the beginning--Captain Robert Walton is set out to explore the North Pole. His ship is eventually incased in ice when he discovers a man from Geneva named Victor Frankenstein. Victor spills his tale. Victor is a scientist who created and then immediately abandoned a living abomination.That's it. i don't want to give anything significant away.I love this book but I just couldn't give it five stars. The main reason is because it bogs down a bit in areas. The worst example of this is when the monster is telling Victor his tale about a family he was spying on so he could learn more about human nature, how to speak, how to emote, etc. This is all interesting, but then he digs into this family's history and goes into a MASSIVE digression spanning pages upon pages about whom is marrying whom, all their relationships, etc - minutia to the extreme and it's all for naught. This section could have been cut down drastically without risk because when it all boils down, none of these details on this family matter and none of it is all that interesting.Aside from the complaint above I found this novel to be quite good. Much better than I thought it was going to be! Definitely check this one out. Aside from the dreadfully boring section I mentioned above this would have been an easy five, which I rarely give."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Many of the main ideas of Romanticism are seen in Mary Shelley's book Frankenstein. The romantic period is characterized by a movement and departure away from scientific and rational ideas, in literature, ideology, and art. The artwork from the romantic era strove to capture and represent the sublime, the experience of nature, and the personalization of these experiences. This particular work of Mary Shelley is a story that is not from her own personal experience nor written in her own voice. This work is about a quest to achieve the sublime. Through the use of emotionally stirring words and a creative, gothic mood, Mary Shelley creates a romantic piece of artwork that drives one towards personal discovery and romantic ideology. Frankenstein is about Dr. Victor Frankenstein's quest to create a living being out of raw materials in his laboratory. With an emphasis on a \\"new way of seeing things\\", Dr. Victor Frankenstein applied imagination and creative thinking in order to better understand the world, perfect the vision of human beings, and better characterize the society in which we live. Being the dreamer, who is preoccupied by the sublime, suggest Dr. Victor Frankenstein and this novel, as a wonderful romantic work."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"\\"Frankenstein\\" is a classic of Gothic literature that has boasted several spin-off books and movies. This particular edition rounds out at about 200 pages, and it was a quick read for me. It's not terribly fast-paced by today's standards, but it is engaging. The title character, Victor Frankenstein, grows up with an affinity for science and is determined to make his mark on humanity. He scavenges for human body parts until he is able to create, and bring to life, a new creation. As soon his creation comes to life, however, Victor is horrified by what he refers to as \\"the monster.\\"The novel is a frame story, and Victor's tale is conveyed by a ship's captain who finds him wandering in the North. The story of the monster is told mostly from Victor Frankenstein's point of view, but in some longer parts the monster narrates his experiences to Victor. For me, the monster's story was the most riveting part of the novel--I found Victor's character a bit annoying at times. The novel as a whole emphasizes the potential dangers of science, but it also brings to light themes of the dire consequences when the \\"created\\" is neglected or, worse, treated ill. The monster's character starts out as quite a sympathetic one, until he meets with the horror and revulsion of human beings he encounters. This raises issues about the consequences of intolerance that are relevant today; the enduring themes of the novel help to make it a classic.While those who prefer a fast-paced plot may be a bit bored with this, fans of earlier Gothic literature will enjoy the ride.

I won't go into the details of Shelly's masterpiece in this review, but deal in what I think makes this a timeless classic that hangs on to readers today.The character of Victor Frankenstein, a man obsessed with making a difference in the studies of life and death. It is his blind devotion to his studies over life and death, that leads to tragedy for his family and friends later in the story. Shelly takes us on a journey that shows us the frailty of our lives and the motives that drive us to achieve no matter the cost. Victor, even though he is a character, is within everyone. He is the blind ambition that throws away love for the sake of fame and immortality, and the utter lack of responsibility for his actions once the deed is done. This character is versatile, because it lingers in people, perhaps even someone you know.Just as haunting is Victor's creation, the Monster. Racked with questions about his identity and guilt for a life unwanted, the Monster is just as much a part of our lives as Victor. Forget about the rheumatoid Karloff of the Universal Classics, this Monster is so much more. Memories implanted by the mind or the parts of the whole, surprise Victor's creation and lead him on his journey for answers. A Monster that can speak and play music, a humbling yet violent creation asking for justification from his creator, an answer to the question: Why?This is a human tale.Yes there is drama and horror, but the human message is one that should be remembered and savored because it is a cautionary tale that tells how expendable life really is when one embarks on gaining knowledge and the frailty of the human soul when confronted by the deeds they have committed. To lose one's soul chasing after an obsession and then to seek redemption all too late.I know this does not cover the wealth that is Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, or Modern Prometheus, but as I have stated this review is what I think makes it a timeless classic that should be embraced by readers of all ages today."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus is actually great novel with intense themes that apply to the 1800s as well as today! A 4/5 rating is a little low, and I wish that I could give it a 4.5/5 because it is so good. But, it has a few weaknesses so I couldn't give it five stars. The novel is a whole lot more emotional and meaningful than the 1931 movie. They are so different in their story's events and in their message that it is surprising that they even share the same name!Although I don't agree with everything Mary Shelley is implying in her writing, such as the idea of a planned destiny, some of the novel's main messages are actually quite true and apparent to the modern world. The novel shows how taking someting, such as science or the desire to become famous, taken to the extreme actually destroys rather than builds. This applies to the confict between science and ethics in the case of genetic engineering and cloning of modern day. Also, the novel shows how others' heartless and presumptuous actions can totally ruin a person and can bring out the evil from within that person. Even though the book isn't very long, with all these powerful themes, it is not exactly an easy read.The story is great, and Mary Shelley related events very well. I have to admit, some parts were predictable, but other parts of the book were suspensful and exciting to read. The story starts with an arctic explorer who finds and saves a man he found almost frozen to death. This man, in order try to teach the explorer a lesson about the the downsides of fame, tells his story about his scientific discovery dealing with life and death and his terrible destruction. This story is not action-packed, terrifying, nor that believable (it really doesn't need to be) but it is emotional, tragic, dark, and moving, and Mary Shelley's writing style creates this mood well.The language that Mary Shelley uses is exquisite, but sometimes challenging because it is old-fashioned. I would recommed that you get an edition, such as the Penguin Classics, that has end-notes so you can have a greater understanding of Mary Shelley's writing. Also, there are certain parts of the book that move at a slow pace. Getting through the slow parts is well worth it, however, because it is such a powerful and fascinating book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Greatest book ever written in my opinion, but I'm writing this review to warn people that once again Amazon has inaccurate information. This is the THIRD Kindle Frankenstein I have bought from Amazon claiming to be the ORIGINAL version. All three have NOT been the original. They are the 1831 revised edition."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"When people think of horror, the image of Boris Karloff's Frankenstein can generally be expected to pop into their heads, usually within the first minute of the word \\"horror\\"s utterance.Yet Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is not horror. It is science-fiction - and, for that matter, one of the first works of science-fiction ever written, as well as one of the most brilliant. While many of the nineteenth-century authors who boldly dove into the realm of the unknown came back with fascinating baubels that are now horribly dated, \\"Frankenstein\\" maintains its power and prescience in three ways:1) Its foremost theme is that of life itself - what is it that separates inanimate tissue from its living counterpart, and what in turn can give sentience to what might otherwise be a mindless organism. The answers to these questions have not yet been discovered, and are indeed probably in greater controversy today than they were in Shelley's own time.2) Another aspect timeless aspect of this book is its exploration into the responsibilities of creation - not merely scientific creation, but of any sort of creation, of any situation in which a human being with an idea sees it through to the finish, only to find that unexpected consequences await him/her.3) The drama itself - of a man fleeing from a monster, and of a monster trying desperately to assert his manhood - is as poignant as it is profound, and the reader who isn't moved by the plights of both these characters lacks either the heart to care or the brain to understand.It is a shame that people today associate the word Frankenstein with cheap and formulaic horror films. Indeed, there is a fair amount of irony that Frankenstein is often thought of as a run-of-the-mill hideous monster, when indeed it was precisely that sort of knee-jerk superficiality and intolerance that Shelley herself was trying to combat. Either way, Frankenstein is one of those rare books that managed to create its own genre without later being dated by countless similar efforts. No matter how great future science fictions writers may become, they will always walk in the shadow of Frankenstein."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I bought this book and I have had problems with the version. I have reason to believe that this is the original version from 1818, although many schools call for Shelley's revised 1831 version. However, the version isn't stated anywhere in the book.Subtle differences in the two texts include Elizabeth's relation to Victor (she is a cousin in this novel, an orphan in the 1831 version), the chapter organization (part of this version's chapter 1 is the other's chapter 2), and various other minor occurences (in the other version, Victor and Walton discuss the seriousness of the journey and the possible loss of sailors, which doesn't occur in the 1818 book).If you are buying this book for school, I would advise checking version's because the subtle differences can really mess you up on tests and reading checks."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I was required to read this book in college for my information technology & society course.

I became so absorbed in the book that it only took me two days to read it. \\"Frankenstein\\" is a story that questions ethics, society and relationships. It is dark in the same way as \\"Dracula,\\" but unlike \\"Dracula\\", which is also a fine book, there is an undertone of tenderness and sadness.

The instant that I began reading this book I became totally enthralled. I would go well beyond the assigned chapter yearning to know what would happen next.

So, if you're looking for chainsaw slashing, blood, and gore, look elsewhere. But, if you're looking for a classic novel of intelligence, love, alienation, and desperation-this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I picked up this ebook for my Kindle, I've read the story before, but I needed a copy to carry around for school and reread.

No, I was not forced to read this. I read it far before it was on the reading list. Just wanted to clear that up. Back to the review. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is an intriguing autobiography of a man obsessed with tampering with the laws of nature by reversing them. This novel shows how man deals with failure and loss. Unfortunatly, Victor Frankenstein dealt with failure and loss the wrong way and... Wait, I don't want to give away the ending. Anyway, Mary Shelley creates a clever plot and adds some gruesome happenings and romance, combining the three to make one of the most famous horror stories. Unfortunatly, for those of you still hooked to video games and fast-paced action, you may have a difficult time reading this for it tends to drag out at some points. But that's how literature is, you'll just have to deal with it. Apart from that, I would definitly recommend this book to just about anyone."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is a fantastic work of classic literature. I think few people realize just how different the novel is from the archetype version of the story most people are familiar with. You know, the cheesy green monster with the bolts in the neck, flat head and elevator shoes with the moral not to play God. Oh, yes, and the creature in that idea usually only grunts or says things like \\"Fiiire Bad!\\"That is NOT what Frankenstein, the novel, is. In the novel the creature has yellow eyes, tightly drawn skin, long black hair, is very agile, and is highly intelligent. The creature is hyper intelligent. Within minutes of his creation he figured out how to dress himself and only months after that he could speak, read and write, more articulately than his own creator. He was even quoting Milton. Many people remember the moral not to play God but few remember that there is a secondary moral. The creature had to forgive his creator for how he treated him, for abandoning him, and for not preparing him for the cruelties of the world. He had to learn that revenge would bring him no peace but only perpetuate a cycle of anger and revenge.There is also the message of responsibility to one's child and the importance of keeping one's promises (which Victor breaks several times in the course of the story and only causes more trouble for everyone invovled).The creature is tragic. This is a brilliant work of literature by a impressively creative woman. What she created was a story that will last through the ages, a combination of science, alchemy and parent / child metaphors that reaches us on a very basic level. Read the classic novel if you have not yet done so already."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN is as relevant today as it was during its initial publication in 1818. The story, butchered by Hollywood renditions, chronicles a young doctor Frankenstein who discovers how to reanimate life. He attempts to create the perfect being: tall, athletic, and free from disease. Instead, when the being comes to life, the result is hideous and grotesque. The doctor flees his lab and his creation only to find his life haunted by his rejected creation. Modern retellings of this story hold that the monster (who is often inappropriately called \\"Frankenstein\\",) is a lumbering idiot who is afraid of fire. These versions focus on the horror of the monster. The 1818 version of Frankenstein's creation is a smart, nimble creature who has become a wretch after finding rejection at every corner of the world.Shelley's original narrative focuses on the horror of being rejected or cast out of the world. The book often references and evokes Milton's PARADISE LOST, and for good reason. There are similar themes at work here -- similar ideas about creation, rejection, and the yearning to find meaning in our lives.The Kindle edition is a pretty good public domain copy. The formatting is great. There's two introductions: one from Wendy Steiner, and another from the author herself. There are a few instances in which letters and characters did not translate correctly to the electronic edition (some ol's that format as d's, etc). Other than a few instances of this, this version is very readable and contains few errors.I'd recommend this book to anyone who has even a cursory interest in FRANKENSTEIN -- the tale told here is infinitely more interesting and fascinating than the monsters of Hollywood. Because FRANKENSTEIN is available through the public domain, Amazon is offering this eBook for free. It's easier to access this great book now than it ever has been before.

I found myself fed up somewhere in the middle of the novel because of this, but at the end I was satisfied."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is an interesting, enjoyable, and thought provoking novel, depicting the consequences of one immoral decision on the behalf of Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Frankenstein is then faced with whether or not to create a second monster to appease the first, which has already killed his brother in his fury. This second decision, which he saw as a choice between his family and the human race, was what angered the originally kind-hearted creature and turned him to a path of evil and revenge. While the story of Frankenstein is commonly thought to involve an evil &quot;monster,&quot; I particularly liked that either the doctor or the creature (or both) could be seen as evil. Frankenstein had sought fame in the ability to bring one back from the dead but he never paused to consider the moral implications of his actions. Abandoning his creation, Victor saw only evil in his creature and, blaming him for the death of his brother, vowed revenge. Victor would not sympathize with the creature's hard life and refused to grant him one request that would end, or so he promised, his evil doings. Similarly, the creature entered the world with a good heart and had intentions only of helping others. He wanted nothing more than acceptance and love, but people were unable to see beyond his hideous appearance. After being shunned by the human race, the creature vowed revenge on the person who had cursed him with life, his creator. Once Frankenstein refused him a companion, and with it, any chance of happiness or love, the creature vowed to make Frankenstein pay for his selfishness. Mary Shelley's story is captivating and intriguing; it portrays the classic horror story plot in an enjoyable manner with emphasis on the issue of who is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot;, and what the responsibilities of Frankenstein, as the creator should be to his monster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Contrary to my original belief that Frankenstein was a generic monster story, I found Shelly's novel to be engrossing.

However, when he finally brought life to his creature, Frankenstein had no idea that his &quot;work of science,&quot; would eventually control his life. Shelly's novel breaks the boundaries set by dull science-fiction stories and enters a world of human nature, with love, vengeance, misery, anguish, and regret.

While there's no denying it was an incredible idea, particularly for 19 year old girl written so very long ago, I found the language inpenetrable, repetitive and rather unsettling.Much of this book is written in a philosophical tone and the reader is expected to wade through page upon page of the internal workings of the central protagonist, Victor Frankenstein. In spite of this, I felt incredibly distanced from him due the language used to describe his emotions.Nonetheless, the book's themes are fascinating and insightful. It is basically a story of how a man's arrogance and thirst for knowledge leads him to meddle with nature, and what tragedy this causes both for him and the being he creates.

As a sophmore in highschool I was required to read it in for my English 2 class. I glanced through it at first and thought it to be quite verbose and overly detailed. My assumptions were wrong. When I actually got into the book I began to really enjoy it. I realized that the many details help you visualize what is going on more. Mary Shelly creates a very imaginitive and creative plot about a man who tampers with the laws of nature. She combines science and fantasy to create one of the greatest novels of all time. So if you have the patience to read this somtimes slow but fabulous book, I definately recommend you do so."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Among the many themes of Frankenstein, one of them is that of friendship, ambition, and the conflict between the two. The message is that the deeper need of the two is friendship, but that we are susceptible to the temptations of ambition, which can destroy friendship.Ostensibly, Victor Frankenstein had an unselfish mission to \\"benefit all mankind\\" with his scientific project. His \\"selfless\\" ambition failed him and proved to aim at self-glory because he wanted to create a race that would bless him as its father. In Captain Walton's second letter to his sister, we learn that although he has a well-trained crew, he has no soul companion; this need he regards as a \\"most severe evil.\\" Walton's exploration of the secluded and frozen Arctic serves as a metaphor for how his ambition has removed him from society. His ambition even threatened his own and his crew members' lives when ice surrounded and trapped his boat. Likewise, this is where Victor's ambition leads him when he's hunting down the monster in futility. The message is that if one sets out ambitiously to benefit mankind, once that person has acheived their goal, their prominence sets them apart from the same society they set out to benefit.Victor had a much more intense ambition than Walton, with corespondingly more disasterous results. As Frankenstein prepared for his project, he isolated himself from his friends and family to laboriously study the sciences and he would later postpone his marriage for this project. The embodiment of his ambition, the repulsive monster, would eventually slay several of Victor's loved family members, including his fiance on their wedding night. Even the monster feels as his deepest need a human relationship, which he has none and which is the very thing that turned him from good to evil. While observing an impoverished family, \\"the bitter gall of envy\\" arose in the monster. He considers them rich because they have the companionship of each other even though they are in financial poverty. When Frankenstein rejects the monster's pleas to create for him a mate of the same race, the monster sets out on an unstoppable path to destruction and an ambitious one indeed. The novel links ambition with destruction, particularly destruction of companionship and conveys friendship as a great , if not greatest, need for man.I don't think the story conveys that all ambition is destructive. At the end of the story, Victor has great regret for the results of his ambition, but he still has pride for his effort. Although he cautions us that we would be better off to believe our \\"native town to be the world,\\" he adds, \\"yet another may succeed.\\" You could interpret this as Victor not \\"learning his lesson;\\" that mankind will continue to give in to harmful passions. Another, much different analysis could be that this story portrays that limited ambition, integrated with society and not aimed at self-glory, can be virtuous. After all, for the teenage author of a classic, enduring novel to tell us that all ambition will destroy us would be a contradiction."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated works of fiction in the English language. EVERYONE should read it- it's very short,very readable, and a really entertaining story. You THINK you know the story from the movies, but it's actually quite different. Frankenstein's monster is not the lumbering lummox the films make him out to be- rather, he is articulate, sensitive, and as soft-hearted as he is embittered. The central philosophical question of the book is whether or not the \\"monster\\" (or, as Shelley referes to him, \\"the fiend\\") is really human. The question of the creature's humanity is muddled by the fact that he is entirely rational and seems to have a well-defined sense of morality, although his morality might not be shared by all the readers. Some will argue that the creature is indeed human, other's will argue that he is merely a sociopath created out of the remains of formerly human souls and is therefore more or less an organic robot. A lamentably short read, this story will stick with you and will forever change your opinion of the hollywood version of this monster.

Frankenstein is more than a tell of gothic horror. If that is what the reader is after any number of works by Steven King or Dean Koontz will suffice. The story of Frankenstein however, is one of love, hate, seeking acceptance, madness and rage gone unchecked. Not only is Frankenstein a great read but it also has the distinction (at least to my knowledge) of being the only novel to be told from three separate points of view, Dr Frankenstein's, the Monster's (who goes nameless through the entire story), and a third unattached view of a ship Captain who finds himself to be the soul witness to the final conflict between the two. Few stories from this time period transport themselves to the present with the same amount of relevance as Frankenstein. Anyone who doesn't find time to read this classic is cheating themselves out of a wonderfull story, that will mean much to them."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is said to be one of the best books ever written and it has been proven time and time again. The story will scare you only if you can really get into it and you can understand everything that is going on while you are reading it. If you get lost while reading the book you will be lost through the rest of the book. It is interesting that Victor Frankenstein can come up with an idea to bring something to life by using old body parts. Mary Shelly had to have had some inspiration to come up with an idea like this one. Frankenstein has some realistic parts to it that make it more believable. This novel shows how grotesque people can be treated when they are out in the real world. Although Frankenstein did deserve what he got because he did not treat people good. It becomes quite sad that Victor and Frankenstein both follow each other scared to see what is going to happen next. Victor has to follow Frankenstein around and put his own life on hold. He cannot get married when he wants to and that is something that should not wait for anyone. Victor should not have been blamed for the murder when no one in the town knew anything about the story. There are people who go in and out of towns all of the time who can say that it was not a common bum. Although the out come is very good with all of the stress that the characters have to go through while this story is taken place. With the descriptions that Mary Shelly uses and the imaginations that people have this novel is a perfect way to expand ones mind. The movie follows the book pretty well although you can only watch Mary Shelly's Frankenstein. All of the other movies that show Frankenstein do not even come close to the real thing.

After becoming deathly ill Dr. Frankenstein relized the mistake he had made creating such a monster and quickly went to destroy it. The beast had actually run away and was surviving in the wilderness and spying on a family before he was shooed away and his emotions began to take place.

Shelley's gothic tale about the artificial creation of life depicts the risks of scientific hubris and the unanticipated consequences that can follow. It calls to mind Robert Oppenheimer's second thoughts about the creation of the atomic bomb, modern genetic researchers who are moving ever closer to human cloning, and the unanticipated environmental risks of greenhouse gasses and nuclear energy. This classic speaks to us from the past about philosophical and moral issues that apparently haven't changed as quickly as our technology."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Victor grew up reading the works of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Albertus Magnus, the alchemists of the time. Toss in a little natural philosophy (sciences) and you have the making of a monster. Or at least a being that after being spurned for looking ugly becomes ugly. So for revenge the creature decides unless Victor makes another (female this time) creature, that Victor will also suffer the loss of friends and relatives. What is victor to do? Bow to the wishes and needs of his creation? Or challenge it to the death? What would you do?Although the concept of the monster is good, and the conflicts of the story well thought out, Shelly suffers from the writing style of the time. Many people do not finish the book as the language is stilted and verbose for example when was the last time you said, \\"Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy of death.\\"Much of the book seems like travel log filler. More time describing the surroundings of Europe than the reason for traveling or just traveling. Many writers use traveling to reflect time passing or the character growing in stature or knowledge. In this story they just travel a lot.This book is definitely worth plodding through for moviegoers. The record needs to be set strait. First shock is that the creator is named Victor Frankenstein; the creature is just \\"monster\\" not Frankenstein. And it is Victor that is backwards which added in him doing the impossible by not knowing any better. The monster is well read in \\"Sorrows of a Young Werther,\\" \\"Paradise Lost,\\" and Plutarch's \\"Lives.\\" The debate (mixed with a few murders) rages on as to whether the monster was doing evil because of his nature or because he was spurned?It is easer to listen to than read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Like many teenagers, I was under the impression that Frankenstein (thinking it was the name of the monster) was a remorseless brute that got joy from torturing people. But after reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, my perception completely changed.I literally knew nothing about the story save that Frankenstein--again thinking that it was the monster--was repulsive in aspect.As I read the story I came to find out that Frankenstein was actually the name of the man who created the abominable creature. Also, I would have never guessed that the creature would have been made malicious by human disdain. The \\"daemon\\" was at heart benevolent and innocuous, but human scorn turned his ways and he sought revenge.Altogether, the story was very well written. It did have a few flaws, such as the overuse of the word \\"endeavour\\" and the impractibility of a man remembering such long a story and actually narrarating the whole of it, not forgetting to omit a single quote. Despite the few flaws, Frankenstein is indeed a horror classic (although, I failed to find any horror in it) and should be read by the fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Dr. Frankenstein goes off to London to receive an education and discovers his love of science. His first experiment is to create a life from parts. He assembles a creature by which even he is repulsed. Frankenstein's nightmare is fully realized when the creature's eyes first blink and he realizes that his experiment worked. He flees the apartment only to find it empty upon his return. But despite Frankenstein's initial thoughts that his problem has taken leave on it's own, he finds himself hunted by the wretched creature. The Monster is seeking a companion, finding himself alone because of society's repulsion to his outward appearance. He proposes a solution to his creator. Create him a companion, or he will take the lives of Frankenstein's friends and family leaving him with the feelings of loneliness and isolation. The Doctor must now decide which horror is worse - to create another of these monsters or to risk the lives of himself and his loved ones.For years I was under the false impression that Frankenstein was the monster himself, not the creator. Further, after seeing brief parts of the movie with Robert De Niro, I had further misconceptions about the true story. But Mary Shelley's actual text is a story about human emotion, making difficult life and death choices, and emotional isolation and loneliness - the desire for true companionship.The difficulty with reading classics like this today is that the language is difficult to get through even for advanced readers. Writing style has evolved so much over the centuries and the old style is not to be faulted, but it does take dedication and patience for those not accustomed to it. Nonetheless, it is a story worth reading and the original deserves notoriety, more so that common and modern misconceptions."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelley had a great idea for Frankenstein... creation vs. creator is always an interesting topic, but Frankenstein is as dull as it gets! I had to read this book for school and I could barely get through it- the plot goes nowhere, and important parts of the book, such as the creation of the 'monster' happen very quickly. I had expected to read a true classic, but after reading it, I suggest watching one of the many movie versions despite their differences from the book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is truly worthy of the term \\"classic\\". Mary Shelley began writing this novel at the young age of 18, yet managed to create a landmark work of fiction. The story is interwoven with ever-present social and ethical questions. What does it mean to be human? What are the consequences of using scientific technology to play the role of Creator? How far is too far when tampering with the order of the universe?Upon my first reading of this book I was pleasantly surprised to find that the creature is very intelligent and human-like, though grotesque in appearance. It is a shame that the Frankenstein creature is universally represented in the minds of the public as an oafish and very dimwitted monster with bolts in its neck and a green pallor. The true Frankenstein is far more intriguing. I love the parts of the book that are a first person narrative by the \\"creature\\".I highly recommend this book as it is an enjoyable piece of classic literature. If you are a fan of horror, read this for an understanding of the early roots of the genre that you so love, and that those roots actually formed intellectual arguments and contained actual substance. This book is a must read for the well rounded reader. In fact, had I graduated from high school and never read this book, I would begin to question the quality of my own education."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Book ReviewA strange man is met by a ship headed through Antarctica and tells a story about making a monster and its destroying of his life. A man on the ship writes letters to his sister telling about their voyage and how they met a strange man by the name of Dr. Frankenstein. In the letters he retells Dr. Frankenstein's story of the creation of a monster that he abandons right after giving life to. Because it was so hideous nobody could meet it without running away and his creator abandoned it. With the lack of friends the monster is driven crazy and demands Dr. Frankenstein to make him a woman companion. When his request is turned down he promises a life of misery to Dr. Frankenstein and it keeps its promise. With all friends gone Dr. Frankenstein chases the fiend in hope of vengeance all the way to Antarctica were he gets on this ship. While on the ship Dr. Frankenstein dies and the fiend comes in to see his fallen creator. The fiend then repents and leaves the captain of the ship with the promise of burning himself alive. Frankenstein by Shelly is a sad, warning for the future, descriptive book worth every minute it takes to read it.This book builds very sad images while your reading along. The short story the monster tells about secretly helping a family but when it goes to confront them is beat with a frying pan and drove away it gives you a feeling sorrow for the monster. But when you read about Dr. Frankenstein's newly wed wife screaming as the monster strangles her to death you feel hatred for the monster and sad for Dr. Frankenstein. And even more heart compelling is when the monster is standing over its creator grieving and repenting for all the horrible things he has done to Dr. Frankenstein.During the book people are warned the possibilities of what would happen by giving life to a creature by man. It says by doing this you make a monster unable to be loved by the nicest of people. It also implies that by making a creature your just making a burden for yourself. Another factor proposed in the book that would disapprove of the making of a human is the chance of a violent natured monster set out to harm its creator and not a nice monster only there to help.The book is very descriptive in all aspects. The formation of the fiend is very in depth and the feelings the monster goes through are numerous. The landscape and harsh conditions the monster has to endure and the way he survives is covered, and the mental state of Dr. Frankenstein is always known.If I could I would reread the book to have the same emotions I had the first time round. It was a very sad book that carried an important message for people about the creation of a human in a descriptive manner. It was a fun experience for me and I am sure it will be for you also.(...)"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I am one among the very few who has never watched a Frankenstein movie, but yet is very familiar with the name Frankenstein. Yet, it's highly ironic that popular culture (in film, television,etc.)has ironically came to confuse the name \\"Frankstein\\" with the Monster rather than the creator. This is one of the greatest attributes that has made Mary Shelly a genius of gothic and horror literature: uncertainty. She somewhat forces us to interpret the plot and the characters. For instance, who is really the monster, its creator or the monster itself? And most hauntingly, even more so to this day, where does science draw the line when it comes to the point that technology is playing the role of God? Even throughout the plot we aren't truly sure or convinced that any of the characters have grown wiser, or just sadder, if they learned anything at all. Is the monster a genius? Is he a murder, the \\"fallen angel,\\" a representation of a neglected Adam? Or simply just a child of innocence that was neglected and somewhat forced into a life of melancholy, despair, and adversity? Even after Mary Shelly had revised Frankstein, she has never changed the story. Her haunting novel still awakens us to think about the knowledge and imagination of man, and its limits, and how dangerous it can become if we start trying to become a substitute of God, or the \\"modern Prometheus.\\" I feel lucky that i have read this book before actually watching the Frankstein films, which i look foreward to seeing. But i know that the film doesn't follow Mary Shelly's novel exactly, however, it's a classic moment in pop culture. That has good points and negative points: first of all, regardless if people have read it or not, it opens us to a tale that still brings chills and suspense, and exemplifies the genius of the incredible author that made all of it possible. The sad thing is that people who have NOT read the book at all, and assume that they KNOW the story just from watching the classic Frankstein films, are truly missing out on a story that should be read, not just watched. I believe that people should learn this tale from literature first before pop culture. But from the looks of it, i guess it's easier to simply watch the film and be contented at that, which is fine. But hopefully, more people will be interested in knowing the true Frankstein who wasn't just some mumbling, grotesque creature, but one who was intelligent, articulate, an adept orator, and hauntingly just as human (and monstrous) as man itself."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Frankenstein is, by far, one of the best novels I have ever read. Set in the 1700s, the novel follows a captain on an important expedition. Frankenstein was written for a diverse audience. Anyone of any age or race could read this book and understand it without any problems. It not only keeps the reader interested in what is going on, but it also keeps the reader trying to guess what is going to happen next. The novel has a mysterious appeal. The plot is filled with many twists and turns which make it uneasy to spoil the story. The characters in Frankenstein are very unique. Each of them possess specific characteristics which make them key figures to the development of the plot. I believe there are many themes to this novel. I believe that tragedy, sorrow, and grief are the main themes though. All of the characters experience tragedy sorrow and grief brought on by a series of misfortunate events which occur throughout the story. This book is considered a classic because it has, over the years taken on its on identity, becoming one of the most popular myths of all time. There have been many different versions of the book and many movies, but nothing comes closer to the original version written by Mary Shelly. I would recommend this book to anybody of any age who is able to read it. It is not a complicated story to read and it is filled with many aspects that any reader could relate to. Science, love, mystery, and suspense all play a role in making the story interesting and worthy of reading."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I love this book and how fitting it should be written by the child of Mary Wollstonecraft and Percy Shelley.I just think on what my Literary Types prof at the University of Michigan had to say...\\"It's the story of a crazed undergraduate.\\"\\"All right, Viktor, you put the twelve-inch [organ] on the monster and what do you think he's going to do with it?\\"Made a 7 a.m. class worthwhile."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I believe at the time that this was written, that readers were expected to come away from reading this book with a sense that people should not try to emulate God by creating their own life from scratch. And in such, readers were supposed to empathasize with the monster and shun the doctor. I had the opposite reaction. Initially I had pity for the monster but it slowly disolved as the story wore on. I felt pity for the doctor. I think this is one of the classic stories of good versus evil. And the fact that the interpretation of who is good and who is evil is up to each individual reader. And it's because of this that this is one of my favorite books of all time. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Think about how technology and humanity often clash with one another. For 18 years, an unidentified mail bomber kills several and wounds many, his career culminating in an anti-technological jerimiad blackmailed into mass media publication by both The New York Times and the Washington Post. Doctors in Scotland succeed in cloning a sheep, and knowingly set off both heartfelt protest and academic wrangling. The decoding of the human genome sparks scientific firestorms--as scientists debate the possibilities for both help and harm to come when new techniques of curing disease and prolonging life spring into being. The proliferation of nuclear weapons heralds a chaotic possible future that political scientists still cannot completely fathom, even as the looming shadow continues to pursue us all.Mary Wolstonecraft Shelley, author of &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; seemingly foresaw what lurks within all these examples. As the wife of Percy Blythe Shelley--famous even today as perhaps the greatest poet of the Romantic Era--Mary Shelley shared with her husband the concerns of many of the most humanized intellectuals on the planet. Technology in 1821 was a relatively new social force. Industrializing rapidly, the England with which Shelley was familiar had already bent beneath the weight of changes wrought by the beginning of the age of machines only decades before. Old ways obliterated themselves. New, and unfamiliar metaphors to the human condition quickly replaced them.Considered by some as the first science fiction novel ever written, &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; as a novel, could be and might best be considered something of oracular proportions. Sweeping in its scope, wise in its prophetic and albeit poetic assessments of what technology really means to the survival of the human spirit, the novel rises up from the predominant notions of both medicine and the ultimate purpose of technology--in that the prolongation of life and the defeat of death are the ultimate endpoints of both. Moreover, the prospects of creating life from death--and we all know the familiar scenes from the movie in which the crazed Dr. Frankenstein robs graves in the pouring rain--provide an ironic counterpoint to the major thrust of the novel's theme.Even more ironic is that no one will ever know how Shelley might have felt to have learned that her grave warning to the human race would be hacked and cut to pieces to serve as a form of entertainment that was undreamed of in her age. What would she have thought of Boris Karloff's chilling portrayal as a blunt-headed beast of her protagonist's creation? Could she have ever dreamed that the very message beneath her life's work would be mangled and disembowled of any and all meaning? While many today celebrate the fact that Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is the archetype of the modern horror story--the birth of a monster that takes more contemporary form in movies such as &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;--few consider the powerful metaphors within the novel itself.Unlike the movie, Mary Shelley's version begin with a harrowing encounter in the Artic--the ice cold and unhospitable axis of the world, the place by which the world turns and turns ruthlessly with no consideration for the fragility of human life--and continues with almost karmic dimensions as Dr. Viktor Frankenstein, fully and suddenly understanding the scientific terror and technological golem he has obsessively unleashed, devotes the grim remainder of his life to the destruction of what he has created. It's an old tale, too, a little like Dante entering a wood and visiting Hell, the tale of Dr. Frankenstein is synonymous with the advent of middle age: We spend our youths dreaming of our creation, and yet we spend our later years often searching for ways to destroy that for which we once dreamed.&quot;Frankenstein&quot; is one of richest novels ever written. A favorite of generations, it regales in a style that is itself a vivid example of how technology and its unforseen imperitive--that we constantly hurry and curry the lowest common denominator--have turned both the novel and the English language into a strange changeling that is a pallid, shadowy reflection of an age of philosophic and spiritual grandeur that unavoidably midwived the modern age. Regardless of its richness, however, Mary Shelley's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; won't alienate a reader who gives herself to the oceanic flow of her voice. Told simply and with a passion unsurprisingly absent from contemporary prose, &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a novel whose time has yet to come."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I've never really seen the movie version of this literary classic, let alone thought about reading the book. I picked up what I thought was the story of Frankenstein by osmosis. It is now obvious that what I learned didn't come from the book, as the story is totally different from the movie versions. Mary Shelley has written an interesting tale that attacks not only technology, but the misguided belief that man can control such technology.The story has three narrators, so readers get different viewpoints on the story. The first narrator comes across Victor Frankenstein in the arctic as he is tracking down his beastly creation. This narrator is Walton, the captain of a ship and a man on his own dangerous mission. We then get to hear Victor Frankenstein's story. This section details Victor and his education, where he is enraptured by alchemy and natural science. During the course of his studies he figures out how to animate objects, and creates a man that is to become his nightmare and his undoing. The last section is narrated by the creature that Victor has created, and the Creature's attempts to become part of society and learn to educate himself is one of the more interesting parts of the book. The creature is spurned, of course, and decides to take his wrath out on humanity in general, and Victor in particular. It isn't hard to see the theme of the story, which is that man shouldn't attempt to play God. If man is imperfect, the creatures he could create would be even more imperfect. I think the book has a nice message to events today, in that those who advance technology almost never suffer themselves. It is the rest of us that have to adjust our lives to accomodate the Bill Gates' of the world. Bill Gates and a few thousand other people really benefit. In Frankenstein, others do indeed suffer, but so does Victor. No one benefits from this beastly creation. Even the beast suffers in the extreme.This book is indeed well written, although as with most 19th century literature, the prose takes some getting used to. It sure beats the garbage being passed off as literature today. The Penguin version, which is the one I read, is pretty good. It includes appendices that contain extra text, as well as some short horror stories written by Shelley's friends Lord Byron and Polidari. The introduction is pretty good as well, and points out some connections that the book has to other works that were circulating at the same time.

Mary Shelley was truly an inspiring author, she is probably one of the greatest authors of our time. The way she described the monster, Frankenstein, and many other characters in the book. If you have not read this book yet, you should be deeply ashamed, it taught me so many things about life and how precious it is. Frankenstein is about a young man who creates a monster, the monster is very lonely and as a result begins to kill Dr. Frankensteins family and friends. Loneliness can be a small thing to some people, or can be a big thing. This is why we need to take part in the world today and comfort the lonely, sad, or self-distrout. If we don't, there is no telling what may happen.

I thought it would be one of those books that have no point or moral, just as most of the books we read in english. But I was wrong the novel was one of the best I ever read.

And what the effects are of using power and not thinking of the consequences, making it an anywhere anytime type of novel. Marry Shelly uses the frame device through 99% of the book (it's when the whole book is being told by one of the characters, often used to make the story more believable) The book will keep you wanting to read more and more.

In fact, it is book with a profound theme. It's a book with romance, some suspense, many twists, and a some sad scenes on top of it all. After reading this book, the reader either sympathizes with Victor or the monster. I thought Victor wasn't an extremely complex character who just has to deal with the wrong choices he's made.

Then after Victor created this monster, he finally realized that it was a very bad mistake. &quot;That is what got me hooked&quot; Frankenstein was not known or understood by the villagers and the mean things they did to him was only because of the way he looked. This books makes you think about several things; one being don't creat something without putting a lot of thought into it, becuase it could seriously back fire on you and the pain you can bring to others as well as your self. And last don't judge someone by the way they look, because even Frankenstein had a heart that felt pain, anger, humility and sadness. Thank you.

This may however have to do with the time period Mary Shelley wrote the book in, as a work of romantism it is very good. I expected the book to be heavily feminist but i found myself pleasntly surprised that it wasn't overly feministic. I didn't expec great things more the book and didn't get anything spectacular.

I especially like the way that the plot unravled and jumped from place to place. It did not get confusing either. It was quite easy to follow. The characters were well drawn and in everything that they did, their motives were clearly known to the reader. None of the characters did anyhting that seemed out of context. There were parts of the book that were a little drawn out and slow, but it always picked right back up again. Mary Shelley presents an issue that is very applicable right now. Is it morally right to play God and attempt to create life? Obviously, Shelley's opinion is that it can only lead to disaster."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Wanted to gift one of my favorite books for a family member.

What surprised me the most was that there was no assistant, no Igor. Also that Frankenstein hated what he had created. The book had many pages of remorse and it is very gloomy and sad. So much death and sadness created by giving life to something that should not be alive. I think Mary Shelley is trying to warn us that God is the only One who can create life.

We take several chapters before we even meet Victor Frankenstein, and there is a lot of backstory told that isn't really needed. However, between the unnecessary exposition, there are many exciting and profound, and even emotional moments. Shelly went much further into character development than what I was expecting from what little I knew about the story - I knew the monster is misunderstood, but was not expecting the depth that is offered.The roots of modern sci-fi are found in books like this, and this should be considered a sci-fi classic. I also noticed hints of language and style that reminded me a lot of H.P. Lovecraft, particularly the descriptions of madness and angst, and themes of delving too far. Could it be that Lovecraft was heavily inspired by this novel?

Commentators and critics throw out all sorts of theories about Mary Shelley's original message, many of them centering on the creation riling against its Creator.At last I've read the book for myself (my first novel read on an e-reader). The story starts with a ship in the cold Arctic regions coming across a man, almost dead, upon an ice floe. This man is Victor Frankenstein, who gives account of his life for us, telling of his youthful interest in science, of his search for the key to life, and his discovery thereof. In his pride, he unleashes a monster that wreaks havoc more upon its creator than anyone else. The story ranges from Italy and Switzerland to Germany, England, and beyond. A number of murders occur, and Frankenstein in his unwillingness to seek help or bring the truth into the light, suffers the consequences, in much the same way we see in \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\\"\\"Frankenstein\\" is so much more than I expected, more literary and thought-provoking. It touches on the evil within each of us, and the way that is unleashed through our pride, our secrecy, and our anger. In many ways it's a metaphor for man and science, for man and arrogance, for man and sin. This story continues to reverberate because it touches on so many themes, defying easy interpretation all the while. On the other hand, \\"Frankenstein\\" is much less than I expected. The horror and violence are mostly committed out of view of the reader. The story, like \\"Dracula,\\" is told through journals and letters and remembrance so that it feels personal while also feeling detached from the original actions.A precursor to many of our science fiction novels of today, \\"Frankenstein\\" was the foundation for H.G. Wells and Robert Louis Stevenson to further build upon these themes, and later, writers such as Heinlein and Crichton. It's all the more remarkable for being written by an English woman in the early 1800s, a stark contrast to books such as \\"Jane Eyre.\\" It loses some of its horror and excitement in today's market, but remains a classic for its language and themes."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is obviously a classic. This book was one that I never thought I would find myself reading but the more I got into it, the more I enjoyed. The classic story of the man who creates his own monster out of anger and aggression, is portrayed somewhat differently than what most think. Unlike the movies, the monster is an intelligent man who knows what he wants, and the man who created him is just as smart. The book follows the main character through his life, past, and present and somewhat into the future. With exciting twists and turns and climatic events, Frankenstein will keep any reader interessted. This book will make you think, use your imagination and have sympathy for the main character. I would reccomend this book to everyone, especially those who are big fans of all the Frankenstein movies."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Overall, I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed reading the novel. I was a little skeptic at first since it was written so long ago, and also because I already had an idea in my head of what the book should be like. Although the book started off slow and some parts tended to be very drawn out, it began to pick up towards the middle and it became much easier to read. I liked how the author allowed us to see from the creature's perspective and were able to sympathize with him. This was my favorite part of novel because it makes you want to find out what happens in the end. The novel can definitely be related to society in the way that people that are not considered the &quot;norm&quot; are treated.

Although, many times i found my mind wandering to other things. It was somewhat slow paced, and at times very boring. I felt Mary Shelly left out some things that perhaps should have been discussed in order for the book to be a little more interesting (ie. how the monster actually came to life). Even though the story was short, and unbelieveable i did however like how she made the monster a product of society- everyone hated and feared him, therefore he hated everyone else. He could have been good, and lived a (somewhat) normal life. The story has a deep meaning to it- it just took M. Shelly a long time to bring it out. I would recommend this book if you like science fiction."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein was pretty good.

At all times Shelley is able to hold the reader in suspens and then jump into vivid details about the accounts of the story and the journey of Victor Frankenstein and his creation. I would not consider this to be a horror story as much as it is a drama story with its fair share of action. Shelley also lets the reader gain a personal attachment to each of the characters in the story by enclosing very detailed descriptions of their physical and personal attributes. As the story progresses the reader can begin to sympathise with the characters which creates a rising interest for the duration of the novel. Because this book has many different scopes that can be examined and critiqued, I would highly recomend this book to readers from 7th grade on up through professional levels of literature. One of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Published in 1818, Mary Shelley's best-selling novel Frankenstein has become famed and celebrated annually as thousands of children dress in various monster garb for Halloween, depicting themselves as Dr. Frankenstein's creation. Although Shelley's story is sometimes slow and explicitly focused on minor details, the work presents many issues that are still being analyzed today in literature and society. This is a testament of the timelessness of this great book.Like other authors of the time, Shelley comments on the innocence of childhood when Frankenstein says, \\"I feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood, before misfortune had tainted my mind, and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self.\\" Frankenstein's childhood was something that was precious and dear. This thought has remained popular in current literature. For example, in the television show Ed, the main character has this to say about the early days:\\"Explain to me why we're always so condescending towards our younger selves. We should be looking back in awe of who we were...all that passion, all that fire, all those dreams. And then it all fades and people say, \`Oh well, that's just part of growing up.' I think that's tragic.\\"The fascination of the idealism of children is still quite popular, not only in modern sitcoms but in blockbuster movies like Big or classic fairy tales like Peter Pan as well. Although Shelley does not fully explore this matter, she addresses an issue that still gains press today.Another theme of Frankenstein is equivalent of the modern day sociological issue of nature versus nurture. The creature begins his life full of love and cannot even conceive of why someone would murder another person. But as he faces constant abandonment and bitterness, the creature turns to acts that he once could not imagine. Placing the blame on his nurture, or lack thereof, the creature exclaims, \\"I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all human kind sinned against me?\\" Shelley's answer to these questions is not all too clear, although the fate and doom of Frankenstein sends a message that the scientist was partially at fault. But the answers that the creature would get in modern times are lucid and concise.A final issue that is still prevalent in society is mankind's attempt to govern the physical world through science. The results of Frankenstein's experiment indicate that Shelley strongly believes that man should not try to play God. Stephen Hawking is currently trying to unify physics, or combine the theory of relativity with the theory of quantum mechanics. Others try to clone life using DNA. Hawking recently said, \\"\\"If we find the answer to [cloning or the unification of physics,] it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we would know the mind of God.\\" Like Frankenstein, scientists are still trying to discover the mystery of life, and Shelley's commentary on this absorption is appropriate even today.This book is slow at times but in the end worth the read."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Finally, a classic novel that keeps your attention from beginning to end. I think what makes this novel so great is that it is so different then what you originally perceive the story to be about. It's nothing like any of the movies that Hollywood has created over the years. As you read, you find yourself completely in tune with everything that Victor Frankenstein feels. Sometimes it seems as if the story starts to just drag on, but just at the right moment, something new happens that grabs your attention and rekindles your interest! While writing this novel, Mary Shelly left out what seems to be some very important details. This, at first, may seem frustrating! But as you read on, you realize that it only gets the you to use your imagination to create parts the parts of the story that are missing. This actually seems to make the story a little more dramatic and scary then it would have been if Shelly had filled in all the blanks for you. There are some very interesting things going on in this book if you read between the lines. While reading, you must ask your self various questions about why Victor decides to create the monster and is there a connection to this and the death of his mother? I won't spoil any more for those of you who have not read this book yet. All in all, I was very impressed with this book and really enjoyed reading it. It is by no means, hard to follow or understand. I believe that anyone who reads this book, will enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I bought this recording so that I could introduce my seniors to the Romantics and I really am pleased. The actors who portray the main characters all do an excellent job bringing to life a book that could very well be hampered by the limitations of audio.Also, it was nice to show my students that their concept of Frankenstein is decidedly not the real story. The recording does a wonderful job of reflecting the major philosophical statements that Mary Shelley wanted to express to the reader.If you are going to share this with a class, it would be a good idea to connect the ideas of education, as well as the Promethian connection. Not only does the story make a connection between Frankenstein and the daemon's education, it provides a connection between Shelley's education and that of the daemon's. I feel that one of the strong points of the book is the feminine interpretation of education (not necessarily a feminist viewpoint of education). It is important to expose high school students to women writers who express strong ideas and transcend diaries and letters to their daughters.That said, I have two minor complaints:1: The audio level is not evenly balanced. I found myself turning up the volume to allow my students to hear the important dialogue and turning it down because the voices were instantly too loud. Alone this would not be a problem, but in groups it certainly was.2. While the music fit the mood of the story, there wasn't enough of it for my taste. I would have liked a bit more to punctuate some important moments.If you want to listen to this alone, while sitting quietly, this is a wonderful experience. However, if you want to have a group to listen, be prepared for volume problems. Essentially this is a really good abridgment and reading, but the sound is a bit troublesome."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Set in remote European landscapes, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein transports her readers into a gothic tale of sympathetic characters driven by success, revenge, acceptance, and grief. A great book to have on a snow day with hot tea and a cozy blanket."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I thought that the book was good from the beginning. It starts out with people crossing the Arctic Ocean on a ship and they find Victor Frankenstein half alive on an iceberg. The rest of the book is his account of the creation of his monster and how he came to be in the middle of the ocean. He tells the people about how the fiend he created killed most of the people in his family and his best friend. He tells them how he tries to stop the monster from killing any more people by he trying to destroy his creation. I would probably read it again, even though it was a little boring at times."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"As there have been many reviews of the book and its story, per se, I will not review that but this particular audiobook version of story. The reader of the audiobook is quite good and very dramatic. There is never a dull moment. The reader captures very well the emotional nuances of all the characters, from the beast's feelings of loneliness, isolation, rejection and resulting bitterness and anger to the revulsion of those who meet him to the creator's fear of his own creation, thirst for revenege and eventual finding of permanent peace. All and all an excellent well told story that will never bore and keeps the reader enthralled through its approximately three hour length. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book embodies a lot I love in a book: moodiness, mystery, supernatural+scientific, plus a little romance.

However, if you read the book \\"Frankenstein\\" written by Mary Shelley you will see that Frankenstein is the name of the man who created the monster.\\"Frankenstein\\" is about a man named Victor Frankenstein. As he grows older, he develops an obsession with life. He has a deep passion to learn how to create life. As victor goes through college, he takes classes that deal with life. In these classes, Victor is at the top of his class.After college, Victor isolates himself from his family and friends, so he can focus on creating life.Victor succeeds in creating life, but when the creature stands up for the first time, Victor is freighted and runs away, leaving the monster alone in his lab. After a while, Victor returns back to the lab to find that the creature is gone.Mary Shelley does a great job of creating conflict and resolving it.

I wish I had read this first, because it gave me more of a feel for what was happening in the sequel, but still, it was easy to read them out of order.The original book strikes me as more of a cautionary tale for wandering men of the time period! It's hardly the \\"horror\\" story it turned into due to Hollywood magic. It was horrific, but not a horror story as it evolved into. It was a book about losing sight of what is important, about losing yourself to your passions, of redemption, of pain and longing, but really, the \\"horror\\" aspect of it is secondary in my mind.I tried desperately to figure out which character was the \\"bad guy,\\" but it turns out that there really wasn't one. Frankenstein and his creation were both equally guilty and equally victims of each other. I felt for both of them, and it was hard for me to think of the creation as a monster. I was profoundly moved by his plight, but at the same time, I wondered that he could speak so eloquently and be moved by beauty, yet could commit such crimes and feel justified. He was definitely torn, as was Victor Frankenstein.The style of writing and use of language is superb and I can't recommend it more highly. If you hesitated because you thought of this as strictly \\"horror,\\" well, don't let Hollywood's butchering of this magnificent story deter you. There is more here than meets the eye and it's worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"English teacher. Couldn't wait to get this book.

His goal is to create a human out of sewn together parts of corpses. When the creature comes to life Victor instantly regrets his progress. His creation is a hideous monster that Frankenstein fears. The remainder of the book documents Victor's exploits in trying to capture the monster and conquer his fear and depression. Throughout the book the reader gets to hear the story from several different perspectives: a captain of a ship on a voyage to the North Pole who runs across Victor on the ice, Victor himself, and even the monster's side of the story. The end of the book is quite bleak and very depressing, but the idea discussed is one to think about: When does science go beyond morals and ethics into cruel punishment?There was everything I love to be in a book in this book: mystery, a little bit of romance, and a great adventure. I love the way Mary Shelley keeps her audience reading by not revealing anything until the right time. The reader begins to question what is about to happen in the story and reviews all the possible outcomes of the situation.The only drawback with this book is that the vocabulary of the characters is very sophisticated. The book is beautifully written, but some parts are difficult to understand because of the language used.This book is a great piece of literature with action, adventure and suspense. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good adventure.Elizabeth EdmondsonLandrum High SchoolLandrum, SC"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The book, Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, really surprised me. I thought it would be a boring book, with language I didn't understand, and a plot I couldn't get into. But let me tell you I was WRONG. Yeah, it did start a little slow but once you got amerced into the plot of the creature and Frankenstein's hatred for one another, you couldn't really say you had enough of it.In this book it starts off with letters from a boat captain to his sister, then we get to see Frankenstein's story, inside that is the creature's, and inside that is the story of the family in whom the creature watches. In other words, a big giant story sandwich. The tone of it could get a little boring and bleak but what was actually going on could never be. From all the deaths in the book it could be labeled a tragedy, but the tragic part was how the creature actually loved Frankenstein and blackmailed Frankenstein, so he, the creature, wouldn't be lonely. But when Frankenstein dies, so do all of his dreams of a loving life.But I agree this is still a sci-fi book, but with the plot twists of a tragedy.Faith HowellLandrum High School"},{"Title":"Frankenstein (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"for the people who hated this book and gave it poor reviews. Really missed out on what may be the greatest novel of all time. For me it's hard to put down. And the themes are deep and everlasting ones that humans will forever struggle with. Life and death, God vs science, good and evil, spiritual themes, and social ones also, all wrapped up in a GREAT story. Oh well, you can't expect everyone to get it and resonate with it.One thing about this Rieger version: it says it \\"reproduces for the first time in more than a century the text of the first edition published in 1818\\". Not true. Donohue produced at least three editions (I have them) around 1895 that are all the 1818 text.Just an FYI.Believe the hype! This book is hard to surpass.

What made him turn on his progeny?And, we also are let right into the mind of the creature, who, abandoned, makes his own way in the world, rejected, scorned, feared. How does he survive?
