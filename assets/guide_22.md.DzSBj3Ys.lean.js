I snapped it up and devoured it. This was the first time I had ever had access to these legendary pre-1950s Dick Tracy comic strips, and I kept hoping that more books like this would come. As it turned out, one did follow a decade later, covering the first two years of Dick Tracy (The Thirties, etc.), but none followed that one until the current comprehensive series of books. I'm now going on age 65, and I guess it was worth the wait, but boy! That was some wait!There has always been a real downside with this book, and now that the complete strips are being published, this book is definitely obsolete. That downside is the fact that none of the Sunday strips is included in it. Therefore, there are major continuity gaps in the story, with the reader feeling frustrated about missing something every six strips. In fact, some of the stories end prematurely, e.g. The Brow appears to be heading off to jail in this book, whereas his real end comes when he becomes impaled on a flagpole (American flag flying from it -- very symbolic and graphic!). It's nice that the daily strips about The Blank have been colored in this edition, but once again lack of continuity ruins it for me.My suggestion is to buy the current series of the complete strips and forget this relic. Starting with the upcoming Volume 7, the very best of the Dick Tracy strips will be published. These editions suffer from lack of color and small images for the Sunday strips, but they are complete!"},{"Title":"The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy, 1931-1951","review":"I searched high and low for this book until I found it for sale on line through Amazon. I first read this collection of Dick Tracy comic books at the age of 10 and have been hooked ever since. Reading through it a second time was even better because I now had a historical context to enjoy some of the references and greater awareness of some of the unfortunate racial stereo-types sometimes depicted. The cases include criminal minds like Flat Top, Pear Shape, Gravel Gerty & BO Plenty, The Blank, 88 Keys, Jerome Trohs & Mamma, Little Face Finny, The Mole, The Brow, Breathless Mahoney and Mumbles.

With rare skill and inventiveness driven by a personal fire, this comic blazed a new trail in subject matter. This book contains some of the greatest stories of what mystery luminary Dashal Hammit called the first modern police procedural stories.In this book, you will enjoy classic tales like Tracy's first story as well as his cases against great villains like The Blank, 88 Keys, The Brow, Mumbles and Flattop. However, I have to mention that since the sunday strips were not included in this reprint, stories in the strip's prime have gaping holes that those colour ones were supposed to cover. It is not fatal, but it hurts the collection.Otherwise, if you want to see what this strip at its best was like, then this can be a good example for you.

I came into the world in May 1938 and by the time I can recall getting hooked on the exploits of Dick, his partner Pat Patton, girlfriend Tess Trueheart the aging ham actor Vitamin Flintheart, one-time criminal and later friend of Tracy, B.O. Plenty, his wife Gravel Gertie, and their daughter Sparkle Plenty, not to mention all the assorted hoods (Flattop, The Brow, The Summer Sisters, The Mole, B.B. Eyes, The Blank (no face), Breathless Mahoney - played by Madonna in the later film - 88 Keyes, Larceny Lu, and many many more), they were entering about their 17th year.Now, thanks to this great book, edited by Herb Galewitz, with an introduction by Ellery Queen and a 19-page interview with creator Chester Gould, I am able to go right back to the roots of this long-running newspaper strip. Combined with another great volume titled The Dick Tracy Casebook - Favorite Adventures 1931 - 1990, the 99-issue comic reprints by Blackthorne Publishing (Dick Tracy Monthly - issues 1 to 25 then Weekly - issues 26 to 99) which got under way in June 1986, augmented by the 4-issue series \\"The Unprinted Stories\\", the 4-issue \\"Special\\" including one dealing with \\"The Early Years,\\" the one-shot Dick Tracy in 3-D, and the one-shot issue from Gladstone \\"The Original Dick Tracy - vs Mrs. Pruneface\\" - I pretty much have my fix of the most famous newspaper strip detective ever."},{"Title":"The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy, 1931-1951","review":"I too was a long-time fan of Dick Tracy ,who at age 18 got a copy of Celebrated Cases...for Christmas.

On top of that,the editor ended not one but two of the greatest sequences (Brow and Flattop) prior to their actual conclusion.Each continuity went on to have a slam bang ending that the reader does not get to see.

The book was a great nostalgia trip!"},{"Title":"The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy, 1931-1951","review":"Yes, I admit it. I am a Dick Tracy fan. I loved the old serials with Ralph Byrd, and I was captivated by the garish sophistication of the Warren Beatty extravaganza. But most of all, I liked the comic strips, with the stark yellow-and-black designs, the x-ray diagrams, the cross sections, and the arrowed labels of significant clews and objects. At least once in a single storyline, the villains would put Dick in a really tight spot-- dipping him in paraffin, breaking his gun hand, stabbing him with a lightning rod, pushing him out of an airplane, handcuffing him inside a truck and setting it on fire-- but he would always find a way to escape. And eventually, he would always give his own back in return.I never had much use for the television show, because it would recycle villains much in the manner of _Batman_ or _Superman_. But in the original strips, most of the villains (no matter how colorful) eventually come to bad ends by death or disfigurement. (Though there were a few like B.O. Plenty and Gravel Gertie who eventually reformed.) This is in keeping with Dick Tracy's oft-repeated motto: \\"Crime does not pay!\\"The downfall of the villains was usually in part the result of Tracy's methods of detection. But there was usually a certain element of Grecian ironic fate that came into play as well. One gangster, for example, who dealt with black market tires during the 1940s, was dragged to his death at the bottom of a river by an old tire from a garbage scow.Chester Gould's _The Celebrated Cases of dick Tracy_ (1970), with an introduction by Ellery Queen is a sampling of Dick Tracy adventures from 1931 through 1949. Perfectionists may complain that some of the episodes are not complete and that other favorite cases were omitted. But this is inevitable in a single volume collection that spans almost twenty years.Tracy's first case is there, in which we are introduced to Tess Trueheart and her family. The central villain, Big Boy, is really a fairly stock gangster. But we quickly move into adventures with The Blank, Jerome Trohs and Mamma, Little Face Finny, the Mole, B.B. Eyes, 88 Keyes, Flattop, Gravel Gertie, B.O. Plenty, Mumbles, Breathless Mahoney, and Pear Shape. Once Gould's villains became colorful grotesques, his strip developed into a vivid morality play.Recommended, though I will admit that there is violence that even today may be a bit unsettling."},{"Title":"The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy, 1931-1951","review":"This book collects the strip from when it was started during the depression, through the war years, and into the early post war. The cast of characters, the story lines, and settings provide insight into an era fading from memory. It's a morality play from a simpler though poorer time the country is nostolgic for. Good and evil are black and white. Innocents are led astray by cold hearted killers, shown the error of their ways, and forgiven. The storys take place in a time during which the US went from facing the greatest hardships it had known to finding itself a superpower. It was physically a different country, heavily industrial, agricultural, without television, linked with railroads instead of interstate highways. Dick Tracy was the prototype of today's tough, smart cops, MacGyver and CSI in a time when a cop had little to rely on besides his own eyes and brain. He always got his man - if he (or she) didn't earn some horrible end first. Crime doesn't pay.

They are the words we would expect our students to know by the time they are in the upper-level classes, whether at the high school level (or, I suppose) the university level. One of many attractive features in this book is the specific information given for each word: verbs have the entire form in all the tenses clearly written out, nouns have the spellings of the plurals as well as the various endings needed for the cases, adjectives have the spellings for the comparative and the superlative. Besides the amusing drawings to illustrate some vocabulary, idiomatic uses of verb-preposition combinations are elaborated upon. Stress-marks are used on all words to assist in the pronunciation of the vocabulary. The layout is clean and unclutterd, with one column on each page, the key words in green and the whiteness of the paper lends an overall crispness to the appearance. Unusual additions to a dictionary are found at the back of the book where a map of German-speaking countries illustrate where the various dialects are spoken, as well as letter-writing forms, the new spelling rules, and the various farewells found in the German-speaking areas.

Consequently, some definitions are defined using words *not* found in the dictionary. Really, it's unforgiveably careless, and has put me quite off Pons. For example, \\"missmutig\\" is defined as \\"ver&auml;rgert\\", which is not in the dictionary! Another example: \\"bei&szlig;en\\" is defined as \\"mit den Z&auml;hnen erfassen und zerkleinern\\" - you guessed it, neither erfassen nor zerkleinern is in the dictionary.

So this review should be taken as coming from such a person and not a person who has managed numerous successful project. In fact quite the opposite. I have been on numerous chaotic, insane projects. It is from this perspective that I review the book, and the methodology given forthwith.This is a great idea, and a great concept. What it is not, however, is a methodology that you cherry-pick the parts you like and leave the rest. Only choosing to implement some of the Scrum methodology will take your previously chaotic project lifecycle and choke the life out of your employees.In a nutshell, projects are broken up into thirty day, self enclosed cycles. Development, implementation, documentation, and testing done. Testing, that oft forgotten step in the development process. The teams are empowered to manage themselves, with only a coach along to make sure the rules are folled. One of the scrum \\"rules\\" is that you have to actually test the code in the 30 day window (all of the rules are presented in an appendix.) Customers are involved at the beginning and end, deciding what features to implement, and then implementation happens. Obviously it is more complex than that, but not by much.Will it work? I believe so, given the right corporate involvement, customer buy in, the right team, and a good deal of team self-discipline. Developers will eventually love it, and should have no problems following the rules once they understand them. The \\"customer\\" may have the hardest time, as they can only apply a heavy hand to direct development monthly, rather than daily. On the other hand, with many classic projects, the problem was that design was done for months, then development for months, then testing and documentation done by the poor unwitting users!The book is very well written. I like how he introduces the team roles, then gives good and bad examples of how they have been done on past projects. Very reasonable examples are presented that feel very genuine and real, that I as a developer for over twelve years could eaisly relate to. It isn't perfect, and there are places where the author seems almost too eager to believe that Scrum is the fix to all of the world's problems. Only one place does he seem negative, that having to do with fixed bid, fixed time contracts. I also feel that the level of developers you will need to make this work will have to be above average. Not to say it won't work without world class developers, but their motivation will need to be derived from doing a good job, not at being told what to do and just mindlessly doing it."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This book provides a simple introduction to Scrum. Author briefly explains basic Scrum concepts based on real life case studies. However this book is not sufficient to start practicing Scrum in real projects.

For example on page 88 he draws a Network Diagram and refers to it as to Gantt chart... He also very often mentions PERT charts as one of his painful memories from waterfall projects.Being such an expert in software project management Ken should know that there is no PERT chart, just the PERT technique (for estimating the duration of a task). PERT chart is a name of Network Diagram, wrongly introduced by Microsoft Project.

More importantly, it helps in deciphering the differences between it and task oriented systems management. I'm a traditional project manager in an industry not directly involved with software development but I try to read anything on project management and this is a good book to show how Scrum can work in particular situations.

Employees were happier; confidence returned to clients.The concept of scrum is the very basis of a free society: you are accountable for your work: you will be held responsible: and you set the objectives.I would never think again of running a project under any other method!"},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This book helped me understand more details about how to implement Scrum. The rules of Scrum are simple. Apply these rules in your context can be tricky. I found that the case studies that thread throughout the book really helped me to understand some of the nuances of the Scrum process.

SCRUM techniques are described and then discussed by resort to case studies, helping the lessons become more applicable to you.The end result is a good SCRUM Manual for a more experienced Project Manager or IT professional. It's not a book that's pick-up-and-learn basics - its a book on theory, philosophy, and applications for people who have been there.If you need a first SCRUM book, and want to get the most out of one book as possible, this is definitely a good choice.

I figure Scott seems to have had great success with Scrum at his place of work ([...]so any book he recommended on the topic ought to be solid. Indeed it is!The book's laid out in a series of stories which illustrate responsibilities and typical problems to overcome for the Scrum roles of Product Owner, ScrumMaster, and Team. The stories are short, concise, and followed up by Lessons Learned which cover salient highlights for the various points made in the section. Throughout the book runs Schwaber's theme of how one can use Scrum to solve any number of problems and increase the productivity of their development work.What's really nice about the book is that there are stories of failures as well as successes. Software development is rarely all roses, so it's nice to see a couple examples where things didn't work -- and a solid analysis of what went wrong in those cases.On the flipside, I'd have liked a bit more detail on constructing the sprint and product backlogs. I realize that traipses somewhat over into the realm of software estimation, but more fleshing out would have been helpful. However, there's a great example of scaling Scrum and rolling up numerous product backlogs from lower levels in to a larger backlog for a major system, so that's quite beneficial.The book's terrifically well-written, is an easy read, and is formatted such that you're able to quickly pick up the important bits of Scrum. It's a terrific read for anyone looking to bring some sensible, tailorable processes to their software development efforts."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"Teaching others the minimalist approach to software delivery. This book should be read/processed in context of the Agile Software Development with SCRUM book by Schwaber, as well as, the Enterprise SCRUM book by the same. All three craft a lens from which to view what really matters versus what gets in the way of getting work done that is useful, tested, and tangible to a customer in short bursts of time. And no, this isn't so simple as saying it's another version of RUP iterative logic .. this is actually a low-ceremony lower COA/COO, higher ROI than RUP (as said by someone who's done both now multiple times).This is a book you can pass around to anyone involved anywhere around software solution delivery streams - they read it, and get it. It provides concept explanations, real world examples and suggestive commentary .. like walking into a swimming pool on a gradient slope. My perception of the problem to solve with this book? What is Scrum and why do I care? And .. if I entertain Scrum .. what does that look like? Schwaber's book tells you about it, what it is, who's doing it, challenges, etc. Look at this book as a doorway into new space and practice. This book _does not_ prescribe how to solve all your woes.I just plain encourage the purchase of and pass this book out to others. Quick read. Concepts are face value.

The usage of examples to illustrate Scrum at work is to some extent successful, but it also has its weaknesses. The details of Scrum are not present and there are little best practices as the example projects often appear as too streamlined and simple.It also gets a little annoying that Scrum almost always saves the project and appears as a silver bullet; real world software projects are more complex than this.The book comes with a nice appendix containing Scrum rules, definitions and references to further reading."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This was the first book I bought when I was introduced to agile.

Many companies talk about a new, better way of a project planning, developments' ehgagement and other agile techniques. When trying to apply these techniques, these companies immediately hit the wall of a management looking for traditional ways they've been using for life and with a success (at least, in their estimate). This book makes a Scrum approach very clear and very compelling. You can read chapters from this book to your manager (by the way, I'm a manager myself) and move him/her, step-by-step, to the better understanding how a new approach works.Books on a market about an Extreme Programming left me with much less clarity and didn't prove compelling to my CIO. This book does an excellent job of describing a total approach and all small details you need to implement Scrum, as an excellent form of agile development.I strongly recommend this book to everybody who is tired of products \\"dead on arrival\\" and project plans (thanks, Billy, for an outstanding piece of bureaucracy - Microsoft Project) which never work as planned."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"Agile project management methodologies, for me, still seem to be a new thing - mainly because I was out of the game for so long. Looking back pre-2000 at what we used to do with Microsoft Project, GANTT charts and all that, Agile methodologies seem to be a natural progression in the way of doing things. Another 30 years and we'll have something else? A new new way of managing things.I think at the start the Agile thing was all about just trying to get away from a GANTTy way of managing projects to trying something new, or at least looking at what was working and trying to model that better in project management processes rather than trying to keep fitting the irregular shaped object into the symmetrical hole of traditional project management.But I am in a state of digression. This Scrum book. Executive summary: it's for cooks, not chefs. Scrum seems to be a well defined set of rules for how to do something, that have evolved through trial and error, and yet don't seem to have a solid academic background to the reasoning behind them. Although, that could be because I've only read this book on Scrum, and this is a book of case studies of software development projects. And again, there's something: it's about software development. I'm sure Scrum could be used for other projects, something intellectual such as a business process or documentation - but that isn't documented in this book.Something that I do like about Scrum, is the idea of having a Sprint review and retrospective meetings at the end of each Sprint. I think these are quite often left until the end of each project, if they get done at all. Navel gazing is an important part of any process, so it's nice to see it at stages through the project life cycle.So, the downsides of Scrum. Those of the unbridled enthusiasm set would argue that there aren't any, and that's a fallacy. Everything has its downside, it's a natural part of having an upside. So, one of the things that I don't like is the implied inflexibility of the process. Sure, it'll work if it's a large project with more than 8 or so developers who don't have other competing tasks or projects, but it doesn't work for us (a very small team over multiple locations, multiple projects running at the same time, etc., etc., etc.)By enforcing the terminology of ScrumMaster, Sprint, etc. and having no flexibility with Daily Scrum meetings, it can belittle the process and reduce it to nothing more that mere spectacle. I mean really, a $1 fine for missing the Daily Scrum meeting - are we adults?Scrum also suffers from the assumption that the client will be available to make decisions quickly at the end of each Sprint. This might seem a strange assumption. If the project is that important to the client you'd think that they'd want to be involved with the project. My experience is that either the client is too involved, or not involved enough, or worse still, they vacillate between the two. Managing expectation and access is quite difficult at the best of times, it doesn't help if the project grinds to a halt waiting for the client to approve what has been done so far and help decide what comes next.In retrospect as well, the idea of collocated work teams can be both a blessing and a curse. If your work requires a period of concentration, then not having management interrupt you can be great. However, being collocated with your work colleagues can server as a substitution for those interruptions. Sure, having the stimulation of co-workers around you can help you when you need it, sometimes you don't need it. This does come down to working out what kind of office space really works for you ... maybe a mix of individual hot-pluggable offices and shared caf&eacute; like workspace.So, to conclude, Scrum seems to me to be the most basic implementation of an Agile process, and that for me isn't enough. And a book of case studies doesn't sell me any more on the idea. We'll take what we need from Scrum, just like any of the other processes out there, and put them into the blender and see what we get."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This is a great book, and an easy read.

I would absolutely go back to this seller, if he has what I need."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"I came at this book from several perspectives based on my background in Solutions Sales, Project Management (traditional -- PMP certified), Contract/Vendor Management, and SQA Management.I'll briefly explain how SCRUM has helped me consider new possibilities on each of the above mentioned areas. In addition, I'll start off with a general perception of this book.If asked to sum up my thoughts in one word on Agile Project Management with SCRUM, it would be \\"REVOLUTIONARY\\"!Even though the text is focused on software development as the domain where SCRUM is applied, it's easy to see how SCRUM can be applicable to any project.SCRUM is based on a well defined set of rules and a set of roles which include a ScrumMaster, a Product Owner, and a team(s). I found it revolutionary as it works exceptionally well in complex, chaotic project situations, and it empowers a team in new ways, and forges new optimized partnering between those delivering (the team) and those consuming (the customers). SCRUM also focuses on ROI and regular prioritized delivery of business value.The Solution Sales view:SCRUM offers a new approach to bid on complex, fixed-price, fixed-date RFPs. To do this, a bidding firm would have to collaborate with the client up front, to explain the differences between between a traditional waterfall-based approach and the SCRUM approach. An enlightened client will see the opportunity for partnering in new ways with a supplier, and how SCRUM minimizes risk and increases flexibility while keeping the spotlight on business value as defined by customer's prioritized needs. Communication is based on business value, not technical jargon, which also leads to increased customer satisfaction.The Project Management view (traditional):When I studied to become Project Management Professional (PMP) certified, I learned many formalized methods for managing, controlling, reporting, and delivering on a project. SCRUM is a complete paradigm shift, but it rapidly starts to feel good. The author illustrates through numerous case studies how a project manager, now a ScrumMaster, contributes and can still meet management's requirements for information reporting and results. The text also highlights CMM KPA's and how SCRUM still ensures compliance.The Contract/Vendor Management view:Having taken a formal program in contract management and having been both on the vendor and vendor management sides of the fence, I began thinking early into the book how SCRUM would impact these areas. My thinking here ties into my earlier thoughts on the Solution Sales view -- SCRUM provides a new model of Supply Chain Management (SCM) and partnering that can reduce costs and improve results. A side effect that leaped out at me is that I believe that SCRUM could have a dramatic effect on minimizing the need to offshore delivery. By having a resident local team using SCRUM, results look so positive based on the case studies I read, that SCRUM could increase onshoring due to its rapid results (achieved within a 30 day Sprint), team/customer cohesion, and more. Offshore delivery would still be very possible using SCRUM and improve results, however, I can imagine the value of the shared space partnership between a local team and local customers at its positive macroeconomic impact as well.The SQA view:I've been a QA engineer and manager. QA adds necessary value, however, it is often seen as a policeman role, or an afterthought where quality is \\"tested\\" in. The identification of last minute defects causes angst, anger, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction. The latter often being due to great pressure to ship anyway or solutions that can't be fully tested in time which lead to customer identified defects (and costs), or bug-fix delays impact client schedules/needs.SCRUM makes testing a component of \\"doneness\\" -- embedded in a concept which SCRUM calls \\"sashimi\\" after the Japanese delicacy. In a nutshell, testing becomes everyone's job and the team partners to produce a complete result as committed to at the beginning of the Sprint. No more policeman. Instead, a committed team that works together in an optimized manner.In summary, SCRUM provides much to think about for Sales, Project Management, Software Development, Contract Management, and QA professionals. It is an exciting process that has undeniable value."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This book gives a clear explanation of what Scrum is, by one of the people who invented it.

I really enjoyed this book because it is more than theoretical. It offers real world insights into dealing with real situations. Great book. Easy to read. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"If you're just starting out looking for information about Scrum, start with this book. It's easy to read and has enough detail to answer most questions without getting bogged down."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"Software development has grown more and more complex to the point where it approaches chaos. Most approaches to it have been aimed at controlling (read, taming) the chaos. And such approaches are doomed to failure since chaos, by definition, cannot be tame. A more realistic approach is to accept chaos and learn to harness it to give you a competitive edge. Such is the message Chet Richards' fantastic little book,Certain to Win, and such is the message of this echo of Agile development processes.Mr. Schwaber has given us the tools we need to understand what Agile is and is not. He also gives us the basic tools we need to begin using Scrum for as a chaos-harnessing approach to software development project management. All the key players and their tasks are identified through the use of several case studies. Each case study illustrates, by example, key concepts in applying Scrum to project management. The use cases are gleaned from the author's personal experience and are therefore believable and real world examples and not just theory. Scrum works where other approaches have failed.Scrum is particularly suitable for engineering projects in that it focuses on people rather than processes and enhances rather than stifles creativity. It allows engineers, who are creative and innovative thinkers, to do what they do best and allows them to approach a given problem from the direction they find most efficient. It let's good problem solvers concentrate more on solving problems and less on managing processes.Though Mr. Schwaber focuses primarily on software engineering projects, Scrum is a generic approach to managing a variety of project types. The real world examples he provides may all be software projects but the concepts are clearly defined enough to be applied to many project types.A definitive work for an exciting and liberating approach to project management. A must read for project managers and senior software engineers in particular. It is at last a remedy to the dilemmas identified in Dr. Brooks'The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Anniversary Edition (2nd Edition)."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"I've been doing .NET programming for 5 and a half years now, and have practiced Agile in various degrees - all well short of what I believe Agile methodologies recommend.

I turned to this book to help me understand the roles, meetings and project artifacts that I need to introduce to truly have an agile development environment (Scrum in particular) as our team grows.This book really helped me to do just that, and also did it in a way that I found to be very intuitive.

It presents Scrum in real-world environments. It talks about imperfect real-world situations and constantly *adapting* - and how Scrum is a top-notch tool to produce results. One of the great benefits of Scrum is the CONFIDENCE it gives developers and product owners - because real results are produced every 30 days. Anyway, this book is an excellent teaching tool because it shows how Scrum can help in the kinds of imperfect projects and environments we have all experienced. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"The Scrum principle is simple. It starts with some common observations: that projects generally succeed when someone sidesteps the formal process and gets the job done anyway, and that big teams spend more time tripping over each other than typing code. Scrum starts with the radical idea of announcing that we're going to do what we were going to anyway, then mixing in big handfuls of eXtreme Programming.This is a good second book. It attends less to the basics of running the team and working with the customers and corporate surroundings, although Schwaber does present all those basics. Instead, the focus is on case studies, especially ones that look like bad matches to Scrum management style. I like that emphasis: typical methodology books assume perfect compliance with fragile or rare prerequisite assumptions, then wash their hands of any circumstance that doesn't meet their delicate needs. This is a good bit more realistic - it's about the whole concept of cut-and-fit to get the most out of Scrum despite unfavorable situations and stakeholders.Late in the book, Schwaber makes the point that people will do whatever they're rewarded for. However obvious this sounds, it's an ongoing source of corporate inanity. Suppose that percent of the code covered in testing is a major goal: programmers will dutifully eliminate handling of exceptional conditions or invalid preconditions for which tests are hard to generate (NOT an improvement). Suppose reduced development time is rewarded: watch testing time plummet and bug counts soar. I agree that progress must be measurable, and agree at the top of my lungs that the wrong measurements are worse than none at all.Still, one theme comes through again and again: that, when the going gets weird, typical practitioners will rapidly find themselves in way over their heads. He, with more experience than any other Scrumster around, exerts the limits of his creativity to get past problems of fairly ordinary kinds (like intrasigent management). It's certainly a good recommendation for his consulting services. It's just not a message that a novice wants to hear. I have the strongest reservations about his fondness for bullpen office environments, as well.There's good to be had here, I'm sure, but I'd have to see Scrum in action before I could really internalize the way it's meant to work.//wiredweirdPS: It's just an amusing typo, not a deliberate act that \\"the ... team was going to use Scum [sic],\\" p.64"},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"While this book isn't a technical step by step exposure to the Agile Scrum project management path, it is a great reference with written example.

Scrum is quite likely the best starting point for most companies interested in pursuing an agile development process. The readability and excellent anecdotes in this book make it a fantastic starting point for any journey into agile development.I loved seeing how Schwaber applied Scrum in many varying situations. Rather than introducing each case study one at a time, the book is organized around key areas. Multiple anecdotes are given for each key area. Throughout each chapter, Schwaber brings the anecdotes together in Lessons Learned sections and the chapters conclude by helping point out the conclusions we learn to draw from the anecdotes.I appreciated that Schwaber was not shy about mentioning projects that didn't go perfectly-including one he got fired from for being too zealous in his role of sheepdog guarding his flock of developers.Although this book is ostensibly about software development, Scrum has its roots in general new product development and can (and has been) applied to a wide variety of development projects. A problem with a process like Scrum is that it is best learned by \\"feeling it\\" rather than being told about it. There are many subtle differences between Scrum and a more command-and-control management process. Learning Scrum by reading a book filled with examples like this is the best way to get the feel for how to use it on your own projects."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"Reading this book won't turn you into a ScrumMaster- only experience with a few projects will do that- but this book really has all the information you need to start to implement the Scrum agile methodology in your company or department.I've been trained in two seperate PMI-certified methodologies, and both have been complete failures in my organizations. The response, of course, has been to bring in a third methodology. The real reason for the failures has been that traditional project managment as it is usually practiced is designed to fail. It encourages the creation of fictions that live a seperate existence form the actual project, with due dates dictated from above, and project schedules fudged to meet due dates rather than actual resources. In my own organization, we had a typical example of what happens in traditional \\"waterfall\\" development: A massive project to replace our main administrative system was ticking towards a June delivery (according to the detailed MS Project charts) and then, 30 days prior to delivery, it was announced that the delivery date had been pushed back an entire year!This can't happen with Scrum. Scrum reflects what's really happening in a project, and it encourages incremental development- prioritizing requirements, and delivering them in their order of need, instead of trying to deliver a complete project with every single componant at a certain date. It's also one of the least onerous of methodologies. As a Scrum Master friend notes, \\"It's the simplest methodology you can implement that will actually deliver results\\".It does requrie some changes in how things are done in the traditional organizations. Scrum project managers don't assign tasks and track performance on each task; instead, they assign goals and the programmers report on progress and any difficulties they many encounter. There's a daily stand-up review to report on progress and roadblocks and monthly reviews to reprioritize and review changes in scope. The result is that the project continually is driven by the needs of the customer as they evolve, and not by arbitrary goals in the distant future.If I've piqued your interest in Scrum at all, get a copy of this book. Better yet, order copies for all your team members, too."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"When co-workers see this book on my office shelf, I inevitably get one of two reactions. The most common one is \\"Do you really want to take advice on project management from Microsoft?\\" The answer is probably not, but this book was written by the co-creator of SCRUM, and published by Microsoft press, so it's not exactly a recipe-book from Redmond.The second reaction I get is \\"I was at a company/on a project/reported to a boss who used SCRUM and it worked really well.\\" After reading several books on the subject and applying the lessons, I can see why. SCRUM has been the most useful project management method I've tried so far on my software development projects.Since the goal of traditional project management is to standardize a known process to produce a required result, it has always had problems when applied to the creative process of producing software. This problem is only multiplied when the software to be produced is web based and consumer oriented, throwing a multitude of marketing and usability issues into the mix, making the desired end product as uncertain as the process. SCRUM is an ingenious solution to this problem; instead of trying fruitlessly to predict the future in the form of a project schedule, SCRUM emphasizes development as a continuous process that can be controlled using the same empirical feedback mechanisms of visibility, feedback, and adaptation that are already used to good effect in the manufacturing industry.In this view, the team is a machine that constantly produces features as output. That output is inspected by end users, who then provide feedback, which is then incorporated into the next round of development. The book details the organizational roles and responsibilities needed to set up this machine and the processes to keep it running.I found this book to be considerably more reader friendly than the original book by Schwaber detailing SCRUM. (Agile Software Development with SCRUMThe emphasis on case studies rather than theoretical discussions certainly helps keep the discussion grounded, but more than that the text is more coherent and better written. Whether this is the effect of more experience or a better editor is hard to tell.The three roles of SCRUM are the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Team. The first two are single person managerial roles that are responsible for requirements definition and maintaining the process. The Team, however, consists of everyone who is assigned to do work exclusively for the project, and in Schwaber's conception it is to be completely self-managed. Now that I have gained some experience using SCRUM, I have to say that this is both the most challenging aspect of the process.SCRUM depends on the Team effectively taking control of the product and committing themselves to delivering shippable features on a regular basis. To successfully introduce SCRUM engineers and other creative people have to be convinced that not only do they have the power to make decisions, but that it will be worth their time and effort to do so. Much of the process documented here- 30 day sprints, defined times for feedback, and so on- seem to exist to help insulate the team from those who would interfere with their control. But getting a team to the point where it is functioning at such a high level requires more than just giving an assignment. It requires either a fortuitious mix of personalities and culture, or time and nurturing. Know which one you are signing up for before you start.There is a lot of other good advice in here as well, and I found it very helpful in taking the first steps towards a more agile approach to project management."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"I generally like this book, and find it's content helpful. However, the examples chosen for the book focus on \\"broken\\" situations that seem to go beyond just project management and development methodology, and demonstrate that somehow magically, Scrum saves the day.While I like the optimism and positive-thinking these examples encourage, it doesn't match reality. When I walk into a messy, complex situation, apply Scrum, and the world doesn't turn to pink roses, I'm left wondering if I did something wrong...I'm frustrated...I'm angry...I'm confused. The examples setup an expectation of outcomes that is too high to be reached generally, and I think some examples of failures and lessons learned would have rounded out this book much better.In the real-world, \\"perfection is the enemy of success\\" and I think that's what I find missing from this book. All of the outcomes represent a perfect implementation of Scrum to solve the problem in the example."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This book is a sales pitch for agile project management, not a book on how to use it. There is chapter after chapter with the same format. 1) describe long list of problems company has, 2) implement agile 3) magic happens. There is a small amount of information on agile and how to use it."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"This is a good account of Scrum practices as used \\"for real\\" in several case studies, plus some general evangelism and two very useful appendices on Scrum rules and terminology definitions.I do think it has become somewhat hard for Schwaber to imagine what it is like NOT to be familar with Scrum, as it is so deeply embedded in his thinking and practice! For instance, he uses the term \\"sashimi\\" early on without bothering to define it in Scrum terms - that comes later (Hence the 4 stars instead of 5. Would really like to give 4 1/2.)His other book \\"Agile Software Development with SCRUM\\" has more in-depth coverage of the subject. It includes a fuller account of the essential difference between defined and empirical processes which is at the heart of Scrum and other agile methods. In this one, he does include the same reference to the (hard to find!) industrial engineering textbook that explains this, but in a more offhand way - just quoting a key paragraph a couple of times.Perhaps the best sequence of reading depends on your role. If, like me, you are a developer, the first book is, I think, more rewarding for in-depth study and relationship to Agile principles in general, while this one is a good follow-up on implementation realities. For a manager wondering whether Scrum deserves exploring, this book will give a strong (positive) answer to that question, and can be followed by more in-depth study with the other book."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"I found this book to be an excellent introduction to the subject, however it was sparce on details and practical application. There were a lot of the author's experieces which I thought were useful dos and don'ts. I really expected more details on how to implement Scrum and was disappointed at the lack of real details."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"Excellent, easy to read anecdotes of what works and what does not work with Scrum and how to over come obstacles for implementing this framework when there is resistance"},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"I read this book right before attending the Scrum Master Training.

It addresses common mistakes and misinterpretations with examples. It also shows how Ken fixed those scenarios.

For the former this book provides a solid foundation for Scrum terminology, practices, and value. Through consistent utilization of real-life case studies in a variety of environments, the author is able to show how Scrum was implemented to reap business and IT value while also showing some stumbles along the way. These case studies will be of particular importance to the latter group mentioned above as the specifics can either help to get your implementation \\"un-stuck\\" or at least provide some thought around the differing ways Scrum can be utilized.As the author of this book is also the co-developer of Scrum, one might think that the case studies and ascribed values might be coming from too biased a source. There is no question that Scrum takes on a bit of an omnipotent air in this text. However, after myself questioning Scrum's potential value in a particular circumstance, I was gratified to find the author admitted (although without strong conviction and in the appendix) that Scrum might not be the best technique to handle this.Cheerleading aside, this book in an excellent read to better understand the power of Scrum and its place within an organization's project methodology."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"Unfortunately just reading about Scrum won't result in a successful transformation of your company; Scrum is a methodology that you have to adopt, actively iterate on and adapt to your environment. For this reason, the format of Ken Schwaber's \\"Agile Project Management with Scrum\\" should be very helpful to teams in many stages of this cycle. Instead of reiterating the Agilista dogmas, Ken focuses on the key aspects of Scrum (planning, retrospectives, product owner, etc.) and provides hands-on examples illustrating how Scrum has benefited each company and how it was adapted to fit the culture and sensibilities of each team.It's a quick and easy read, filled with a lot of insights. Highly recommended it."},{"Title":"Agile Project Management With Scrum","review":"If you want to learn Agile/Scrum, this is a good book to read. The topics are well covered. Who are the stakeholders?

If you are new to the topic and want to start at the beginning, then this book is about the beginning of it, whereat to start. Rageh Omaar was there. He had been Iraq correspondent for the BBC for several years prior to the invasion, he chose not to leave and was in Baghdad throughout the shock-and-awe phase, the fall of Saddam's regime and the immediate consequences. He does not even mention the report that many will particularly remember him for: he was on the plinth of Saddam's statue in Firdoos Square after it was pulled down and the London anchorman said \`Rageh, raise you arm so that we can see you.' The correspondent, who is tall, walked across the plinth waving as he walked, and the sense of authenticity was unforgettable. He left for a while to see his family, but he went back, and his postscript offers his own assessment of what it all amounted to.This book is in the best tradition of BBC reporting. Facts are paramount, and the occasional inferences are strictly related to his observations. He not only saw, he listened as well. Rageh Omaar speaks English in the impeccable tones of an expensive English education, but he was born in Somalia and speaks Arabic, several dialects of it, apparently. He was able to converse with Iraqis and he lets us know what they said without either interpretation or embellishment. He does not lecture or preach or moralise, and if he does not give us much in the way of hypothetical \`better news' that I have heard the BBC accused of not reporting, it is quite obvious that this is because there was next to no better news to report. THIS is what it was like, and this is someone who did not have to rely on second-hand opinions.He describes some early bombardment of civilian areas by the coalition, as well as the coalition bombing of the HQ of both Al Jazeera and Reuters, the co-ordinates of which were known to the coalition forces. He quotes coalition allegations in this context about \`human shields' purportedly used by the regime, but in these cases there was nothing of the kind, nor does he ever mention any others. (I should say that he was no enthusiast for Saddam's regime, which he depicts as being one of thugs and gangsters.) He is particularly enlightening regarding the looting that followed immediately on the air strikes. Ransacking of the luxurious apartments of members of the hated regime was one thing, but the wholesale vandalism was something else, and too organised, he says, to have been anything except a pre-planned scorched earth policy. He cites the coalition protection of the Oil Ministry and Ministry of the Interior while the rest was neglected as a glaring error, and he traces the start of the Iraqi public's disenchantment with the occupation from that gaffe onwards.There is, naturally, a good deal about the life of a reporter in such conditions, and it is highly informative in its own right. However this is an Arabic speaker, and the best things of all are his reports of what \`ordinary' Iraqis told him. The picture that comes across is of a people repressed by a brutal and sadistic regime who briefly entertained hopes of genuine \`liberation', hopefully leaving them to run their country as they desired. The number of ways in which we find that to be not the case are more various than perhaps we realise, and any reader who gains an overall impression of brainwashed ignorance, arrogant dishonesty and doublespeak, and downright incompetence on the part of the occupiers will have no trouble in gaining it, but this reporter is too professional and self-controlled to spell it out (if it is even what he thinks).After a short absence he came back, this time starting in the south at Basra and some smaller locations. As before, he is first and foremost a reporter, but this time he offers rather more analysis, and it is mainly analysis of a catalogue of errors, pre-eminent among those being Bremer's almost incomprehensibly stupid policy of de-Ba'athification. At the start, Rageh Omaar had described in thoughtful detail the disastrous impact of the UN sanctions, that followed by the dissolution of the army which turned loose a whole population of unemployed, dispossessed and humiliated citizenry, resentful, vengeful and armed. Now here was Bremer consummating this process of total annihilation of the state apparatus which had always been relied on by the people under Saddam but whose fundamental importance to them had been immeasurably increased by the sanctions.It's not clear to me how any significantly different picture could be obtained by any fair-minded and attentive reader, but that's my own view and it may not be yours. However you see it, check your basic understanding of what actually happened from this book, and see how other versions hold up against it. It doesn't get more honest than this."},{"Title":"A Survival Guide for Frontline Living: Working Out God's Calling - Wherever He's Placed You","review":"Having read the Street Children of Brazil a few years ago, I was so inspired by Sarah and her work that as soon as I knew there was another book, I was very interested to read it.

This small book remains one of the most readable and compelling accounts of life on the rough and rugged Texas frontier among the famed Texas Rangers in the 1870's. With a foreword by the noted western writer J. Frank Dobie, and an introduction by current day historian Stephen L. Harding, author N.A. Jennings recounts with clarity and intensity his first-hand experiences as a young easterner who comes to Texas to find his fortune. What Jennings actually finds is adventure beyond description in a land that abounds in beauty and majesty while frought with danger and hardship. The author's depictions of real-life events along the Texas-Mexico border are told in first person and include his recollections of fights at Las Cuevas and run-ins with such outlaws as King Fisher, John Wesley Hardin, and Sam Bass. The reader, through the eyes of this talented writer, is offered a look into the action-packed old West. The book serves to accentuate the impact that the daring and hearty young Rangers had in ridding the frontier of Mexican raiders and the lawless riffraff that found its way to Texas in the mid-nineteenth century. While A Texas Ranger makes an interesting read, the book itself is not without controversy. Famed Texas historian Walter Prescott Webb characterized the book as one that &quot;abounds in errors and misrepresentations.&quot; However, Jennings fully acknowledges that his book, written some twenty-five years after his experiences in Texas, is based largely upon his recollections of events at the time and is adequately footnoted throughout. From this reviewer's perspective, A Texas Ranger is an interesting and engaging story, one that most readers will have a difficult time in putting down."},{"Title":"A Texas Ranger","review":"This book must be taken with a \\"grain of salt\\", as apparently it is loaded with fictionalized accounts, and mistakes.

The story alternates between two narratives of the protagonist Lucia: the memoir Lucia is writing about the week before the premiere of the first movie she directed, and the journal she is writing 30 years later as she lies in the hospital with an undiagnosed illness. The way it is written, however, both narratives feel like present day stories. Montero's conversational writing style makes her very easy to read, even with the switches in narrative and with Lucia's philosophical commentaries on love, relationships, and death. It is both entertaining and mildly thought-provoking. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Delta Function (European Women Writers)","review":"This book is a rare find in that it manages to evoke laughter and heartache. It can be read as a light romp, but upon reflection, the reader will almost certainly recognize and perhaps confront some of the human condition's recurring quandries in Montero's characters. Readers will connect with the self- discovery and evolution of the main character, regardless of gender. Prepare to laugh out loud and weep with this one."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"Dear Will and Ethan,I hope you read this together. To learn how someone your age had her life stolen....I won't say more except that this is a TRUE STORY. And your Nana was a baby when all this was happening.We'll talk about it.Love,Nana"},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"I began and finished reading this book today. This is an excellent account to introduce the reality of the Holocaust to children and youth. The author takes you on a journey alongside a young girl, Hana, and her brother George, as they bridge from a seemingly ideal childhood, into the terrors of being Jewish with Hitler at the helm of a war machine. The children are followed as they are ripped from their home, placed into a ghetto, and then taken by train to concentration camps. This engages the readers, having them know and love the children that are to be so brutally treated based only on their Jewishness. Jump forward several decades, and the author simultaneously tells the tale of a Japanese woman who dedicates her energies into educating the youth of Japan about the atrocities of the Holocaust. She relentlessly pursues the story of Hana, to make history come to life for the children she is teaching. This is an amazing tale of perseverance and desire for light to shine on truth. From her work, she not only educates the next generation of Japanese, she brings to Hana's life and cruel death such a strong purpose - so strong that it reaches across an ocean. This story recounts the horrific historical truths without being too graphic for the target audience. After such unbelievable sadness, (you will probably cry), the amazing twist to this true story leaves readers with a sense of hope, rather than a heavy despairing heart. Very impactful. I am grateful to be able to share these incredible lives with my children."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"As director of the Tokyo Holocaust Center, Fumiko Ishioka wanted to find a way to help make the immense tragedy of the Nazi genocide feel real to the Japanese children she was teaching. Through her efforts, she was able to secure the loan of a number of relics from various Holocaust museums, including a suitcase labeled with the name of an orphan, born in 1931, \\"Hana Brady\\". This suitcase captured the imaginations of the children, so Ishioka found herself searching for more information about Hana and her fate. Her search would take her to Europe and would ultimately connect her to a survivor in Canada.This book is both the story of that search and the story of Hana Brady, one of the millions of victims of the Nazi atrocities. Told in alternating chapters, the stories unfold in parallel, building to an inspiring conclusion. This book would provide an excellent introduction to the Holocaust for a young reader, because it not only describes the atrocities (in an age appropriate manner), but it also shows the importance of remembering and passing on these stories."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"A true story.

This is such a touching and beautiful little book, and it's bound to move anyone who reads it. As another reviewer has noted, it will be loved and treasured by any age, from ten to a hundred. The story is fast paced and fascinating as it tells the story of a determined Japanese woman on her journey to find the story behind the name of the girl on a suitcase.Though short, the story packs a punch in it's short size. It can easily be read in one sitting, but will be remembered long after. This would be great for personal reading, for book clubs, or classrooms. I highly recommend this book. It will touch your heart."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"This book is an excellent teaching tool to introduce students to the Holocaust. The time and effort put into investigating the origins/owner of the suitcase are admirable and it was wonderful to hear the story from Hannah's surviving brother. Very well written and thought out.

This book is the result of their search for the truth.A clear, simple narrative delivers a vivid picture of what happened. It was touching to see the dedication and interest of the children and of Ms. Ishioka to find out as much information as possible with just a name to start with. Well done.I believe that this book is also suitable to readers aged 12+."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"I have read this book to my fourth grade class for the past two years. They are instantly drawn to Hana, Fumiko, and the story of the Holocaust. The minute they see the picture of Hana's Suitcase, they begin to ask all the questions that the children in Japan asked of Fumiko. They always want me to continue reading and they are so eager to find out about her story. This book has inspired so many deep and thoughtful discussions with my students. They really connect to Hana and her story and the book helps them understand what happened with the Jewish people in WW2 and why it got so out of control. The chapters switch between Hana's story and the story of the children in Japan who are learning about Hana, so it kind of breaks up some of the more difficult parts of the story with the more happier, hopeful parts. I highly recommend this book for anyone- kids and adults."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"I read this with my 7 year old daughter after watchingThe Boy in the Striped Pajamasand she/we really got into this.

I found Hana's Suitcase to be perfect for my elementary-age children. We discover Hana in a way that makes her real, especially since there are photographs of her throughout the story. This true story of a Japanese woman who tries to find out more about Hana was in itself a story; she showed great perseverance to achieve her goal of helping bring Hana's story to the children there as the Holocaust hasn't been a regularly-discussed subject in Japan. An easy read, but long enough to spend some quality time with the subject. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"Hana's suitcase tells the story of Hana Brady and the suitcase with her name painted on it. One small piece of her life that she took with her on her final journey to the Gas Chambers of Auschwitz. Her story would remain untold if not for a Japanese Curator of a small Holocaust museum in Tokyo who after being sent the case to put on display, was compelled by her child students to try and find out what happened to the little girl who had owned the case originally.Told in flashbacks, we learn about Hana Brady, her loving hard working parents and her older brother George, a middle class family living in Czechoslovakia who just happened to be Jewish. And because they were Jewish they were targeted by the Nazis, first the father was arrested, then the mother and finally the children were taken, and Hana who was then just 13 years old was killed upon her arrival at Auschwitz.However her older brother George somehow survived the Holocaust and the determined museum curator tracked him down and George Brady, now a Canadian, was finally able to lay the memory of his little sister to rest.In 2002 he went to Tokyo and met the curator and the many school children who saw in that simple piece of luggage the very essence of who his sister had been, Hana Brady, schoolgirl, artist, daughter, game player, sister, dreamer granddaughter and finally a victim of the Holocaust.A moving book for all ages, short and simple, well worth a read."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"I've read many accounts of the holocaust throughout my 68 years ...and thought, perhaps,this particular story might be a good introduction to this time in history for my granddaughter.

I read the book with my 11 year old over a few nights: he was riveted by the story in a way I've rarely seen. Other parents report similar reactions. The book is illustrated with many poignant family photos and original documents. Hana's Suitcase will greatly advance your child's undertsanding of the Holocaust and of humanity's capacity for both great evil and tremendous compassion. I've recommended the book successfuly to many others; my son's class will soon study it. Be forewarned, especially if you are a parent: you may find the final chapters impossible to read without losing your composure. It is a story of unbearable loss and ultimate healing.

She was immediately put to death, but her story didn't end there. With her she'd carried a suitcase which had followed her from her home to her aunt and uncle's house to a Jewish ghetto in Czechoslavakia and finally on to her final destination. Many years later, Fumiko Ishioka decides to open a Holocaust Museum in Japan in order to teach young people about the horror. One of the items she is sent to display is the suitcase which bears the name of Hana. Her children become adamant that they must know more about this girl, so Ishioka goes to work. She tenaciously goes to the prison camp where Hana lived for 2 years and discovers much more than she'd planned. This is the story of undying human spirit told in a way that children as young as 8, 9, or 10 can understand. Levine does a unique job of presenting the facts in a moving way without becoming mired down in gruesome details. This story will touch your heart and you will be unable to forget the story of Hana and her suitcase."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"Youngsters ages 10-14 will enjoy the suspense that Levine builds as we follow Japanese curator Fumiko on her quest to find the owner of a Jewish child's suitcase entrusted to her Holocaust Museum for a children's exhibit. Levine weaves the mystery and intensity of Fumiko's modern-day search with touching, but not overly sentimental, stories from Hana's past from 1938-1944. We begin to care for Hana and her family, while simultaneously unravelling the clues that lead Fumiko into the past.Children will enjoy the simultanous stories, which are easy to follow. Teachers or parents will love to see their children watching Fumiko at work, bringing alive the real work of historians, and bringing little Hana's legacy to life. Inclusion of Hana's drawings made in the Terazin ghetto, as well as photographs of Hana and her family in Czechosolvakia, and photos of Fumiko and her children's group, give the book something extra special. Over 60,000 people have seen the museum exhibit that inspired the book, and I'm sure that it will be millions once this book is *truly* discovered!"},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"This is a very different account of the holocaust than I have ever read before. It is a living account of the holocaust and how it still affects our lives today. This book brings the holocaust into the present by telling the story of a Japanese woman searching for a girl who was lost nearly 60 years ago. I loved this story and wonder how many more stories of survival, hope and faith we can find if we just dig a little deeper to unbury a past that is not always pleasant but that we can always learn from."},{"Title":"Hana's Suitcase","review":"Fumiko Ishioka lives in Tokyo, Japan.

How could she find out more about Hanna?The main characters in this book are Hanna, Fumiko, and a group at the Tokyo museum called small wings. The small wings are students that that help teach other kids about the holocaust.This book is set in two very different places. Some of the book is set in Tokyo. The rest of the book is set mostly in Nove Metso, Czechoslovakia. It is in the time range of 1943 to 2000.It is a really good book. It helps you realize how bad it was.

She wants the people of Japan to understand the story of the Holocaust, especially children. The children wanted to know about Hana. The book has many photographs of Hana and her family.

This happened to Fumiko Ishioka in Hana's Suitcase by Karen Levine. Hana's Suitcase is an informational book about the Holocaust and the sad story of what happened to over 6 million Jewish people.Hana's Suitcase is about a young Jewish girl named Hana who lives in Czechoslovakia with her family in the 1930's and 1940's. It is also about Fumiko Ishioka in Japan and a group of kids called Small Wings who find a suitcase from Auschwitz (a German concentration camp) with the name Hana Brady on it. Fumiko and all the Small Wings are eager to learn about Hana and her life, death, and family.Hana's story begins when she is a pampered girl who lives in Nove Mesto, Czechoslovakia. As Hitler's troops march into other parts of Czechoslovakia, Hana is barely affected. She still has all her rights and freedom. Soon after, Hitler and his troops marched into the rest of Czechoslovakia changing the Brady's life forever.Hana's Suitcase is an amazing book that I think everyone should read. It teaches us all more about history, who these people were, and the pure evil that attacked them.

Like a good pot of chilli, this books has a bunch of different spices. The alternate history angle is great, with our WW II-era counterparts shown in a harsh but truthfull light. Our 2021-era protagonists are also shown in a harsh but truthfull light, giving this book a cautionary feel. As a wise sage once said(and I'm paraphrasing), \\"When the only tool you have is a hammer, all your problems start to feel like nails\\". Twenty years of the War on Terror could bring us to this level. I was hesitant about this book at first, but when I was done, I was duly impressed. Birmingham does a great job of writing, with taut, fast action and believable characters. I never got the feeling that the characters were being written untrue to form. I also liked the sly hommages to other alternative writes (Like the agents who guard Kolhammer in L.A. named Flint and Stirling). I highly recommend this book and I am looking forward to the next two installments in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Weapons of Choice is the first of a series which begins when a multi-national (Mostly American) carrier task force in 2021 on a United Nations mission in Indonesia is transported to 1942 and finds itself smack in the middle of the American fleet heading into battle near Midway. I put off reading this book for fear that it would be juvenile, simplistic, and poorly-written. I also braced myself for a smothering and cloying \\"politically correct\\" element along with cardboard black and white characters. However the author, John Birmingham, has pulled off a compelling and thoughtful tale of what might happen if people from different times were to meet.Of course, much of the book covers the effect of 21st century technology on World War II with some very imaginative scenarios. However, this is not a story of the future riding in on white horse and bringing light to a welcoming and backward world. For one thing those in the world of 1942 thought they were doing quite well until the visitors (invaders?) showed up! What makes Weapons of Choice especially interesting and a cut above many similar books is the interaction between the people of different centuries. To put it simply, they often don't like each other much. The time travelers arrived with a destructive bang that brought death and mayhem and inadvertently undermined the war effort. Secondly, the people of 1942 find many 21st century social mores and personal behavior shocking, disgusting, and immoral. Meanwhile the 21st century people justifiably see considerable bigotry, ignorance, and crudeness in the world of 1942. Weapons of Choice appears to be written from a moderately liberal perspective (starting with the super carrier U.S.S. Hillary Clinton) which has alienated some reviewers, but the people from the future have faults too. They mean well and wish to help the Allied cause, but many are rude, disrespectful, contemptuous and vulgar at times (the women especially), and on a high horse that begs to be toppled. After all, just because mid-twentieth century people are \\"ignorant\\" and backward does not mean they are stupid and do not learn fast. Meanwhile, the Japanese and Germans are aware of what has happened, managed to snag a bit of the future technology, and are determined to use it to change what they found out is their own bleak future.Weapons of Choice does have its problems. 2021 is simply too close to our own world of 2005. The weapons and technology seem too advanced for only sixteen years in the future. Secondly, although our own society is changing rapidly, the part of the world of 2021 the multi-national force comes from seems unreasonably accepting and tolerant of diversity of all sorts. In addition, what happened to the conservatives/religious right? Has it become irrelevant in only sixteen years? Finally the writing is very good for the genre, but don't expect great literature and character development. Despite these quibbles it should be remembered that this is a only a story and Birmingham has written something that will appeal to Alternate History, Time Travel, Science Fiction, and World War II buffs."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am a longtime fan of time travel and alternative history, and this novel brings together the best of both. While this isn't the first time such an \\"accidental temporal traveler\\" tale has been written - the tradition goes as far back to at least Mark Twain's \\"Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" - Birmingham's book is among the best of the type. His pacing is excellent, with gripping action scenes and fascinating depictions of tomorrow's naval warfare technology in action. Moreover, the development of his characters belies the \\"Clancyesque\\" blurb on the cover - Clancy can only dream of writing characters as interesting as the ones in this book.What makes this book truly remarkable, though, is how well Birmingham brings off the differences in perceptions, particularly the contrasting perspectives about war. As much as the technological or social differences, it is the different attitudes and views that would stand out in a scenario like the one that he establishes. Today we fight wars that are dramatically different than we did in the 1940s, as are the goals and priorities that we use to fight them. Birmingham develops this brilliantly by imagining a culture shaped by the horrors of the twentieth century and two decades of our modern \\"war on terror\\" projected back into a time when life was based on different standards and war meant something completely different. It's his development of such an oft-overlooked contrast that elevates this book into a time travel novel of the first caliber, one that every fan of the genre should read."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a fan of books like Eric Flint's 1632 as well as Harry Turtledove's Worldwar series and Stirling's Nantucket trilogy. This new novel by Birmingham is definitely among the better books of this type of alternate history/time travel. Yes, there are superficial strains of The Final Countdown in the story, but the consequences are carried much further.The character interaction is very good in this novel. The &quot;feel&quot; of the fictional and factual characters from 1942 and their attitudes towards war, society and ethnicity is extremely authentic. I want to stress there is nothing 'politically correct' about this book, and no 1980's Very Special TV Episode-style moments. Everything unfolds organically, realistically and in a way that will keep you interested.The previous poster mentioned something about 2021 society being an extension from 2004. I think this is part of why I enjoyed reading the book so much. One can project oneself onto the future Americans since they seem very similar to Americans today. Along that line, there are two events in this book regarding allied operations towards the Japanese that will immediately ring a bell and make this future-past fantasy resonate with the present. I won't give them away, but think about the very emotional response of today's US public towards the rescue of PFC Jessica Lynch (a single prisoner!), and the current controversy over Geneva Convention interpretation and the treatment of POWs/&quot;detainees&quot;, particularly those who you know are guilty of very heinous, inhumane behavior. I don't know if the author intended to produce this sort of reaction in me, but it certainly was a good way for me to grasp the effects of the War on Terrorism on these 2021 Americans, compared &amp; contrasted to the state of mind of our 1942 counterparts.There is the requisite technogeek wish-fulfillment when future tech is used against 1942 tech, but this book is so much more than that. There are some potential problems in projected plot from the end of this first part of a trilogy. For example, it's not clear how the author will keep up dramatic tension since it looks like the Axis will have a hard time of it, even with the &quot;help&quot; they've gotten. Since I've read books with worse contrivances and enjoyed them anyway (advanced space lizards who are damn near learning disabled anyone?), I am certainly willing to await future novels before judging this.In short, if you liked any of the books of this genre such as those listed above, you should definitely try this one out, and this book could well be enjoyed by non geeks as well, due to the issues about society the book raises."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is one of the best SF books I've read in years. The plot is intense, the characters real and the alternative history seems really well done. If you are into SF or altenative history, then this book is one you have to read. Birmingham writes like a combination of Tom Clancy without the technobabble and Harry Turtledove without the turgidness. (I am a great fan of both, and so know their weaknesses all too well. ) Some scenes in &quot;Weapons of Choice&quot; are so well written that they're almost literary rather than just something else to read in the john. For a while, I was afraid it would turn into a &quot;hey, look how much we can effortlessly kill WWII Japanese with out super-duper 21st century weapons&quot; but it turns back from that kind of disappointment. In fact, I rather think the writer was doing that on purpose, to have a bit of fun with jaded SF fans. He also tosses in a couple of funny references to Turtledove's works ... Can't wait for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I read 1.5 books in the trilogy.I don't want to repeat all the justified criticisms concerning historical accuracy and incorrect military policy. What finally ended my reading was the endless repetitive 1,000+/1 battle losses of the axis forces vs. allied forces.In any confrontation I came to realize there was no suspense involved. At some point in the battle a 21st century weapon would be brought to bear or sabotage would result in an allied victory with minimal losses.No suspense, preordained outcome, repetitive gory details.I cannot recommend this series."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"FINAL COUNTDOWN is one of my favorite movies. The idea that a modern nuclear aircraft carrier (c. 1980) could go back to 7 Dec. 1941 and solve a few problems was an intriguing one. They got part of the job done but got sucked back to the future before they could really get down to business. WEAPONS OF CHOICE does not face that problem.It is set in 2021. A multinational force is off Indonesia to deal with the continuing war against terrorism. When an experiment goes wrong, the entire task force gets sent back to 1942, just before the battle of Midway. The weakest unit in the modern arsenal could single handedly win the war. If only it was that easy!Since the moderns appeared mostly in the midst of Admiral Spruance's fleet and there is a Japanese ship in the task force, chaos ensues. The 1942 pacific fleet takes a beating. As a result, even when things are sorted out, there is plenty of distrust to go around. Having Germans, Russians, Japanese as part of the modern force just exacerbates the situation and having black, Orientals and women in senior command positions just makes things worse. The Allies of 1942 may have been the good guys but they had some definite problems with bigotry. Just to complicate matters further, not all of the modern forces showed up at the same place. Some wound up in the hands of Admiral Yamamoto and the Imperial Japanese Navy.This book is well written, interesting and exciting. I found the principle characters to be less 1 dimensional than some other viewers. Some are presented in a simple but bigoted matter but then I am sure we have all met people like that.This is to be the first book of a trilogy. I eagerly look forward to seeing what happens next."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I wish it was possible to give half star marks, because I'd rate this book 4.5 rather than 5. The opening battle scene, which is awesome, does tend to unbalance the rest of the book. It powers on for well over a hundred pages, but in the subjective time line of the story covers only a few hours. When Birmingham then gets around to character building and exposition in the latter half of the novel, it feels a bit rushed or squashed. But what the hell, he's not shooting for a Pulitzer, I think he just wants to keep you awake at night, and as long as you're not completely boneheaded about some of the narrative's cultural subtext, you will lose sleep over this baby. I did anyway.Some people were dissatisfied because not everything was resolved at the end of Weapons, but it's the first of a trilogy, and possibly even more if Birmingham goes all Turtledove on us. I'll admit I would have liked more information about the murder of two characters which influences events in the second half of Weapons - again, another reason for shading him a half star - but it reads as a set up for developing later conflict. I can't say much more without spoiling the read, but anyone who's finished the book will know what I'm talking about.The last thing I'd point out, having read some of the wilder 'anti-PC' rants about Weapons, is that Birmingham earned his spurs as a humorist with his earlier books, and to me Weapons of Choice reads partly as a satire, both of political correctness and of the thriller genre. Maybe its not. Only the author could tell you. But there are some great in-jokes for alternate history fans. Enough of them in fact, that I wonder how many I missed. And the thing about an aircraft carrier called the Hillary Clinton? Come on, he had to have written that with an evil grin, although he probably regrets it now.So 5 stars from me, despite the technical flaws, because I feel that I should balance out some of the crazier one-star reviews."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It seems incredible that anyone would write a time traveler story without even giving a nod to the \\"Grandfather Effect\\".

After 5-6 pages I started feeling like I had come into the middle of a story. So I found the first book. I wasn't disappointed. I'm a fan of alternative history stories which was what attracted me. My only real problem with the story is the central event of how they got into the past in the first place. I'd have thought that the black hole or whatever would have killed them all but that wouldn't have been much of a story. So let's get past that. So here's a few whys. Why did the bulk of the fleet just happen to land in the middle of the US Navy fleet in 1941? Why didn't they all land in the same place? Why did one ship land on top of and partially in a mountain, seemingly fused together? A future ship and a 1941 ship end up fused together, with grotesque results for crewmen and furniture. Why did all the other ships arrive floating in the ocean and not somehow fused with the water? What happened to all the air they landed in?Despite these questions I still enjoyed the book and plan to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A fun reading and fascinating concept. John Birmingham hasn't disappointed again in this my second book under his authorship. The battle descriptions while enjoyable (read like a Clancy Novel) were a little long in some areas (like the first 100 pages), but the anachronistic interactions between the time travelers and residents of 1942 were not only entertaining and fascinating. The happenings and ideas from the plot line seemed very plausible and the hint of future plot directions make me excited about reading the next in this trilogy."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I generally consider myself to be an alternate history fan. I've read Turtledove and Eric flint among others. I suppose the first thing that stands out about this book is that I don't think it really qualifies as alternate history as opposed to simply techno-military thriller and using, well it's isn't even \\"really\\" time travel per se but more the parallel universe premise a la Timeline by Michael Crichton, or 1632 by Eric Flint. That said I can see where others might like this book, but me personally, I must decline. The initial premise and the first meetings of the uptimer and downtimer characters takes way too long. I'd even dare to say that with the exception of the time travel event nothing really happens in the first hundred pages. I also felt the characters were not terribly likable. I only got about half-way through before I put it down."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I thought this start of a series was a refreshing change of pace after years of Turtledove. The military & political story was believable enough and kept my interest. However I take off one star for the needlessly overdrawn sociological aspects of the book that have been mentioned already by other reviewers. If you accept the author's views, *everyone* alive in the 1940s was a misogynist and a bigot while by the 2020s (only a decade and a half away) everybody will be non-smoking egalitarians with the armed forces of the 'West' being nearly 50% women. The few men from the 40s portrayed in a positive manner are those who must 'learn' to overcome their prejudices after seeing women/minorities prove their worth in battle. It would have been nice to see at least one character from the 40s who was naturally unpredjudiced on their own, and at least one 2020s individual who secretly agreed with the older, prevailing views... or at least somebody who is relieved they can finally light up without getting dirty looks. Obviously there were different values back then, but I quickly became tired of the modern characters' pontificating and desire to ram their views down the throats of everyone else as fast as they can. Although, perhaps this isn't too far removed from America's apparent stance that only Western culture and democracy will do for the rest of the world. A scene from the book itself will probably illustrate how much this aspect of the book will bother you: two of the modern reporters are loudly discussing the sexual escapades of one of them while eating at a restaurant in 40s Hawaii, with no respect at all for the other patrons. When an elderly couple complains, the reporters basically tell them and the maitre'd to 'get a life'. Personally, I'd rather not have somebody making a big show of their sex life while I'm trying to enjoy my lunch; if you think I need to 'get a life' too then the book will probably be an entirely enjoyable read for you. All that said, I do recommend the book and it only loses 1 1/2 stars from me for these gripes."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It is not without its flaws (I agree with an earlier review in that the modern characters could have used some more personality flaws), but ultimately, I found it an interesting exploration of an intriguing idea, and am looking forward to reading its sequel. However, I would like to address both HaloJonesFan and J. Reed: lighten up! HaloJonesFan- This is not some parody of conservative fears about gender roles being upended, but a simple military thriller set in a very unique setting (I also disagree with your assessment of it as full of mindless carnage). J. Reed: calling HaloJonesFan a \\"lefty loon\\" and assuming that he is a \\"lefty-elitist\\" who feels that anyone who likes this is stupid is simply insulting and simpleminded, and calling him that will do nothing to improve his opinion of your worldview."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The new John Birmingham novel Weapons of Choice is a book most of us might at first shy away from. It is about a US-led naval task force based around the aircraft carrier USS Hilary Clinton (\\"America's most uncompromising wartime president\\") been sent back by accident from the year 2021 to 1942. There it proceeds to kick Imperial Japanese butt. The military hardware, fireworks and explosions are all the stuff from the fantasies of teenage boys who haven't discovered girls yet.The book could be read on this techno-masturbatory level, but it wasn't written by some Neocon American armchair military geek. Instead Birmingham is one of Australia's leading fringe journalists. He achieved his notoriety and fame in 1997 he wrote He Died With a Falafel In His Hand, a hilarious semi-autobiographical romp around the streets of Brisbane in search of beer, dope and the opposite sex. So has he sold out in return for a six-figure cheque from his publisher, with the promise of more where that came from milking another two books to make up the trilogy? What's the story here?What's happened in this novel is the fusion of Birmingham's style of well-researched journalism together with the laconic Australian humour of his other books, all crowded with characters he has the innate ability to bring alive with a few well-chosen words. Reviewers have hammered Birmingham for not having one central character, but that's not the deal with epics. Homer's The Iliad didn't, and like the ancient blind Greek dude, Birmingham draws drama from his characters pulling against, or letting themselves be pushed around, by events they don't understand or have control over.The future warriors are battle scared veterans who have spent the last two decades fighting the War on Terror. On one hand they have a war crimes unit that is as important to them as any of their weapons, but on the other they have the attitude of shooting first, and asking questions later.The characters from 1942 at first come across as a bunch of bigoted racists not far removed from the Japanese or Nazis they are fighting, but as the novel progresses like the rest of us, they become more then the some of their parts. All of Birmingham's characters live inside the cracks of their imperfections.The allowance of imperfection in the characters, while at the same time empathising their situations that are made clear as the story unfolds, makes it easy to suspend your disbelief. The science fiction weapons soon begin to break down, or run out of ammunition, because the characters need to use them if they don't want to die.By the end of the novel, it is the knowledge of the future that is bleeding into the culture of 1942, causing conflicts, which, by high lighting aspects of society in 1942 and 2021, allow us to reflect on our own time. Apart from writing a novel which is an exciting as it is interesting, the gentle metaphor it provides about the change going around us here and now makes it worth reading."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am awed by the authors ability to produce a book like this.

How about:\\"USS Kandahar, a Baghdad-class littoral assault ship\\" or \\"USS Hillary Clinton\\"I kept looking for F-87 Gandhi fighter-bombers and Buddha Main Battle Tanks.

Unfortunately for the author, there are still living individuals (and extensivedocumentation) from the time of WWII that completely blow his image of the past out of the water even more effectively than the techno-babble arsenal he equipped his multinational force with. Yes, there were racists, bigots, misogynists in the 1940s WWII. As there undoubtedly werein 1940 BC and will be in 2940 AD. (sorry, no PC BCE or CE) The idea that people will be very different in 2021 from those of 1940 is extremely silly. Hair styles, clothing, cars all change, but the people of 1940 are not so very different from those of present day in terms of wants, fears, failings etc. Simply looking at Cicero's (106BC-43BC) complaints about the degeneration of\\"modern\\" society demonstrates that people are people no matter their time and place.The authors future is farcical, his representations of the people living and fighting during WWII ludicrously wrong, characterizations cardboard and plot silly, overblown and derivative.

Saw a copy in the bookstore recently and bought it. Oops. I think one of the jacket blurbs describes the novel as Clancyesque, and it sure is, in all the worst ways- the uber-bitchy female reporters, the loving descriptions of weapons, and the colorfully named and one-dimensional military heroes. The author, an Aussie, appears to have little familiarity with how actual Americans talk. He also has issues with the Japanese- they're generally portrayed as inhuman fanatics, and the 21st-century characters are calling them \\"Japs\\" almost as soon as they arrive in 1942. Bottom line- if you like Clancy, Thor, etc. then go for it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"For years now I've been a big consumer of both alternate history and military thrillers - techno-thrillers I guess, if you want to split hairs and genres. I love the works of Stirling and Flint and Clancy and Eric L Harry. (If you haven't read Harry, you should. He's awesome).It never occurred to me, though, that somebody would ever combine my two great reading loves in one package. That's what Birmingham has done. He's written a high explosive military adventure inside a bitchin' alt-hist novel.I won't do the spoiler thing; plenty of others here have covered the major plot points. All I need to tell you is that i finished this baby in one day and night. I couldn't put it down until I knew what happened. Now I can't wait till the next one.

The story's background has been very well thought out, the quality of the writing is excellent and the storyline itself is an absolute hoot. The only downside is the over-long fight scene which dominates the second third of the book.While this book won't change your life (I hope!), it is a fun read and ranks well ahead of most of its' competition."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"JB, an ex-St Edmund's lad that hails from Ipswich Queensland Australia, has written a first instalment of a time slip, alternative history based novel. This is the first book of three. The broad plot in book 1 is that a muli-national navel contingent in the year 2041 (or there abouts) is off the coast of Indonesia and is part of the secret test of a potentially new weapon. That weapon is a matter transporter that aims to be able to \\"beam\\" a bomb into the desired target. No jets, no missiles, you just plug in the coordinates and send the bomb off. It's much like an \\"evil\\" transporter from star trek. However it goes terribly wrong and most of the navel fleet is sucked into a worm hole and deposited in the middle of the American battle fleet heading to the battle of Midway in 1942. Thus we have an situation of the clash of cultures with one side tooled to the max with advanced weapons and knowledge of the history of WWII and the other is pretty much prehistoric by comparison.The achievement of JB with this book is that he does not take the easy way out in anything that happens. As another reviewer stated, the temptation for a writer to engage in wish fulfilment in such novels is immense. JB as far as I can tell does not do it. It would be easy to write that the advanced military task force whipped the Japanese and Nazi's in 2 days and everyone lived happily ever after. However from the second the future task force arrives the wheels start to fall off! Sure, the Allies now have these great weapons, but they have no supplies for them, (even an advanced missile can only blow up once), they have no maintenance facilities, they have no families, even their money is useless in 1942. The allies might know the enemies' weaknesses, but as one future ship landed into Japanese hands, so do the Axis forces. The bad guys can learn from their \\"future\\" mistakes too! JB makes the characters struggle and makes life hard for them. Another strength of JB's writing is that he does not make it \\"obviously\\" topical with obvious name or event dropping such as gulf wars, Sept 11, Bali bombing. However, the future world derives from them in a logical way; in the future it is a battle between ideas.JB has a wry sense of humour and this is reflected in the names of people and naval craft. He has Prince Harry as a SAS officer, Hillary Clinton (former US President) is an aircraft carrier sort of thing. Many others are his friends or Australians that would not be recognised to people elsewhere in the world. (but where were H. Stringer or Etna/Ekna(?) JB?) He doesn't hesitate to kill huge numbers of people and takes great delight introducing some characters, getting you to connect with them, and them bumping them off!Stylistically the book is sort of written for people with limited attention spans but good memories. It has lots of short chapters and this is the major problem with the book form my point of view. I found it very hard to follow what was going on for maybe half the book because there were so many parallel stories proceeding with different people in different places at different times!The book also doesn't really finish: almost no plot lines are tied off at the end. This is not so much a problem as treatment of the problems of new arrivals with the old timers is well done. Although the allies knew how the war was \\"going\\" to turn out, that information becomes almost instantly useless and the world starts going down a new line of causality induced by the arrival of the new timers. A major sub-theme that bubbles along in the text is the cultural tension between the new timers and old timers in terms of race. 1942 was not a time of wide acceptance of non-Caucasians by Caucasians and JB deals with that well and it's not an aspect I would have given much thought about.So I enjoyed the book, and I'm reading the next one in the series. JB tackles the questions of \\"what if\\" and doesn't take the easy way out in answering that question."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a confirmed Alternate History fan I was a bit sceptical when I heard that John Birmingham had written an alternate history series. While I've read most of his previous books (a word of warning - they're VERY different to Weapons of Choice) I didn't think that this was his genre.I was wrong. While it's not perfect - the Tom Clancyesque battle in the beginning between the allied forces is a bit long and could be shortened without losing impact, the murder later in the book is clumsily presented - the book is still well done. The gulf between the task force personnel and 1940's society is very well delineated and it will be fascinating to see how both sides adjust. I'm looking forward to seeing how the taskforce is kept together against all the political pressures to split it up.For the Turtledove fans (like myself) there's a few throwaway references - a character called Harry Turtletaub and a passing reference to something being as unlikely as an invasion of lizards from outer space.I hope it's not too long till the next volume..."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"WOW - Fantastic book that looks at things in ways I never really thought of.

I LOVED it!!!Personally I'm a 1st contact, time traveler, alternate history buff and this has it all.You see a unique problem from all sides of the war and it's not only the good guys that have access to the new and future technology. Don't get this confused with the World At War series by Harry Turtledove (another GREAT work), there are no aliens in this series, however, the 2025 Task force is as alien as can be to the 1942 solders.

However, an experiment goes awry aboard one of the ships, the Joint Research Vessel Nagoya; much of the joint task force is sent through a wormhole to 1942. Most of the vessels end up in the middle of the American fleet heading to battle off Midway Island; however some fall into the hands of the Japanese.The two allied navies struggle to interrelate as the mid twentieth century one is 100 percent white male while the twenty-first century group is diverse and multiracial with a high percent of females on board. When the future force fire power comes into being along with their knowledge of the war outcome, the American navy feels confident until the reality that the crew of the USS Hilary Clinton and others has changed the future. The Japanese now sees the technological means of winning the war with the vessels they have captured.This is an exciting alternate history tale with terrific battles that military science fiction readers will appreciate. The individual cast members are overshadowed by the varying collective attitudes of the future and \\"present\\" militaries. The 1940s navy is racist and sexist while the 2021 navy has women and minority in leadership positions. Finally how the futurists see terrorism after two decades since 9/11 is subtly superb with the 1940s crowd unable to envision Twin Towers let alone jets destroying them.

Clinton, but that isn't the sum of this book's parts.Like many, I didn't care for the language of some of the female characters... but, this is a novel, so I took it for what it was worth.I think his one big glaring flaw comes from his lack of study done about the U.S. Marine Corps. There are no Doctors in the Corps... medical personnel are supplied by the navy. Naturally, as a USMC veteran, I would notice that. The author, being Australian, is completely forgiven.Birmingham tells a story that is fun to read, and will be enjoyed by people who are fans of the genre.

I bought it because it seemed that it was a much more intresting take on a bad movie I saw once.

This alternate history is one of the best ones I have read. Kolhammer and his men and women are forced to deal with a parianorid US, and future informed and limitedly supplied Axis Powers.This is a must read for techno thriller fans and alternate history fans. Battle scenes are rividing and descriptive. The characters are fleshed out and deal with the effects of their time travel in realistic ways. Plus the dipiction of the major historical figures seems right on to myself, Yamamto is the cautious planner, Himmler a scheming madman, and the more fantical Japanese shown.Pick up this book, you won't regert it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Yes, the story's been done before with Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen, but this brings in the fun of creative anachronism and culture shock thatThe Final Countdown (Widescreen Edition)sorely lacked--such as discovering that The Greatest Generation was filled with racist jerks who could care less if a black lesbian gets murdered even if she was a US Navy officer--while at the same time extrapolating on the advancement of modern military technology in our time period. It's been said that it's satirical (probably due to naming a carrier after Hilary Clinton, making Condi Rice the Vice President, and suggesting that Posh Spice becomes a noblewoman), but it's hardly noticeable; it does, however, make what I felt was a low blow againstChoosers of the Slainby sinking the Cobb-class ship USS Amanda Garrett from the 21st century somewhere off Antarctica in the '40s after the battle group gets blown back in time.

The premise of the book is intriguing, but oh-so poorly executed (which is incidentally what should have happened to the rough draft of this story). Central theme? Everyone from the past is an insular, bigoted sexist moron. Author goes out of his way to make everyone in the '40s apart from intellectuals like Einstein seem like knuckle-dragging scum, and he doesn't do much better with the cast from the future either. His explanations for various important events in the story are absent. His character development, when he bothers to do any, runs to stereotypes and blatantly contradicts itself numerous times. Also, the book was published in a large paperback size, and was not worth the retail price.I've changed my mind about this book since I wrote all this down; I no longer dislike it.I HATE IT!!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I can't help but laugh at the left-wing loon \\"HaloJonesFan\\".

HaloJonesFan needs to sit down, eat his plum pudding and go back to reading \\"Are Men Necessary\\".First, to even suggest this is some Right-wing writing is like saying Maureen Dowd writes for National Review. Lighten up. The book is VERY EXCITING, but also has its \\"bowel evacuating\\" moments. Anyone who could write a book, which highlights \\"Hillary Clinton\\" as a ...\\"Great President with a no compromising attitude towards terrorists\\", must be hanging out with Susan Estrich. That, as well as the completely perverse transition of women reporters into some troglodyte, chest-beating, blood-and-guts Rambo, did stretch reality somewhat. In addition, I have to somewhat question the veracity of the racism that permeates 1940's America. It seems to be somewhat forced into extremes at times.....but it also portrays the difficulties that would arise between a generation raised in the 21st century to one raised during the first part of the 20th century. Eye opening.Second, forgoing the Maureen Dowd\\"ish\\" reporters, I had a very hard time putting this book down. I am a fan of alternate history and this one has been one of the more exciting to say the least. The weapon systems are described with reasonable accuracy and the fight scenes, especially the initial contact between the Multinational Fleet and the US Fleet headed for Midway, were so exciting I could not get off the Stairmaster until I had finished reading it. The fight scenes are what they are meant to be....Exciting descriptions of a \\"what if\\" scenario if today's high-tech weapons were introduced into World War II and, more importantly, how history adjusts itself as each historical event is changed. The changing of any historical event will ripple out to virtually all events from that point on. This makes it increasingly difficult for our \\"future\\" warriors to look at their history books and predict the outcome of a battle since that battle may never be fought due to changes they themselves have introduced.If you are looking for an exciting read and like alternate history, time travel, and/or military fiction then this book should be on your short list.

I thought at first that his was just a leftish politically correct sort of story as the traditional-minded characters in 1942 were confronted by the ones from 2021. At the end, though, I see positives and negatives on both sides. The questions about what kind of people these are from the future, and what made them this way, are asked in a variety of ways by characters all the way from a slobbish, bigoted 1942 detective to military professionals and all the way to Admiral Yamamoto. I find myself asking them, too. I agree with some reviewers that the opening \\"transition\\" and resulting battle could have been shortened, but I personally loved the detailed 'technobabble' as weapons are described that I've previously read about only in research articles.

For example, the horror with which the 1940s characters regard women participating in combat and holding combat command positions. The book does these compare and contrasts quite well. One thing that needs development though is that few of the characters have developed much beyond a somewhat stereotypical level. You just don't see much of anyone outside of their official capacities, whether it is as a soldier, sailor, politician, scientist, or reporter. Sure, a character is homosexual (a fact that we find out rather late for the character), but what greater impact did this have on their military career or on their character? Is it truly even relevant to the story line or just a convenient plot device? This book is a good introduction to these people, but I hope that we get to know more about them as humans and not just as official titles."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I downloaded this for free to my kindle and enjoyed reading it.

The premise is twisted from the ones you may have read before:An advanced mid 21st century battle group is at war with terrorists- terrorists who have frighteningly managed to attain sophisticated weapons systems at a level only an army or navy might have. So even though the coalition forces (including the US, Australia, and England to name a few) fighting them have even more advanced weapons, it is still a struggle.Suddenly a catastrophic event sends the entire battle group fleet- and many of their enemy ships-back to the early 20th century- during World War II! Advanced ships of unfamiliar design appear in the midst of a naval battle and both sides America and Japan, not knowing who they are, fire upon the new \`intruders'.When the smoke finally clears, the WWII allies have obtained advanced weapons of unbelievable destruction: cluster bombs, guided missiles, cruise missile, lasers, reactive armor,- and even more startlingly for the 1940's soldiers and sailors- computers and information technology. But unfortunately, many of both the future coalition naval vessels and the terrorist's ships have also fallen into the hands of the Japanese and Nazis.\`Weapons of Choice' is a non-stop book of action and John Birmingham does a fantastic job of describing and explaining the advanced weapons technology which he must have culled from present day scientific journals since every element rings so true as to be surely be already on the drawing board. Every weapon seems a logical evolution of what exists today.Better yet, the characters, many of whom are actual people in the WWII era, are richly drawn and identifiable as real people-whether imagined or part of history. The author does a magnificent job of juggling all these characters and the timelines so there is never a question of what is going on. The reader quickly begins to identify with the characters and care about them and their struggles during their unimaginable journey back in time. The people from the future will never get back and have lost everyone they ever knew. In some cases they even find themselves face to face with distant relatives.But what sets this novel apart, what makes it truly one of the best time travel novels ever written is the author's attention to the social implications of such a time anomaly. Imagine if you will, the social mores and prejudices of the WWII era- the 1940's coming face to face with the multicultural society of today (which has advanced even more as the future in this novel). This is especially true of the racial and sexual discrimination that was rampant in the early 20th century. John Birmingham has created such a rich and involving social structure that the reader is lost in it.We couldn't put down \`Weapons of Choice', and whether you are a sci-fi buff or not, we encourage you to pick it up anyway. We doubt whether you will be able to put it down either."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Get the rest of the series before you start reading book 1; you won't want to wait before starting book 2 - then book 3. Dana in Colorado"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The story is a low \\"4\\" star, eminently readable with interesting interactions between the people of the era, albeit a bit stilted in places. The author has a reasonable if not overly deep knowledge of the WWII era weapon systems. Certainly enough for most people reading the story.I almost discarded the book after the \\"Transition\\" though-- there were two major flaws impossible to suspend belief on. The first was the now apparently obligatory \\"Hollywood Scene\\" every author includes in an attempt to get a screenplay. This case was the demise of the HMS Fearless. One would expect that the CIDC (Combat Intelligence/Damage Control) of the Fearless would have done -something- in an attempt to avoid the Hollywood calamity the author envisioned. Oh well, such was not to be. The other was the convenient appearance of a dive bomber that damaged the Clinton. The 1942 story starts with the USS Enterprise in \\"fog... sleet...\\" at 2239. US doctrine of the time would not launch planes from a carrier at night in bad weather conditions since it would be suicidal. Yet somehow a mystery plane bombs the Clinton (conveniently for the plot). The author slaps a pastie on this later by having the Enterprise launching planes, but to no avail, the concept is just too preposterous. The main reason these are grave flaws is that they are totally unnecessary, with a dozen paragraphs the author can fix the story up easily but simply fails to do so[1].There are other mild irritants, such as a lack of frantic concern by the XOs on logistical topics, the once again convenient and unexplained appearance of a plane just in the nick of time at the end of the story, and a peculiar inability to convert metric to English units (a big guy, 6'4\\", and 198lb (??) Hello? How about 298lb., or better yet, stick with metric!).The personal interactions keep the story readable, and I liked the dirty underbelly of society making profitable bets nearly immediately. There is so much potential material to cover that a lot of possibilities are given short shrift as one would expect.[1] For instance, with the HMS Fearless the CIDC may want to close below waterline water tight doors on the hangar level but can't because unconscious crewmen (crewpersons?) block the large main hangar door-- a command override is needed for such a case where crewmembers are threatened by incipient actions by the CIDC. But the commanders are out too, and down goes the ship due to 21st century safety regulations. How appropriate. Pity the author did not include the irony, it would even play well in Hollywood."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"One of the finest alternative history books I've ever read, Weapons of Choice is a roller-coaster with depth. Birmingham convincingly shows what those in a world influenced by 20 years of continuous terrorism might be like, and what the interaction between them and people of the 1940's would be. It may seem surprising to talk about realism in a book of science fiction, but I feel like this book has the realism of a history text book. We see the enmeshing of both technology and values, and a double window on ourselves, as compared to our fathers in the 40s and our children in the 20s. Even though Birmingham deals with a plethora of characters, each of them comes alive, and each is unique. I kept on trying to predict what might happen, and was consistently surprised.Perhaps the only drawback to the book is that Birmingham assumes the reader is well versed with various types of ships and engines of war. Conversely, the finest aspect of the book is that it doesn't make the same mistakes as other alternate history works. Many others use some sort of deus ex machina to bring a population into the past, most famously in the1632 series. Here Birmingham manages to very convincingly show how the group can travel into the past, at the same time making the process mysterious and rather unknowable.Kudos to Birmingham, who has written an engaging, informative, and above all fun book."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is the first of a series of three books. It is an original take on an alternate World War 2. Birmingham has everything under control in these three books. Characters are unique, real and very human. No superheroes here. His vision of an Alternate World War 2 is very well articulated and flawless in detail. I would highly recommend giving these books a read."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Disclosure: I'm an old friend and sometime co-author of said Birmingham. Further disclosure: sometimes he's been known to wash his underpants in the shower, by wearing them.Right, that's out of the way.I'll start by saying that on the whole, technothrillers leave me cold. There's a certain sameness to the genre -- testosterone-sweating, square-jawed heroic types saving the world for Mom, Pop, Apple pie and the right to remain silent while an endless parade of Dodgistani psychopaths and Russian ex-KGB billionaires charge froth-jawed about the stage, chewing the scenery. Yeah, right, whatever.That makes Birmo's book a very pleasant surprise. Happily, he hasn't tried to turn a tried-and-tested entertainment form into Undying Literature... but he has made every effort to create a raft of interesting and believable characters, and hang a well-crafted, well-researched storyline around them.It's an alternate history of sorts, based on a kind of \\"Final Countdown\\" incident. (Haven't seen the movie? Go look it up somewhere else) A flotilla of high-tech naval craft from the US (and allies) of 2021 or thereabout gets tossed about in time and turns up just in time to completely sod up the battle of Midway for all concerned. Cue general alarums and excursions...The good news is that far from chasing the hardcore techno stuff (which is handled quite well) Birmingham offers us much more: a real slice of the future trying to find its place in what is very much the past. How does the society of the 1940s deal with modern women, Blacks, queers, and attendant social mores? How do people from an information-based, heavily integrated world deal with the jingoism, chauvinism, racism and simple ignorance of their great-grandparents. And most importantly, how does this sudden arrival change the balance of power and the course of history in the greatest conflict of the 20th century?It makes for interesting reading. Birmingham tosses up plenty of googlies, and hits a few straight ones for six. (Yeah, I've been watching the cricket. Sue me.)

None of the books in the series disappointed me.The full \\"Axis of Time\\" trilogy isWeapons of ChoiceDesignated TargetsFinal ImpactIn this first book, \\"Weapons of Choice\\" a multinational carrier battle fleet from the 21st century is accidentally sent back in time to 1942 when a scientific experiment goes wrong. They arrive in the middle of the US fleet which would have been about to win the battle of Midway, which immediately causes some serious difficulties.A different book might have given a military unit sent back to World War II a dilemma; should they intervene on the allied side, or try to avoid changing the timeline in the hope of getting back through the wormhole without changing the past?Birmingham never gives his characters that option, as their arrival itself changes events beyond any hope of putting the timeline back in place: his 21st century characters have to make the best of the world they now find themselves in.What happens at Midway is bad enough, although the the arrival on the Western side of a 21sr century carrier battle group is more than enough compensation. But a second problem is that, while the great majority of the multinational force is thrown back as a unit and arrive together, one or two ships turn up in other parts of the world and are captured by bad guys - which for this purpose includes the Soviet Union as well as the Imperial Japanese and Nazis. Consequently both some modern technology and the knowledge of what would have happened come into the hands of all major powers in the war. Once they have overcome their disbelief, Nazis, Soviets and Imperial Japanese alike resolve not to repeat the mistakes which in our timeline consigned them to the dustbin of history.The men and women from the 21st Century face a continuing struggle both to adapt to the very difficult world they find themselves in, and to persuade the \\"temps\\" (short for contemporary) from their own side to accept such things as an African-American U.S. Marine colonel, and a Royal Navy Commander who is a half-asian woman. I would like to think that my parents and grandparents' generations would have treated members of the 21st century forces better than they are treated in this book: however, no doubt that Mr Birmingham is right that some people would have treated them well and others very badly. The captain and crew of a Japanese ship in the multinational task force have a particularly difficult time.Mr Birmingham takes the view that they, and other people in an anomalous position such as a 21st century Russian special forces officer, would regard the current rulers of their home countries as tyrants and put loyalty to their 21st century comrades before loyalty to country. However, the \\"temps\\" have great difficulty trusting Japanese and this is perhaps the worst of the many difficult problems with the multinational force have in getting on with their new allies.The action scenes in the book are very well done and make it almost impossible to put down; there is also some excellent use of humour. One of the members of the multinational force from the 21st Century is Prince Harry, who has become a Colonel in the S.A.S; throughout the trilogy there are some very amusing lines and situations involving him.None of the books in this trilogy are suitable for those of a squeamish disposition. Faced with Axis and Soviet powers who have become even more cruel and ruthless in their desperation to avoid defeat, the allies have to be almost equally brutal to defeat them. I can't remember reading a story in which the \\"good\\" guys kill so many millions of innocent people since E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's Lensman series. (Much more so even than in the real WW2, which is saying something.) Birmingham rarely goes for the easy answer and this is a series in which horrible things often happen to good people.Nevertheless, if you are into alternative history or war stories, and provided you are not squeamish, you will very probably enjoy the \\"Axis of Time\\" trilogy."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love the concept that Birmingham deals with.However...Let's just think about this for a second.The major issue of book 1 is that there is a 2020 fleet with a carrier back in 1942 that grapples with the Japanese pacific fleet and is instrumental in rescuing POW's from that theater.That carrier has several AWAC's aircraft with several thousand miles ranges and extensive loitering capabilities along with a few (albeit not a full compliment by plot device) strike fighters.Those strike fighters with precision munitions (even not satellite guided) would devastate any WWII fleet, even in port.What ship (even the final climactic event) could get close enough to damage them?&lt;sheesh>Book 2 is even worse. I'll post there in a minute."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"A United Nations-sponsored force lies off the coast of Indonesia when a science ship brought along because its escort was drafted into the impromptu force runs a test--and accidentally cascades the entire fleet back into 1942--just off the island of Midway. The local US navy responds instantly, believing that the Japanese fleet had somehow come into range and a bloody battle ensues. Resolving the misunderstanding doesn't resolve more basic issues, though. By the standards of 2021, the local Americans are hopelessly racist, sexist, homophobic, and ignorant. By the standards of 1942, the Americans and others of the future are arrogant killers (with a peculiar fetish about rescuing prisoners).Although the main fleet, lead by American Admiral Kolhammer, ends up allied with the local Americans, the Japanese are lucky enough to stumble onto two smaller and less well-equipped ships--ships that give them an idea of what they face in time for them to abort the Midway offensive. They, and their German allies, decide to learn from the future. Japan draws back from its Chinese offensive and the Germans seek to end their costly war with Russia. Given time, and the rate of weapons usage by the future fleet, they just might be able to use what they've learned from the future to develop technologies to allow them to win the war--at a minimum, they can avoid the disasters (from the Axis perspective) of Midway and Stalingrad.Author John Birmingham does an excellent job describing the near-future weapons of 2021, and contrasting them to the strikingly dumb weaponry and defenses of 1942. The real strength of the story comes not from the techno-thriller aspect of future weapons, however, but from the clash of culture between the integrated (but desenitized to death, torture, and ignoring the rules of war) forces of the future and the bigoted (but in some senses more honorable) military of the past.Birmingham set up the situation for a conflict between the down-time governments (the British, for example, wanted the British elements of the UN fleet returned to Atlantic waters and to down-time naval control), but didn't really develop it--perhaps this will follow in future volumes of the Axis of Time trilogy. I thought he missed a chance to let the future warriors to see World War II as not really involving them. With a largely black force, the legal racism within the U.S. could have at least let them question whether to support either side. Certainly they would have been strong enough to stand back--or perhaps even force a solution on the battling forces. I also thought Birmingham missed a chance to look into the mixed emotions with which the Japanese contingent in the UN force might have been faced.WEAPONS OF CHOICE made compelling reading--and set the stage for more stories set in this world. There were some loose ends, but I'm looking forward to them being resolved as the trilogy plays itself out. I especially like the fact that the Japanese and Germans have their own chance at the technology. With Germany's lead in rocket science, and American resentment of the women and minorities represented in the future UN force, it'll be interesting to see how the battle for technological supremacy unfolds."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a huge fan of alternate history, from authors like harry turtledove to William Forstchen and to movies like final countdown.

All major characters are women, usually black or other minority. Women in combat -- not a problem. They all fight brilliantly. Women are all either sexual predators (reporters) with incredibly offensive language or homosexual. Men are indecisive.Every American from the 40s was racist, sexist, homophobic, closed-minded, etc. ad nauseum.And, agreeing with another reviewer... I'm sorry, but saying that Hillary Clinton was \\"the greatest President for the Navy since Reagan\\", simply unbelievable. I can believe that an entire naval task force can be sent back 80 years in time before I can suspend disbelief that far.However, I did manage to turn off my PC radar enough to enjoy the book.

This book was written almost like a screenplay where cute phrases and name recognition and political correctness take the place of an actual story.Last month (Dec 2012) I happened to read Wikipedia (not the best source of knowledge) about the retirement of CVN-65 the USS Enterprise. That led to reading about the next generation of CVN's (The Gerald Ford Class) and their weapons systems/fighters going forward for the next few decades. this was known in 2004 when the book came out. Obviously, this author needed to spend more time than I did researching the book. If you mess up on the little stuff then it becomes harder and harder to buy into the rest of the story.Science fiction takes a crazy premise and usually requires the author to flesh out the details. Harry Turtledove's, \\"Guns of the South,\\" did this effectively with good characterization and Birmingham must have read Turtledove because he names an officer after him.While most people gave this a good review I think this book had the potential to become something more than Final Countdown 2.

I accidentally stumbled upon it, and once I read the first page, I cannot put it down.Why? Is it that good? No. But because the background of the story is about my country Indonesia. The year is 2021, not so far from our current time. An American led (yeah, ho hum) multinational force is positioned near East Timor, just outside Indonesia's territory. They are preparing to overthrown the Jihad rebellion who just won the civil war, by retaking Jakarta. Yes, Indonesia has become the next Taliban, in 2021. Maybe it is too far fetch, but still I find the story interesting.The Background: Indonesian legitimate government (President and loyal staff) is seeking refuge in Geneva. Indonesian Armed Force (TNI) had been divided, some are supporting the Jihad. And the last standing force, protecting the legitimate government, is-yeah-the Marines (Marinir TNI-AL). I believe that the author has done his homework. He used to work as researcher in US Defense Department, and he knows the role played by Marines during 1998 Jakarta riot. Marines was the only effective armed force at that time, the other: army, police, were just disappeared!And the story goes, the multinational force, accompanied by two of Indonesian frigates, KRI Sutanto and KRI Nuku (yes, the author is using KRI as the term), which are refitted frigates bought from East Germany during Habibie's term as president (yes, he said that), which are a part of national armed force still loyal with the government.Everything is ready, until something goes wrong. One ship, which is a research vessel is conducting a top secret science experiment, accidentally creates a worm hole which transports the entire fleet backward in time, to 1942, in the middle of Midway naval battle, creating huge confusion in the Allied fleet. The multinational force from the future, is destined to change the history of World War II. Will history repeats itself, or will it change forever?Well, interesting, right? There are lots of characters, and some of them are historical figures, such as Roosevelt, MacArthur, Churchill, Hitler, Yamamoto, even Einstein. There are also a lot of tension because of the \\"clash of culture\\", between the future American, and the old American. The author is also quite accurate in depicting Indonesian culture. The naval officer is hoarding pirated movie and music in his ship, for long period on-board entertainment! He also makes reference to clove cigaret, and rice cake wrapped with banana leaf (or lontong)!Those are the strong parts, now the weak parts. Birmingham seems undecided about whether he will make this novel a \\"lesser history\\", such as Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest, as historical account of the foot soldier, or a \\"major history\\" such as The Second World War, as the account of generals. By mixing them, he is loosing the focus.There are also too many point of view characters. By doing that, each characters only has small portion, therefore the character development is sacrificed. You cannot have a deep sympathy for the character, such as in Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest or A Game of Thrones.The story also looses the steam in the middle, only to catch up near the end. Birmingham is genuine in creating the social tension caused by the \\"Transition\\". But he just failed to blend the tension in the story; it felt like a nuisance instead of strengthening the story line.Final verdict: 3.5/5. Potential to be a 4 star, actually. Just not enough."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"'Weapons of Choice' is a good book, but like all books that are intended to be series, one gets the feeling that while the Author could've wrapped up the whole thing, they left a lot of threads dangling just to lead you into the next book.That's the case here - a 21st Century Naval Fleet winds up in WWII, and while they could've eviscerated the Japanese Navy \\"midway\\" through the book (heh, heh) they don't. Yeah, there are story reasons why they didn't but the main reason seems to be so that the Japanese navy will be around in books 2 and 3.When all 3 books are published, the series itself will probably rate 4 or 5 stars. However, ya gotta rate the book as a standalone entity.Good things in the book:- Nice forward looking history. The fleet is from 2021 and an ongoing war against Terrorism and Militant Islam has shaped its men and women- Nice treatment of the mismatch between 1940/2021 mindsets- Great techno warfare stuff, especially how body armor/advanced ammo changes the land battle paradigm- Recognition that the characters from 2021 would hold certain 1940s characters in awe - Spruance for one, others you'll have to find out about - and how the 1940s characters react to this- Great overall update on the \\"Final Countdown\\" scenario- Subtle nods throughout the book at other alt history characters and scenarios. You'll know 'em when you see 'em.Things which hacked down the star rating- The scene in which the fleets first meet is just ~too~ drawn out in some places and too short on description in others.- A few times in which suspension of disbelief extends all the way to enabling seasoned warriors to make decisions that result in expension of precious advanced ammo. The reasons for doing so are given in the book, but they're not believable....- The 2021'ers are generally paragons of behavior and professionalis- not a black sheep in the family, which any military vet will tell you just isn't realistic.- A slight lack of depth. Too many of the characters are all surface, and in some cases (the female reporter) they're all surface even at their inner core. The forties characters are generally given a two-dimensional treatment, which is unfair to them and their time.- Constant use of the term \\"Jap\\". I'm not big on PC and never understood why that term wasn't as acceptable as \\"Yank\\" or \\"Brit\\" or \\"Aussie\\", but anyway, its used A LOT in this book, by characters from both times. For all the multicultalism of the modern characters, no one objects to the use of the term. The author is Austrailian - perhaps the term isn't pejorative down under?Overall, this review comes out a bit harsher than I'd like. I read the whole thing in a day, and I'll read the whole series. I'm glad I bought it.Even so, there are a lot of things in this book that are \\"4 and 5 Star\\" but the book itself just doesn't quite make it to that level."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"Weapons of Choice\\" uses the same basic idea as Eric Flint's \\"1632\\" series and S. M. Stirling's \\"Island in the Sea of Time,\\" but John Birmingham has given it a Tom Clancy-esque twist, having a naval task force from 2021 wind up in the middle of Admiral Spruance's fleet headed for Midway in June, 1942.The technological projection of 15 years in to the future is plausible and avoids dating itself too badly (the technical lingo--\\"data slate,\\" \\"flexipad,\\" etc.--sound like words some one would use). And the actual story is told well, even if it is a little unoriginal. The visual description of settings, battles, and characters is vivid and displays a strong grasp of the subject matter--whether it be geography or military history--and no small amount research.Which makes the books problems all the more pronounced. Mr. Birmingham displays his political biases a bit openly and falls too easily in to stereotypes, often allowing his characters to become two-dimensional. The characters from of 2021 are all enlightened, tolerant, professional, polished, and displaying a unrealistic lack of character flaws; whether brawling in a bar in Hawaii with troops from '42 (where a small group of 2021 marines--via martial arts training--is able to clean the floor with a crowd '42 marines and navy men) or having a conversation with '42 charaters, they come out on top. The characters of 1942 (with the exception of peraps two non-major historical characters)--civilian and military--are uncouth, undisciplined, bigoted/racist (sometimes to the extreme), rough, and sloppy.Now, having grandparents from that generation, one of whom won a purple heart on Iwo, I find this inaccurate and even insulting (my grandfather on my father's side, a Nebraska farm boy who grew up living near an Indian reservation, couldn't be less racist). Racial attitudes could very dramatically from region to region and from person to person. As an example, take a look at the men in the famous flag raising picture taken on Iwo Jima. Ethnic minorities include marine Michael Strank, who was born in a small village in Slovakia and Ira Hayes, a Native American who became a national hero after the picture was taken. Further, the picture was taken by AP photographer Joe Rosenthal, a jew. Three years earlier, colonel David \\"Mickey\\" Marcus, also a jew, was named commandant of the Army's new Ranger school, and would go on to lay the groundwork for Israel's armed forces in 1948. And all of this happened whilte hundreds of thousands of Issei and Nisei Japanese along the West coast were interned in detention camps, yet the all-Japanese American 100th Infantry Battalion would become the most decorated unit in US military history. Mr. Birmingham, by succumbing to these biases, has failed to portray the complexity of racial attitudes; the clash of racial prejudice and common decency in the American character, which would have been an interesting conflict on the pages of Weapons of Choice.Lastly, his biases lead him to project certain ideas on US politics and military culture, in particular an openly gay female captain of the USS Leyte Gulf and Hillary Clinton as \\"the most uncompromising wartime president in the history of the United States.\\" However, this is far more a matter of opinion, so yours may be different.All this aside, it is a good yarn, and if you have a hunger for a good war novel and some alternate history then I recommend it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I will not add yet another summary of this book, as there are plenty of reviews already posted that serve this purpose. (My only gripe: the first meeting of the Multinational fleet from the future and the '42 fleet was a bit drawn out.) I shared this book with my father, who served on the USS New Orleans from 1943 until 1946 (she was stuck on China Service clearing mines for a full year after the Nipponese surrender). Keeping in mind some of the comments posted here (that the 1942 contemporaries - or Temps - were a bit two-dimensional), and the fact that the New Orleans is sunk at the beginning of the book, I was curious what he thought. Well, he loved it from start to finish. He thought the concept was great, and the writing was sound. In fact, he was practically giddy reading it!We discussed the whole aspect of the racism/ignorance of the Temps. He did not deny it was rampant, especially since many sailors did not know better. And what's more, he was certain they would not have been receptive to wartime \\"sensitivity training\\"; since fatalism was rampant. Why pay attention to it, when a sudden torpedo or kamikaze could end it all? Besides, there was a war to win. This \\"lack of sensitivity\\" carries over to Spruance and Halsey's discussion (in the book) as to whether a POW rescue is a wise use of resources.My dad's only gripe, the name of the futuristic supercarrier, and the fact it wasn't sunk at the onset. But I think he is willing to forgive!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I am not writing about the mainly one-dimensional main characters the book is abundant with. My main problem with the book was the glaring lack of technical knowledge from the author - one would not want to meet such inconsistencies in a military/naval timetravel fiction.Get the surface vessels of a modern (2009) USN carrier battlegroup and transport it in the middle of its WWII counterpart. Such an engagement would be one-sided - the modern battlegroup would be reduced to wrecks in a short notice. Modern ships just lack the weapons for a short-range fight, while WWII ships were just built for it (check the second battle of Guadalcanal and all the night fighting of the Solomons campaign). Close-in defense weapons would not have much effect on 8\\" armor piercing shells - like 3\\" wall thickness with only a small amount of explosives. And carriers are not armored against such an obsolete threat - were not armored even in WWII to the required extent. The anti-surface armament of a modern carrier group is carried by the planes (i.e. useless in the scenario), a limited number of Harpoon rockets (not really useful against armored targets like a heavy cruiser), the secondary anti-ship capability of the Standard anti-air missiles of the AEGIS system and the one or two 5\\" guns for each modern destroyer/cruiser.So the author invents a fantasy weapon that has no OTL/RL counterpart to trash the old guys, called 'mace'. The main problem with it is that such a weapon does not exist on the drawing boards, which would be necessary to see them on a ship laid down in the late 2010s. Which has a dual-purpose ('high explosive' and armor-piercing) warhead apparently has the equivalent damage potential of a sub-kiloton nuke against ground targets without any fissile materials. The author then babbles something about 'fusion' that has nothing in common with what we know - mainly that it is anything but suitable for the miniaturization in the game. Replace 'fusion' with 'nuclear' and it might work, but won't be politically correct.The Raptor is not a carrier-capable aircraft, nor does the USN has any plans navalizing it. It is a USAF plane, plain and simple. A 2021 carrier would have 40-60 F-18E/Fs and F-35Bs on board, plus a number of UCAVs (combat drones) - the latter two do not get any mention.An USN CVBG would not sail without any USN escorts. A handful of destroyers and one nuclear submarine the minimum. It won't be sent naked, relying on a multinational medley for protection.Strategy and logisticsThe author displays an ignorance on historical Japanese politics - and it is supposed to be one of the main themes of the book.Japan's strategical objective (#1) in the 1920-30s was to secure China. The attack on Malaya/Sulawesi (objective #2) was necessary to secure resources (oil, rubber and copper) that the US was not selling, to cut China off from foreign help and secure Japanese Hegemony. The attack on Pearl Harbor was necessary, because the Philippines were in the middle of the Japanese line of communications to South East Asia (objective #3), thus the USN must be neutralized so they could not intervene (objective #4).So the author assumes that the Japanese throw out their 40-years of involvement in mainland Asia to focus on objectives of tertiary and lower priority like invading Hawaii and Australia on the urging of Yamamoto. Who, as the commander of the Combined Fleet, had about zero influence on political decisions. Not Navy Chief of Staff of Naval Minister. But this sensationalism is apparently necessary to get Australia mentioned enough times.Nevermind that they would not be able to support either of these with their available transport assets - the Japanese expansion was more or less stopped by the limits of logistical capabilities (and the lack of naval assault forces against any opposed landing) not military opposition."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Its a sad commentary when Turtledove is less biased in his PC commentary than this book is.

No one else around, no children/spouse/co-workers/pets bothering you - just peace, quiet and a good book, something to take you away from life's everyday trials and tribulations. The \\"alt-history\\" genre in particular can be very interesting. You know, the kind of books that are about things like, \\"what would the U.S. be like today if the South had won the Civil War.\\" Pages turned out by the hands of a superior writer can lead to some really creative ideas and interesting reads.Then there are books like \\"Weapons of Choice\\", by John Birmingham, which are so dreadful that they bring the real world mercifully crashing back around us. What's worse, I will reveal to you at the end of this review that the main idea of the book isn't even original!Our heroes are a multi-national naval force from the year 2021. Thrown together are mostly Americans, some Brits, some Japanese, some Indonesians, and some Australian ships, all (predictably) under a U.S. commander. Through a scientific experiment (predictably) gone terribly wrong, most of the fleet gets sent back in time to June 2, 1942, two days before the Japanese were about to attack Midway Island, a battle which in real life was a decisive U.S. victory and pretty much turned the tide of the War in the Pacific gainst the Japanese. Because we all know that time travel backwards makes one physically ill (unless one is a Terminator), all of the future force characters (predictably) find themselves in various states of incapacitation upon arrival in 1942 and, thus unable to man their respective stations or defend themselves.This is important because the future force people materialize in the middle of U.S. Pacific Fleet Task Force 16 under Admiral Spruance, which is on its way to spring a trap on the Japanese at Midway Island and essentially put Japan on the defensive for the rest of WWII (as happened in real life). While the WWII force gets a good, long look at all of the weird ships that have suddenly showed up in their midst, the future force people are kind of flipping around on their decks like beached fish. By the time the future force people recover, the WWII force has decided to open fire with everything they have (especially at the one Japanese ship that is part of the future force) and cause some pretty heavy damage before the future fleet and its dazzling array of computer intelligence-guided weaponry and laughably superior fire power take control of the situation.***** WARNING: SPOILER FOLLOWS *****It is fortunate for the book characters that cooler heads ultimately prevail before the future force annihilates the WWII force, which surely would have happened had the future force come out of the time warp without the time travel sickness. Indeed, we could suspect that the future force would have wiped out the WWII force at the first sign of trouble, had they been able to do so.It is unfortunate for the reader, however, that that did not happen, because now the book has to continue. And oh, what a cast of thousands of stock characters we have. Basically, I learned that WWII Americans were stupid, bigoted, and sexist, but courageous and patriotic. I learned that WWII Japanese were all devious, prone to outbursts of anger (a shamelful loss of self-control), and blindly devoted to their superiors. I learned that WWII Germans were suavely decadent, sometimes irrational, but basically good robot soldiers with a firm belief in their human superiority. In short, I learned everything about every stereotype I have ever seen in every bad old war movie ever made.What about the modern force? Let's see; the modern Americans are (for the most part) the antithesis of the WWII people. They are much, much smarter, much, much more tolerant, too dependent on technology, can't cope with roughing it, are macho in a much less threatening way, unless they are special forces, in which they get to out-Ninja even Japanese folks. The modern Brits are summed up by the RN Captain who is a super-hot eurasian woman who is super-efficient and has that uppercrust accent and the sense of entitlement that goes with it. In a nutshell, the future force are mostly materialistic wimps, except for the truly nasty bada****. In short, I learned everything about every stereotype I have ever seen in every bad new war movie ever made.Last, but not least, we have the bitter and none-too-bright Indonesians. As the representative Muslims of the future force who feel that they are being slighted by their christian friends in the future, they (predictably) end up betraying the future force to the WWII Japanese, thus mucking up the future as it should have happened. That they think that they know what they are doing is of no moment because CNN has taught us that all Muslims will eventually sell out the rest of the world, right? Again, more stereotypes.The plot, of course, is the effect that the future force may have on the future. Should they participate in WWII or not? How will technology captured by the WWII Japanese change history? Will the future Japanese go and fight for the WWII Japanese. The characters in this book are stereotypes who do and say exactly what you think that a stereotypical character would do or say in the same situation. They never progress beyond cartoonish proportions. I could go on and give examples, but I've already written enough.What was really funny, though, is that I could have sworn that I read this story before. After much searching, I realized that what I was thinking of was a fairly bad TV movie about the same thing. Well, just looked it up and I was right. In 1980, when YT was only 12 years old, the movie \\"The Final Countdown\\" was on, starring Martin Sheen. Here is the description of the movie from IMDB: \\"The USS Nimitz, a modern-day nuclear aircraft carrier, is drawn through a time warp from 1980 to a couple days before the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor, and the crew must decide whether to launch a preemptive strike against the incoming Japanese carrier fleet with their more advanced air wing, or allow history to take its course, which might not happen since they had rescued Senator Chapman, who disappeared shortly before the attack, from his death.\\"Hmmmm...sounds awfully familiar! However, if given the choice, I'm going cheesey 1980 made-for-TV-movie over this book any day of the week!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"One of the most basic and glaring errors in historical research is to evaluate past individuals and their beliefs and actions by today's standards, rather than to try to understand these past people's attitudes and actions by understanding them as the products of the times they lived in--their history up until that time, and their intellectual, cultural, economic, political, religious, and moral environment.Birmingham commits this cardinal sin, gaining a cheap victory by presenting WWII era characters as just knuckle-dragging racists, and 21st century characters--no matter how \\"messed-up\\"--as paragons of virtue, neglecting to take into account the vast differences between the times and environments that produced each group. The people from WWII represent that era's mind-sets, beliefs and actions; the 21st century crowd represents theirs, but fundamental human nature does not change and certainly not in a couple of generations. Birmingham mistakes changes in technology, clothes, slang and convention for fundamental change and writes from a perspective that just assumes that the \\"more advanced,\\" more \\"Liberal\\" 21st century crowd is right on all issues, but are they?I also agree with another reviewer who felt that the author had just strung together technical sounding terms to come up with a \\"cool,\\" but unconvincing set of military technologies; much too large a quotient of \\"handwavium.\\"Not the exploration of the clash of values and beliefs that it could have been, had Birmingham been willing to write more that just an exercise in moral preening, and a reflexively PC book, but, instead, had tried to more evenhandedly, deeply and sympathetically explore not only the technical and historical, but also the many ethical, moral and practical issues that would be raised by such an event."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Ultimately, this book was a disappointment and the reason are the characters. Or, more accurately, the collection of stereotypes. When you have people from different eras meet it makes sense that there should be culture shock and some serious misunderstandings. 1632 played this dynamic well. Here, it's sloppy, ham fisted and repetitive.Almost every 1942 character is either racist, sexist, a pig headed moron or a criminal. Yes, 1942 America embraced stereotypes and racist laws we'd find appalling but these stereotypes are no more accurate than the racial stereotypes 1942 embraced nor do they make for good fiction. They're just annoying.On the other end, the 2020's Americans are just as thin and obnoxious. They are uniformly great soldiers, smarter, stronger and better in every way. Many of them talk on and on about sex, to the point of being irritating. The female journalist is probably the most shallow of the bunch.Ultimately, I couldn't stand or care about the majority of these characters, which is sad given the strong points. The action, historical accuracy and the plot being set up for the next books is great. With characters like this though, I won't read any of them."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Birmingham studiously avoids temptations throughout the riveting and realistic storytelling so it's full of confusion, egos, accidents, disasters, setbacks, limitations, personal concerns of each character (I thought they were more multi-dimensional than most reviewers, they just didn't wallow in their grief and isolation page after page)...it's far more realistic than most novels. The author seems to have a much richer and in-depth understanding of real military psychology, especially now and as it's quite likely to develop over the near term with current trends.By taking the task force from 2021 after 20 years of an asymmetric world wide war on terrorism, the way conflicts shaped people up until the comparatively short wars of the 19th & 20th century, Birmingham is really writing brilliant speculative fiction about the next 20 years (Hillary Clinton as the assassinated toughest President since Truman and TR, Condoleeza Rice as a VP, emerging weapon systems in full deployment, the accumulated trauma of both major terror attacks and continual wars, police actions, Wahhabi terrorists, UN actions, suicide bombings, a high tolerance diversity force as a reflection of not only society but also recruiting challenges and techno-war's skillsets...it's brilliantly realized stuff about the road the whole world is on.The sensibilities of the future task force based on their own experience (they have a war crimes forensics unit onsite and document for it continually) so they're far more concerned with the death camps, POW's, and civilians than the WWII folks which unfortunately fits as more continues to come to light about how early WWII leadership knew about the atrocities, scale, and locations but mostly ignored them in terms of tactical resources. The racism and dumbness of the 1942 military (they hadn't been getting or keeping the cream of the crop in the 20's and 30's so the officers and senior enlisted aren't the ones we think of later in the war when over 50% of U.S. men were serving in the armed forces...if it wasn't for rich wives, MacArthur, Patton, and Eisenhower all would have left the service long before the war.) George C. Marshall is oddly absent-he'd have been far more likely than Eisenhower and even King to be dealing with this (I recommend Forrest Pogue's outstanding biography to the author) and Vinegar Joe Stilwell assigned to Chiang Kai Shek's campaigns should make a strong appearance in the sequel. I'd also expect the Soviet influencing of U.S. policy through it's 350 agents in the FDR administration, revealed by the Signal Corps' Venona transcripts from the Soviet Embassy and confirmed in the 1990's from the Soviet archives, to have a major impact particularly for Undersecretary of Treasury Harry Dexter White, Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles, and others feeding direct intel to Stalin's war and negotiating efforts. The gradual revelation of U.S. business interest ties with the Nazis up through the war would also likely be known and also be a political bombshell (American Axis and IBM & the Holocaust are chilling reading). Birmingham does underplay the impact of high speed computing and the degree of technical education across the task force on projects like the Manhattan Project or Tuxedo Park's/MIT's Radar Labs or the current efforts at developing jet engines, helicopters, antibiotics, transistors, trauma units, project management, quality assurance, supply chain management (thinking of the impact of computing on logistics alone would make real generals weep with joy), code-breaking (since the Japs and Germans would be revamping their codes immediately rather than letting us read them for the rest of the war), materials science, aerodynamics, etc...there's so many jumps they can make immediately to 1947-1955 era technology from their base with this, like Korean-war era jets, long range jet bombers, hydrogen and neutron bombs, MASH units, med-evac 1950's helicopters-Bell & Sikorsky exist already, ship-based nuclear propulsion plants, big subs, stabler jeeps, useful tanks, self-propelled artillery, radar-guided anti-aircraft, really good radar and sonar, solid-state electronics, etc.. If you look at what we were producing by 1943-1953 in the U.S., Britain, Japan, Russia, and Germany, I think the author is really underestimating the engineering horsepower and industrial base really at work. Great book, couldn't find it in the bookstores which is a shame (Barnes & Noble and Borders at least)as this will appeal to many who rarely visit the SF section as well as SF fans."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I was looking for a nice fast-paced action-adventure read for an airline flight and picked this up. What a disappointment.I didn't like it for two reasons. First was the excessive and overbearing political correctness. In the future portrayed in this novel, the characters are hyperconscious of race and gender issues. I'd hope by 2021 that race and gender would be non-issues. And the supercarrier USS Hillary Clinton? Please. I was expecting the USS Al Sharpton to come sailing over the horizon and neutralize the enemy with a tactical hairspray weapon.The other reason I didn't enjoy it was the inauthenticity with which the technology was presented. A lot of it just sounds fake, as if the author is just stringing together numerous technical-sounding words to make something seem complicated.

True, the culture-stuff is mildly entertaining but after a few pages you get point. The way the book is structured is not very original either and probably 'borrowed' from Red Storm Rising from Tom Calncy, which by the way was a lot more fun to read.

Thanks to battalion logistics officer Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Vivani the marines have \\"the very best equipment other people's money could buy.\\"As for the ships - quite diverse, among them the USS Hillary Clinton, and with one you couldn't miss: \\"The Joint Research Vessel Nagoya was a purpose-built leviathan, constructed around the frame of an \\"eighty-thousand-tonne liquid natural gas carrier.\\"All set? Not quite. A military experiment goes awry, very much awry, throwing this armada back over eighty years to 1942, and where? Smack in the center of the naval task force non-stopping to Midway Atoll.What are the 1942 seamen to think of the time travelers who suddenly appear in their midst, and how will they react to weaponry they could not even imagine? As for the fighting men of 2021 suddenly jettisoned into the past, what must they do? Perhaps even more importantly, did an enemy come with them?The first in a planned Axis of Time trilogy, Weapons Of Choice is riveting alternate history.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Finished this a few days ago but just now got time to sit down and review it. This is my first alternate history book of any kind. I quite enjoyed it. I have no idea how it measures up against other alternate history books, but this being my first one, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"One of the best books I've read. I couldn't put it down. Starts out with what seems like boring information, but you must read all the background information about the ships and the people involved because it will be useful later. I found myself turning back the pages to re-read the background info. It starts with a BANG! and never lets up. It mixes sci-fi with history and creates and alternate history and does a great job. I highly recommend this book and will get the next. My first purchase was a kindle freebie, but I'm hooked on the series will buy the rest."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I don't normally read action or military books, but I couldn't resist this one because of the great concept. I wanted to see how the author would develop this plot, after an entire fleet is displaced into the past by a bad science experiment. I could not put this book down! I loved the little tidbits of \\"history\\" throughout the book, and it was really interesting to see the author's view on how certain things turned out after our current history. The characters were very well-described and felt real. The military aspects seem legitimate to me, but I'm not knowledgeable about a lot of that. The plot was interesting, and the book was very well written. Highly recommend this!!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought the book based on the numerous positive reviews and the fact that I really enjoyed the movie \\"The Final Countdown.\\". I don't know if I would buy any of the other books in the series.Leaving aside the fact that the characters other that ADM Yamamoto are very 2-D and that the initial melange of the Modern and 1942 ships was extremely drawn out, some of the \\"Political Correctness\\" was too much to take. Any female who acts as boorish as the two reporters imbedded in the fleet are definitely NOT ladies. I am a believer in equal rights and wouldn't mind seeing women in Combat/front-line reporters, but these gals go out of their way to be foul-mouthed \\"skanks.\\"As far as the CVN Hillary Clinton is concerned, I really don't need a crystal ball to be told how unlikely this would be. Female president, sure...but \\"the greatest wartime persident\\", come on now. What about FDR, Truman, Lincoln, Washington. Mrs. Clinton has made her feelings about the military quite well known around the White House when she was 1st Lady. Somehow I don't see here as being able to change that much.The attitudes of the military is believeable, but when Adm K. recognizes a young Bing Crosby and goes out of his way to make rude remarks to him in a resturant...My father is an Admiral and he was always known to hold his temper in public.Finially, I do like the fact that the Japanese are finally being correctly portrayed to be the monsters that some of them were. they got off very easy after the war and as a result never had to admit to most of their warcrimes. This is probably due to the fact that the author is an Australian."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Starts off with a bang and rolls on.

I was sorely disappointed after having read the reviews. My only wish is that the muslim extremist had succeeded in blowning up the ship at the end and this silly \\"trilogy\\" would die the quick death it deserves. The pacing was painfully slow, the characters were numerous and not one of them were developed into anything that would make one care whether they survived or not. I wish a black hole would swallow this whole book away where it belongs...There are so many better books out there that to say this book is anything but lousy is a wonder. What do these people read who rate this book worthy of anything other than kindling? They must read worse books than this so that this looks good in comparison. Good grief.Do yourself a favor and pass this by."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I really had high hopes for this novel, but I just can't do it. First of all, any military person will tell you that Hillary Clinton would just about be the worst person for the military, next to maybe Osama bin Ladin, and that's a close maybe. This is, after all, the woman who ordered that no military personel should wear their uniforms to the White House during her husbands presidency because she found them offensive. Second, he's naming ships after fictional characters, i.e. the USS Amanda Garrett, named after the captain of James Cobbs fictional USS Cunningham series. Anyone with any experience with the US Navy, heck, anyone who does more than five minutes of research, will tell you that no one would ever authorize a ship to be named after a fictional character, ever. So is Mr. Birmingham emplying that the Axis of Time series fleet is originally from the universe Captain Garrett exists in? If so, did he get permission from James Cobb? I doubt it. Third, why are all the World War 2 personel portrayed as racist, sexist, quasi-fascist jerks just barely one step ahead of the Nazi's and Imperialists they are fighting? A lack of respect and understanding of the era is to blame here. It seems to me that Mr. Birmingham started out with a great idea, War on Terrorism fleet of multinational task force, (By the way there has never been a \\"multinational fleet\\" under UN command, and never will be, by the way, US Naval Forces would never let a Supercarrier, like the, *dry heave* USS Hillary Clinton, within 500 miles of another nations warships, especially those of questionable loyalty like the Japanese research vessel or the Indonesian warships) gets sent back in time to WW2, and fight of the Japanese...Didn't this get done in Final Countdown.... Oh well. Mr. Birmingham, if you read this review, please, as an ex-sailor myself, do more research....If you want a ship that the Navy would be proud to call their own, use the USS Ronald Reagan...."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Islamic terrorism is the order of the day, club them with nazis and wormongering japs and america's enemies are complete. Ridiculous is the word that comes to mind while reading this book. The author is simply ridiculous in putting forward 21st century technology in the hands of the allies instead of using it to stop the war without shedding blood. Interesting to note that a jap (yamamoto) and a nazi seemed to be the most sensible people in the story."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I picked this book up in the bookstore to see what all the good reviews are so happy for.Rather pathetic would be better description. I wonder if any of the critics so raving actually read it. I wonder how much history or even militery knowledge any of them might have beyond watching a few JAG episodes.This is the awful type of book I have come to loath, an unrealistic sci-fi set in the past. A modern carrier battle group falling into the past to 'save the day', why not the starship Enterrise?I should not have been suprised that this book is awful by the choice of whom the carrier was named for.Certainly all this book proves is that though the technowlogy of the past was inferior, the brains were much better.'Sexist' and 'racist' attitudes of the past so eagerly condemned can only be matched in brainlessness as tThe Politically Correct attidudes the elite espouse here in the present.I put this one back on the shelf.Not worth buying."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"John Birmingham presents a parody of right-wing wish fulfillment. In his book, twenty years of \\"liberal\\" social development gives us women who are vicious, foul-mouthed, sexually-aggressive harpies; future men are limp-wristed nancies. This is contrasted against a cartoon-character cast of 1940s personalities who are, to a man, clones of Sergeant Rock and John Wayne. The former are presented as superior to the latter, but are so disagreeable that the reader wonders why he is expected to cheer for them--which is, of course, the point. Except that the attitudes are so over-the-top that the reader further wonders how it could not be intentionally exaggerated for comic effect.The remainder of the novel reads like militaristic right-wing wish fulfillment, the likes of which Larry Bond or Dale Brown would be embarrassed to sign their name to. Hyper-advanced military weapons sweep the world clear of faceless, nameless enemy troops in extended sequences of lovingly-detailed carnage (one battle is the longest single sequence in the book and comprises almost a quarter of its length.) The implications of taking a network node out of its network (in terms of satellite communications and logistics) are explored briefly, and then dropped to allow the bloodthirsty killbot characters to rack up higher scores. Again, it all reads less like something that a professional author would intend to be taken seriously, and more like the product of a 13-year-old with a head full of \\"Popular Mechanics\\", \\"Counter-Strike\\", and Tom Clancy potboilers.The book clearly sets the stage for Mary Sue imaginings (although I guess you can't really call it Mary Sue in this case, perhaps more like Billy Bob.) It shifts setting from set-piece to set-piece, and steadfastly refuses to focus on any main character. The dialogue reads as though the characters were actors presenting lines, waiting only for the reader to hit the appropriate button and continue the video-game. Technology is an un-named character in every scene; as is the techno-thriller stereotype, weapons and military equipment are given equal time to plot and character.I found this book to be hilarious. The only thing more amusing is to think about how many people read it without understanding that it is poking fun at them."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Hilary Clinton is not billed as \\"the greatest president ever\\" claiming that is what the book says is either sloppy reading or conservative propaganda. What it says is that she; \\"is the most uncompromising wartime president,\\" that is a different kettle of corn.Hilary Clinton is pretty much uncompromising in general so its not out of line to assume this crazy stonewalling would extend to war time.That being said the book is really, reallly, really, bad. This guy writes like a three year old and his characters are one-dimensional.But you know the part that makes me the most angry?Gosh darn him for positively portraying strong women and homosexuals!That really makes me angry, I'm glad the rest of these fine amazonheads are here to make sure that people know women don't have souls and should shut up and know their role and that homosexuals are an abomination!Oh wait...that's retarded..."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"_Weapons of Choice_ was an excellent alternate history/time travel book, so well written, paced, and conceived that I believe it was the best of that type that I have ever read (and I've read a few). Genre fans may remember the 1980s movie _Final Countdown_, where a modern _Nimitz_ class aircraft carrier accidentally time travels back to just days before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Though we did get to see F-14s deal with a few Zeros if memory serves, the movie didn't fully explore what could have happened had modern equipment and personnel suddenly appeared during that conflict._Weapons of Choice_ does that and more.The book opens in the year 2021. An international fleet of warships - largely American but importantly including British, Japanese, Australian, and Indonesian vessels - are on a mission to Indonesia. This multinational armada is tasked with defeating the Caliphate, a revolutionary Islamist regime that has taken over the government of Indonesia, threatening to spread the revolution violently to neighboring nations such as Malaysia and is massacring Christians and ethnic Chinese within the country. The impressive force sent to stop the Caliphate includes a variety of warships, aircraft, and weapon systems that don't exist yet, such as the F-22 fighter, the amphibious warship _USS Kandahar_, the super carrier _USS Hillary Clinton_, and a great deal of futuristic technology including ceramic armament, intelligent battle computers, and biochip implants.Also present is the Joint Research Vessel _Nagoya_, an impressive scientific research vessel that was originally stationed off the Australian coast to do high energy physics experiments. When its assigned warship escort was recalled to the multinational task force, it was ordered to accompany it to Indonesia. Resentful over the delay in experimentations, the scientists and crew on the _Nagoya_ continue their projects. Something goes horribly wrong, an artificial wormhole is created, and most if not all of the international task force is sent backward in time, ending up near Midway in the middle of the Pacific, days before the fateful Battle of Midway in 1942.To say much more than that would spoil the book and that would be a shame. One might think that such an impressive fleet would rule the Earth and quickly defeat the Axis powers; that however as the reader will discover is not at all the case. If anything the accidental arrival of the task force may make things better for the Axis nations, at least in the short term.In a tightly written, page-turning narrative Birmingham shows the interaction between the international task force and the soldiers, sailors, military leaders, and politicians of the era and the course of the war after their arrival. The author explores how the people of 1942 view an integrated fleet, possessing many sailors, marines, and officers that are non-white and/or female. The people from the future have the benefit of hindsight, knowing how the war turns out, possessing an advantage, but then the people of 1942 live in this world and possess a lot of knowledge and experience not conveyed adequately in future books and television programs. Slang is different, as are tastes in music, movies, dating techniques, etc. They have different views on such issues as the Holocaust (a major issue in the future; hardly known to many particularly in the Pacific theater), how to win the war, and how to adequately make use of the weapons that seemed to have been dropped in their lap. Command issues arise (just imagine General Douglas Macarthur and his view over this futuristic force appearing in the Pacific), as do issues of pay, medical issues (the medical personnel from the future are aghast at 1942 medicine)...even the embedded (an unknown word in 1942) reporters don't know who and if they can report to the contemporary news organizations of this time period, as the authorities are unsure how to handle the news of this momentous event!Of course, the knowledge, equipment, and personnel from 2021 aren't in Allied hands alone; Birmingham details what happens in Japan and Germany as well. Major characters in the book include Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto and German engineer Major Paul Brasch.As an aside I would like to note that throughout the book the author sprinkles asides, references, and observations about our future history; it appears that up to 2021 the Allied nations have been fighting an irregular war against terrorism, sometimes overt as in among other places Iraq, Afghanistan, and at least as originally planned in Indonesia, sometimes covert. Occasional references are made to September 11th type attacks after 2001, including some with weapons of mass destruction. Though not fully explored, the crew of the multinational task force has come from a world at war, perhaps not as dire as the situation in 1942, but nonetheless a world truly in conflict.The first of a trilogy, the second act looks to be action-packed and gripping. I can't wait. This trilogy should appeal to Harry Turtledove fans (there are several throwaway references) and Tom Clancy fans (I think I caught at least one reference to him as well). I highly recommend this book, I read it in about two days."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"______________________________________________This is a new twist on that perennial AH fave, rerunning WW2. Here a naval task force from 2021 is diverted to 1942 by a DARPA teleportation experiment gone spectacularly wrong. In the confusion, the moderns sink most of Admiral Spruance's fleet, enroute to Midway. Oops....This is a first-rate piece of AH/mil-SF, marred by being #1 of 3, pacing problems, and some odd auctorial choices. His 2021 is a rather grim place. The interactions of 2021 with 1942 are very nicely done.Huge logical flaw in the denouement of vol. 1, which needs a *SPOILER WARNING*, and which wasn't immediately obvious, to me anyway (but I'm slow, and sick):[Islamic jihadists hijack an 'old' 21st- C. frigate, try to ram the supercarrier. Which finds its guns won't depress far enough to blow same out of the water] After 20+ years of fighting suicide jihadis, the Navy hasn't figured out an effective close-range defense??? Worse, they have one ('MetalStorm'), but Birmingham ignores it to make a cute plot-twist: the \\"Hillary Clinton\\" is saved by a 1942 fighter! Bad, bad author! What was he thinking? That his readers are stupid? Editor asleep at the screen?Nevertheless, I recommend WoC to mil-SF and alt-hist fans, as the best of same I've seen yet this year.Paul Di Filippo's enthusiastic review led me to read it. He gives WoC a solid \\"A\\" [G00GLE scifi[dot]com] Sample:Perhaps Birmingham's biggest accomplishment is the clash of civilizations he brilliantly limns.

Over all it wasn't bad and I am looking forward to buying the next book in the series. However, the author's voice is clearly very preachy about, \\"How far we've come.\\" Yes, I like some of the incidents as played out, but it became a repetitive nagging when I read about the same thing happening again... and again. The 1940's US is shown to be full of Racist, Sexist, homophobic morons while the world 15 years from now is supposed to be full of Totally competent egalitarians.The author has embraced the multiple worlds theory through his writing, but hides little clues here and there to show what he means. The willingness of people to allow drug dispensers and cybernetics to be places in their bodies plus the overwhelming use of fusion energy makes me wonder if this is *our* 2021. Yes many of the technoligies are probably being developed, but remember the cost of these weapons systems. Unless there is a major capital infusion from somewhere else than China, who is a clear enemy state in the book, this wonderous technology wouldn't be able to be funded. The 1940's the Fleet shows up in have a weird feel like it may not be the correct past either. The author does have a sense of otherworldliness that Alternate history needs.Overall, not bad at all."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Weapons of Choice is the first novel in what is supposed to be something called the Axis of Time trilogy. The premise of this novel is that around 2021 in the middle of a jihad in sourtheast Asia, some military experiment gone wrong thrusts several ships back to 1940 something, just after Pearl Harbor and before Midway. Chaos, naturally, ensues as both the 40's people and the ot20's people try to figure out wtf is going on, and then, what to do about it.The action scenes are pretty cool, especially near the end. But the \\"transition\\" as it comes to be known is draaaaaawn out a little long. And the scenes with action in them are few and far between.The biggest problem with Weapons is that given the fantastically interesting premise and chance for twists and turns at every moment, it doesn't really deliver any. Everything you think would happen in such an event does, and none of it is surprising or particularly compelling. Even the tension between the women and black sailors of the future and the sexist and racist boys from the 40s plays out exactly as you think it would. The good guys accept it, and the bad guys don't. Boring.The characters of FDR, Hitler, Yamamoto, Einstein, etc. seem exactly like the typical elementary school history book versions would read, without a surprise anywhere. There is a small amount of humanizing of Yamamoto, which is one saving grace of the book. The created characters of Kolhammer, Halabi and Jones epitomize the group from the future in that they don't have one single outcast, badass or malcontent among them. Hey, I'm all for the future, but puh-leeze. To think that our armed forces are going to be perfectly behaved with nary a variance in just under 20 years is laughable.The book does have its merits. The transition, though, again, drawn out too long, is a good read and has some excellent visuals. Also enjoyable are the brief mentions of the \\"future's past.\\" One of the ships is named the USS Hillary Clinton, and she is mentioned later, briefly, as the greatest wartime president in American history. Snicker. The story moves pretty well and it never became a chore. But the characters damage the story, which isn't that spectacular or surprising in any way, with the exception of an eyebrow raise towards the end.I'll probably get the other two, just to see how the presence of the future peeps changes World War II and the world. But if this book is any indication, it won't be that exciting anyway."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I think this book did a pretty good job of setting up the premise and getting all the players introduced. As the first book in a series, it suffers because it doesn't resolve anything. In general I find the idea quite interesting, and the execution competent. There was a bit of hammering on the attitudes of 1940s allied morals, but I finally came to realize (when the future guys started popping prozacs like breath mints) that the 21st century troops have something to learn too, and I hope this thread is followed and expanded next time."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm not going to add anything to the previous reviewer's objections to the stultifying P.C. sermons.What I found boring was the colossal amount of filler which did nothing to advance the story.

My main complaint is that the lazy author should have delivered already. It looks like it's been a year since this came out.Unlike some I didn't have a problem with his characters. In places I thought there was too much character development and not enough action! Well, that's untrue. There's action on almost every page, but for my shoot-em-up tastes, Birmingham coulda chopped out some love scenes and replaced them with stuff being blown up.A minority view perhaps, but mine.Did I mention that I loved it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Like other reviewers, I sped through the book in two days and can't wait for the rest of the trilogy!

The pace is excellent and the issues raised concerning the clash of past and future, in both military and cultural terms, is compelling. Aside from Turtledove's works this is probably the best alternate history book I have read in recent years."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"There is no doubt that the Australian writer John Birmingham can write. He has a glittering track record in a number of fields and his previous work has made him something of a cult hero in his home country. When I first heard that he was turning his attention the thriller genre I had no doubt that he would produce something of note. However he has done more than this. Book One of the Axis of Time Trilogy, Weapons of Choice, has reached beyond airport schlock into the realms of the &quot;thinking person's thriller&quot; and to Mr Birmingham's credit he has done it so skilfully he hasn't risked alienating the more traditional fan base that consumes this genre.John Birmingham has presented us with not only a ripping thriller, but has encapsulated within it a stinging critique of both past and future cultures. In doing so he holds the mirror up to the reader and offers a chance to examine the slippery slope down which we appear to be joyfully skateboarding.Whereas a lesser writer might have lapsed into lecturing us with his own views, Birmingham has stepped back far enough to allow us to make our own judgments. Be in no doubt about the seriousness of the questions the marvellously drawn characters raise. As we in the real world watch the unfolding war on terror and allow our own moral positions to be manipulated by spin and counter spin, uncertainty and fear, this novel gives us a glimpse of the continuum we are on. What we make of it is up to each individual reader.And as a pure thriller? Wonderfully imagined, brilliantly executed and peopled by characters that leap off the page fully formed, no matter how brief their existence and painful their demise.I do have one major concern with this novel. As the author of seven published thrillers, I have to confess that John Birmingham is extremely serious competition. I await the next book with some trepidation."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Having read through the entire trilogy (starting in the middle and working back and forth as I found the books) I was initially thrilled, but quickly grew to feel \\"meh\\".A large part of the problem is the way the trilogy skips huge chunks of time; true, some of the information from that \\"missing time\\" is filled in later, but often as not it's vague and unrewarding, especially when it comes to prominent characters or events.And the characters...this is where the book's appeal is lowest to me. The characters feel poorly fleshed out in many cases, or follow a single ideal--ie., all the woman are portrayed as hard-edged, ultra-feminist types without an ounce of warmth or compassion, for example, leading one to wonder how the author sees modern women. The men get a bit more variety--Brasch and Dan Black are good examples, at least. The problem is there seems little depth to anyone--they are little better than machines.Also, the habit of introducing then forgetting or killing off characters after only a few pages or chapters, often as an afterthought (we don't often see their deaths, only hear about it after the fact) is a poor way to do things.While the technology is interesting and seeing it applied against a more \\"primitive\\" time is fascinating it also feels very compartmentalized, as if each battle is a single separate story outside of the whole, with no real connection. Also much of it isn't explained well, so my inner geek who loves military hardware was left badly wanting.Overall the trilogy is an interesting if not entirely entertaining read; it's not as dry as Harry Turtledove's works nor as talky (and the author--to his credit--avoids using big words when small ones will do) but it still feels lacking."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The first third of the book was interesting in a Tom Clancy-esqe near future meets the past with a bang sort of way.However, after the inital encounter, no one from 1942 behaves the way that real Allied leaders would have behaved in 1942. The task force from the future had enough information and firepower to take out the leadership of all the Axis powers *easily* and likely end the war immediately, yet they do nothing of the sort.But that would mean no sequel books!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Usually I have strong opinions on what I read. But in this case I had to read many of the \\"one star\\" reviews of this book to help me determine what was bothering me. I agree with much of what is said in the \\"one star\\" reviews -- too much political correctness, predictable plot, cardboard characters.Yet, as I sit here writing this review I must admit I have read the entire series. That's why I had to give it a \\"four star\\" rating. Something kept me coming back. Maybe it has to do with my age. I was a child during WWII. There is something about the idea of going back in time with the technology of today... There is also something about how, after all these years, we have not changed enough. We still carry all our hates, fears and biases.Guess you'll have to see for yourself."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While it has a good premise and passable technology and writing, this book ends up being a complete disappointment. We jump into the action before we can even recognize any of the characters by name, much less care about them, and the action is a jumbled mess: too convenient in some respects, too confusing in others, too quick in some parts, and too tedious in others--and no, this does not just represent the fog of battle. All of this might be okay except that the time-travel is handled quite badly and inconsistently. That's not to say that there's not a pseudo-science explanation for it, but the jibberish has nothing to say about why most of the modern fleet appears one place (moved in space and time, but not in plane (i.e., the ships are still on the surface of the water, just conveniently atop another fleet, which would be like hitting an orbit for a stable planet on a random hyperspace jump)), but the rest are not. Worse yet, the secrecy of the time travel is handled terribly inconsistently and, at times, unbelievably and atrociously for a country at war. For instance, military messages about the event are sent by courier to prevent Japan from finding out, but the bars and brothels of Oahu are ordered to take modern money from the sailors from the future who are on leave. Are there no Japanese spies in Hawaii just after Pearl Harbor? The author likes to contrast the political and moral attitudes of his two-dimensional characters from different times, but has obviously given no serious thought to time travel or its actual reprecussions. Moreover, this is nowhere close to a complete novel, but is instead a prelude with no resolution leading to an undisclosed next book, which is not so much a sequel but an apparent continuation of the muddled plot of the first. Incomplete books which are part of a hidden series always have a full star taken away from any review I do and guarantee that I will never read the rest of the series or anything else by the misleading author. Don't bother and don't expect much if you do."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In all honesty, I am not a big fan of the alternative-history genre. This book, however, was a real treat. The book does an excellent job of showing how different we in the 21st century are from our grandparents, but then at the same time, how alike we are. There is political intrigue, action, and adventure, all mixed in with a healthy dose of our history. I highly and enthusiastically recommend this series to others!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"It's January 2021, and an international task force headed up by the USS Hillary Clinton (a George Bush class supercarrier), is off Indonesia, responding to a political crisis caused by the overthrow of the legitimate government and its replacement by the extremist Caliphate. Because of the haste with which the task force was thrown together, they've got with them a research ship that had to come along with its protective escort-no time and no spare forces available to send it off to a safer distance. While the rest of the task force waits and prepares for action, the scientists continue their experiments-which, contrary to the official story, do not involve sea floor mapping. Something goes horribly wrong, and major pieces of the task force find themselves someplace else, surrounded by unfamiliar ships behaving in a hostile manner. It's now 1942, and the unfamiliar ships turn out to be very familiar, once the naval history buffs recover enough to identify them. It's the US fleet steaming toward Midway. Unfortunately, the two fleets do major damage to each other before the 21st century officers realize they're all ostensibly friendlies, and then manage to convey that message convincingly to the 1942 Americans.Conveying this message convincingly is somewhat hampered by the fact that they've got a Japanese ship with them, as well as some German officers. And of course life is further complicated by the racially mixed crew, and the fact that both women and blacks are well-represented among the officers. But with major damage to both fleets, including the fact that some of the 21st century task force apparently didn't make the trip successfully, they have to learn to work together if they're going to prevent a disaster at Midway.It's extremely well-done, fast-paced and exciting. The characters, from Admiral Phillip Kolhammer on the Hillary Clinton, down to Able Seaman Slim Jim Davidson, on the USS Astoria, are mostly well-rounded and convincing (although some of the 1942 British officers do seem to have been cobbled together out of left-over cardboard. Birmingham, by the way, is Australian.) And mostly the history seems correct, up to the point where it starts changing, and if any of the military details are wrong, I'm not knowledgable enough to catch them. There is one minor error, though, demonstrating why it's dangerous for British and Australian writers to assume that America is as much like their homes as the language sometimes suggests: At one point, Birmingham has two of his 1940s American enlisted seamen, Moose Molloy and Slim Jim Davidson, talking about American \\"Girl Guides.\\" While it's perfectly correct that the organization was originally founded as \\"Girl Guides of America\\" in 1912, they changed their name to \\"Girl Scouts of America\\" in 1913. Moose and Slim Jim would never have heard the name \\"Girl Guides,\\" much less used it in casual conversation. This is such an obscure bit of information that googling \\"Girl Guides of America\\" takes you to the Wikipedia article that explains this in its first few sentences: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA This does give me some concerning, wondering what other details he missed that may be glaring to someone else.Nevertheless, it's a fun book and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book because I thought the next one in the series was out already, but I realised that it's not released until late October. Bummer.I loved this weird time travelling war story. It's one of the oddest ideas for a novel I've ever seen, but Birmingham really pulls it off. The plot has been written up dozens of times in other reviews. The basics: modern war fleet gets sucked back to World War Two. Everything goes pearshaped.The battle scenes are awesome. They reminded me of early Clancy before he started indulging himself in laziness and politics. About half of the book is things going bang, but it never gets boring. The other half is exposition and character building, and unlike some reviewers I loved Birmingham's characters. Yes, some are ciphers, and some are historical cut-outs, but some are genuinely fascinating and you end up wanting to know what happens next to them.I'll definitely be buying the next. Even though it means waiting for the last book in the series to come out in '06."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Being an Aussie I'm probably a little bit biased but I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The only problem that I have with it is that its a big call to say that the allied fleet would appear right in the middle of the Midway task force, its a big ocean but hey, it had to appear somewhere I guess and it made for a ripping story. I can't wait for the next in the series."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Its books like this that make me think the Hugo awards should have a catagory for series. I won't know if this book deserves to be nominated for best novel until I see the second and third books. And its too late to nominate it then since it will no longer be eligable.Here's why I think this author may be doing something very important. He may be telling the story of what 20 years of the War on Terrorism does to our world. This novel is structured as a straight forward alternate history. What happens when a 21st century naval task force is transported back to 1942 in the pacific. But the meat of the story is the way mid 20th century Americans react to their 80 years later countrymen and allies and vice versa.Those Americans are not the same as us here in 2004. They are what we may become after 17 more years of an irregular war. I didn't catch this right away, it crept up on me. And I'm not sure if is an intentional story telling device. But, if this is indeed where the author is going then I can only compare him to C. J. Cherryh. Another writer who doesn't cut the reader any slack and tells an exacting and exiting story because of it.We may have the real deal here. I'm reccomending this to my friends and crossing my fingures that the next book doesn't descend into a generic thriller."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The very few minor flaws in this otherwise outstanding first effort are simply evidence that no one writes a perfect novel. Alternative history/time travel is a great genre when done right, but more typically is the province of one dimensional, shallow character development coupled with whiz-bangers that require a total suspension of belief and rounded out by plot devices that combine outlandish good fortune and timing with little or no actual relationship to the story line. Not so here. The story flows, the characters are real and the author has his social/technical act together. And, as a bonus, the dialogue has regular moments of humor, cleverness, insight and pain.WEAPONS OF CHOICE falls only a bit short in what the book calls the 'Transition', i.e. that actual temporal displacement itself. The deficiency is that more goes wrong--way wrong--than should be the case. It makes a certain amount of sense for the temporal displacement to have somewhat of a random and unfortunate impact on the time travelers. This is more than adequately captured, and in fact is overdone. The flaw lies in having the displaced fleet land smack dab in the middle of the June, 1942 U.S. Fleet en route to Midway to engage the Japanese invasion fleet. The Pacific Ocean is a damn big ocean and the transported Combined Fleet covered an area perhaps 25 miles in diameter. Its like trying to hit a quarter lying on a football field with another quarter and doing it from another dimension. Having the 1942 U.S. Fleet see and recognize just the lone Japanese Self-Defense Force ship that makes up a small part of the larger Combined Fleet compounds the flaw. This device results in immediate shooting between the two fleets, with the primitive 1942 Fleet giving a pretty good account of itself. Another of the Combined Fleet is split longitudinally, apparently to demonstrate the finite limits of the temporal displacement while yet another is molecularly blended with one of the contemporary U.S. Fleet. Too much of a bad thing, if you ask me.Although flawed in this respect, even this part of the book and the balance are extremely well done and it is a fun read. Other reviewers have noted the references to other AH greats, Stirling and Flint and also to Turtledove's World War series. I'll be the first to note that the references to space lizards by President Roosevelt is directed to Cmdr. Turtletaub, Harry Turtledove's precurser name.Best of all is the blending of cultures, socially, militarily and technologically. Some reviewers are turned off by what they see as a liberal bent. My politics are at least as conservative as most Texans and probably more so. Too bad the ideological blinders we see today on the hard Left are just as prevalent on the hard Right. The fact is, mid-century America was great if you were white and had a job, otherwise, it had its shortcomings. Putting a Mexican or a Black in a superior position to white males back then was beyond the capacity of many, if not most Americans to comprehend, much less accept. This is doubly true for women, and particularly minority women. Face it fellow conservatives, it was this way, no getting around it. Having said that, the author would do well to remember that the armed forces were integrated in 1950 (or a year or two before)and Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954. The country was open, at least part of it, to change, although certainly not the level of we have today or are certain to see in 17 years. The times, they were a changin' and they still are.These same reviewers are troubled that Hillary Clinton gets such favorable play. Have they followed her comments post 9-11? I will most likely never buy into most of her domestic agenda, but like Lieberman and Gephardt, and too few other prominent Democrats, she doesn't stutter in the least about the need to fight fundamentalist terrorism with everything we have. Like her or not, you wouldn't want her mad at you and I am pretty sure, as a senator from New York, she is not happy with the bad guys.Now, for the book itself: Birmingham picks up with near perfection on not just the extension of military and social evolution the present day suggests, but he also--and you have to really like this in a time travel novel--describes with what seems to this technologically challenged history major/trial lawyer an entirely plausible (insofar as these things can be plausible) time travel mechanism. Worm holes, singularities, quantum foam--apparently these are words that esoteric physicists actually use. I recognize that they are in English, but that is as far as it goes. One thing for sure, even for scientific illiterates, it reads well.Finally, for military history buffs, Birmingham has done his homework. If you ever wanted a great blending of near future with recent past in a military context this is it, bar none. Highly recommended and looking forward to the next two--too bad the ideologues can't lighten up."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While I enjoyed Mr Birmingham's previous works, 'he dided with a falafel in his hand', and 'leviathan' I really loved this book, couldn't put it down. As a longtime fan of these alternative histories I was so glad to find John Birmingham as acomplished an author in the alternative histories as Harry Turtledove.As someone who is living now I really like watching the crusty older generations try to adapt to the kick ass 21st centruy. The most fun is watching how those who live in the a socity where the constant is change clash head on with the staid and steady cast of the 1940s.Not since Douglas Coupland's &quot;Generation X&quot; has an author argued that its the generations who face the suffering of temp employment, the collapse of social instiutuions, constant retaining and job surfing are hence by their nature more adaptable and be able to cahnge the world and can drag the 20th centruy kicking and screaming into tomorrow.My only complaint, how long do I have to wait for book 2?"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love this series, lent my original copy to a friend that never returned it.

Great purchase !"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"From Wikipedia, \\"Alternate history or alternative history[1] is a genre of fiction consisting of stories that are set in worlds in which history has diverged from the actual history of the world. It can be variously seen as a subgenre of literary fiction, science fiction, and historical fiction; different alternate history works may use tropes from any or all of these genres.\\"I must admit that I'm a sucker for novels involving some form of alternate history. Most of them, alas, are rather simplistic; \\"What would happen if Hitler had died in WWI and there had never been a Nazi Germany?\\" They seem to center around battles and daring do.S.M. Stirling has written some excellent stuff (see his Trilogy, \\"Island in the Sea of Time\\"). Also someone rather new, Taylor Anderson, is writing some interesting stuff.But by far, the best of this genre I've ever read is The Axis of Time trilogy by Steve Birmingham. Bold talk, I know. but if you read his stuff, I think you'll agree. The premise is rather simple. A strange experiment in the 21st century pacific throws a bunch of warships (mainly American) back in time to 1942. Most of the ships end up in the pacific, but enough get scattered around the world for all the players, Hitler, Japan, US to get their hands on some.While there's plenty of gore and battle scenes, what sets this apart from others of the genre is the time and effort put the political, economic, and social impart of a large body of people with very advanced technology suddenly appearing. How Birmingham describes that is fascinating! Well written, the characters are fully realized (even the actual historical persons), the plot makes sense. Damn good read!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"The basic vanity of the book is a one way time travelling journey of a fifth generation military force back to the Battle of Midway in the Second World War. The author cleverly sets up his scenario so that the war does not become one sided and the intelligence is more important than anything else the modern warriors bring back with them.The best thing about the book is the intelligence put into the scenario. Both the Allies and the Axis adapt to the effects of the time travel event smartly and with an eye towards victory. Every military historian and enthusiast has indulged in a parlor game like this and this one is done very well.On the other hand, the characters are not very interesting. Mostly they are cardboard cut-outs for whom little empathy or enimity can be mustered. Yamamoto is the only really interesting figure. The dialogue is frequntly flat and too much emphasis is put on racial tensions.But despite its flaws, this is a fun book and it will leave you playing out its wargame for weeks after finishing it."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"There is enough in the book to keep you interested, and turning the page. The idea is intriguing, but it is Science fiction after all. Without rehashing the content of other reviews here I found the Idea of the culture shock Ok but totally overblown. The concept of being able to accelerate the development of technology given information from the future is an intriguing one. Also the idea of the fact that by changing the past the strategic knowledge that you brought with you from the future would become useless pretty quickly. The political aspects of the novel are less satisfactory. But I will follo through on the trilogy to see how it pans out"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Similar to the movie The Final Countdown, but more futuristic. Whether you believe in time travel oralternate realities, this book is still entertainig. Waiting to read the second book now."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Ok, the idea is not new -- a naval task force is sucked into a black hole and transported back into the Pacific right before a major battle of WW II. The idea has been written about before, done as a \\"B+\\" grade movie whose title I have forgotten now. But all of that does not matter -- Weapons of Choice combines three genres in an interesting way that makes for an entertaining book well worth the read if you like any of the three genre's it uses: Naval Warfare, Time Travel-counterfactuals, and Sci Fi.The first is the war novel, or more appropriately the large scale war novel. Here Birmingham has created an environment as rich and as real as anyone. Think about how well structured Clancy's Red Storm Rising and you get the idea. I would recommend this book for people who enjoy reading navy combat novels as they involve multiple ships and multiple weapon systems.Second this is a time travel novel and before that turns you off, it's not a Back to the Future type of novel. Rather than going back in time, the fleet goes to an alternate version of Earth at an earlier time. That removes most of the 'funny business' involved in time travel novels like the oedipal stuff about meeting your mother when she's 16. So if you might be scared off because of the time travel aspects, don't be.Finally this is a science fiction novel, not the 'gleaming spaceship' type of SCIFI but near term science fiction stuff you can imagine coming on line in the next 20 years. So its science, fiction but not so beyond reality as to compromise the story.The thing that clinches this book for me is the perspective -- it's written by an Australian not an American or Englishman. This gives the novel a nice edge and an expanded view. For example part of the fleet consists of elements from Indonesia, much of the action happens in the western pacific, and the world view is decidedly non-US. This perspective allows the author to make some interesting twists -- for example the main future aircraft carrier is named after the U.S.'s greatest recent wartime president Hillary Clinton.The book does try to explore cultural issues related to race, women in the military and sexual practices. Fortunately these are side bars to the main line of the story and the characters. While Birmingham has to deal with these issues and I think believes that they are a bigger part of the story then they really are and that is a good thing.Overall big thumbs up for the first book in this series as bringing the best of both while avoiding many of the pitfalls."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I love alternate history and of course the story of naval task force being teleported from modern times into 1942 was enough to attract my attention.There are few things however, i found rather irritating in this book.1)First battle described just went on and on. It could have been cut down quite a bit without losing anything. 2)This book is feminist dream come true-everyone amazingly politically correct and heaven forbid, some woman gets an apprasing glance from 1942 guys. He is immediately reprimanded by modern sailors who are the models of proffesionalism. Not to say that our navy is not proffesional but Mr Birmingham will make you believe that men will treat women like men and everyone is happy. Well, in feminist dream perhaps.3)You will also have to put up with ships named \\"Hilary Clinton\\" and dialogue that explains to idiot newcomers that she\\"was the best president we ever had since Ronald Reagan\\"(Can I throw up now?)Other than that, its an interesting story.

Every one of the 1942 era individuals in the book is a borderline fascist, homophobe, bigot, etc., while the \\"modern\\" 21st protagonists vary between incredibly shallow, two-dimensional characters (the women in particular make Lara Croft seem like DaVinci) or smug and self-righteous.

I WON'T be wasting my money on the 3rd book"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As an avid \\"time travel\\" fan I'm really easy to please, but I found this book trying too hard, in several areas, to make it a winner. As you can see from my title (and other reviews) this author is all about being politically correct in referring to the future navies of the world (female submarine and battleship commanders, etc). Call me a neanderthal, but all of these \\"strong\\" women ordering sailors around reminds me of several other current authors who portray women in their stories as Delta Force commandos and Navy SEALS. And the women from the future, particularly the two female reporters traveling with the convoy, swear more than sailors from EITHER period. Their personalities are so over-the-top and unattractive, that I kept hoping for at least one of them to be swept overboard. As an example, one \\"future girl\\" develops a relationship with a WWII officer who must watch in horror (via a HUD TV feed) while his big-bad girlfriend pours lead into one enemy Japanese after another. In the meantime he's cowering behind a chair, or some such nonsense, back at the base. Ugh! Please...just stop.The other problem I found with this story was the author's attempt to make an already fantasic premise (modern and WWII ships/crews working the same waters) MORE fantasic by placing the modern Navy 25 years into the future (complete with tri-hulled missle cruisers for example). Not necessary. The effect that our modern Navy would have on sailors from WWII is astounding enough without having transmitters embedded into the necks of crewmen. Kind of like Star Trek mets McHale's Navy.If you must, borrow this from the local library...and don't forget your pantyhose."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I took a chance and bought the set, and am really enjoying this series. He really got into not only the military and historical aspect, but the culture clash of the 1940's versus modern day, like racism, sexuality, etc. And what about those in the past who's future is revealed? Like a young JFK learns he'll someday be president AND then assasinated? Heavy stuff.

People who don't like those likely won't like this. Throw in some time travel and a less biased outlook than say, Patrick Robinson's 'kill all the foreigners that disagree', you get something a bit more Dale Brown than that. A 2021 wormhole tech experiment screws up badly and sends a 21st century Multinational naval force back to 1942, where they proceed to mistakenly shoot the crap out of the US fleet heading to do the same to the Japanese at Midway (complete with Prince Harry and the odd Aussie on board). First of a couple more books, the plot sickens from there as history starts to change."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This is an exciting fast paced sci-fi thriller. The plot; A naval task force that is escorting a scientific vessel doing advanced physics research finds itself caught in a time warp and right in the middle of a key WWII battle in the pacific. This was once done in a Kirk Douglas movie about 25 years ago(The Final Countdown). That unsatisfying movie barely explored the intriguing possibilities that time travellers arriving in the middle of WWII would create. In contrast this book delves fully into all the changed timelines. Any good writer knows that you can't just show up from the future and have a look around without changing anything. The naval task force from 2021, lead by an Admiral of German ancestry causes a lot of political and social turmoil in 1942. This story is well crafted.That Hillary Clinton will become such a distingusihed President she will have a mega aircarft carrier named after her is a bit of a stretch. But the other speculative aspects of 2021 are very plausible, such as the HAL like computers which oversee the advanced weapons of the powerful fleet. The tensions between members of the all white US Navy of the 1940s and the multi ethnic, multi racial 21st century Navy fleet are also well detailed in the book. The Japenese and German officers who have racial and cultural hatred for Americans (and each other)are also well developed. When the time travellers from the future bring historical information about their future demise they seize upon this as an opportunity to change strategy and find victory.Also prominently mentioned is how ordinary Americans of the day were so emotionally fragile that they couldn't cope with the thought of racial hatred so evil and so intense that it would lead to a serious attempt to exterminate the entire Jewish race. Whenever the time travellers insert the holocaust and other WW II atrocities into the war planning discussions the contemporary 1942 military and political leaders(or 'temps' for short)display emotions that indicate they really aren't ready to talk about it. It's clear that the author is well versed in the historical biographies of the famous and infamous WWII actors such as MacArthur, Yamomoto, Hitler, Stalin, Lord Halifax, Churchill, Nimitz and Roosevelt. I enjoyed this book(and the other two in the trilogy) immensely and recommend them all."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This Author knows how to write but his story structure needs some serious work.

First and foremost of these interesting points in my mind is the difference between the social norms of today versus the social norms of 65 years ago. We really are different from our parents' parents.The only regrets the book left me with are (1), it's yet another trilogy. It seems as though every industry in the world today has to think outside the box to improve, yet SF publishers seem bound and determined to maintain the \\"trilogy\\" publishing model. Few writers seem capable of cranking out the sequels, which usually become weaker and weaker as the author is forced to beat his or her topic to death.(2) There is no satisfying conclusion. But, of course there isn't. It's a trilogy. Maybe if the author manages to fulfill the publisher's expectation of another two books, they will let him write a book that stands alone--that is, a novel that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. (Imagine, for a moment, a composer being forced by the recording company to write songs that have no ending, in the hope they can sell a second and third track that will complete the sequence....) The author will no doubt be happier, and the readers will probably be happier, too.I was going to make a point #3, but it's a rehash of the above, so I won't.In essence, I enjoyed the book, but I was disappointed by the lack of an ending. I cannot blame the writer for this...I knew it was a trilogy before I bought it, so I have no one to blame but myself.I hope this author is given the opportunity to write a novel that is complete in and of itself.

It looked like I had found one--a lesbian with a chip on her shoulder, but then she disappeared. Honestly, there was not one likeable person in the book. I kept hoping the plot would make up for the liberal manifesto (like the USS Hillary Clinton, named after the \\"greatest\\" president). The story was convoluted and disjointed. Finally, just past half way through the book, I could take no more. For some reason, the author seemed more determined to show the reader how unenlightened people of the 1940's were, and how liberal and sexually uninhibited the people of the future had become.

The clash of cultures is done well, as are the political elements. Yamamoto is a surprisingly sympathetic and engaging character, as well as a formidable adversary.All in all, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

I like alternate history in general and enjoy some good military sci fi now and then. This has both of those elements, plus some interesting thoughtful bits.PROS: Quite a lot of thought is given to the cultural differences between the characters from the future and past. How would 1940s society react if American female or minority soldiers appeared to fight in WWII? This is an interesting question and is explored in good detail. There's a wide variety of interesting characters and subplots in different countries. The future navy isn't invincible and some thought went into designing the technologies of the future.CONS: The way that more and more ships from the future pop out in different places on Earth through the series starts to feel a little contrived. This together with the massive \\"main event\\" makes it perhaps less elegant than some more subtle alternate history books. But it's still a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Going for this novel is interesting speculation about what would happen with a futuristic battlegroup in 1942. Particularly intriguing was the notion that the \\"good guys\\", the Allies, might not be totally comfortable with the mores and expectations of a contemporary military team that included, for instance, female commanders, or Japanese members of a multinational taskforce. Characters were flat, unfortunately, and intentionally secondary to the technobattlescape described in lurid and overripe technomilitary jargon. And, apparently, the Islarmic Jihaad has continued well into the future."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Quite detailed speculations about the impact of a 2021 fleet into 1942. Parts of the book also touch on aspects of the war often ignored in books of fiction or non-fiction written for a US audience. General MacArthur is shown in his Brisbane headquarters, and a brief narrative sidenote is made of his good relations with the Australian Prime Minister Curtin. Plus there are other scenes in Australia. Outside Australia nowadays, it is usually forgotten that several hundred thousand US soldiers and sailors were stationed in Australia during the war. The war was after all a global conflict, so standard histories of it barely have room to touch on this. Being Australian, I found it refreshing to see a story with credible Australian scenes and dialog. For the latter, an example is where a person from 2021 says she went to \\"uni\\", whereas an American would say \\"college\\". The author is an Aussie, so that is how we see these nuances.The book is heralded as one of a trilogy. Good, because a later book may correct one thing that seems to have been omitted here. The technology from 2021 is too advanced from 1942 for the latter to easily make the weapons and tools used by the newcomers. But the computers can be used as computational engines, immensely exceeding the electromechanical dinosaurs of 1942. In fact, a German character points this out. But thus far in the plot, none of the Allied characters seems to have done this.There is a very specific and obvious application. The Manhattan Project. By 1942, it had the world's greatest concentration of scientists. A big problem for them, and the engineers, was getting numerical results from equations. Richard Feynman, for example, organised a group of women as cellular automata, passing computed numbers back and forth. Each woman had a slide rule or a calculator.To the Project, simply having a few computers, possibly with personnel from 2021 to operate them, would be a huge step forward. Also, the scientists of 1942 would certainly have been able to learn a programming language of the computers. Forget any fancy graphics. Just being able to code in a pure number crunching language like Fortran would have led them speed up the design of the weapons.Of course, there are all sorts of other factors. Just knowing that a fission bomb is possible would have helped morale. (In our timeline, we had to have Trinity to be sure.) Plus, the 2021 fleet seems to have had nukes. So there are possibilities like using a few of these, disarmed, to guide the Project's design. Assuming that the nukes are not too advanced to make this infeasible.Plus, simply from a storytelling vantage, if the author brings in the Project, it lets him have luminaries like Oppenheimer, Teller, Bethe and Feynman walk across the stage."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book is fantastic - I'll just come out and say it outright. Birmingham takes the best of early Clancy (tight plot, detailed knowledge), combines it with best of Sterling (imaginative historical setting) and throws in great characterization of a large cast of heroes and villains. It would be easy to have the book slip into 'Good guys kick ass with futuristic weapons', but Birmingham indulges it in moderate amounts this book requires. The very realistic examination of cultural problems and issues surrounding the intermix between two very different people is handled deftly and interestingly.Birmingham really has what it takes to be a top notch SF writer. It's been a long, long time since I've looked towards a second novel of a trilogy with such anticipation."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book just doesn't let you drop it until you're done. I am a very conservative book-buyer, so I don't buy a book at a whim and without reading what others have said about it. So I was extremely cautious taking this book without any recommendations for or against it.Needless to say, when I opened this book, I did not drop it until I was done, only breaking for sleep. (Bought it late a Friday night). One of the things I love about this book is that the people from the future come to the past weakened. A lot of their technological advantage is lost when they hit the transition to the past.The other thing I like about this book is the accurate representation of racism and homophobia prevalent among the Americans and the other Allies (usually portrayed as the \\"good guys\\" in World War II). This racism goes to the extreme that two characters are murdered for this.There are great moments of comedy, including naming the carrier in the group after Hillary Rodham-Clinton, the best wartime president who happened to get assasinated. If you're Republican or Democrat, one cannot help but find this line hillarious.In the end, an excellent book. Had some problems with some of the technical factors. If memory serves, the fighters used F-22 (which are not a carrier-based design) and the carrier is named Hillary Clinton, instead of Hillary Rodham-Clinton (the Navy uses the name of the person as he used it in life, i.e. the USS Harry S. Truman instead of the USS Harry Truman), but those are minor things.All in all, a great book, highly recommended. I am awaiting the second of the books in this series. If this is the beginning, I look forward to not dropping the sequel until I turn the last page."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As a first novel, not shabby at all.This is not military SF, BTW - so far as I can see Birmingham has never served in any military capacity. For the record, neither have I - but in general I find (and have been told by those with experience) that realistic-seeming writing about the actual experience of military action and military life tends to come from authors with prior experience (Drake, Laumer, Pournelle, Ringo - even Heinlein).What's great about WOC are the social questions it raises. How would a 21st century, multinational, multiethnic, mixed gender fighting force interact with pre- Civil Rights World War II Americans? As an outsider Birminham provides an interesting take on what might happen. He's not great at the personal level - characters are basically one-dimensional - but on a macro \\"worlds collide\\" basis it's rather interesting. He also throws in a number of little inside jokes for attentive fans of alternate history SF, which is cute.I would say this book isn't nearly as good as some alternate history attempts from more experienced authors (Eric Flint, whose positive review of Weapons of Choice appears up above, leaps to mind.) However, while it's probably not going to be a sci-fi classic, it's a good enough story. I just ordered the 2nd book in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In WEAPONS OF CHOICE, John Birmingham describes an alternate history America of the type that brings to mind films like THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT or any novel by Harry Turtledove. In 2021, a multinational fleet is sent to Indonasia to quell an ethinc cleansing, the roots of which began in our timeline. On one of these warships, scientists have built a device that reconstructs the temperature one nanosecond after the Big Bang. Such colossal heat punches a hole between their time and 1942, sucking the entire fleet and placing it smack dab in the midst of the Battle of Midway. Such a concept of time travel by a powerful military group is inherently interesting not only for the inevitable paradoxes that altered history may cause in future history texts, but also for the correspondingly inevitable clashes between the racist mindsets of both Axis and Allied mentalities and the more utopian and advanced non-racist non-sexist attitudes of the Western world circa 2021.Part of the charm of this novel lies in the peeling away of 1942 contemporary attitudes not only by the more enlightened personnel from the future but also by the racist and sexist characters from both the Axis and Allied forces. In the former case, the transplanted future fighters have an intense moral qualm: do they resist the lawful orders of President Roosevelt to replace the female and minority senior combat officers with white males or do they bow to the inevitability of recognizing that such officers can not exist for another eighty years? In the latter case, both American and Fascist warleaders agree that the need to remove such personnel from positions of authority is more important than what these officers can accomplish with their wonder weapons from the future. As I read through WEAPONS OF CHOICE, I could sense that this book is a novelized polemic. Its purpose was not to titillate the reader with the the need to rewrite future history texts, but rather the author wants to show that as time passes there is a concommitant advance in both weapons technology and people technology. The world can more easily accept the wonders of atomizing a far distant enemy by merely pushing a few buttoms than the far more difficult task of accepting the belief that all men (and women) are created equal, whether in a combat or civilian context. In WEAPONS OF CHOICE, John Birmingham presents the first of his Axis of Time trilogy that is sure to raise the cackles of manly men who have a mindset fixed in the mold of 1942 or 2005."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Weapons of Choice is a fascinating book that flows well with an adequate plot. Characters are over the top which proved useful in contrasting 'uptimers' from the 1940s characters. I had a problem towards the end of the book with the 'uptimers' target for their all out attack. I would think that battling terrorist and engaging in a battle against terrorist they would emphasize the philosophy of Kill the Head and the Body Dies.I didn't have as much of a problem with the soldiers and marines being the paragons of good. In a volunteer and professional military, the overall standard of personnel will be much higher then the general draft of the 40s.Pro- Exciting combat scenes, contrast of how alien the future can be, drives the point home how much technology and ideology has changed the last 50 yearsCon- Unrealistic military choice of target, characters were slightly over the top,"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"After seeing this novel at my local book store completely by accident, I picked it up and like a good number of people drawn to this book, I couldn't help but notice the incredible similarities (some would say outright copy) of the early '80's movie, 'Final Countdown' with Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen. In that tale, the USS Nimitz, on duty off the coast of Hawaii, encounters a mysterious weather pattern which follows and eventually envelops the carrier and when they emerge, they find themselves captive in the same world, but the date is December 6th 1941 -- the day BEFORE the sneak-attack on Pearl Harbor by the Naval & Air Forces of Japan. Coincidence? It would seem ridiculous to say this story wasn't at least partially influenced by that movie.With that aside, the story begins rather fast and the journey from the year 2021 back to 1942 doesn't take long at all...however, as another reviewer also mentioned, the author seems to take quite a bit of unnecessary time setting the stage for the Multi-National Forces as they are unexpectedly and instantly transported smack in the middle of the American Task Force on the way to Midway to battle with the Japanese Navy. The resulting shock to both sides and the unfortunate battle that takes place was well done...but again, after so many pages I couldn't help but wonder when it would end. It seemed to last forEVER. MUCH too long. Yes, it was filled with great military descriptions and great battles, but it just went on for way too many chapters. Had the editors, or even the author chopped this down to a more appropriate length, this first novel by John Birmingham would have rated at LEAST 4 stars. Well written and quite entertaining (for the most part) I found it an easy read overall and found myself rather curious as to where the story would lead to next.One more thing: Like a few other reviews I have read here, I couldn't help but feel as though this entire story most likely could have been done in one single, large volume rather than over the course of a multi-novel arc. I understand the marketing value of such a plan, however unfortunately as it so often does, it ends up diluting the story so much in order to s-t-r-e-t-c-h it out that the entire series suffers needlessly. Maybe it could have been done in two books, but any more than that and well, everybody suffers -- especially the readers. I DO hold out high hopes that I am proven wrong in this matter and the author totally redeems himself with the second novel, 'Designated Targets'...I AM planning on buying and reading it, but until I am proven wrong, and somehow I believe deep down I won't, I'll stick with my initial beliefs. All in all I would have to say I enjoyed the book for the most part, and do look forward to picking up the next installment. Time will tell, however whether or not it will meet, exceed or fall flat compared with this one."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm embarrassed to say that I picked up this book only because I noticed the tagline, &quot;World War II - with an astonishing twist.&quot; Since the book was in the sci-fi section of the bookstore, I guessed it was an alternate-history type of book. However, I was so engrossed in the story that I ended up spending an hour and a half reading through the first 250 pages of the book at the bookstore, and I eventually bought it (partially influenced out of guilt, hehe). The book extends the current &quot;war on terrorism&quot; into 2021, then takes a task force of that violent, future time and drops them into 1942. The imagination of the author far outstrips anything like the movie &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. Imagine what would happen if laser-guided, wide-area cluster munitions were unleashed upon early 20th-century fortifications, supported by attack helicopters and other combined arms. It's simultaneously frightening and compelling. Add to that a comparison of the social conditions of the 1940s with the multinational, multiethnic cultures of the 21st century, and you get an excellent book. I can't wait for the next one in the trilogy!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have to confess that I have not read any of John Birmingham's other works as yet, but if Weapons of Choice is anything to go by, I'd best remedy this oversight asap. I bought the book on Friday and finished it Sunday evening. It's one of those books.A tightly-written thriller, this is a welcome addition to the Alternative History canon. Weapons of Choice is, on the most superficial level, the technogeek's dream of 21st century superweapons meeting WWII technology, but it promises and delivers so much more; Birmingham explores the social dislocation of a generation inured to total war finding themselves in an environment where their social and military organisation is viewed as alien and threatening.Birmingham's WWII setting is still within living memory, and the near future he postulates for his cast of displaced persons from 2021 is entirely plausible, yet the characters from each of these periods view one another as almost another species. We stand between them and observe their interaction, and can empathise with both groups.John Birmingham has struck Alternative History gold with Weapons of Choice. I recommend it to any fan of Stirling, Turtledove, or the great H. Beam Piper of blessed memory.Now can we please have Volumes 2 & 3, preferably yesterday?"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"While Weapons of Choice is marketed as Alternate History,I think that term is misleading; to me Alternate History is a story built around something that plausibly might have happened, such as: What if Napoleon had won at Waterloo? or what if the plot to kill Hitler in July of 1944 had succeeded? or maybe what if Nixon had not been forced to resign? All these things might have happened; a multinational force from the year 2021 could not travel back to the year 1942 because of a worm hole experiment gone wrong. Therefore the events of Weapons of Choice are not an alternative under any circumstance, I'd prefer to think of it as science fantasy.And on that point, author John Birmingham does a very good job of making the impossible seem viable, a necessity in pulling off any good fantasy. He also has a good sense of the action scene and an almost Tom Clancy like ability to describe modern weapons and systems. He also puts in a few clever in jokes concerning other Alternate History series.Much has been made of the clash of cultures depicted when the modern multiracial military force interacts with the world of 1942; Birmingham has been criticized for making all of the 20th Century characters excessively racist and sexist, and rightly so. I was raised by people of the Greatest Generation, in the South no less, and can testify that such attitudes as expressed in this book were not universal. I think the author was trying to milk the dramatic potential for conflict between two vastly different Americas for all it was worth, it's just that he lays it on way too thick at times. All of the modern characters are often too good to be true, as if racism were completely eradicated by 2021. And a ship's captain who's black and a lesbian? Again, laying it on a bit thick. And the female reporter from the 21st Century is just too over the top.There is one other problem, and it's the central one to all historical fiction: the real historical personages always make the fictional characters seem as flat as wallpaper when they interact, this is because no made up character could ever be as compelling as Adolf Hitler. But I commend writer Birmingham for doing his homework and giving us quite accurate portraits of FDR, Admiral Yamamoto, Einstein and Douglas MacArthur.If anyone wants to read a great historical account of the battle of Midway, I would suggest searching out The Winds of War and War and Remembrance by Herman Wouk. It does true justice to the brave men of 1942.All in all, Weapons of Choice is a good read despite its flaws, and if you liked other books in this genre, you'll enjoy this one as well. It is the first in a series, so don't expect everything to be wrapped up by the last chapter."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"\\"Weapons of Choice\\" is not as good as I expected. As the other reviewers have covered the plot, I will just add that I was distracted in the story development by the multiple story lines, the inconsistency in the characters, and the somewhat boring middle of the book.There also was only a limited climax, and the book just left me feeling that I did not want to read anymore of this story. So I will pass on the next books. I do hope they are better, but \\"Weapons of Choice\\" while predicated on an interesting subject, and a book which did have potential, failed to live up to what I was looking for in a novel."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"When I found this book's description, I thought I'd found a modern vs. WWII book similar to Final Countdown, but with a more satisfying story. Instead I found I was even more dissatisfied than I was with the movie. First books in series need to grab the reader with a great story that holds his interest. Instead we get an interminable painful telling of \\"transition\\" to 1942 such that both the modern multinational fleet and the WWII U.S. Pacific fleet virtually annihilate each other. This would be bad enough but to take up so much of the text of the book with this initial brutal pointless exercise made me page forward until it was over (the first time I can remember doing that in any book). There ARE no epic clashes with the Japanese and such battles as exist are at the end of the book where they reach an unsatisfying and poor resolution. It's not really an integrated story, just a very bad introduction to a badly written, badly plotted story.And the plot isn't the only problem. The multinational group is composed of fairly good characters, if a little 2 dimensional - the hard driving embedded reporters, the smart and tough fleet commander, etc. But the characters from 1942 are cartoon caricatures of wartime personalities from movies, only more so. There are some interesting treatments of the clashes between the 2021 navy's attitudes and the less enlightened attitudes of 40's but they're lost in the poorly threaded plots. It's a shame too because when the combat comes it's not badly written. It's too bad it's not more plausible and there isn't more of it. After all, what the book promises but doesn't deliver is the spectacle of the Germans and Japanese finding themselves up against modern weaponry - something we were ultimately denied in Final Countdown. I won't be buying the sequels."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book has all the makings of an excellent potboiler. The various motivations of the Allied and Axis sides who all of course covet the obvious kingmaking power this misplaced future fleet has are handled well. The author obviously has extreme affection for some of the WWII central figures and spends a good deal of time having them interact with our future arrivals.Where it fall down, and really falls down, is the portrayal of the WWII rank and file as being nearly to a man, ignorant bigots without a brain to share between then. Race relations were obviously much cruder back then, but surely the whole -- Gooooliieeeeee, would you lookit that Cleatus, that there (insert minority slur here), is in the room without a serving tray! - does not need to be whipped early and often. I think the author did the book a disservice by not allowing some complexity to exist in that area. Its also not believable to suppose that 100% of 1940 era males would be fantastically shocked that any female would be offended by a nice pat on the butt. Plus the characters contradict themselves. First they marvel at how a dad-gum women is flying an aircraft, and then in the next breath declare that Amelia Earhart would probably fly circles around them. Can't have it both ways, either they are amazed and confused, or understand the concept.That said, it possible the overlook that shortcoming, and skim the love story chapters. (I really didn't care much about the budding love story between the 40's officer and gentleman, and the 2021, brassy and plucky female reporter. Especially since the authors love story dialogue is alot like his guys on the bridge of the carrier dialogue. Just a bunch of snappy banter.) There are some decent and believable conflicts set up, and our uptimers don't have the namby pamby hesitation to muck with history (Oooo, what if I somehow get my daddy killed off!). Action and conflict are pretty much what one would expect from a book with this title, and that's mostly what is delivered.Just read it for fun."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"As such, 3 stars at best. What it really is someone's Sociology Thesis. As that, it's pretty good.As sci-fi milfic, it's got holes. For one, the author did minimal research on the military. The USMC doesn't have medical officers. The USN supplies all medical services to the USMC, including Corpsmen who go into battle with the Marines. It's also very doughtful that there will be fusion powered super carriers in service by 2021, or personal combat armor that has a direct MMI (Man Machine Interface) to the wearer.Seeing the 1942 reaction to a modern multiracial/multinational taskforce was the true focus of the book. Keep in mind that America was probably the most \\"progressive\\" of the allied forced at the time.The USMC was all White, and the Navy only allowed blacks to serve in the Mess, but the Army not only had a long history of black combat troops, it also had serving black officers by that point.Keep in mind that colored troops were sent to Cuba during the Spanish American War, because they were considered some of the best combat troops at the time!The interaction between the mid 20th century and the early 21st personnel is where this book is worth the cover price.If you want straight milfic or Scifi Milfic, you are better off with David Drake or John Ringo."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Another reviewer complained that \\"Every one of the 1942 era individuals in the book is a borderline fascist, homophobe, bigot.\\" Well not _all_ are, but most. Yet this was reality in the 1940s military, when blacks were not allowed in combat units, filipinos were only mess attendants, and woman were drivers and typists. Homosexuals were at best shunned. The real issue in the story is that the modern contingent is a bit too smoothly integrated.When I first saw the back cover blurb, I thought it was going to be a ripoff of \\"The Final Countdown,\\" but Birmingham takes quite a different path. The issue of merging a 21st century naval battle group with a navy that is almost at 19th century technology levels is one he starts to approach, but actually puts off for the sequel. By which time the newcomers will have expended most of their ammunition and other consumables. There is a twist at the end when Yamamoto makes a stunning, and brilliant strategic move.P.S. The edition I read (not the one listed here) could have used better editing.

I particularly like the line about the prisoners being held in the Philippines and Singapore, \\"If they were our people we would go get'um!\\". The phrase just so neatly sums up the leave no one behind theme of the modern military? The WWII generation just were nave to the pervasive evil of their foes; but, alas we are not strangers to that evil are we?

However, it is a good book, and while I have not finished it yet, I am willing to check out the other books in the series when they come out. The book is pretty well researched and realistic, but the beginning has a bit too many characters and it takes a while for them to fall into place. I agree with one reviewer who said that the initial battle scene went on too long, I think that that was a factor in my not getting into the book as much.All in all, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes revisionist \\"what-if\\" fiction, it is a good read."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Finally got to read some over Christmas.

In a science fiction story, real science is an integral part of the story. Real science has no connection to moving a fleet decades backwards in time. Nor is it supposed to, nor does it have to.This book is very well written. I liked the opening scenes, where it slowly dawns on the leaders of the 1942 fleet that the newcomers have awesome weapons and are good shots. The author draws these scenes out to explain the confusion on both sides that becomes central to the rest of the book. The depiction of the contrast between the two worlds is great. Ask some people in their seventies about the America of their childhoods if you don't believe it.More than that, I like the situation it poses: what would folks do if they were in the middle of a war and some newcomers showed up from several decades into the future? Not just one person that no one would hear about, let alone believe. But quite a few of them!

Although the excitement and adventure of a world war and a devastating clash of technology keeps the story moving along, the author also delves deeply into the cultural shock between the \\"'temps\\" (contemporaries) and the time travelers. The personal and cultural reactions between the two groups are surprising and revealing. Old salts from the WWII navy have a hard time dealing with female naval officers, diverse ethnic groups in responsibility and authority and the \\"modern\\" social outlook of the misplaced servicemen and women.

Birmingham, whose previous works I found to be a great read, has caught my attention with this brilliant story of time travel and it's consequences.He gets you hooked from the first page and the action never stops. The best thing about it, is that it makes you think. With the world in the mess it is today, this book quickly paints a picture of what our not-too-distant future could be like.Having had a father who fought in WW2, I found the way in which Birmingham depicts the characters of the era exactly as they were - it was a different time and he makes that distinction well - their reactions to their 21st Century counterparts made all the more realistic through their dialogue and actions.While I was a fan of Birmingham prior to reading this book, I can only say that he has cemented himself as one of my favourite story tellers.I will be keeping an eye out for the sequels to come!"},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I picked this up thinking it would be another \\"Boys Own\\" alternative history fantasy that operated at a \\"candy floss for the male techno mind\\" level - which I enjoy as pure escapism.However, it turned out to be both techno stuff and social collisions, which is unusual for this genre.Reading all the reviews here helped as I now agree the author is pointing out that both 2020 and 1940s mindsets have their +s and -s (he has kept in mind the quote \\"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there\\", L.P. Hartley).In the end I was reading more for the social collisions and less for the technology stuff.As regards the complaints about such things as the aircraft carried named \\"Hilary Clinton\\", the author is Australian and indulging in irony which can be,according to author Bill Bryson, confusing to North Americans (PS good to see the author contributed a \\"review\\" as well!).I gave this 3 stars as I want to see how the rest of the series works out and if the author can sustain the good beginning."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"In full disclosure, I downloaded this novel when it was available as a free Kindle download, for which I want to thank Mr. Birmingham; it was a generous thing to do, and I enjoyed the time rreading.This is a good alternate-history/timeline-jumping military science fiction story with a number of elements that make it it unique and a fun read. There are some blemishes, some of which are hard to get past, but overall do not distract from the enjoyability of the novel.First, the good:The novel is a lot of fun for the first 3/4's of the novel. There is a completely expected juxtaposition of a modern (2020) military force and a 1940's military force on its way to Midway. The mechanism by which this happens is given away in the first 50 pages or so, so it's no spoiler, and the fun begins after that anyway.The weapons systems, military jargon, and general treatement of the way a naval warship works is authentic and well-researched, as is the stark difference between the 1940's technology and the more modern technology of \\"our future\\".The pace is gnerally good, except that the initial battle is too drawn out, and suffers a bit from narrative jumps that are sometimes hard to follow, since the various ships have not been well introduced at that point.It's a fun read, as I have already stated. I came away with no great insights, but it is a meat and potatoes sort of military science fiction novel, and I did not expect much in that respect.The bad:There were moments of discontinuity for me as American characters used British vernacular and slang. \\"Have a go\\", is one that stood out, rather than \\"have a try\\" which is the American colloquialism. Because I have lived in the UK for 6 years, I am attuned to this, and it stood out for me.In addition, the debate in the book about understanding the culture and motivations of the Axis is a slice from modern-day GWOT (we can't call it that anymore, can we?). This doesn't seem to be working for us now. I guess it's just wishful thinking, but I would hope those working this problem 10 years from now would have caught on by then.The imposition of 20th century morality and judgements on the 1940's era personnel was a little over the top in my opinion. What we are to believe is that there was more or less universal bigotry and visions of ethnic purity in the 1940's, which, as a child of two early 1900's parents, doesn't strike me as quite accurate. More to the point, military personnel who spent their time away from the U.S. were probably much less bigoted than usual, and certainly a little more understanding of cultural concepts than the people in this novel. The author would have us believe that almost no one from that era would meet this group half-way, either they completely abandon their cultural upbringing in favor of the new cultura mores of the travelers (hard to believe) or they would be completely and totally obstinate in their beliefs (also hard to believe).Finally, I fail to understand why in his quest to create strong female characters, the females are almost universally cursed with male sex drives, including the drive for indiscriminate multiple sexual trysts. This required more than a normal suspension of disbelieve for me. This may be cultural; the female American reporters strike me in language and sexual aggression as more typical of British women. That may explain it, but a foul-mouthed harlot is still a foul-mouthed harlot. The author had no problem creating a criminal American character, and his motivations and thought processes were much clearer.All in all, a good novel that should appeal to many."},{"Title":"Weapons of Choice (The Axis of Time Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I bet you can't read just one! these are real page turners (or button pushers).

Would suggest this series to anyone who enjoyes reading about the power of the mind."},{"Title":"Collected Poems and Selected Prose (Penguin Twentieth-Century Clas)","review":"I have never known how Housman got away with it, living at the time he did. He failed to obtain honours in his final Schools at Oxford but finished his life as Professor of Latin at Cambridge. He treated his fellow scholars with scarifying contempt in print. His poetry makes it clear without quite flaunting it that he was homoerotic (he would have hated 'homosexual'as being half-Greek half-Latin), and he was not only an atheist but downright blasphemous.Obviously he is best known for his poetry. He was, or affected to be, surprised by the popular success of A Shropshire Lad with its pervasive fixation with death, but the reason is easy to see -- Housman's poetry is catchy. It has 'tingle-factor' in a big way, and the deadly simplicity haunts the memory'So here I'll watch the night and waitTo see the morning shineWhen he will hear the stroke of eightAnd not the stroke of nine'(of a man due to be hanged the next morning). In The Name and Nature of Poetry he makes a very entertaining attempt, largely at the expense of the eighteenth century style, to explain what poetry meant to him, but he gets the point across far better and more briefly in an address on Swinburne when he says 'poetry is a tone of voice, a way of saying things'. That illuminates the matter far better for me than any amount of pretentious lit crit.The finest and most characteristic of all his poems is in Latin, the dedication of his great edition of Manilius to Moses Jackson. Those who have been privileged to study Greek and Latin while they were still mainstream subjects are not likely to forget its last four lines, among the most awesome in any language I can read, but in general I go along with the assessment of him as 'an absolutely marvellous minor poet'. As a scholar he was among the greatest, and he enlivened the dusty pages of classical scholarship with some of the most entertaining prose I have ever read. His address to the Classical Association is entitled uncompromisingly The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism, and his final words to his 'peers' -- 'one thing above all others is necessary, and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head' is only one specimen I can never forget. 'The habit of treading in ruts and trooping in companies that men share with sheep' or 'Stoeber's reprint of Bentley's text, with a commentary intended to refute it, saw the light in 1767 in Strasbourg, a city still famous for its geese' are others.I neither know nor care what his relationship with Jackson amounted to in practice other than that Jackson was the love of his life. He did not hesitate to to publish in the press his brilliant satirical poem on the imprisonment of Oscar Wilde, and I gather there was a tacit understanding among the dons of Trinity never to refer to his poetry. That poem ends with another of his great fixations'He can curse the God that made him for the colour of his hair.' Like other notable atheists, e.g. Johannes Brahms, Housman knew the scriptures inside-out and he made witty use of them -- I treasure in particular the scholar who 'has rendered Greek nonsense into English nonsense and gone on his way rejoicing'.The photograph of him on the cover of this book is more favourable than many others which make him look as if he was descended from a long line of maiden aunts, as someone once said. Be that as it may, I recommend this book to anyone not yet familiar with a great mind and a brilliant and fascinating writer."},{"Title":"Collected Poems and Selected Prose (Penguin Twentieth-Century Clas)","review":"This is a first rate edition of Housman's poetry and considerably more, including some of his prose and letters. The latter will largely be of interest to scholars and most will read this book for the poetry. As a poet, Housman's reputation rests on his 2 slender collections, A Shropshire Lad, and Last Poems. Some additional poems, including deft parodies, were published posthumously, but the real meat is in Shropshire and Last.Preoccupation with death, the transience of life and youth, and frustrated love are the themes of this poetry. Housman's relatively short, powerful lyrics, direct style, and remarkably evocative phrases (has anyone ever described a youthful relaxed summer better than \\"the idle hill of summer\\") make many of these poems among the most anthologized in the English language."},{"Title":"Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025","review":"Edit of 21 Dec 07 to add links and new comment,New Comment: In my view, this is the single most important work of the century with respect to American moral diplomacy. I note with concern that under Bush-Cheney \\"Failed States\\" have increased from 75 in 2005 to 177 in 2007. We've lost our mind, and our morals, as a Nation.Ambassador Mark Palmer puts to rest all those generally unfair stereotypes of Foreign Service Officers as \\"cookie pushing\\" softies who fall in love with their host countries and blame America for any flaws in the bi-lateral relationship. With this book he provides an inspiring model for precisely what every Foreign Service Officer should aspire: to understand, to articulate, and then to implement very great goals that serve democracy and help extend the bounty of the American way of life--moral capitalism and shared wealth--to every corner of the world.This is a detailed and practical book, not just visionary. It is useful and inspiring, not just a personal view. It is also a damning indictment of fifty years of US White House and Congressional politics, where in the name of anti-communism and cheap oil America--regardless of which party has been in power, has been willing to consort with the most despotic, ruthless, murderous regimes in the history of mankind. Still alive today and still very much \\"friends\\" of the U.S. Government are dictators that think nothing of murdering millions.There has been some improvement, offset by an increase in partly free countries. From 69 countries not free at all in 1972 we now have 47. From 38 countries partly free in 1972 we now have 56, many of those remnants of the former Soviet Union. Free countries have nearly doubled from 43 to 89, but free and poor is quite a different thing from free and prosperous.The level of detail and also of brevity in this book is quite satisfying. On the one hand, Ambassador Palmer provides ample and well-documented discussion of the state of the world, on the other he does not belabor the matter--his one to two-paragraph summative descriptions of each of the dictatorships is just enough, just right.He distinguishes between Personalistic Dictatorships (20, now less Hussein in Iraq); Monarch Dictators (7, with Saudi Arabia being the first in class); Military Dictators (5, with US allies Sudan and Pakistan and 1 and 2 respectively); Communist Dictators (5); Dominant-Party Dictators (7); and lastly, Theocratic Dictators (1, Iran).Ambassador Palmer makes several important points with this book, and I summarize them here: 1) conventional wisdom of the past has been flawed--we should not have sacrificed our ideals for convenience; 2) dictatorships produce inordinate amounts of collateral damage that threatens the West, from genocide and mass migrations to disease, famine, and crime; 3) there is a business case to be made for ending U.S. support for dictatorships, in that business can profit more from stable democratic regimes over the long-term; and lastly, 4) that the U.S. should sanction dictators, not their peoples, and we can begin by denying them and all their cronies visas for shopping expeditions in the US.The book has an action agenda that is worthy, but much more important is the clear and present policy that Ambassador Palmer advocates, one that is consistent with American ideals as well as universal recognition of human rights. Ambassador Palmer's work, on the one hand, shows how hypocritical and unethical past Administrations have been--both Democratic and Republican--and on the other, he provides a clear basis for getting us back on track.I agree with his proposition that we should have a new Undersecretary for Democracy, with two Assistant Secretaries, one responsible for voluntary democratic transitions, the other for dealing with recalcitrant dictators. Such an expansion of the Department of State would work well with a similar change in the Pentagon, with a new Undersecretary for Peacekeeping Operations and Complex Emergencies, my own idea.This is a very fine book, and if it helps future Foreign Service Officers to understand that diplomacy is not just about \\"getting along\\" but about making very significant changes in the world at large, then Ambassador Palmer's work will be of lasting value to us all.Also recommended, with reviews:A Power Governments Cannot SuppressThe Unconquerable World: Power, Nonviolence, and the Will of the PeopleBlood Money: Wasted Billions, Lost Lives, and Corporate Greed in IraqThe Sorrows of Empire: Militarism, Secrecy, and the End of the Republic (The American Empire Project)The Fifty-Year Wound: How America's Cold War Victory Has Shaped Our WorldWar Is a Racket: The Anti-War Classic by America's Most Decorated General, Two Other Anti=Interventionist Tracts, and Photographs from the Horror of ItThe Paradox of American Power: Why the World's Only Superpower Can't Go It AloneThe Tao of Democracy: Using Co-Intelligence to Create a World That Works for AllThe World Cafe: Shaping Our Futures Through Conversations That MatterFaith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping RealpolitikForthcoming on Amazon in February and also free at OSS.Net/CIB:COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace, edited by Mark Tovey with a Foreword by Yochai Benkler and an Afterword by the Rt.

His case studies range from Chile to the Philippines and make a lot of sense.

War, terrorism, poverty, famine, torture, and other human rights abuses, by and large, result from the actions of about forty-five dictators who control roughly one third of the world's population. The removal of these tyrants through peaceful means and their replacement with responsible democratic governments is the most cogent approach to ending most of these abuses across the globe. Although the author strongly advocates the peaceful removal of tyrants where possible, he does acknowledge the need for military force in some instances.

I found it pretty interesting reading and definitely illuminating as to viewpoints that underlay much of the Reagan and George W. Bush foreign policy. This book gave me a broader understanding of the different views on how to address problem of dictatorships abroad. It helped me to understand the different approaches that statesmen today propose for dealing with today's unrest in the Middle East. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025","review":"AMERICA - ISRAEL. These two dictatorships were not included, probably because the rosy light of Toffler's Third Wave (technology and information leading to continued American domination of the world) was still obscuring the clarity of the Western world (if not some other parts of the world) when the book was written.Why?Because dictators have been put in place as puppets of US control for decades, for one. Dictators have emerged (Iran's theocratic republic) to counter being dictated to by the US, for two.Going back some decades to the Democratic election of Mossadeq in the Iranian 1953 elections. Well, that was overthrown by the CIA in order to keep the Iranian oil monopoly in the hands of the West, and by the US installing another dictator, the Shah.So who was the dictator in this exchange, hmm? (Ron Paul speaks on this subject as \\"blowback\\". There is a YouTube on it.)Many other dictatorships named in the book fall under the heading of PUPPETS. Remember Saddam?Another dictator, puppet, with delusions of grandeur, who bit the dust when his \\"use by\\" date was up.Some nations don't like being funnelled into the Western monopolies timeline. So if they rebel, inevitably will they become \\"dictators\\" if they follow another line, dictators within an alternative view?I am thinking that what we are really looking at is simply a schoolyard of bullies (dictators. would-be dictators and those who don't want to play but end up, anyway, in the ring) squaring up. But who are the ones wielding whips and weapons? They are the ones with ultimate dictatorial standing.This book was written in 2003, and since then the gyre of many people's search for truth has widened considerably. For this the REAL AXIS OF EVIL as a topic has an entirely different coloration today. And the naming of it is difficult because it is still hidden in plain sight thanks to the media monopoly of the conduits of information and the tazing of people's minds through idiot programming (violence, horror, sex, slavery, homicide shows as pleasure and entertainment topics), and narrow and shallow broadcasting.A new book on this topic needs to be written with a new list of contenders, with a wider band of questions; for instance, newly identifiable dictatorships may include vastly powerful corporations with too much power dictating behind the veil of \\"business as usual\\" and functioning as quasi-nations in their wealth and reach (Monsanto?) The Vatican is another, but to implicate that will look like the entrance to \\"conspiracy theories.\\" or will it?The tyranny of the pedophile network is a dictatorship and along with it the porn industry. It is spread across many nations. Do both have a hub? Clearly the topic can veer to the existential, philosophy, and human values, so right into the lap of psychology and human identity.However, when I saw the list of contenders for dictatorships in this book, while clearly compelling, I felt the main game, the main meal, had been bypassed for hor d'oeuvres and dessert. We need to arrive at the main meal, somehow.Naming nations not included in this book is a more even approach, by increasing the honest reach of the \\"named.\\"Why should Israel and the US be on the list? That is the first question for the new book."},{"Title":"Breaking the Real Axis of Evil: How to Oust the World's Last Dictators by 2025","review":"While i have not read this book I could not help but write this anyway ..The assumption in official circles is that the US and its foreign policy has been to build freedom and democracy around the world.This is patently false and many of the worlds dictators are American corporate puppets propped up by the CIA.The US is responsible for much of the tyranny in the world because this is its true goal.Look at Central and South America \\"Americas Backyard\\" where the CIA and its policies have run free and it is still a mess after over 100 years of US intervention.The first Axis of Evil is the US and its Intelligence ,Law enforcement agenda.Read \\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\"for a reality check."},{"Title":"The Best 50 Bargain Wines","review":"I would rate the book I purchased for my Son in-law about different wines, great.I was fairly priced and shipping wasn't bad either.

He categorizes collective violence along a spectrum or coordination amongst members and political salience of any damage that occurs. The book is also a tour de force of various types of collective violence (at least circa 2001 in the last edition). Definitely recommended for students of collective violence."},{"Title":"The Politics of Collective Violence (Cambridge Studies in Contentious Politics)","review":"One reason for political scientists to be wary of the analyses offered by their discipline is that sociologists have always been better at providing contemporary political analysis. Charles Tilly goes even further when he comes as a historical sociologist. In The Politics of Collective Violence, he provides, in a readable fashion, an analysis of collective violence through time and space.By forcefully advancing the notion that collective violence is best explained when considered as a form of \\"contentious politics\\", Tilly dismisses the good versus evil dichotomy that seeks to understand any type of violence including collective violence as steaming from evil. By demonstrating the shortcomings of the type of collective violence analysis available so far (\\"ideal\\", \\"behavioral\\", and \\"relational\\"), he highlights relational analysis to tells us that it does not matter what people believe or what their genetic predispositions to violence are for collective violence. This is important because now we recognize individual responsibility without being able to raise anybody's moral superiority (p. 8).The categories of collective violence provided in The Politics of Collective Violence (Violent rituals; coordinated destruction; opportunism; brawls; individual aggression--indeed; individual aggression is considered part of collective violence; scattered attacks; and broken negotiations) seem to include all types of collective violence known so far. Showing the functions of different actors, namely, the \\"political entrepreneurs\\" who differentiate between who is \\"us\\" and who is \\"them\\", the \\"violent specialists\\" who have tools necessary for carrying out damage (corporal, etc.), and, perhaps implicitly, the ordinary people who get co-opted, Tilly demonstrates how complex the task of identifying who is responsible is. This is complemented when he depicts how different types of state governments lead to different types of outcomes in collective violence.Do not expect Tilly to be precise when it comes to facts (as for example when he calls the current president of Rwanda Paul Mugabe (the real name is Paul Kagame, or when he calls Hutus who opposed Habyarimana regime \\"dissidents\\" as if the regime was totalitarian like North Korea for instance and not authoritarian); however, whether or not he misses a fact or two does not affect the overall argument of the book--collective violence must be understood as a form of politics--is not affected. That is the power of history-based theory in explanation. Theory-based arguments are useful especially when one is dealing with policy recommendations such as policy recommendations for reducing collective violence as is the case in this book.Tilly's book is a must for any student of collective violence.

It was very entertaining seeing an interplanetary revolution through the eyes of a ground-pounding teenaged soldier.All of Heinlein's juveniles were good reads, but this one remains one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"I have always loved this bok but couldnt find a new copy of it anywhere.

Definitely one of Heinlein's best of his so-called \\"Juvenile\\" Science Fiction.I recommend this as an introduction to good \\"hard core\\" science fiction."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"This review comes 33 years too late. Heinlein'sSpace Cadetis a favorite, part of my personal Top 10 list. And I wished my Boy Scout troop was like the ones inFarmer in the Sky (Baen Book). But for some reason, I never delved into Heinlein's other juvies. I made the same mistake with the Narnia books, but that is for another review.So I have repented, and this 33 years after I read the comic book version of \\"Between Planets\\" in \\"Boys Life.\\"I like how this book fits within the loose continuity of \\"Space Cadet,\\" although I puzzled over how the books all fit together. The PRS Pathfinder, which plays an important role in \\"Space Cadet\\" is under construction in BP, and, in Harsh Mistress, crashed into Belgium. Are these the same craft? And the Venutian War--where is the Patrol? Where is Oscar Jensen? Are these events before or after Cadet and Farmer?But laying these fanboy perplexities aside, we have a roaring adventure in the tradition of H. Ryder Haggard or Robert Louis Stevenson'sKidnapped: (RED edition Penguin Classics). Don Harvey could hold is own against David Balfour, and has the benefits of rocket-ships and Dr. Isaac Newton, a thinly-disguised Worsel (The Dragon Lensman: Second Stage Lensman Trilogy, Vol. 1). The Dragon With A Thousand Faces?Yes, many of the plot-points are stock and stale. But the same can be said about Indiana Jones. (Nuke the fridge!) The key is characterization and execution. Also, Heinlein's observations about military life help: \\"Don made a rhetorical and most ungracious suggestion as to what the Captain could do about it and slit silently to his feet. \\" (Chapter 13).Nope, this is not Matt Dodson and Lt. Wong. I miss the high ideals of the Patrol, but--grudgingly, I guess--we need this side of life. Every organization has its ideals, the theory, but the theory must also be broad enough to take reality, or practice into account.But the take-home lesson is sound. Life has curve-balls, sometimes sorting out right and wrong can be difficult for a callow lad, be kind to strangers because friends matter, and, although an ending is not wrapped-up into a nice tinsely package, it still can be a good, happy, and fulfilling one ...... because that is what life is like."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"I enjoyed reading this story. It is one of Heinlein's juveniles so it's a fairly standard 'coming of age' story. It's not as good as 'Citizen of the Galaxy,' but I found it a good read. I particularly enjoyed the contrast between RH's successful technological predictions (space stations, sat phones) and his unsuccessful predictions (his characters are still using slide rules!). When he wrote, integrated circuits and the computer revolution of the 1980s were still decades in the future. Who knows if a faster-than-light space ship is possible? We'll just have to wait and see.RH understood economics and history even better than technology. His portrait of the struggles between colonies and an Imperialistic (if ironically claimed to be democratic) power rings as true today as it did in the 18th century.Modern readers will feel comfortable with Heinlein's non-white characters. RH was ahead of the times with his sympathetic and realistic treatment of Chinese and Native people."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Heinlein is a name to be reckoned with in Science Fiction. This was the first book of his which I read and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It is a quality adventure story and well-suited even for a SF neophyte such as I. Additionally, there are a lot of interesting themes here such as homesickness, authoritarianism, and alienation. Pick this as an introduction to Heinlein."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"\\"Between Planets\\" is one of those novels written during Heinlein's transition from shorter fiction to novels. It was published in 1951, first as a serial titled \\"Planets in Conflict\\" in Blue Book Magazine's September and October issues (note that some sources indicate it was published in three parts, but it appears to have been just the two editions). It was then published under its current title in that same year.The story takes place in the future, where man has colonies on Mars and Venus, and each planet has a sentient native population. On Mars this is an old and dying race which is very fragile and has great difficulty in surviving on Earth or even Venus. On Venus it is a very intelligent long-lived species which most resemble dragons from Earth's mythology. Earth's government has grown very repressive to its colonies as well as the people on Earth, and a conflict is brewing between Earth and its colony on Venus.The protagonist is Don Harvey, a seventeen-year old boy who is the son of scientists currently working on Mars. His father is originally a citizen of Earth and his mother a Venus national. He was born in space, and is considered a citizen of both, or perhaps neither. He is attending school on Earth and has no interest in the politics of the time when his parents send him a note telling him to come to them on Mars. They also want him to see their family friend, Dr. Jefferson, before he leaves Earth.The story follows Don through his interrogation by Earth's security forces (I.B.I.); the receiving of a package he is to give to his father, which consists of what appears to be a cheap ring; the blocking of his trip to Mars by Venus' forces and his subsequent detour to Venus; his attempt to survive on Venus while trying to find a way to either contact his parents and/or to get passage to Mars; the invasion of Venus by Earth; and his decision to join the Venus army. Along the way he meets some interesting characters and finds himself further and further into the conflict between the government of Earth and those opposed to it.This novel is aimed at younger readers of speculative fiction, as was \\"Farmer in the Sky\\" from the previous year. However, unlike \\"Farmer...\\" this book is softer on the science fiction elements and more along the lines of a fantastic adventure, and overall it has a lighter feel to it. There are certainly some flaws to the story: one wonders why two fairly random people on Venus seem to know that the ring Don is carrying is more than it seems, and there is a rather amazing coincidence which helps bring the story together near the end, and lastly the ending itself feels rather abrupt. These problems don't have a big impact on the reader though, as Heinlein has a way of telling a story that you want to keep reading, even if there are some things which don't quite fit.I would have liked to give \\"Between Planets\\" 3-stars, but Amazon does not allow us that option. Since this story does not quite measure up to the 4-star and 5-star Heinlein books, I felt 3-stars would best reflect this stories place in Heinlein's bibliography."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"The standard of Mr. Heinlein's work never fails to amaze me. This book is a great addition to anyone's Heinlein collection."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"I am continually amazed at the consistently high quality of Robert A. Heinlein's writing. Whether he was writing a short story for a pulp magazine, a light adventure story for teenagers, or an epic work for adults, there was one consistent fact running through all of Heinlein's works: they are fun to read. Heinlein's work is the literary anti-thesis of &quot;watching grass grow.&quot; His dialogue was top-notch (the best since Oscar Wilde), and his stories were fast-paced and exciting. Although many claim that he lost his touch in later years and began writing overlong, self-indulgent novels that pushed his hobby horses at the expense of a narrative, his &quot;juvies&quot; - great SF adventure yarns written for teens in the 1950's - remain a fascinating and remarkable staple of this kind of literature. Although his writings then were all fast-paced and extremely fun to read, the truly incredible thing about them is that they are much more than just surface-deep: he consistently packed his books with provocative messages. Although some claim that he often beat you over the head and forced his opinions on you, one must at least admit this of Heinlein: his works were intelligent and thought-provoking; and, whether or not you agree with his opinions, you must certainly respect them. His works teach you to think for yourself - certainly a valuable asset for the growing teen. Between Planets, while not being among the top tier of Heinlein juvies (Red Planet, Tunnel In The Sky, Citizen of The Galaxy), is a fine, fun, and delightful read. Like many Heinlein works, it pushes the virtues of the military, and it features a lot of political and social overtones that may be lost among some of the younger readers for which it was intended - which is precisely why I reccommend this (and Heinlein's other juvenile books) to adults as much as to anyone. Readers of all ages can enjoy any of his works as they are invariably well-written and interesting. This book is certainly no exception. It has the quality of a mystery to it (a tactic which Heinlein did not often resort to), and it is suspenseful and will keep you reading. Many have pointed out that the majority of the story is now dated (not to mention impossible) due to subsequent advances in science - true. But Heinlein, though often classed as a &quot;hard&quot; science fiction writer, never intended for science to be the central tenet of his stories; no, Heinlein is the man who introduced the social sciences (politics, economics, psychology) into science fiction. This book is a prime example of that. Those who go around pointing out its scientific fallacies are missing the point. If for nothing else, enjoy the book for what it ultimately is: an enjoyable and delightful science fiction adventure romp. Any Heinlein fan will want to pick this up; if you are unacquainted, however, you should read some of his other works (such as the ones I mentioned, or later novels such as Starship Troopers, Stranger In A Strange Land or The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress) first."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Excellent character development.

Was 50 years ago."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"\\"Between Planets\\" is a great place for a young reader to start reading Heinlein. It has worn well over time, it doesn't have much of his later survivalist/grumpiness, it is less explicitly political, and it seems to be in tune with what modern ya readers like and want.I mean, it's pretty easy to pick out and recommend Asimov, Bradbury and Clarke books for new young readers, but Heinlein has always seemed a little harder to figure out. Once you've narrowed down the choices to his early \\"juvenile\\" novels, I guess it turns on personal taste. What's particularly fun is that for most reviewers that choice turns on which novel they most remember from their own youth. I would pick \\"Tunnel in the Sky\\". Some go for \\"Have Spacesuit - Will Travel\\". Others are partial to \\"Podkayne of Mars\\". Then you have \\"Space Cadet\\" and \\"Farmer in the Sky\\".Whichever one you pick, I think you have a good chance of pleasing your young reader, and maybe you'll get him or her interested in \\"old-fashioned\\" science based sci fi."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Heinlein was in a groove at some point early in his career when he was able to rapidly create so many variants on the \\"coming of age\\" theme, each providing an opportunity for today's readers to not only enjoy a relatively predictable plot, but to reflect on the 1950s/early 60s culture that shaped his language and the values he either adheres to or rebels against.

Heinlein continues to entertain readers, young and old alike. This work of futuristic fiction is as pleasing to read today as it was when published over 50 years ago. Though much of society's technology and scientific understanding has advanced, his story is a good read filled with drama and entertainment.This story is about a boy who suddenly finds himself without a home; a child of two worlds caught between them both in an interplanetary struggle for independance. His only goal is to reach his \\"home,\\" to return to his parents' side. On his journey he finds good friends (earthman and alien alike), excitement and adventure, but, most of all, himself.This book was a quick read, and though it contains glaringly outdated scientific ideas about space travel and aliens, it is extremely entertaining. The pieces that capture the reader are the believability and consistancy of the characters, and the clear and easy to follow plot. There are no startling sub-sub-sub-plots, no masked agendas, and no inconsistent storylines.Overall, this is one of the outstanding classics that should be enjoyed by sci-fi fans of all ages!"},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"This book was sitting on a library shelf when I, having been sentenced to work in the junior-high library, made the life-changing decision to read a book for pleasure.

It would be nice sharing our sun with the Venerian \\"Dragons,\\" a learned people but not without a sense of humor. The Martians are cool also and the non-sentient \\"Move-Overs\\" are very appealing.The main character comes of age in a war-torn solar system but we don't see much of the fighting. There are a number of memorable human characters as well. The cause the young man winds up serving is liberty and there is a lot of talk going around today that it is over-rated. Heinlein and I would both disagree.The book ends with the advent of vast and sudden technological change. The author never takes up the story again, so that technological change is never explored.

As I have stated in other reviews these books were originally marketed as juveniles. That ended decades ago and none of them have ever been out of print.The joke is Heinlein's editor couldn't stand him or his books. She only tolerated him because his books sold so well. But I digress....Donald James Harvey is in boarding school in the American Southwest when he receives word from his parents. Don's parents are scientists who have traveled the solar system. Don himself is a rarity, he was born in deep space. His father was born on Earth and his mother born on Venus.This is the future as perceived during the fifties. Both Mars and Venus have active biospheres and indigenous intelligent races. Mankind is exploring the solar system. The human colony on Venus is thriving and growing restive under the yoke of Earth's government. There is a possibility of war.Don's parents want him out of the line of fire. They are part of the human research colony on Mars. He's pulled out of school short of graduation. However they do give him instructions to meet an old family friend. This meeting and the events prior to Don leaving Earth illustrate how decadent and repressive things are in this society.On the way into orbit, Don befriends and gives comfort to a Venerian who goes by the human name of Sir Isaac Newton. Once they arrive at the transfer station, we find Don's parents have lousy timing. The Venus revolutionaries have declared war and taken over the station.

Still, it's a workmanlike juvenile about young Don Harvey, born out in space to a Terran father and a Venusian colonial mother -- who are now working on Mars in any case. He's attending school on Earth as a colonial rebellion is breaking out, finds himself an \\"enemy alien,\\" and just manages to get off-world. He's also an unwitting courier for a shadowy, underground political group his parents are involved with.

At the level of a simple adventure story, it works, if you bear in mind that it was written in the 50's, and that it was written for young (say, 10-14) readers.Having read several of Heinlein's juvenile novels, I would have to place this at or near the top of that group. When compared to the likes of Rocket Ship Galileo or Space Cadet, this is a better book. It is more interesting, a little more realistic, and certainly more fun to read.However, it is not Starship Troopers or Stranger in a Strange Land, either. By today's standards, much of the science fiction is ridiculous - giant intellegent dragons living on Venus? The worst swear word is &quot;Aw, shucks&quot;? Thus, it sounds very dated and quaint and even.... juvenile. But that aside, it's a fun read and at 200 pages, it's not taking up much of your life. As someone else mentioned, pick it up for a long flight when you just want something fun to read."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"This was the fifth of Heinlein's \`juvenile' novels. By this point he'd pretty much ironed out his format for this type of work, and as a result it's quite a bit better than his first couple of juveniles (Rocket Ship Galileo and Space Cadet).The story revolves around Don Harvey, a young man who starts this story as a student on Earth, though his parents are living on Mars, and who was born in space and spent his early years on Venus, making his citizenship status something of an open question. When conflict breaks out between Venus and Earth, this status becomes a key item in several events that follow. Harvey's internal allegiance is also something of an open question, and his maturation and the solidification of his own feelings about which planet is his \`home' is the prime focus of this work.This was published in 1951, when a warm, wet, and inhabitable Venus was still scientifically plausible, and Heinlein took advantage of this to populate the planet with an indigenous intelligent species, the Venerian dragon. While not his best alien species, having perhaps a little too much cutesy charm, with different dragons \`speaking' via voder in whatever accent (like Cockney British) their English mentors had, the family/political structure envisaged does make for a good alternative to most Earth societies.There are some flaws with this book. I felt the change in Harvey from a boy somewhat lost, not knowing what to do, and dependent on his parents and other older mentor figures, to a man well versed in fighting techniques with some strong opinions about what he is fighting for, capable of making his own decisions, was both too fast and not shown very well, as almost all of the change in attitude happens offstage. Some of the secondary characters (and especially the only portrayed woman in the story) are very thinly drawn, near stereotypical, and definitely conforming to the cultural attitudes of the time this book was written (feminists beware).There is very little philosophical pontification present here compared to most of Heinlein's late period novels, but he does raise points about intrusive, controlling governments and intelligence organizations that will resonate with some current headlines about treatment of \`terrorists'. And like several other works by Heinlein, the concept of fighting for what you believe in is front and center, though he does not glorify the military here, in fact shows how dirty and hard a life soldiers can have.Not his best juvenile, a form at which he would continue to improve through several later books, but quite readable, with Heinlein's typical unforced prose and dialogue, with a lot of relevance to today's world.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Between Planets (1951) is the fifth SF novel in the Juvenile series, followingFarmer in the Sky. Like most of the author's SF, it is set within the Future History universe. Much of the story occurs on Venus, which is the home of an alien species and many disgruntled humans.In this novel, Don Harvey is a boy of several worlds. His father was born on Earth and his mother was a Venusian colonist. His papers declare him a citizen of the Federation.Don is attending school on a ranch in New Mexico. While out riding his pony Lazy, he gets a mobile call from the headmaster. He has received a radiogram from his mother, so he immediately returns to the ranch.The message informs him that passage has been booked for his flight to Mars, where his parents are investigating the remains of the First Empire. Don is puzzled, but the headmaster tells him that his parents are probably worried about the threat of war. They don't want him to stay in the warzone.In this story, Don calls Dr. Dudley Jefferson -- a friend of the family -- after reaching New Chicago and is invited over to the apartment. When he arrives, Dr. Jefferson makes polite talk, but asks him about a package sent to him at the ranch. Don hasn't received it, but the package is mentioned more than once during the evening.Dr. Jefferson takes him out to an expensive nightclub, which opens Don's eyes in more than one way. But he is puzzled by the presence of someone that he had seen earlier that day. A man sitting in the club looks like a security policeman who had stared at Don when he was conversing with a Venusian dragon.The security police later confront Don and Dr. Jefferson. Don knows nothing and security lets him catch his flight. Then he is told that Dr. Jefferson had died of heart failure. In a sense, everyone dies of heart failure.Don encounters the dragon -- Sir Isaac Newton -- once again on his flight up to the space station Circum-Terra. Don has a pleasant talk with the dragon and interprets for him when his voder fails. Then he discovers that Circum-Terra has been captured by Venusian forces, so he now has the choice of returning to Earth, going to Venus, or being blown to atoms.Don decides to go to Venus. After all, he does have Venusian citizenship. Maybe he can catch another ship to Mars somehow or the other.This tale is about a displaced person during a major war. With the conflict between Venus and Earth going on, he has to support himself on Venus without any relations or resources. He gets a job washing dishes for the Two Worlds Dining Room. Eventually he finds himself in the military.This edition has an Introduction by William H. Patterson and an afterword by Travis S. Taylor. Any fan of the author will enjoy these notes about the story and the man who wrote it. Take it from Taylor, the author really knew the science and technology of his period. You also might find out a bit about the Martians and Venusians in the tale.This work is a classical story by a Grandmaster of Science Fiction. While it was originally written for young adults, it was still enjoyable for an old man like myself to read again after five decades.

A sympathetic but not at all perfect hero and some good minor characters. An atmospheric vision of Venus as it should have been, a world of swamps inhabited by a few human colonies and a race of intelligent (and friendly!) dinosuaroid that communicate by whistling. What more could you ask?"},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Say 'yes' to one and let the other one ride? Did you ever have to finally decide?\\"BETWEEN PLANETS (1951) predates this Loving Spoonfuls hit by many years but the questions asked are very much on young Don Harvey's mind. As the book opens he is enjoying an early morning ride near his New Mexico boarding school but his ride is cut short when he is summoned back to school. His parents have sent an urgent message for him to return immediately home to Mars. Don is surprised to say the least, he was after all just weeks from graduation. His second surprise came when he realized that the talk of war between earth and her colony worlds was not just idle talk, and that due to his family situation could be considered a citizen of each side. His loyalties were called into question by his headmaster and tested when he realized that his best friend could soon be fighting on the other side.Don considered this situation as he began his long journey home. His problems increased when he discovered that he had become a 'person of interest' to the police who were convinced that he had something they wanted badly enough to kill for. As his journey continued he found himself stranded, penniless, on Venus. All along the way Don was forced to question and requestion his own loyalties until he finally had to make up his mind.This is a very typical RAH juvenile novel. The hero is thrust into a situation where he holds the power to change the course of history. Also typical of RAH's work of this time is a rather unrealistic idea of the conditions of Mars and Venus, a firm belief that alien races will be both advanced and benevolent, and that females take a purely supportive role. It is also, like most of RAH's work, an enjoyable and exciting read that will force the reader to re-examine their own long cherished truths.This would be a good place for someone unfamiliar to RAH's work to begin but is a special treat for fans. Here we see Venus dragons, and fragile Martians who will return in later works. One of RAH's favorite themes, that military service separates the men from the boys is also explored."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Don Harvey lives a wonderful life. He lives on a school ranch in New Mexico while his scientist parents are on Mars. Don's life is well-ordered until he receives a message from his parents. The message tells Don to return to Mars, and passage is already booked.Soon Don enters a world of extended confusion as the secret police begin pursuing him, first in New Chicago, then into space and finally to Venus. Why do the secret police want Don? Don's problems occur against a turbulent background of rebellion as Venusian colonists attempt to throw off the oppressive yoke of control from earth.Heinlein skirted disaster with this book. The book is nicely plotted and written, but has a lot of detail. Though the detail is just enough to help a reader follow the story, the detail was just short of being confusing. However, Heinlein is a master of concise writing, and his mastery shows in this novel. The detail is enough to let you know that Heinlein knew what he was doing, but small enough to let you keep track of it. The detail and the story were crammed into less than 200 pages; a remarkable feat.This story is dated both technically and astronomically. Venus is far different from the way Heinlein describes it, as we know now. Technology has achieved far more than Heinlein's novel describes, and the war that created New Chicago never happened. However, Heinlein's wrote this story so matter-of-factly that he makes you believe the background and the story. Heinlein always impresses me by how casual his stories appear, regardless of how sophisticated the material and how bizarre the backgrounds.\\"Between Planets\\" is a nicely written and easy to read story that will draw you in and hold you to the end. You will believe that Venusian dragons and moveovers could actually exist. You will believe that there could yet be a Don Harvey, and you will wish this novel was longer.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Between Planets is yet another suberb Heinlein classic, one that doesn't leave you hanging in the middle as much as some of his works.

I started off on his juvies (like \\"Between Planets\\") when I was about eight, and graduated to his more serious work (eg. \\"Starship Troopers,\\" \\"Stranger in a Strange Land,\\" \\"Time Enough for Love,\\" etc.) in my teens. So yes, I certainly harbor a great deal of affection for this book due to fond childhood memories. On the other hand, I'm still capable of being objective enough about it to feel fully justified with a five-star review.Simply put, this is a fun, fast-paced little novel aimed at juveniles, which nevertheless has some outstanding themes subtly running through it. Absolutely, as many reviewers pointed out, \\"Between Planets\\" is quite dated, since it was written in the 1950s. But even though I knew Venus was uninhabitable when I read it as a kid in the '80s, I still managed to enjoy it thoroughly. For one thing, I learned at a young age to check when a book was written, and I was always able to separate my frame of reference from the author's. For another...well, it's science fiction (or speculative fiction if you prefer). You don't expect it to be perfect because you know it couldn't happen in the first place. Update the setting, the slang, and the technology and YOU STILL HAVE A COMPELLING STORY!See, that's one of Heinlein's greatest strengths - even though he was a \\"hard sf\\" writer, he always understood that the readers cared far more about compelling characters and a strong plot than the \\"gee whiz\\" science. So he grabs Don Harvey just a couple of weeks before graduation, scrambles his life around, and (here's the important part, to me at any rate) lets him choose his own life path; which aspect of his background he finds most important. He has great adventures along the way, but Don becomes an excellent role model for any child or teen; he's intelligent, athletic, and self-reliant, but he never becomes an \\"uber-mensch.\\" Rather, he's exactly the sort of role model most children lack. Heinlein makes it cool to be smart, and makes it cool to question authority; he even makes it cool to be a Boy Scout! These are traits that are sorely lacking in today's youth. All in all, great fun for readers of any age!"},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"I've read some of Heinlein's other short stories - Puppet Masters, Double Star, etc - and enjoyed them, but I can;t say that I enjoyed this one as much. It's not a bad story, mind you, but for me, it just didn't make me feel or think as his other stories. It's about a teenage boy who's of mixed descent (Earth and Venus) and doesn't really explore much into the past or explore weighty matters. It was more of a 'light' reading, not as deep or thought-provoking as most other his other work. If you're a Heinlein fan, it won;'t hurt to check this story out, but if you're new, I recommend 'The Past through Tomorrow', 'The Moon is a Harsh mistress', or 'Stranger in a Strange Land'."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Between Planets was one of the first Heinlein books I read, when I was ten or eleven years old. I never counted how many times I've re-read it since, but if it's over fifty or a hundred times, at least half of them as an adult, it wouldn't surprise me. This is Heinlein writing adventure with the best of the classics -- Robert Louis Stevenson, Daniel Defoe, and Stephen Crane included. When Heinlein wrote it in the 1950's, his description of the planet Venus as capable of sustaining both human life and an intelligent race of dragons was not impossible. That we have since learned that there are no other planets in our solar system which are friendly to life as we know it is unimportant -- we'll someday find planets in other solar systems that are, and Heinlein wrote about that possibility in other of his books such as Starman Jones. But what makes Between Planets so memorable is the portrait Heinlein painted of the planet earth as politically repressed: where you can't make a phone call without a government agency like today's National Security Agency listening; where you can't go to an airport (it's a spaceport in Heinlein's future) without being X-rayed and body searched; where politically incorrect books are sold only by \\"bookleggers\\" (we're not there yet but keep your eyes open). And most importantly, where other planets can fight for independence from a world government on earth where a federal officer interrogating you can inform you that your request for a lawyer is about a hundred years too late to be meaningful. Read this book for the tight action writing, the coming of age story, the politics, the descriptions of meeting with non-human races who can be friendlier than our own kind at times. And give it to your kids to read. They're the ones who are going to have to live in the future Heinlein warned us about.Reviewed by J. Neil Schulman"},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Just for the record, before I launch into this, I have absolutely no problem with Heinlein's depiction of whether there was life on Venus (or Mars) or whether people could safety live on either. I don't know if Heinlein actually believed that back then (as a lot of folks did, we're talking the days before satellites, kids) or he just figured the cardinal rule of fun writing: don't let science get in the way of a good story. And he sure doesn't, Heinlein draws us into a pure SF adventure story that rockets around the solar system, as seen through the eyes of one Don Harvey, who really only wants to get back to Mars to see his parents. In the process he gets accosted by an irate Earth government (and Heinlein's depiction of an almost authoritarian Earth was probably a social comment that went way above the heads of his target audience . . . but then this is the guy who thought Starship Troopers was a childrens book), winds up on Venus and gets involved in the revolution (Viva!). It's mostly nonstop action and the settings are fun, if you can suspend your disbelief and take yourself back to a time where it was possible that there was life on Venus and we might one day wind up there, and I don't see why you can't, you'll find yourself enjoying this despite everything. Harvey is hilariously stubborn when it comes to just about everything, the aliens are interesting in a nonscience way, plot twists abound, and a grand time is had by all. Sure, Heinlein sticks in some of his usual &quot;the army makes a man out of you and it's the only good life&quot; stuff that eventually became the central concept of Starship Troopers (not that I didn't enjoy that book, mind you), by and by, this is optimistic endearing science fiction with some pointed messages but nothing too deep or heavy. It's just an enjoyably fun way to spend two hundred pages."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Revolution, aliens, young love; hot stuff to a teener. Uncle Bob at his political, inventive best (this tale includes the first literary description of &quot;stealth&quot; vehicles,,,decades prior to their actual construction in &quot;our&quot; world)."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"The story ends abruptly, like Heinlein had to meet a deadline or an arbitrary word count or something.If I wrote this novel, I would have shown Don Harvey's reunion with his parents. I would have had him retrieve the Chinese restauranteur's bones and return them to China, like the Chinaman wanted. I would have shown how the war between the Federation and the human colony on Venus eventually came to a resolution. And I would have suggested that Don and Isobel got married and lived happily ever after, like the characters in several other of Heinlein's novels.Heinlein's portrayal of the Venusian dragons also doesn't make sense. You'd think that they would object to having humans settle on their planet in the first place; and that they would object even more when humans brought their war with them. For all their vast intelligence and technological sophistication (as shown by the dragon Sir Isaac Newton's lab), why didn't the dragons already have their own space ships and weapons of war to make a show of force to the people of Earth with the warning that humans should knock it off, or else, rather like Klaatu in the classic science fiction filmThe Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)?In the Afterword in this edition, the physicist and science fiction writer Travis V. Taylor points out the general technological primitiveness of Heinlein's view of \\"the future\\" in the novel, where the characters have ray guns (including teenage boys!) and interplanetary space travel, but they still use analog radio and slide rules, and they have nothing which we can build with microprocessors. Taylor seems unduly impressed by Heinlein's description of a radar-deflecting stealth technology, but I happened to like Heinlein's description of a virtual environment in the New Chicago nightclub in Chapter II. I don't know if Heinlein has received credit for that as one of his imaginary but feasible inventions.As for Heinlein's other assumption about \\"the future,\\" the abusive police state which has taken over Earth in the novel reflected the living reality of totalitarianism circa 1950 when Heinlein wrote it. (Hitler died in 1945, and Stalin still have a few years to go). Unfortunately I suspect we haven't really gotten the police state form of governance safely behind us. Heinlein's portrayal inThe Puppet Mastersof a pervasive security grid to control the infiltration of alien parasites has turned into the reality we live with in American airports; and this kind of police state system could spread to the rest of American society with the right provocations."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"For me, this was a 5 star read. I wasnt annoyed by anything in the story until the very end, when the author used technology to take over the starring role. That part was very pulpy, but up to that point it was the best kind of sci-fi. That being a story about people, that just happens to take place in a sci-fi ennvironment.Our young hero is off on an adventure that crosses three planets. He becomes a soldier and a man, though not in the knowledge of a woman way, just the way of gutting enemy combatants in their sleep, and his outlook on life. Gotta love - or not - them 1951 sensibilities.Still this one was easy to read, I never felt like it was gettig to be a chore, and I recomennd it to anyone who cares to listen at my bookstore."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"I give this book only 2 stars because, well, compared to great literature, 'Between Planets' is what it is; a 1950's pulp sci-fi novella.But that's not to say it isn't a solid, well-written story; it is. It's a bit dated, a bit simplistic, and a bit of fun.Save this for a cross-country flight, or some other occasion you need to kill time. You're not missing anything if you don't read it.It's a decent, solid novella that would earn any college student an 'A+' in a fiction-composition class."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"I love Heinlein's fiction. He is the great author. But this book is not the one of his best ones. There is action, there is story, it's nice to read, and it's not bad if you have to fill transantlantic flight. At least you will not feal bad after it (a lot of books does not have this important feature :-( ) But if you will not read it, you will not lose much. That's it."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"Apparently, three centuries in the future, our descendants will all use 1950s slang whenever they speak--\\"Aw shucks,\\" \\"Are you savvy to it?,\\" \\"Pooh!\\"--computers will have been replaced by high-tech card-filing systems, and our mobile phone technology will, for some reason, have devolved something crazy. (\\"Mobile 6-J-233309, Don Harvey speaking.\\")And like most 1950s sci-fi novels, the future presented in this book is pretty much just the 1950s but with rockets and force fields and other inhabited planets.For all that though, it's not a bad book. It's fast-paced, it moves by steadily, and its story is intriguing. The book tells the story of a boy, charged with delivering a package to Mars, who gets interrupted in his quest by a war between Venus and Earth. There are talking Venusian dragons, some rah-rah military posturing, and again, that abundance of 1950s jargon, but in general the book is all right, for what it is.Where it really disappoints, however, is its ending: I mean seriously, they finally get this great technology to allow Venus to defeat Earth's oppressive federation people, and what happens?Well, not much, really.The author got to the end of his alloted word count, I suppose, and decided he'd better wrap his story up quick."},{"Title":"Between Planets (Ace SF, 05500)","review":"This was one of the boringest books i've ever read....

The bottom line regarding the book is &quot;the First Amendment was written to protect the press not for its own good, but for the good of the public,&quot;...and &quot;if we choose not to care about the world until the world comes crashing through our door, then we will not get it. Not at all, or only when it's too late.&quot; The attacks on 9-11 should emphasize to Americans the importance of knowing what is going on beyond the shores of the United States.

A five-mile-wide behemoth, Hermes passed within half a million miles of the Earth in 1937. Although much better than Lucifer's Hammer as far as complexity of story, it isn't as good as Shiva Descending or Thunder Strike, by Michael McCollum, because it lacks the emotional elements.If you can find The Hermes Fall, it's worth the read."},{"Title":"The Small Woman - The Heroic Story Of Gladys Aylward","review":"I bought this book because I love \\"Inn of the Six Happiness\\".

Bruce Kinabrew"},{"Title":"The Small Woman - The Heroic Story Of Gladys Aylward","review":"This is a lovely and well written book about Gladys Aylward, a Christian missionary to China from England. What makes her story so unique is that she embarked upon her adventure on her own and there are so many potentially horrifying personal tragedies that she just manages to avoid. And that is saying something, because she went to China by train and the train got stopped. And she had to sleep out in the night all by herself. And it is just all so very incredible. Eventually she reaches her destination and becomes a well respected figure in the community. She is appointed the foot inspector for the area by the Mandarin to ensure that the foot binding ban was being adhered to in all the Mountain communities. There was a movie made of her story titled \\"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness\\" and many of the elements of the book are present in the movie. But the book still gives details that are just so inspiring. It is well written and done in such a fashion so that even a non-religious person will not feel affronted by the Christianity present in the book.

She was an &quot;independent&quot; self-supporting Missionary (not CIM - China Inland Mission's missionary : because by CIM's reckonings, she didn't qualify.) That the book and her life got to be written is itself a miracle. Woven into it was also a gripping account of life and death as the Chinese struggled against the Japanese invaders during the early stages of World War II. Perhaps poignant was this exchange towards the end of the book :&quot;When had you been last home ?&quot; asked the American missionary. She smiled, &quot;What chance have I of going back to England when I don't even know where tomorrow's dinner's coming from ?&quot; (She had been away from home for 17 years.)

Somehow she lost her cultural baggage (literally and metaphorically), got over it, and quietly learn the locals' ways of life by interacting with them on a personal level rather than positioning herself as a high-and-mighty missionary preaching to the ignorant natives. Mentored by an experienced missionary with a no-nonsense attitude, Gladys learnt and grew to love and respect the local ways of life, with an open-minded freshness that came from a curious mind and a generous personality. The contrast of Gladys' warmth and integration with the local culture with another older missionary who never learnt a word of the language despite decades of living in the country is startling. Aylward showed genuine Christian humility and from a timid and clueless parlour maid grew to become an assured and resourceful woman whose virtues shown through to all who came across her, so much so that she was given a Chinese name signifying 'the virtuous one'. This is the part of this small book that I most enjoyed - she really is a 'small woman' in the best sense of the term, by leading others through her quiet example.The Japanese's bloody intrusion into the tough-yet-idyllic existence of this rural community is honestly and harrowingly rendered, the cold-blooded cruelties of which constrast sharply with, and overshadow, the narrative on the budding romantic relationship between Aylward and the Nationalist general. Here she reminded me a little of the character Maria in the Sound of Music - one whose love of God did not prevent her from loving and being loved by a man, even in the throes of war.All in all, an epic tale of a woman's life in a foreign land, how she grew to love her new-found life and how she was loved and respected by all around her in return. The major feat she pulled off towards the end, taking 100 orphaned children with her to safety while playing cat-and-mouse with the Japanese army, did not seem so improbable when one sees how she has grown and developed under the grace of God in spite of the unexpected turns in her life path. This is a small book that would be appreciated by anyone with an interest in experiencing life in war-torn China beyond the official statistics and male-driven narratives, as well as by people who are looking for a heart-warming story about the fortitude of the human spirit in the face of adversity, with the heros being an unassuming woman and her orphaned children. Above all, this book would be loved by both religious and non-religious readers, for this slim volume depicts the humble story of an unpretentious missionary whose spiritual grace crosses language, cultural and religious barriers.

I bet they do give good service at those prices. Its certianly makes me more cautious about trusting the prices posted on Amazon.

BUY IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"I have heard the Korean War described as America's &quot;forgotten war,&quot; so I was eager to read James Michener's &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri.&quot; A short novel about United States fighter pilots taking part in the Korean conflict, this book is an entertaining, and often very thoughtful, story of this era.The plot of the book is driven by a daring plan to destroy the strategic bridges of the title. The main characters in the story are George Tarrant, a no-nonsense admiral with a painful personal burden; Mike Forney, a tough and passionate Irish-American enlisted man; and Harry Brubaker, a husband and father who resents being recalled to military service as a pilot.Michener creates an effective blend of action and personal drama. His narrative is full of interesting, vividly rendered details about life on an aircraft carrier.Yes, some of the book's characters and situations seem a bit stereotypical; the female characters, in particular, struck me as one-dimensional. But overall this book is an impressive achievement. Michener creates a compelling portrait of men at war. This book deserves a continuing audience; I thank Michener for helping to keep the legacy of Korean War veterans alive with this novel."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This is almost a novella; it can easily be read in an afternoon. I read this after seeing the movie, and it's one of those rare occassions where I like the movie better than the book. The book is still compelling, though. A Navy attack pilot is reluctantly thrust into the Korean War, and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This man wants nothing more than to come home to his wife and kids, all of whom he loves deeply. In case you've never seen it, I highly recommend the 1954 movie with William Holden, Frederic March, Grace Kelly, Mickey Rooney, Earl Holliman. Only minor parts of the story were changed for the movie, otherwise it's very faithful."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"I read this book voluntarily for a book report as a freshman in high school, and found that I was also able to tie it into a history project. The story really makes it easier to understand the feelings and happenings of the misunderstood Korean War, also called the &quot;forgotten war&quot;. I recommend it for anyone who wants to know more about this war or just enjoys action books in general."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"A good but very short novel about the Korean War that was written in 1953. Although short, the novel touches on many issues, the dangers faced by bomber pilots and their courage, the political reasons why were fighting in Korean, the unfairness to those who were chosen to fight, and the ignorance of the American public about the ongoing war."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"Compared to most of Michener's other large tomes this differs in two immediately noticeable ways. Firstly, it is a very short novel coming in at about 125 pages compared to many that are 1000 pages or more. Secondly it is fast paced compared to many of his other novels.The worlds of war and of peace, highlighted in the first two chapters are brought together in a poignant and thought provoking manner in the final chapter.The subject matter is not pleasant, covering as it does a major war situation in Korea and how it impacts upon many people, but it is a thought provoking publication and worthy of a read - the length and pace making it possible for many readers to read it in one day. The story and message though have lingered with me for much longer."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri is the story of a naval pilot, Harry Brubaker, during the Korean War. He is assigned the very dangerous mission to attack and destroy the bridges at Toko-Ri, a possible turning point in the war. The book follows the events before the bombing. For example, in the beginning of the book, he crashes his plane into the ocean. He also goes to see his wife in Japan. After meeting his wife, he finds out that no one in America knows about the war. The book goes into great detail of his feelings before the bombing. Will he make it, or will he fail his mission? I guess you will have to read the book to find out.I thought this book was good but had some very confusing parts. The book kept you in suspense the whole time, with events you would never guess would happen. The author wrote the book to make you feel like you were piloting the plane. The major problem I had with the book was all the military terminology. During flight scenes, I had a hard time understanding some of the information, because the author used a lot of military terminology. Overall, the book is easy to read.I would definately recommend this book to all people. I would especially recommend it to people who enjoy military history."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This small novel from Michener is a moving and artistically masterful little book which gives meaning and hope to the bitterness of war. I call it a time capsul becuase it represents a lost American culture. A culture of self sacrifice and honor, tempered with a sort of traditional manly pride and a feminity that has been essentially erased by the passing of time. The charaters are all bight and vivid and very well developed in so few pages. The internal thoughts of the main character are a fasinating interpretation of the human phsycology pushed to the brink by stress and the abstract,but very powerful emotions of love, brotherhood,duty and fear.I very dearly wish that the world I live in was still populated by the same sort of men and women described in this novel, which very accurately reflects its time. I also wish that the red beast these heros are fighting mano a mano ,so to speak, had not slipped in the back door dressed in rainbows and business suits and ruined the fine and blessed society we had in 1953.May God bless and protect all true patriots and Americas fighting men."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"Michener's powerful storytelling ability drives this book, although it's merely a fraction of the length of most of his other work. The tale centers on a reluctant Korean War pilot and his relationships with his commanding officer, his fellow soldiers, and his family in the face of impending doom, symbolized by the titular bridges. Over its short space, the story runs the gamut of emotions from despair to fear to exhilaration and back again with a you-are-there intensity. The reader may also gain insight into the camaraderie among soldiers in wartime. This is a very solid quick read."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This novel is an excellent account of a Navy pilot in the Korean War. Unlike Michener's later novels, it is a relatively short one and fast paced but nonethless very impressive. The character are well drawn and put in difficult situations with unpredictable resolutions.

It imortalizes those who fought in the air over the Korean Pennisula in what is sometimes known as the \\"Forgotten War\\". I have read it before but wanted a copy for my personal library.The book arrived in excellant condition too I might add.I would recommend this novel to anyone who has not read it before."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This book was great, its the first time in a long time that I've actually finished a book that i started reading. That may have a little to do with the fact that it is only about 125 pages, but it is also true because there weren't any boring parts in the book, unlike most others. The story is of a airforce pilot in the Korean War that is very bitter about being called back into action. In the end it shows the sad part of war, a man dieing for his country. This book was very action packed and a quick read, I would suggest it for anyone that is in desperate need of a quick book for a book report!"},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"Despite the accolade this book has received, it is merely an action novel with an ineffective layer of emotional drama added. Consequently, all aspects are simplistic. The men are rowdy and brave, the women are weepy and tricky, and even the physics are childishly contrived. Not even a supersonic body can outdistance the disturbance for which it is the source!The plot attempts to generate tension from the internal turmoil of characters uncertain whether performance of duty warrants the personal costs. This fails since the characters' worries never concern embattled civilians. In any case, such reluctance and preoccupation could not possibly produce the elite fighter pilot the protagonist is described as being.Fortunately for the original reviewers of the newly published book, The Bridges at Toko-ri was a short novel. Some surely feared the reprisals an unfavourable review of a Michener novel would bring, and instead chose to praise it, comforted with the kno! wledge that exaggerations on such a short book would be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"I had to read this book for history and it's ok I think that Mike Foreney was the greatest character because he was the most interesting. Nestor saved a man from a crash. and Beer Barrel was a drunk who snuck beer on board in a golf bag. What else do you need to say?"},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"As usual with Michener, the prose is agile and well-planned, so this short novel is a page-turner. All characters, though, are cardboard clich&eacute;s without one single shadow of psychological interest or point. Pulp-fiction characters, totally, and thoroughly sentimentalized.The novella's main thesis, \\"what a shame that the noble military sacrifice so much while the American people don't really care\\", fails to explain why average Americans who are not military contractors or otherwise parasites of the \\"defense\\" milk-cow should concern themselves about an undeclared war for very far-away imperial turf. The notion entertained by the old admiral that this is simply one further battle in the endless Manichan struggle between the Forces of Light (America) and the Forces of Darkness (The Rest of the Universe) is still very much with us, but is made neither more respectable nor more understandable by this little book."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"I recently read Centennial by Michener which is a completely different subject matter and couldn't resist this book as it's a quick read. The story is about US fighter pilots in action during the Korean War. Whilst not the masterpiece that Centennial is it's still a worthy read."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This is a well-written short story centered around a fictional U.S. Navy pilot and set during the Korean War. A very engaging story about love and sacrifice. A good reminder that freedom isn't free."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"I didn't look this up but I'd be willing to bet that this was Michener's shortest novel. It is in my readings of this Author that this short novel was indeed his best work. Michener always was the master of the historical fiction genre much in the same way Leon Uris was. To me these Masters represent a dying breed which has been hard to duplicate.This book is set on an aircraft carrier during the Korean War on the Sea of Japan. The story revolves around a Naval Reserve World War II veteran pilot Lt. Brubaker who was called to active duty to serve in the Korean Conflict. Brubaker is a family man with children. He is given a critical and dangerous mission which entails the destruction of the key bridges at Toko-Ri in North Korea. The essence of Brubaker's dilemma is his duty to his young family and also to his duty to his country at war. Also in this mix is Rear Admiral George Tarrant who has lost 2 sons in combat and whose wife as a result has become an alcoholic.Brubaker's situation during this War was actually echoing thousands of similar scenarios during these times of this \\"forgotten war\\". In fact this fictional scenario actually reminds me of a \\"real actual\\" Korean fighter pilot who also made the sacrifice of civilian life to fight in this conflict, that being Ted Williams. Michener pulls no punches in this nerve racking tale which leaves everyone on the edge of their seats until the final words.Michener brings forth a real story that needs to be told. These actions take place early in the \\"Cold War\\" and the concept of limited war was new and mysterious. The tragedy as Michener shows us the war, unlike the all out effort of World War II, affected only those who fought it and their families. This story is tragic but in reality all so true. Excellent read! Five Stars!!"},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This book is a definite page-turner and can easily be finished in one sitting. That being said, it is a fine reflection of emotional conflict that comes with being in a war. More than that, it is a book about loyalty and friendship that I think any young boy can benefit from reading. A classic."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This book was fast paced and well written. The authors descriptive powers were excellent. You saw what he described in your mind. The story brought to life the Korean war and what it was like to land a plane on a aircraft carrier. It was way to short and could have been longer."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"In this story, Michener describes the true horrors of war. He tells in a spellbinding fashion the story of a pilot in the Korean War. His wife visits him during the book and tells the pilot no one cares about the war in the United States. The pilot goes through a period of doubt that ultimately brings the story to an end."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"This book, although short, got to the point quickly. After the pilot goes to war, he soon discovers what actually goes on there. The book soon progresses into an emotional rollercoaster where only one man seems important. The ending of this book can teach a lesson to those who havn't experienced war first-hand."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"I have believed since I first read this book, even before I became a Naval Aviator, that it was, and remains, Michener's finest work. His characters are dead-on real people, dragged into an unpopular war, virtually forgotten even as it raged. I bought this copy to replace an original that had been loaned out and never returned. It's worth rereading from time to time, just to touch the inglorious experience that is the reality of war. I've been to Korea, to Yokosuka; I've lived and flown off aircraft carriers and known countless aviators from the korean War and through the Cold war. This is real."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYMichener's time in the Navy in WW II prepared him well for his career as novelist, especially when documenting war through fiction. This book follows a pilot who becomes a reluctant warrior in the battles to save South Korea from the invading North Korean and Chinese armies. Unique from many war novels, this one is centered on aircraft carriers and the aircraft that launch from their decks to destroy enemy targets. The ending haunts me 40 years after reading it."},{"Title":"The Bridges at Toko-Ri","review":"old book. out of print. purchased out of curiosity. Michener writes a decent war novel, albeit short. Woth the time to read.... EASY!."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I first read this book as a teen ager in the 1960's, and I've probably read it eight or nine times since then. This book introduced me to Robert Ruark and started my life-long appreciation of his works. Something of Value examines clash of civilization between the British settlers and the Kikuyu natives in Kenya after WWII during what became the Mau Mau Rebellion. It examines the causes and consequences of the conflict and how it affected both sides. As I became older, I began to understand the motivations of the characters and their actions. With each rereading, the book changed. It was not only a safari adventure story, but it was also a snapshot of history, a study of human psychology, and a search for recognition and justice. I know I'm paraphrasing, but the opening Bantu proverb, &quot;If you do away with the traditions of the past, then you must first replace them with Something of Value&quot; definitely and perfectly describes the book. When Ruark wrote about the conflict, he examined how people on both sides were torn from what they knew and had cherished in the past and were thrown unprepared into the future. He examines foreign and unfamiliar ideology, how it affects us, and what its consequences are. Finally, despite the cruelty, blood, and horror in the book, he examines the nobility of human beings and what it means to us. This book has changed the way I view the world because I now can appreciate both the view of the fox and the hound. If great writing enables us to finds new and deeper meaning with each rereading, then &quot;Something of Value&quot; is great literature."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I spent three of the most impressionable years of my live in Kenya in the early '70's as a State Department dependant. Even then, the Mau Mau uprising had a strong influence on day to day life in Kenya. Gun control laws were among the most strict in the world and for good reason. During my three years in Kenya I heard many stories from people who lived through the emergency. Most of these stories made Stephen King novels sound like childrens' tales. I could not count the times I've read both Uhuru and Something Of Value and each time they have taken me back in time to the Norfolk or New Stanley hotel. Everything about the book, from the safaris, to the uprising, are totally authentic. While this is not a &quot;feel good&quot; book, anyone who has a interest in East African history, or just wants to read on of the great books of this century MUST read this book. Even though this is a book of fiction, it should be required reading for anyone studying the history of Kenya. Make no mistake, most of the things written about in this book, no matter how disturbing, actually happened."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"When it was first published in 1955 &quot;Something of Value&quot; was a novel right out of the headlines, set in contemporary Kenya during the time of the Mau Mau rebellion which were the last years of British colonial rule. Now it has aged into an historical novel. The largest part of the novel concerns two men, once childhood friends: Kimani, a Kenyan Kikuyu, and Peter, a British settler. They grow up together on a farm in the &quot;white highlands&quot;, Kimani is the son of a farmhand, Peter the son of the owner. They imagine themselves working together as adults, as gunbearer and white hunter, guiding tourists on hunting safaris. Instead they become adversaries during the Mau Mau. Ruark tells a good story though the book is a bit long in places. Throughout the novel, the depictions of both African and British characters is remarkably balanced and fair. Ruark is one of the few white writers of the 1950s to provide a sympathetic and (apparently) informed view of African (particularly Kikuyu) culture. It is the clash of Kikuyu and British cultures, as British law is applied to traditional Kikuyu custom that is the impetus for Kimani to join the rebellion. It would be interesting to know if all of the novel's details of the Mau Mau oaths are accurate. The female characters are a bit one dimensional; this is a book about hunting, warfare, and the world as seen by men. Overall, a very good book, especially for anyone interested in Kenya and the end of colonialism. (&quot;Something of Value&quot; was made into a movie starring Rock Hudson and Sidney Poitier.)"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book has something &quot;magical&quot; about it. It's an obscure book today, but it holds a special place in my heart and mind, and has so for nearly my entire life. I first read it in the late 1950's, when I was a young teenager. The adventure and graphic violence was probably shocking to me then, but the book inspired me to make reading about Africa and it's history a serious hobby back then.I read the book the second time when I was an adult in my 30's. I found a tattered paperback edition in a used book store. It was just as exciting to me then as it was many years before. By then I had two daughters, and I told them of my &quot;favorite book.&quot;Last Christmas, my youngest daughter, who was then 19, gave me an ORIGINAL edition, which still had the paper jacket. When I opened the gift, tears welled up in my eyes. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS BOOK?Ruark's style was wonderful, and his way of developing a story was terrific. Read this book."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"I am absolutely thrilled and honored to write the first Amazon review of Something of Value, though a little amazed as well. Has this truly great, epic novel of Africa been so completely forgotten?Robert Ruark was sometimes called \\"the poor man's Hemingway,\\" but that's just because he wrote about Africa without lapsing into the pseudo-intellectual vagueness that leaves so many of Papa's readers (come on, admit it) wondering what the devil he was talking about. While Hemingway was boozing in Cuba and writing about fish, and ten years before Capote invented \\"fictional journalism,\\" Ruark was writing about life, death and sheer bloody terror in East Africa, and leaving nobody in any doubt about it. When you get to the end of Something of Value, you won't be scratching your head, pondering philosophic conundrums. You'll be wiping your brow with a shaking hand, just bloody glad you weren't there.To oblivious, Eisenhower-era Americans, Africa was Tarzan and King Solomon's Mines. (Several local members on the crew of John Ford's Mogambo, filmed during the uprising, were later arrested as Mau Mau. Imagine if Clark Gable, Ava Gardner or Grace Kelly had been hacked to death in their tents.) Robert Ruark -- ex-reporter and big-game hunter, just arrived for his second African safari -- was the right man in the right place at the right time to pen a one-of-a-kind tale of Africa, brilliantly simple in concept, brilliantly stunning in execution. Two men -- one white, one black, raised as brothers in colonial Kenya -- are caught up, as are their peoples, in the Terror: a vicious, bloody uprising that degenerates into a slogging war of racial extermination. Savage mutilations. Horrific blood rituals. Incest. Cannibalism. Bloody-handed atrocities committed on both sides. Ruark not only doesn't sugarcoat it, he documents it. (He drew on actual events for several scenes and characters.) Something of Value, its sweeping scope and universal theme spattered with Manson-level depravity and violence, must have hacked white-bread, Peyton Place America's skull open like a bloody machete aimed right at the face.Published in April 1955, the novel was an instant, massive bestseller, with more than a million copies ultimately sold in over ten languages. It spawned a predictably mediocre movie starring Rock Hudson, Sidney Poitier and the lovely and perfectly cast Dana Wynter. With its simplistic politics, sanitized violence and utterly stupid ending, the film is a poor black & white shadow of the full Technicolor, Cinemascope-sized novel. Blunt as a club, sharp as a saw-backed bush knife, this book drags us readers by the hair, kicking and screaming, out of our comfortable sleep and into the African night.Though it doesn't make him wrong, Ruark's take on the downfall of empire has been overridden by the modern, politically correct view of colonialism, which assumes that everyone in Africa is now better off because they aren't white-ruled. Anybody who wrote this book today would almost certainly be vilified as a racist (watch for subsequent reviews; I give myself a better than 50-50 chance of catching the same flak, just for praising it), which is probably why Something of Value has been largely forgotten. Thing is, Mau Mau set the pattern for every subsequent African uprising. This sort of racial, intertribal violence is still going on right now, in Zimbabwe, the Congo, Sudan, and a slew of other sub-Saharan countries, and we all try hard to forget about that, too. Something of Value is Africa's War and Peace. It's Kenya's Sand Pebbles. And if you read one novel about the African Question, this is the one. (Well, after mine, that is.)-- Don Hollway, author of DANGEROUS GAME (ISBN 0741429497)"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"The late Robert Ruark was mainly noted for his magazine articles and his writing on big game hunting, primarily in Africa, but was more than capable of turning out a &quot;keep you up late reading it&quot; novel such as this one. &quot;Something of Value&quot; takes place in Kenya in the days of the Mau-Mau rebellion and shows that tragic conflict from both sides. Ruark shows the mistakes the British had made in &quot;civilzing&quot; the largest native tribe in Kenya, the Kikyuyu, taking their customs away and replacing them with nothing they could relate to and how this lack of &quot;something of value&quot; allowed the Mau-Mau to grow until it consisted of 90% of the male Kikyuyu population. It is, in many ways, an old, old story of culture clash, but seldom is the story told so powerfully. This is Ruark the novelist at his best and should not be missed by anyone interested in Africa or for that matter, anyone interested in great writing....."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book definitely lives up to its billing.

This not only made me Robert Ruark fan, it caused me to begin a collection of his first editions. It is a gripping story of a part of our planet that may never find peace. It is also a tremendous piece of writing, the like of which comes along only every few years. Ruark traveled in Africa during this challenging period and as a news correspondent, held pre-eminent qualifications to write the story. I have re-read it several times since John loaned it to me. Along with another borrowed book, Shackleford's story of Anarctica, I could start and end my library!"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"The Africa described by Ruark in his late 50s novel is disappearing fast.

And it's a ripping good yarn to boot"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book personalizes and, thereby, illuminates a rather ugly chapter in human history, one that should have and could have been avoided. The strengths and the faults of both European and African/Kikuyu culture are carefully delineated, so that the reader can see the causes and, perhaps, inevitability of the Mau Mau uprising quite clearly. While the Kikuyu were brutal by European standards, it seems most of the reviews I read here miss the point. Yes, the white settlers in Kenya came in and imposed their values on the indigenous blacks, treating them as inferiors, almost as pets. Yes, the white settles were kind, improving health care, imposing peace, and so on -- albeit with a great degree of condescension Yes, by present-day, &quot;civilized&quot; standards, the reaction of the Kikuyu in the excesses of the Mau Mau were unconscionable. But the author prefaces the book with a Basuto proverb: &quot;If a man does away with his traditional way of living and throws away his good customs, he had better first make certain that he has something of value to replace them.&quot; The Kikuyu had their traditions stripped away, but the Europeans gave them nothing with which to replace them. The Kikuyu then created something horrible to fill the void. Tragic."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"......Like the reviewer from Kenya, I lived through an African horror show... but in Rhodesia (present day Zimbabwe...)

His descriptions of and understanding of Kenya of a half century ago are superb and fascinating. Novels rarely teach anything today because the writers seldom know anything. Ruark knew Kenya.His weakness is his bad habit of telling rather than showing. There are only a handful of action scenes in this novel and they are dull and without tension. He knows little about fighting with hands or guns. In the scene with the lady farmers fighting off the mau mau, he has one drop a huge man with a long shot to the neck with a .22. Ridiculous. He then has them murder their house boys who are cowering in hiding. One must respect the honesty, whether or not intended.The culminating fight between Peter and Kimani he has the Peter bend back the wrist of the evenly matched black and break his elbow. An expert in martial arts might do this. A farmer could not.The blacks speak well and simply, but his white dialog is so smart, glib and cute that it can barely be read without nausea. All the trite conventions are here. The women drink like men and talk like sailors. Every line is sarcasm, quip and slang. No one ever says they are off to take a bath without saying they're off to \\"wash off the soil.\\" No one ever talked like this outside a novel of a movie---not even in the fifties when sarcasm and faux-sophistication were thought clever.His portrayal of white's thinking about and treatment of blacks as loyal dogs is true if nauseating. He portrays the relationships and attitudes of blacks and whites as honestly as he knows how. The whites here are no angels, but are as barbaric and murderous as the blacks. That I respect coming from a man who obviously sympathized with the whites."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book was made into a movie and had Sir Winston Churchill do the opening narration.The Kenya of the Birtish Empire was one of aristocrats gone farming. Blacks of eastern Africa -- especially the Kikuyu -- wanted to take power from the whites and subjugate the remaining tribes -- the Masai for example.While the term &quot;Mau Mau&quot; has no basis in any African language it quickly took on the nightmarish -- goulish meaning of disembowelment, slaughter, terror.There is abundant evidence that the Mau Mau took the rituals of the Christian church and turned them into ceremonies encouraging brotherhood in the Mau Mau society. These rituals included drinking human blood laced with semen and urine followed by a meal of human infants exhumed or murdered for the occasion.It should be interesting to note that the body of Dr. Gray Arundel Leakey -- patriarch of the archaeological family of Olduvai Gorge fame -- was made part of one of these ceremonies.While it is popular to blame the white man for every fault in the human condition it will take a real stretch to blame pedantic English Aristocrats for native chapels decorated with human intestines, gouged eyes and exhumed bodies."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"While many will say that the terror of the 1950s in Kenya was the White Man's fault those same people will be hard pressed to blame the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone and more all on the &quot;invading whites&quot;.Ruark's book tells it like it was in the 1950s.

Very early in this book one of the main white characters a \\"Mr Mackenzie\\" grabs his sjambock whip and beats his black farm help with it I put the book down. From reading the reviews apparently this book is a fictional but realistic story of the Mau Mau revolt. And I was intrigued to read a review of one customer who claims to have actually lived in Kenya and does indeed say this book is \\"pretty accurate\\". Despite having never lived in Africa and only read about the country, I would think there would be something humanly wrong with the Mau Mau if they didnt revolt against this treatment. I am a bit of a writer myself so after reading \\"Horn of the Hunter\\" I did some investigating of Ruark. It turns out he had a very long and well known battle with alcoholism and eventually died from it. Something that would certainly give me pause to consider my own mental state before declaring what a talented writer he was."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This classic is worth the read. It's the best historical fiction I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"Historical fictions are my favorite form of reading and they don't get better than \\"Something of Value\\". It is an extremely well written and historically accurate story; something all historical fictions should seek to be.It takes place in Africa (Kenya), just after WWII, when the whole face of Africa was changing, after the British colonial period was losing its grip on the region. The relationship between the white colonials and the native Africans, which had developed an uncomfortable peace and even some affection between them, was about to become completely undone by the influences of internal resentment and discontent and external political rivals vying for regional power. It culminates in one of the bloodiest massacres called the Mau Mau Rising.The characters in Robert Ruark's book are realistically portrayed; some are compassionate and kind, some cruel beyond all abilities of human understanding. His weaving of the familie's stories and the events of the time presents a realistic, poignant, and tragic story that offers a true understanding of a calamity that one would not otherwise be able to comprehend."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"This book was so accurate and so brutally honest that Ruark was banned from Kenya by the British and the Native Kenyan goverments.For those of you who don't know; Roberk Ruark was THE defining voice in America for Africa in the 1950's. His columns appeared in Field &amp; Stream magazine when EVERYONE read Field &amp; Stream. He was a celebrity with apartments in New York and a villa in Spain. These were the days when rich men ate red meat, went to Africa to &quot;shoot lions&quot; and were disappointed if it didn't charge!If you love African game stories and you belive in the superiority of Western civilization over shamanist tribalism then this book is for you.When the English colonized what is now Kenya it was a true clash of moderns with the Stone Age. These men (and women) had as rough a time as Americans did taming the West. Really more so because the Africans were more numerous than the American Indians and only one or two of our animals would eat you. After years of carving farms out of the harsh African veldt with the permission and support of the Britsh goverment the farmers suddenly found themselves put &quot;out into the cold&quot; by their goverment. The Socialists in England suddenly decided by vote to modernize the Native African from the Stone Age to the Industrial age overnight. From shamans and chiefs to democracy; brought in by &quot;the Winds of Change&quot;. If you ever suspected that you have been lied to about Africa by the Desmond Tutu's and Nelson Mandela's of the world, if you want to know what is going to happen in South Africa in the next 10 years, if you need any more convincing that America's Africa policy caters more to Jesse Jackson than the true &quot;status quo&quot; of Africa, then this is the book for you.Ruark does a brillant job of juxapositioning the issues of tribesman and colonist alike.The politics and violence of MauMau are amazingly similar to the African National Congress.In Ruark's Africa everyone is right; and wrong. All the native born Africans in his book, Black and White alike, believe to the bottom of their soul in what they are doing.I don't think Kipling himself could have captured the essense of Africa any better!"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"A brilliant work by perhaps one of America's finest authors. The most thought provoking aspect of this classic book was the truth that the Bolshevicks used the same tactics to subvert Kenya that they used before in the Congo and most lately in Peru with Shining Path. Find a down-trodden minority with a genuine reason to be angry in a country you want to de-stabilize, then use a bastarized version of their faith to bind them to your will and cut them loose on the majority you want to terrorize. Even raises questions about the 60's more violent activists in the good old USA and elsewhere. The film version with the brilliant Sidney Poitier and the abysmal Rock Hudson is still a film to rent and enjoy, but the book's power must be experienced first hand. For an old hippie from the 60's, it gave me a new way of thinking of of Jomo Kenyatta and certain other people I encountered in those days. &quot;Uhuru&quot; is the sequel. Ruarks's &quot;The Old Man and the Boy&quot; is probably my favorite book. &quot;Horn of the Hunter&quot; is probably the best pure hunting book by Ruark, who, sadly, drank himself to an early death."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"Ruark's first-hand experience and insight into the events which changed Africa in the middle of this century are a real eye opener. If one really cares to know why and how Africa changed, a lot of it is found in this wonderful historic fiction based upon the evidence of an apparently noble cause gone madly awry. Not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"They don't get any better than this. Ruark redefines the novel in this tale of lives bound up in Kenya's struggle for freedom. The last generation of English colonialism meets the first generation of free Kenya, who have nothing left to lose in their struggle.It is all here: the African bush, the 'Safari' life, the strength of people both black and white,passion, adventure, pain and joy.If this book doesn't move you, then nothing will. It is an 'eleven'! I first read it about 15 years ago, and plan to re-read it annually!Kurt Wagner, Hawthorne NJ"},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"Ruark's finest work, this novel focuses on the Mau Mau rising in Kenya but entends to a consideration of many other fundamental issues, from the conflicts between man and woman to those between races. No pat, simplistic answers are provided-- thank God. The lack of resolution at the conclusion of the novel speaks for itself and is, in microcosm, a telling commentary on race relations, today.Ruark was, of course, a &quot;white hunter&quot; of some renown. He did not foresee the rabid anti-hunting movement of today, but speaks of a time when the uncomfortable truth of man-as-predator was not lacquered over with sentimentalist pap. While foreshadowing the &quot;camera safaris&quot; of the placid 90s, Ruark was still able to write of a time when a man could hunt truly dangerous big game. His spare but beautiful prose is, I suspect, what leads so many to carry this book through life as _the_ novel they most remember. Not one word is wasted.This book is not dogma, nor is it truly predictive of the future of Africa. It is meant to be savored by those who still have something of the hunter in their hearts."},{"Title":"Something of Value","review":"With Uhuru, Something of Value gives an excellent insight into both sides of the story of Mau Mau.

The British entered Kenya with the intent of 'civilizing' the savages. They imposed thier way of life on the natives of Kenya. However, the new values made no sense to the Kenyans. They did not understand the value of the white mans ways.Similarly, todays intellectuals and social elitists are imposing a new value system on America's children. One that has no absolutes, no heroes of substance, no morality or ethics. The children don't know if they are good or bad. They have become value-less because of the lack of value. Nothing more than wondering generalities.When you read this book with this perspective in mind, the reason for a lot of the problems that are occurring today become obvious, American society has become an amorphous blob of do what feels good whenever you feel like it and let someone else take care of you.&quot;Something of Value&quot; is as revealing today as it was back in the '50s.

I could not put it down easily after I got into it. I love Ruark's writing style in that it is like listening to a wild story at a party or a bar. You can almost see the scenery of Kenya as you progress along during the safari, and you can feel the fear as the rebellion of the Mau Mau begins.

Think not that He expects anything from you but your whole trust in Him until He has first saved you by His grace. He will faithfully do according to His Word the moment you have chosen positively to rest your salvation in His saving power and grace alone. After you have thus believed, he purposes to supply all the enabling power to meet all the problems and the needs of your daily life. You need not fear, only believe His Word. His wisdom, strength and bounty are sufficient for you. -117That is how the final chapter of Lewis Spery Chafer's classic book Salvation: God's Marvelous Work of Grace begins. The book, as the final chapter is called, is an appeal for the sinner to come to Christ and to embrace the gospel. This classic is an evangelistic in its nature, but it certainly is not a track where the gospel is over-simplified. Instead, the theologian walks the reader through every basic aspect of the gospel from sin to the cross to the atonement to the resurrection to redemption to the sinner's response to the believers benefits to the assurance of salvation to eternal salvation and to our final destination.Chafer pounds the pages with Scripture references. He helpfully provides a Scriptural index in the back of the book which reveals just how prevalent the Bible is in this book. Oftentimes Chafer will state and thesis and essentially list a number of passages that defend his argument.There were many moments where I was shouting, \\"Amen!\\" In the third chapter of the book Chafer deals with those who challenge the doctrine of penal substitution. It reads as if he were writing today. He points out the empty rhetoric of his day and ours that suggests that the cross makes Christ a victim of an abusive, vindictive Father (the cross is \\"divine child abuse\\" for example). Chafer rightly condemns and corrects any notion of immorality in believing in substituionary atonement.Though there were many Amens, there is one section in particular that highly disappointed me. Chafer was a leading voice in the Lordship controversy that argued that one only needs to believe, but not repent. This is not the place to fully lay out everything regarding the Lordship controversy of a few decades ago. However, Chafer dedicates a large section of one chapter to this issue. He painstakingly suggests and tries to defend the notion that repentance is not necessary for salvation. His argument is weak. One is hard pressed to read the Old or the New Testament without seeing that God demands repentance from His children.Overall, however, this is a great book. Though I have some reservations in certain sections, this is an extremely helpful book in laying out the gospel. Although I would not put it into the hands of a lost person for various reasons, it is a helpful guide to those who might be considering embracing the gospel and also to believers who need to hear that message again (and we all need to daily!). If you can get by the Lordship issue (and that is an important issue to say the least), this is an excellent read.This book was given to me courtesy of Kregel Publications for the purpose of this review."},{"Title":"Mr. Bunny's Big Cup o' Java","review":"WARNING: Do not read this book in a brick-and-mortar bookstore or you'll have people stare at you when they see you laugh uncontrollably. This is an excellent book for the beginner. The concepts are explained in way that is hard to forget. This reminds me of David Pogue's books: Accurate, yet enjoyable. This is not a book for the hard nosed Java programmer, but definitely worth a read for someone who is starting out with Java. Concepts are explained very accurately, and this is far removed from the 600-page tomes in the sense that this is safer: It's not heavy enough to smash your PC screen when you cant get that dang program to work! Interestingly enough, someone with little programming experience can also get the jokes. And for the other reviewers who take programming a little too seriously to be fun: Get a life!

Highly and heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Mr. Bunny's Big Cup o' Java","review":"Satire is a very difficult topic to write well and to maintain the flow and quality over the course of an entire book is one of the rarest of achievements. This book is a satire on the Java language and while it has many good points that are quite funny, it does lag and at times, becomes a bit repetitive. Trust me, if you read this book with the thought that you will learn something significant about the Java language, you will be very disappointed. Reading it for any purpose other than amusement will probably bore you to going back to programming in BASIC.However, if your purpose is to have a little fun and take some time to reduce your level of seriousness about the fast-paced world of programming, then this is a book that you may like. I have inserted the word \\"may\\" because it is necessary for you to have a taste for satire to enjoy it.Quite frankly, I did not enjoy reading the first few pages, as I had not yet placed myself in the satirical state of mind. But once I did so, I went back to the start and read it over, enjoying the (un)subtle turn of computing phrases. This is not a book that everyone can enjoy, but if you fit the previously stated caveats, then it is possible to read it with pleasure."},{"Title":"Mr. Bunny's Big Cup o' Java","review":"I don't get the negative reviews. Well, whatever. This is pure, hilarious, brilliant, hurts-when-you-laugh from a guy who knows his Java. Don't expect to learn anything about Java. It's just a stream of great injokes. Includes enormous curly braces, examples of white space, meeting &quot;the primitives&quot;, explaining interfaces with a guy who's the mayor and a sheriff and a painter and a whole bunch of other things.

So, I will, simply, back him up.Heinlein collected many fans through his short stories. In the first half of his career, he was absolutely excellent at writing short stories. Some of the short stories in this collection show that excellence. Some suffer a little due to dating from the passage of time and changes in our attitudes, manners, and expectations and in the technology that now exists and so apparently is absent in some of these stories.I first read these stories over 50 years ago and they were magnificent then. Today, rhey are still excellent, though the reader now knows that the situations would have alternative possibilities today that were unforeseen fifty years ago.Please, read these stories. I am sure you will enjoy some of them, very much."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"This book can be a little difficult for the modern reader to \\"get into.\\" This is because Heinlein was so successful in achieving his goal- he was one of the first to make life in space sound believable to the average reader. Prior to this, most science fiction was of the old fashion Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon space opera variety. Either that, or it read like a technical manual with 90% technical details and 10% devoted to plot and characterization. However Heinlein knew the technical issues better than most and he could actually write believable fiction. You accept the realism of a contractor with labor problems building the first space station or the marital problems of a space pilot. He has transferred common life situations off of the surface of earth and made the exploitation of space seem attainable. You can readily imagine yourself there. Unfortunately, that is also the problem for the reader 50 years later, for it all seems a little to humdrum now that so much has come to pass. Like many books of the period it is made up of stories previously published in magazines:DELILAH AND THE SPACE RIGGER is a tale of the trials and tribulations of the contractor trying to build the first space station.SPACE JOCKEY deals with the personal and professional problems of a space pilot.THE LONG WATCH deals with an attempted coup on the Moon- the ultimate high ground.GENTLEMEN BE SEATED is a story of engineering and humor set in the Moon.THE BLACK PITS OF LUNA deals with the coming of tourists- and all their inherent irritations- to the moon.\\"IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK\\" is a case of finally recognizing a good thing when you've got it.\\"WE ALSO WALK DOGS\\" is the uncanny prediction of a service-based economy.\\"ORDEAL IN SPACE\\" covers one man's psychological trauma due to conditions that no normal human being was ever meant to face.THE GREEN HILLS OF EARTH is the tale of the blind bard/engineer Rhysling and his wandering among the space ways.LOGIC OF EMPIRE is a condemnation of defacto slavery- and a warning that it usually takes a crash to reform such human stupidity.Of all these stories (nearly all copyrighted in the 40's) both THE LONG WATCH and THE GREEN HILLS OF EARTH are the best, for they both deal with selfless sacrifice on the part of the main characters. True heroism is also transferred to the backdrop of space."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"This oft-ignored middle child of Heinlein's \`Future History series' is chronologically sandwiched between his groundbreaking \`The Man Who Sold the Moon' (Man reaches the Moon through the power of free enterprise) and the powerful \`Revolt in 2100' (which features an uprising against a totalitarian theocracy). By comparison this collection of short stories has an understated quality that can easily be mistaken for lack of weight, but a look beneath the surface shows that there's enough real meat to satisfy most readers of classic science fiction.Back in the \`50's when these stories were written, the science came first, and while Heinlein isn't generally a \`hard' science writer, he is notorious for guessing what sort of innovations the future might hold. In this collection you can really see how much thought he put into future technology and how it would affect the lives of people who used it. The space station, various types of space ships (for different functions), nuclear weapons, and habitations on Luna and Venus are all so carefully thought out that the reader may wonder \\"why aren't we doing this already?\\".But the real power of Heinlein's work has always been in the breezy, intelligent, and determined characters who populate his fiction. Even though the stories in this collection are quite short, Heinlein manages to pack a lot of familiar types into his universe, suggesting that technology may change, but human nature won't.Ultimately, this collection's biggest problem is its age. Heinlein was so groundbreaking in tone and focus and in the breadth of his predictions for the future that whole generations of sci-fi writers have emulated him, and consequently this material no longer seems revolutionary. The title story is probably the only real masterpiece here, but despite a slow start, this collection still deserves a recommendation. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"A great book typical of early Heinlein. Characters not too deeply rendered, but charming and engaging. Strong story line about people, not science. And Heinlein's libertarian philosophy underpinning the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"All of these stories are very good, and memorable. I have not reread this book, in I think 10 years, but I still remember laughing at the lunatics in &quot;It's Great to Be Back&quot; and how the last scene in &quot;The Long Watch&quot; misted over my eyes.This book is well worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"I have an older copy of this book that my Grandpa gave me. I read and loved it. I re-read often."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"In 'The Green Hills of Earth', the reader is given many short stories that deal with how the future might be, in respect to technology and sociology. With storys that touch on future colonies on the moon, interplanitary relations (there are Martians!), and a host of other topics, this book is, as the experssion goes, hard to put down. I reccomend it to anyone with an interest in the future of earth"},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"This is a collection of some Heinlein short stories from, I believe, the Forties. Titles include &quot;Delilah and the Space Jockey.&quot; They are written for adults, but, unlike his later stuff, there's no sex in them. They are part of his Future History series. Most of them are set in, say, 1980 to 2050 -- the early days of space travel.Each tale is quite solid, with an interesting psychological twist. I read it straight through, with considerable enjoyment. Still, this book is mostly for Heinlein devotees. Heinlein's a great novelist, but the short story is too limited a form for him to exercise his vast gifts of painting a society in all its variety. And these short stories seem a little more perfunctory than his others. This book is one of his least memorable -- I was halfway through it before I realized I'd already read it a couple of decades ago. If you've already read 20 Heinlein books, then this is a good choice to round out your collection. If you haven't read any Heinlein yet, then you'd be much better off starting with almost anything from his peak years of roughly 1950 through 1966's great &quot;The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress.&quot; (Although I'd be wary of the self-indulgent &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, and the uncompelling &quot;Glory Road.&quot;) -- Steve Sailer,"},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"This collection is fifty years old and, yes, the tales, with their atomic rockets and homegrown aliens in our own solar system, have dated. But most of the stories are still worth reading with one genuine classic and a couple of near-classics.The stories are built around two general themes: workaday life in a future where space travel is common and genuine heroism.On the workaday side is &quot;Delilah and the Space Rigger&quot;, a tale about how the only woman on a space construction project affects her hundreds of male co-workers. &quot;Space Jockey&quot; moves a common situation, the strains work can place on a marriage, into the future when a rocket pilot must decide whether to quit his job or possibly leave his wife. In &quot;Gentlemen, Be Seated&quot;, a moonquake puts some lives at risks in the tunnels under Luna City. It's work of an unusual sort in &quot;'-We Also Walk Dogs'&quot;. It shows the inner workings of General Services, a company whose boast, that no job is too large or too small, is put to the test when the laws of physics have to be modified for an alien trade conference.A couple of other stories are not built around work per se but still feature domestic matters. &quot;The Black Pits of Luna&quot; concerns a tourist from Earth, a small boy, getting lost on the moon's surface. Its juvenile narrator foreshadows the young adult science fiction novels Heinlein later wrote. The ironically titled &quot;It's Great to Be Back&quot; features a family returning to Earth after three years stay on the moon. The old planet doesn't live up to their cherished memories.It's work of a grim sort in the near-classic &quot;Logic of Empire&quot; about slavery and colonial exploitation on Venus. It doesn't end happily and, by this point in Heinlein's Future History, Prophet Nehemiah Scudder looms on the horizon.Tales of heroism figure in the rest of the collection's stories. The hero of &quot;Ordeal in Space&quot; has to retire after picking up a debilitating case of acrophobia when he saves a luxury space liner from destruction. He finds a cure in an unlikely place. &quot;The Long Watch&quot; is another almost classic. In it, one man foils a military coup that threatens Earth.The undisputed classic here is &quot;The Green Hills of Earth&quot;, a biography of the blind poet Rhysling. Part Homer, part Robert Burns, and part Rudyard Kipling, he travels through space and to Venus and Mars and recites some pretty good poetry before meeting a tragic end."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"Robert Heinlein was writing great science fiction before a lot of people even knew what it was. The Green Hills of Earth features ten early short stories from the 1940s; all of these stories are set in outer space, but these are more sociological and entertaining than technical in the way of hard science fiction. In \\"Delilah and the Space Rigger,\\" the head of the space station construction project is horrified to discover that his new engineer is a woman. His fear of having one woman working among a crew of 200 men is never alleviated, but the modern-day Delilah makes good use of her undeniable engineering skills to win a victory of sorts in the end. \\"Space Jockey\\" is basically a story of a space pilot and his stay-at-home wife. It basically explores the issues of a traditional marriage in which the husband is away from home more than either partner would like for him to be. These two stories' treatment of women is far from sexist in my opinion. \\"The Long Watch\\" and \\"Gentlemen, Be Seated\\" are stories of bravery and heroism. In the first, a spaceman risks his radiation-vulnerable life to stop a military coup from taking place, while the second describes the heroism of three men trapped in a tunnel collapse in Luna City. \\"The Black Pits of Luna\\" is a story of a normal family whose youngest son (referred to lovingly as \\"the brat\\") wanders off by himself on a tour of the moon. The search for the little guy offers us some clues as to what sorts of qualities a space man should have (as well as the qualities of individuals who should never have been allowed on the moon to start with).\\"It's Great to be Back\\" is enjoyable yet wholly predictable. After three years on the moon, a couple absolutely yearns to go back home to earth, only to find that their idea of home has changed immensely during their sojourn in Luna City. \\"-We Also Walk Dogs\\" is probably the most singular story in this collection. General Services basically serves any request made by its customers, offering a service borne of the old tradition of walking dogs for rich folks. Their commitment to do whatever job needs to be done is put to the ultimate test when a bureaucrat asks them to make hay with the laws of gravity in order to pave the way for an ultra-important international business meeting on earth. \\"Ordeal in Space\\" is another hero story-\\"Mr. Saunders\\" is a space hero who has become deathly afraid of heights as the result of a terribly frightening yet heroic ordeal above the earth. He is so afraid of heights that he can't even look up at the sky without getting queasy. When he reluctantly accepts a dinner invitation and ends up spending the night in an apartment 35 stories above the ground, the meowing of a kitten stuck out on the ledge challenges him to overcome his fears. As an acrophobic person myself, it was all I could do to get through some of Heinlein's realistic descriptions of the heights involved in this kitten rescue mission. \\"The Green Hills of Earth\\" is the story of the unofficial poet laureate of outer space, but I found it to be the only slightly disappointing story in the book. Finally, \\"Logic of Empire\\" rounds out the collection. Humphrey Wingate gets into a heated discussion about the reality of indentured servitude on Venus, refusing to see it as a modern form of chattel slavery. When his friend asks him to put his money where his mouth is, he has the great misfortune of being very drunk. Upon awakening, he finds himself on a ship bound for Venus, where he quickly develops a brand new standpoint on the subject of Venusian servitude.These are all great stories which the passage of time has not hurt one iota. Set in a science fiction setting, they are all essentially stories of people and their interaction with one another. Any fan of Heinlein or science fiction in general is missing a rare treat if he/she overlooks The Green Hills of Earth."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"This is a collection of ten short stories, all set in the not too distant future, but somehow the characters all maintain a 1950's feeling about them. It's quite a small book, which makes each of the stories quite short too, good for young and old. When you compare this against some of Heinlein's novels, it simply doesn't have the breadth or the complexity of the novels, but then, I suppose how could it?The style is fairly simple and to the point. The stories all have a beginning, middle and end. Some short stories, by other authors, seem to start somewhere in the middle of some crisis, and leave you there to figure it out. Not this, each story explains itself right from the beginning, and you know what's going on all the time.The themes of the stories range from what would happen if a woman went to work among an all male crew assembling a space station (yes, I know! Shocking!), to how one man had a traumatic experience being left floating in space and ended up with terminal vertigo. Another tells the story of how a family long to go home to earth from their job on the moon, but find themselves instead longing to go &quot;home&quot; to the moon again. As you can see, fairly innocent stuff.But what is good about this book, is to see what a man who clearly thought about the future and science predicted for the future. At this stage in Science Fiction's development, atomic rockets were all the rage, the moon was called &quot;luna&quot;, anyone who stayed on earth and who didn't want to go out into space was obviously some form of backwards trogladyte, colonies on mars and venus were commercial and politically viable, and several forms of alien life had been discovered all over the solar system. The characters are very obviously nineteen fifties in their behaviour, although &quot;modern&quot; at the same time, really totally different from actual behaviour nowadays. You can almost visualise the men still wearing hats indoors, and the women wearing high heeled shoes and nylon stockings with seams up the back. But enough of my fantasising! (Mmmm, nylons...)If you're a budding fan of sci-fi, then get this book. It'll give you a good idea of where things were in the early days, and from one of the greats too. If you're only just getting into it, then leave this 'till later, but do get it eventually. For veterans, this is a good nostalgia piece, great for train or plane rides, as you can dip in and out as you please."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"This volume contains 10 of Heinlein's Future History stories written during the 1940's.The first, 'Delilah and the Space Rigger' (1949) concerns the arrival of women's liberation on a construction site in space.'Space Jockey' (1947) describes the problems of long distance relationships.'The Long Watch' (1948) sometimes being a hero means being in the wrong place at the right time'Gentlemen, Be Seated' (1948) a journalist discovers what it takes to survive on the moon up close and personal'The Black Pits of Luna' (1947) some children should be neither seen nor heard'It's Great to be Back' (1946) a young couple learns that home is where the heart is'-We Also Walk Dogs' (1941) a very enterprising group of business people tackle some very surprising problems'Ordeal in Space' (1947) a grounded spaceman faces his demons aided by a most surprising ally'The Green Hills of Earth' (1947) the life and times of the poet laureate of space'Logic of Empire' (1941) two wealthy young businessmen investigate the colonial problemThese stories laid a very solid foundation to the Future History stories.

It contains ten short stories published in magazines between 1941 and 1949.- Delilah and the Space-Rigger (Blue Book, 1949) tells about the building of Space Station One.- Space Jockey (SEPost, 1947) describes a routine flight from Earth orbit to Luna, until a passenger visits the control room.- The Long Watch (American Legion, 1949) recounts the deeds of Lieutenant John Ezra Dahlquist, junior bomb officer of Moon Base.- Gentleman, Be Seated (Argosy, 1948) reveals the hazards of moonquakes.- The Black Pits of Luna (SEPost, 1948) explains the rescue of a tourist on the moon.- It's Great to Be Back (SEPost, 1947) exposes the irritations and hazards of Earth.- \\"--We Also Walk Dogs\\" (Astounding, 1941) divulges the methods of General Services.- Ordeal in Space (Town & Country, 1948) depicts a man who spends too much time outside a spaceship.- The Green Hills of Earth (SEPost, 1947) discloses the origins of the final song composed by Rhysling, Blind Singer of the Spaceways.- Logic of Empire (Astounding, 1941) examines the work contract system on Venus.These stories show the genius of the author and expose his optimism. They foretell many of the goals and issues of the space program. Yet his schedule is entirely too rapid compared to the actual events. He seems to have based his timeline on the rapid industrial progress in WWII. Nonetheless, privatization of space has finally begun, so maybe we will eventually catch up to his Future History timeframes.The next collection in the series isRevolt in 2100.

It isn't. It is, instead, a collection of loosely connected Heinlein short stories from the 1940's.This collection is comprised of mildly amusing little tales from Heinlein's early days. Amusing and pleasant, but not really compelling. There wasn't anything here that I just couldn't put down. The characters are thin, the plots pretty linear and predictable. From both a sociological and a technological standpoint, they're also rather dated. The stories have a certain charm, however, and are good in that they are simple, personal tales that avoid coming across as apocalyptic -- a practice that should be followed more often by contemporary writers. For readers interested in the sci fi genre, THE GREEN HILLS OF EARTH is a solid example of classic sci fi short stories."},{"Title":"The Green Hills of Earth","review":"I grew up in the 50s and 60s reading Robert A.Heinlein and this series of golden age Sci-Fi short stories is from my favorite Heinlein period. All the stories take place in the 21st century and are told looking back from the 22nd century as if historical in nature.All the stories are somewhat related and take place in a future where large scale corporate commercial space travel,interplanetary politics and commerce is the norm. This is an era of large human colonies,mining operations,etc on the Moon,Mars,Venus,the moons of Jupiter and where huge space freighters,ore ships and cruiseliners navigate the spaceways crewed by space-age versions of Merchant Marines.My favorite character is Rhysling,the radiation blinded spaceship engineer who bums around the solar system writing bawdy songs,beautiful poetry,singing & playing accordian in seedy spaceport bars in ports of call like Venusburg,Luna City and Drywaters,Mars.He becomes his generation's Mark Twain/Rudyard Kipling/Bob Dylan by singing songs like \\"Spacesuit Built For Two\\" and \\"The Green Hills of Earth\\". Then there's the two drinking buddies who get shanghied into 6 years of hard labor and indentured servitude in the swamps of Venus and the hero who gives his life to save Earth from a military coup/nuclear missle crises on the Moon.This is a future that according to Heinlein's timeline should be happening right now but unfortunately is not,as it's a helluva lot more interesting than what we've got.For something written in the late 1940s,Heinlein's vision holds up very well though because it is informed by hard science,full of amazing characters,wry humor and timeless human philosophy.There's more stories to this series than those found in this book and all can be had if you look around for Heinlein's \\"The Past Through Tomorrow\\" collection.

Within the pages of this great book, eye-catching photographs bring to light those events from World War II and the Normandy Invasion. The actions and reactions of the soldiers that fought in that war are caught forever through the historical eye of a camera, through famous and infamous quotes and accounts of the heroes from World War II.The pages show the heightened moral and anticipation of the men prior to the invasion. Then the reader is brought into the middle of the battle with stories and quotes not just eye-opening photographs. This technique brings you side by side with the people of the villages and into the ranks of the soldiers marching off to fight another battle. I believe one of the best chapters is the true story of the movie &#65533;Saving Private Ryan&#65533;. This chapter, Saving Sergeant Niland, shows the true-life drama of a man that Hollywood has made famous.The book brings to light some of the things that are never seen in movies and footage of events of the war. I am sure that this book, as well as its predecessor The 101st Airborne at Normandy, will bring back memories of the way it was behind the lines during that part of the war to those who served. Even though there is a predecessor to this book both stand independent of each other."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Mark Bando, the author of this exposition of the bigger-than-life adventures of the fabled 101st Airborne \\"Screaming Eagles\\" at Normandy, is an old acquaintance and comrade from the Detroit Police Department. We spent time together years ago as writers for our police patrolmen's union newspaper, the Tuebor. We have happily renewed our acquaintance of late, and while I remember Mark as an astute and accomplished writer, my less-than-passionate interest in military affairs had, until recently, kept me from reading this fine book. Now that I have finally done so, I deeply regret that I waited so long.\\"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles At Normandy\\" is a marvelous work on several fronts:It is beautifully bound and presented; the layout and format are perfect for the subject matter; the photographs (many of them rare and quite beautiful) are heartwarming or bone chilling, as the case may be; the narrative is painstakingly researched from personal interviews of old soldiers and authentic military records; and, most importantly, the writing is masterful...accurate and careful as from a shrewd reporter's practiced and skeptical eye...loving and lyrical as from the pen of a writer of first rate fiction. I suspect Mark's experiences in \\"combat\\" on the dangerous streets of Detroit over the years have engendered in him a unique capacity to understand the special sensibilities of the combat veterans depicted in his book. Quite simply, \\"101st Airborne\\" is an astonishing accomplishment, worth reading more than once, and worth buying as gifts for the whole family, whether students of military history or not.Mark has been very kind in his assessment of my own work elsewhere on this website. I am only sorry that I took so long to offer my heartiest endorsement of this first rate book. Get it. Read it. You'll be very happy you did."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"When my uncle past away last year, my aunt showed me the 101st Airborne in Normandy, a book by Mark Bando. In the section on combat experiences, the first soldier profiled was my uncle Manny Gesulga. Manny was part of the 101st paratroop drop behind enemy lines at Normandy and his combat exploits read like something out of a GI Joe comic book. After living his harrowing experiences in Normandy, he went to fight in Operation Market Garden (wounded by sharpnel) and the Battle of the Bulge (wounded by sniper fire) and came out to live a full, productive life. He never mentioned his role in WWII but I am glad Mr. Bando gave credence to him and other heroes of the 101st. This book is a must read for all history buffs and really brings home the sense of duty and committment to freedom that is the legacy of the young men of America."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Eminent 101st Airborne Division historian/author Mark Bando has done it again with his fourth book &quot;101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy,&quot; his third on the legendary 101st Airborne Division in World War II, and his second covering the Screaming Eagles' parachute and glider assault into Normandy as they spearheaded D-Day. Bando has packed 10 exciting chapters full of new and previously unpublished material (painstakingly gathered over 30 years of research and interviews with hundreds of 101st veterans) into this glossy, all-new, 156-page hardcover volume. Along with dozens of never-before seen black and white photos of Screaming Eagles in the invasion, the book also contains rarities that must be considered a historical &quot;Holy Grail&quot; for WWII Airborne enthusiasts, and alone are worth the price of the book: more than a dozen beautiful color Kodachromes of 101st paratroopers in Normandy. There is a feast of photos for those knowledgeable of the U.S. Airborne at Normandy, and for those who wish to learn more. Readers familiar with Donald Burgett's classic book &quot;Currahee!&quot; will recognize photos of many of the places Burgett fought and many of the sights Burgett saw in Normandy. The tank knocked out at &quot;Dead Man's Corner&quot; above Carentan? It's there. The German supply wagons Burgett took a pistol and thousands in French francs from? They're there. A wartime color picture of the Carentan Causeway? It's there, as are many others. &quot;101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy&quot; is both a great companion work to Bando's previously published &quot;The 101st Airborne at Normandy&quot; and a unique addition to WWII Airborne history. Like the epic feats of the 101st Airborne itself, it stands tall among the glut of WWII books on store shelves, and is a must-have for anyone interested in U.S. Airborne or WWII history."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"I really enjoyed this book. If not for anything else, buy it for the photos! The author used personal photos taken clandestinely by various 101st AB veterans during the campaign, many in color. I also liked the mix of contemporaneous as well as current day photos to put the events in their proper perspective. I recommend this book to all Screamin' Eagle followers, as well as others such as re-enactors and WWII history buffs."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Absolutely fantastic book! I have read many of the personal accounts of WWII, and this one was one of the best accounts of the 101st Airborne's contributions."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Quite simply as my review title indicates, every Division or unit that served in the Normandy campaign, deserves an author of Mark's calibre. I am a working tour guide of the D-Day battlefields, and I wish that every unit was covered in the same incredible detail as Mark Bando covers the 101st Airborne in his books. If you want to really get \\"under the skin\\" of a WWII combat division and hear true and verified stories of young men in combat, then this book is a must have. The only danger is that after reading this author's books, works by other authors on other units will seem dull and lifeless in comparison.If you have gained an interest in the 101st because of computer games or a TV series, then BUY THIS BOOK. There is nothing to compare for personal stories of the men who jumped into the area behind Utah beach on D-Day. Unlike other books, these are not re-hashed anecdotes relayed third-hand from other works, these are fresh, exciting, gripping and moving accounts from the author's 35 year hobby of interviewing and more importantly befriending the veteran Screaming Eagles."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Mark Bando has done it again! He has given us another book just full of the kind of in depth detail that puts military history buffs right on the battlefield (but without the need for a medic standing by). The thing that I appreciate most about Mr. Bando's books are the wonderful photographs which accompany the text. I'm so sick of seeing the same pictures appearing in book after book, often having nothing to do with the events being discussed. I'm already looking forward to his next work. I recommend his &quot;Breakout at Normandy&quot; for the same reasons."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Once again, the relationships that Mark Bando has developed over 4 decades with literally hundreds of 101st. Airborne Division veterans have enabled him to present a book that brings the reader closer to understanding the contributions and sacrifice of the Screaming Eagles in the opening months of the Great Crusade. &quot;101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy&quot; is an excellent companion book to Bando's previous 101st. books. The book contains almost all new anecdotes, and many, many new images that have never before been published. Especially compelling are the many color photos developed from Kodachrome slides which give a new, much appreciated perspective to a war most often documented in black and white. As in his previous work, especially &quot;Breakout,&quot; Bando's detective work and his strict attention to detail trumps the efforts of more well-known author/historians. Bando leaves no stone unturned in his quest to get the details right. I came away from the book with a renewed appreciation for the temporary nature of life in battle. Many of the soldiers depicted are simply here one moment, and gone the next. One just begins to have an insight into the personality and character of an individual soldier only to read a few sentences later &quot;...was later killed in action.&quot; The book closes with a final chapter that puts the facts and fiction of &quot;Private Ryan&quot; into proper perspective. A must-have for those interested in WWII Airborne history."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"This 10 by 10 inch book is more than just another coffee table book. This book is organized into 10 chapters detailing the training, preparation and jump into Normandy by the 101st Airborne Division.Bando, through his unique relationship with over 900 World War II airborne veterans spanning 30 years, has unearthed a treasure-trove of photographs (some in full color) never before seen by the public. He has liberated them from footlockers and shoeboxes left in attics all over America by the old veterans who never spoke of their service. Each chapter contains well-written commentary accompanied by first person accounts by the veterans. Their memories and recollections provide a stark realism to every chapter. Bando even dedicates one the chapters to the 82nd Airborne Division, showing while favoring the Screaming Eagles, he's not about to ignore the great contributions of the \\"other\\" American airborne division on D-Day.The book contains a glossary of terms and an abbreviated index. But it's the human connection that makes this a great book in its own right. It was an important research tool in writing my historical novel, The Last Jump and I'm sure it will enlighten and entertain any World War II buff who reads it. It is being republished in a softcover version shortly and it is worth buying regardless of price!John E. NevolaAuthor of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II"},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"The author and I have been in touch several times due to the fact that my Uncle was part of the Normandy Invasion and this book explained the events so well. While I was reading the book I could see the country side and it was as if I was there watching everything. The book was very informative and the best part of it was that my uncle was named in the writting. The author took the time to make sure all his information was true. I enjoyed reading this part of history very much."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Mark A. Bando has followed up his original Screaming Eagles in Normandy work with this update which not only plays upon his first book about the 101st in Normandy but presents new photos gleaned from his tireless work with veterans and their families. It's amazing how many troopers took cameras into Normandy and how great it is to be able to read of their exploits and see the shots they took. Bando is not just a great researcher of the 101st but has become so close to the men and their families that he has unmatched access to information, comments and photos that make Bando's work a \\"must read\\" for those of us interested in the 101st ABN in WWII. I can't wait to see more of his books."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Outragous book, my father was in this book and I had to call him to recount the details to me first hand. Because of this book, I now know more of the war my father fought in."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Mark's love and research of the 101st Airborne is very evident. Once I started reading I couldnt put it down. The day by day account of the 501st and 502 PIRs almost left you as tired as the men that fought the battle. The information of equipment and how it was used and by whom was outstanding. It is a must have for any World War II airborne buff. I loved it."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the 101st Airborne during the invasion of Normandy. Based on the photographs alone (some are even in color) this book is well worth the price. The detailed writing of the author along with the insightful veteran accounts of Normandy make this a great read as well. I am sure once the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; premiers this fall there will be a rekindled interest in the exploits of the 101st and this book is a great place to see what it was like as a 101st paratrooper on D-Day."},{"Title":"101st Airborne: The Screaming Eagles at Normandy","review":"Mark Bando has produced another exceptionally high quality reference work on the 101st Airborne during the Second World War. This is his third work on the 101st and his second on this division during the Normandy campaign. Mark has a excellent style which pleases both those with academic interests and those which are interested in social history. Mr. Bando has had the unique privilege to personally interview over 900 survivors of the 101st which has given him and his works unparalleled depth and quality. Thorough research and careful editing are hallmarks of this author which are unfortunately missing in many other authors on the same topic. Readers interested in WWII airborne history in specific and World War II in general will be pleased with this work.Kurt Barickman Masters of Science German History 1871-1945"},{"Title":"Communication: Principles for a Lifetime, Second Edition","review":"This is certainly a pretty good textbook set for a communication class, and for volumes 1,2 and 4 I have little to complain about. Volume three, however, (Communicating in Groups and Teams) is FAR too enthusiatic about the value of group work. Granted, sometimes it is inevitable that we must work in groups, either because a project is too large for one person to do it well within the time available (a perfectly reasonable reason) or just because whatever company we work for requires it, no matter how pointless (unreasonable, but frequently unavoidable.) But to claim, as this book does, that groups invariably produce better work than individuals (as long as they follow the book's recommendations for how to communicate effectively, of course) is, quite frankly, to perpetuate a very popular lie.There are doubtless times that it's true that a group produces better results than any individual comprising it could have done; this is true if each of the group members are relatively evenly matched for talent (or even if some of them are) and especially if they have different areas of expertise, all necessary to the group function.But generally, if there is one highly-competent member of a group, that member will carry the group, and could have done a better job doing everything him/herself, given enough time. This is true no matter HOW effective the group is at communication. But this truth is unpopular with the many mediocre group members who would be rendered superfluous by an acknowledgement of its truth, to say nothing of the competent individuals who wouldn't be able to shift some of the work to their less-competent peers. So generally, everybody pretends to believe that group work is useful and productive, in order to avoid overworking the top people and leaving everybody else unemployed. Understandable, but still a lie, no matter how popular the lie.Given how popular the lie is, I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised to see it boldly asserted yet again (which is why I only docked the book one star for it) but it is annoying."},{"Title":"Communication: Principles for a Lifetime, Second Edition","review":"I have been teaching Speech Communication for over 17 years. I have taught a few other communication courses. It is not very often that Professors get to brag about a textbook. I recently had an opprtunity to visit one-on-one with the author.

This is one of the fringe - not really in the MacGregor family, but loosely connected - ones, but still has that same energy I've come to love so much in these books. Sparks ignite between a happy and friendly comic artist and her brooding neighbor.

I liked it, but there was a lot of embarrassed laughter and eye-rolling from me. I know it's somewhat dated, but I just wasn't feeling the romanticizing of this guy playing the saxophone. I also really don't like this old McGregor guy pulling the strings behind everything. It gives off a creepy vibe in the old man's dialogue."},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"This one, IMO, was just right.There's nice characterization, and it's a light, quick read.We do see shades of Cybil's parents' romance, but not as exaggerated. In fact, Cybil realizes at one point that Preston reminds her of her father, which is a nice bit of characterization there--women do frequently fall in love with men who remind them of their fathers."},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"\\"The Perfect Neighbor\\" by Nora Roberts is another fantastic addition to the MacGregor series. This time, it's the daughter of Grant and Gennie Campbell who takes the fall into love, with a little help from her matchmaking grandfather, Daniel MacGregor. This is a very quick and very enjoyable read!Cybil Campbell is a naturally outgoing and friendly person, so when a super sexy and mysterious man moves in across the hall, Cybil can't help but want to find out who he is and make him feel welcome. But when Cybil knocks on her neighbor's door to give him some freshly baked cookies, she is shocked by Preston McQuinn's abrupt and rude nature. And then he shuts the door in her face!Preston wants to keep his life the way it is, empty and lonely. A critically acclaimed playwright, Preston figures his rude greeting will keep his terminally perky neighbor out of his way. But living across the hall from each other, Cybil and Preston inevitably run into one another. And Preston finds it harder and harder to resist Cybil's warmth, goodness, and compassion.As time passes, Preston warms up to Cybil's many charms, and the two of them begin a passionate romance. But Cybil is hurt by Preston's determination to keep all matters of the heart out of their relationship. The second Cybil begins to show that Preston is special to her in a way no one else ever has been, he closes down, which makes it abundantly clear that he isn't interested in anything more than a fun, physical relationship.At least that's what Cybil believes. The truth is, after he was brutally betrayed and hurt by his first and only love, Preston has decided to never open himself up to that kind of pain again. But Cybil has found her way into his heart anyway and now Preston doesn't know what to do, so he keeps pushing her away emotionally. But when Preston lashes out at Cybil over a misunderstanding, she decides she deserves a man who can truly love and trust her, so she throws Preston out of her home, and her life.Lost without Cybil to brighten up his days, Preston realizes that he has pushed away the one woman who could have made him truly happy, the only woman he will ever love. Has Preston let his fear of being hurt destroy the one thing in his life that really matters? Or is the love that Cybil and Preston share strong enough to overcome the hurt Preston has caused?\\"The Perfect Neighbor\\" provides the perfect opportunity to visit with old friends from previous MacGregor books. Nora Roberts' MacGregor family is tons of fun to read about, whether this is your first time reading one of their books or your fiftieth! \\"The Perfect Neighbor\\" is a nice, light read that most will read in a day. There is nothing especially original in this book, but the characters are richly drawn and compelling and the MacGregor family is just plain irresistible - you can't help but love them.

I've only just recently caught on to Nora Roberts' talent, A Perfect Neighbor being my first Roberts experience. I was hooked from the first sentence and continued to read until I finished a few hours later.

I hope Ms. Roberts writes another story for Cybil and Preston, but if she doesn't I'll still know they belong together."},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"This is my first book by Nora Roberts. For some unknown reason, I do not have the interest in reading her works in the past (though I know she's popular and a bestseller). But 2 days ago, for some unknown reason again, I picked this book in the library. Once I pick it up, I can't seem to put it down.

When Cybil and Preston meet, the mutual attraction is staggering. Preston, having been hurt in the past, is adamant about not getting involved in a relationship again, while Cybil, feels that she's not ready to settle down yet. As fate or a MacGregor would have it, Cybil and Preston fall in love despite themselves. But in order for them to be truly happy, they must first learn to trust one another with their hearts.

Nothing quiet about Cybil's life. She is bubbly, upbeat, loves to bake (and give it away so she will not eat it all), and thrives on background noise. Good thing too, since all her neighbors in the building are LOUD. Except, that is for the new resident in 3B, across the hall.Everyone wonders who the new guy is. He is silent and seldom seen. Cybil finally gets the man to speak, thanks to her excellent and addictive cookies. She learns his last name is McQuinn, but that is about it. When a nosy, but good hearted, neighbor tries to set her up with one of her relatives (Frank) Cybil pays McQuinn to take her out. Cybil even buys him dinner. All just so the neighbor will see them and not be hurt. Cybil has come to the conclusion that McQuinn is a poor, out-of-work musician. He lets her think it too. But when Cybil finds out who he really is, her mind changes and she decides he is a narrow-minded, arrogant creep. Too bad she cannot seem to forget his kiss.McQuinn's life is dark and barren, the way he likes it. He is rude to everyone so they will stay away and leave him alone. The last thing he wants is to be around his happy and sunny neighbor, Cybil. But while kissing her good night, strictly for their nosy neighbor of course, the block of ice around his heart begins to melt.**** A light and sunny romance guaranteed to help sooth your nerves after a stressful day.

These family members are fun, witty, strong natured, hardheaded, and a joy. I can't think of another fictional family that I've enjoyed more than the MacGregors and their extended family. These characters have made every book written about them fun to read!In THE PERFECT NEIGHBOR, Cybil Campbell is extended family, after all the Campbells and MacGregors have a long history together. Her being extended family does not mean she's immune to Daniel MacGregor's matchmaking prowess. Daniel, the patriarch of the MacGregor clan is the best at what he does, be it business or making sure his family is all married, happy, and continuing the family line of MacGregors. He's an expert at harmonizing his family members with the perfect match, even if they don't think so in the beginning. Their blissful happiness usually changes their frustration at his interference.Daniel places Preston McQuinn, a quiet loner, right in the path of Cybil, whose bubbly and outgoing personality could either overshadow or compliment McQuinn. That's the difference between Daniel and other do-gooders - Daniel just places the people in each other's paths and lets magic happen. And since Daniel owns an apartment complex, he can't be held responsible if two tenants would be perfect for each other and he just happens to place them in close proximity.The magic begins when Cybil mistakes Preston as being unemployed and tries to hire him as her escort. For some reason, Preston agrees and Nora Roberts then takes the reader on a journey of fun and laughter, ok there is romance too!Daniel MacGregor has a perfect matchmaking record and no one, Cybil and Preston included, can deny that he's the best in the world at pairing people. I'm wondering if this is a talent that's gotten better with time, or if Daniel MacGregor is the male reincarnation of Venus, the Goddess of Love?"},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"This is the first MacGregor book that I have read.

He arranged for Preston to live opposite Cybil without either of them knowing the plan underneath. Well... The excitment begins with Cybil trying to be a good neighbour by going to Preston's apartment and introducing herself. She never expected rudeness from her new neighbour but that was exactly what she got. What was funny about this part was how Cybil regretted baking cookies for Preston but she could not take back what she had already presented to him. The story kicks off from here...Do enjoy if you gonna buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"Another great book about the MacGregor family.

Hopefully, we'll never have to find out... not as long as Nora Roberts keeps us up to date with little peeks into the lives of each branch of the Mac Gregor family tree. Cybill and Preston make a great romantic couple, although I found myself pleading with him to 'chill out' a lot sooner than he did! Still Ms. Roberts has always given us grade-A romances and this is no exception. My only complaint is that ; as with all of her books, I wish they were longer.

You've got me waiting on pins and needles!"},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"I really like how Nora Roberts chooses careers for her characters that are creative and grounded in the arts. The Preston and Cybil romance is true to form in that Cybil is a knows-what-she-wants, sassy woman and Preston is the typical, brooding, I-don't-want-to-fall-in-love, hotheaded heartthrob. You'll get a laugh out of how a thwarted mugging reminds the reader of Nora Roberts' sense of the strength of women.I think it was a well developed story with solid character history and easy to see tie-ins with the rest of the MacGregor series. The only problem is that this plot style is getting old. It seems as though I could superimpose these two characters onto half the other match-ups in this series and never know the difference. A person's genetic make-up doesn't REALLY dictate how hard they fall in love.But still, who can resist another chance to see the MacGregor in action?

The hero is young, handsome, talented, successful and independent--closely paralleling the heroine in most respects. Only in personality do they differ significantly. They live in a Manhattan Soho apartment house that is owned by \\"The MacGregor,\\" patriarch of this series of novels.The first third of the book is quite good. After that it tends to drift off into sex scenes and pointless arguments. But that first third has considerable charm, humor, intrigue. The heroine mistakes the hero for an unemployed jazz musician, whereas he is actually a very successful playwright, and she actually pays him $100 to go to dinner with her and $50 to kiss her. Read the book for the reasons.\\"The MacGregor,\\" once again, has arranged their being in apartments just across the hall from each other. His meddling gets a bit tiresome after a few books in the series, and apparently no one has the ability to tell him to buzz off and mean it.The atmosphere is quite good, mostly South of Houston. The dialogue is fine. And, as mentioned, the first part of the novel is excellent, but then it becomes just another R-rated romance with glitzy people who tend to take their success in life for granted. It would be interesting to have some characters who struggle just a wee bit to make the rent and buy groceries. It would certainly be more human, more realistic."},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"Okay, so I'm a late bloomer.

If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever."},{"Title":"The Perfect Neighbor (The Macgregors)","review":"As with all of the MacGregor series, I truly enjoyed this book.

Love is a universal theme."},{"Title":"Cosi the Screenplay (Screenplays)","review":"Having both studied this text and performed it on stage I am very familiar with it, and can honestly give it a 5/5 rating. Nowra has written a riotous comedy set in a mad house, obviously exaggerating his characters, but in such a colourful play this is essential to the comic value. Although essentially a comedy the deeper themes of love, fidelity, sanity and compassion are poignant but not overbearing, so although the readers/audience has a hell of a fun ride, one still comes away with a changed perspective. The warning from the reviewer above misses the point of this play somewhat - Nowra's purpose is not to make fun of or mock the patients, or to highlight their dangerousness; rather it is to show the extent of Lewis' compassionate involvement and 'journey' throughout. Cosi is a extremely funny yet very relevant script which gets my 100% seal of approval. Get it!"},{"Title":"Cosi the Screenplay (Screenplays)","review":"In Cosi, mental patients teach Lewis a lot about life in and out of the walls of the institution, a major theme being that of reality and deception.

Only very rarely does someone suffer so badly from mental illness that they appear similar to the characters in &quot;Cosi&quot;. Nowra's portayal of these patient's has been greatly exaggerated for theatrical purposes, and I just want people to be aware of that as many people I know who have read this book have simply assumed that all mentally ill people deserve to be locked away for fear of them hurting others. This is an incorrect assumption."},{"Title":"A Bookshelf Of Our Own","review":"This is a really terrific book that synthesizes an enormous amount of information in a lively and helpful format.

Adrian Rookwhistle thought he had the answer -- he'd give her to a circus. But it wasn't so easy.\\" Note that Adrian starts out as a respectable, timid, and dull young man before inheriting the drunken elephant and you can predict about 75% of how the story will unfold -- get about a third of the way in and you'll be able to predict the rest.There isn't even an attempt at plausibility as the author pushes Adrian and Rosy along on their adventures. For example, Adrian spends weeks at an \\"inn,\\" with his elephant secreted in the stables, without so much as a hint of a client appearing throughout the whole period. In fact, in this book no one who works seems to have any activity that interferes with their spending all their time with Adrian when he's around.Given the above, your enjoyment of this book will depend entirely on whether descriptions of comic mayhem and characters who are extremely broad caricatures tickle your funny bone. If they do, you might find this entertaining light reading. They don't do anything for me, hence the two stars. Outside of one or two funny lines, the whole thing was more of a slog than a romp for me."},{"Title":"The Short List: Lower Manhattan/Tribeca 2004","review":"NYC is not an easy place to move to. In fact it can be quite daunting. The Short Lists makes NYC more manageable. In a market which is already significantly saturated with guides, the Short Lists have managed to carve out a niche and truly differentiate itself - through QUALITY.They are guides for residents; Guides for people who don't need EVERYTHING, just the best of everything; Guides for those of us who live in and love the city; Guides for those of us who visit the city and want to know what the locals know. I use the guides (as they become available) to learn about parts of the city that I was not as familiar with and find new establishments that I did not know about before (Marc Kirschner should be shot for turning me onto the Donut Factory - but they really are the best donuts in NYC).Without hesitation - buy this book - whether you are visiting NYC, whether you are living in NYC or as a gift for someone who may appreciate it.

During a holiday in Cornwall, they became entranced with the county and vowed to move there. On a subsequent holiday, they quickly found and took possession of a side-by-side pair of cottages in the Cornish coastal town of Looe. Hardly had the ink dried on their purchase agreement when they discovered, literally around the corner from Looe and screened from view by a headland, the privately-owned St. George's Island. Miraculously, it was soon put up for sale, and the Atkins sisters snapped it up for a mere 20,000 pounds sterling, no small amount in 1964, just fourteen months after the original urge to relocate. Having yet to sell the home in Epsom, the Atkins Empire now encompassed their former residence, the cottages, and the 22.5-acre island replete with main house, barn, boathouse, and assorted out-buildings.This story, in the hands of any one of my favorite essayists on the subject of relocation, say Peter Mayle (A Year in Provence) or Bill Bryson (Notes from a Small Island) or Annie Hawes (Extra Virgin: A Young Woman Discovers the Italian Riviera, Where Every Month Is Enchanted) or Barbara Holland (Bingo Night at the Fire Hall: Rediscovering Life in an American Village), would've, I suspect, achieved 5-star irresistibility. As it is, Ms. Atkins' tale, culminating in the extraordinary efforts, with local help, to transfer the usual household, maintenance, and gardening stuff (plus a gemstone cutting and polishing device, assorted pottery-making supplies, musical instruments, a printing press, a telescope, photo darkroom equipment, and oil painting paraphernalia) to the island in the dead of winter in the teeth of gales and high seas, makes for an absorbing read if this life-changing swerve is something you'd consider doing yourself.Born in 1910 into the English middle-class, Evelyn's writing style reflects a certain British stiff-upper lip that enables the author and her sister to establish a beachhead on St. George's with the same doughty determination as the Allies at Normandy:\\"Babs and I ... tried to lever the heavy boat ashore with the use of planks which were stacked up by the boathouse. We extended the cable of the winch to its limit and slowly, inch by inch, levered the boat up to within a rope's length of the cable end. It was a difficult operation, for all the time the surf was dragging at the boat and pulling our feet from under us. At last we managed to attach the rope to the cable but twice the rope broke and twice the boat was sucked back into the breakers. Babs hung on for dear life to the stern, and I was the one with the rope I tried frantically to tie a knot to join the broken ends ... Desperation is a good teacher ... The resulting knot will not be found in any naval, boy scout or girl guide manual, but Glory Be! it held.\\"WE BOUGHT AN ISLAND has a small, 8-photo section of black and white snaps. Considering Evelyn's admitted love of photography, the reader might've expected, and would've appreciated, more.I'm knocking off a star for Evelyn's propensity to natter on about people and events that really have nothing to do with establishing themselves on the island. The narrative occasionally reads as if she's transcribing a diary of social events:\\"Ethrelda was thrilled with her supply of firewood and we had a very pleasant evening by her fire as she told us tales in her rich Cornish dialect. In the middle of this, a friend of hers called. She wore a red hat, a kind of tammy, and although she took her coat off and settled down she did not take the hat off. After she had gone Ethrelda volunteered the information that she never did take it off and the saying went that she kept all her money under it ... Actually she had some nerve trouble for which later she had to go for hospital treatment. She was a very cultured lady, of good family and she had a beautiful speaking voice.\\"It's not completely clear from the passage if the nerve trouble affected Ethrelda or the visitor with the red hat. No matter, I think.Have you noticed how reading one book will lead you to others? Recently, I read OFFSHORE, in which author Ben Fogle visited small islands around Britain's periphery under the premise of some day buying one of his own. In the course of his narrative, he mentions St. George's Island. I was so intrigued by the place that I acquired WE BOUGHT AN ISLAND plus another volume by Evelyn,Tales from Our Cornish Island, andThe Looe Island Storyby Mike Dunn. (I mean, haven't I enough unread titles already? Look at the piles!)Evelyn died in 1997 at age 87. Babs remained on the island until her death in 2004, age 86. The latter left St. George's to the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. It's open to day visitors in the summer and is one more place on my list of places to see in my lifetime."},{"Title":"We Bought an Island","review":"Although this book is old and out of print it landed in my hands in Queensland.

For example, those who would not hesitate to monitor and sue infringing competitors may not monitor non-competitors as potential licensees.To extract the most from intellectual assets, many factors, e.g., legal, technical marketing and sales, must be weighed. Edison in the Boardroom offers important advice to help firms take steps to meet that need. Despite its reference to \\"assets\\" in the subtitle, however, most of this book focuses more narrowly - on IP, and on patents specifically.Davis and Harrison, said to bring \\"a quarter century of IP consulting accomplishments between them,\\" document that some companies have long engaged in trying to optimize the value of their intellectual assets. The authors also assign companies to a five-level hierarchy based on a range of IP-management strategies. A goldmining metaphor is usefully advanced at one point to describe those levels as: defensive (staking claims), panning (cost control), mining (deeper profit seeking), processing (integration), and sculpting. The heart of the book consists of five chapters that discuss these levels seriatim and offers a host of useful ideas and anecdotes.The book is generally well-structured. For example, early in each of the five core chapters is a description of what \\"companies are trying to accomplish\\" at the corresponding level of IP-management sophistication. At the defensive level, of course, companies have processes for seeking, maintaining and enforcing IP. Yet, in the discussion of second-level companies, said to seek to reduce costs by exercising judgment about what is brought into and kept in their patent portfolios, it becomes clear how much various levels overlap. The first two topics may usefully be segregated for purposes of discussion, but it is hard to imagine any company that can afford, literally, to pursue protection without attempting to balance portfolio goals against concomitant costs. Indeed, one thesis of the second chapter is that no firm can seek the strongest protection for everything of potential patentability, much less seek it in every possible country.The third chapter diverges considerably. Companies featured there are said to seek, e.g., to extract portfolio value as quickly and cheaply as possible. Several have gone well beyond suing competitors or easily discovered, non-competing infringers. The most aggressive of such firms regard IP departments as profit centers and actively solicit licensees. Their success is sometimes remarkable. As the authors point out, \\"Worldwide revenues from patent licensing have grown from $15 billion in 1990 to over $100 billion in 2000.\\" Echoing the central theme of another recent book, Davis and Harrison also point out that, \\"Some experts estimate that companies are sitting on $1 trillion per year in unexploited licensing fees.\\"Fourth- and fifth-level firms are difficult to distinguish from ones discussed earlier - or from each other. For example, level-four companies are said to seek to integrate \\"IP awareness and operations throughout all functions of the company.\\" That seems necessary, too, for allegedly less capable compatriots. Further, when level-five firms are described as embedding intellectual assets and their management into the company culture, it is difficult to find divergence.The last are said to have as additional objectives: (1) staking a claim on the future and (2) encouraging \\"disruptive technologies.\\" Still, these could easily been collapsed into \\"Get a Crystal Ball!\\" Heuristics for meeting them non-serendipitiously are weak.Consider, for example, the mouse and graphic interface as commercialized on Macintosh computers. Steve Jobs is said to have derived both from the Alto computer developed by Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. While Jobs became a billionaire, \\"Xerox completely failed to get into the personal computer business, missing one of the biggest business opportunities in history.\\" To avoid repeating such mistakes, Davis and Harrison suggest that companies should \\"identify ways the corporation can benefit from [ideas outside their business capacity] before moving on.\\" They, not surprisingly, can offer little guidance.One IP attorney recently stressed the need for his colleagues better to understand the identification, protection and use of intellectual capital \\"effectively to address strategic corporate objectives.\\" Those for whom this is novel terrrain will find Edison in the Boardroom helpful.Also, senior IP counsel better acquainted with the topic may find the book useful. Some will face difficulty in convincing those at the same level or higher in the corporate hierarchy of its importance. To the extent that their advocacy of the critical role to be played by IP counsel is perceived as serving selfish aims, the book should help allay suspicions.For these and other attorneys, the value of Edison in the Boardroom could easily, and vastly, exceed its modest price."},{"Title":"Edison in the Boardroom: How Leading Companies Realize Value from Their Intellectual Assets","review":"The basic concept of this book is very intriguing: Briefly examine the life and career of Thomas Edison and then suggest direct correlations between his achievements with real-world situations in which various companies are now deriving substantial value from their intellectual capital. The authors also make skillful use of Edison's own recorded thoughts and feelings. Of special interest to me was what he had to say about the creative process. For example, \\"Men are just beginning to propose questions and find answers, and we may be sure that no matter what question we ask, so long as it is not against the laws of nature, a solution can be found.\\" This what the author refer to as \\"The Edison Mindset.\\" Edison apparently had almost no concern about a given experiment's \\"failure\\" which he continued to view, rather, as non-success to that stage. Too often, senior-level executives become preoccupied with results and neglect the process by which they can be achieved. Among Edison's greatest (and perhaps least appreciated) achievements was the establishment of the first research laboratory in which he and his associates would collaborate on various projects. Edison was a pioneer in recognizing the importance of assembling the best available talent and providing them with sufficient resources as well as a culture wherein those talents could be fully utilized. Davis and Harrison obviously have this point in mind when observing that &quot;benchmarking best practices without any regard for the underlying culture of the firm can be problematic.\\"NOTE: For those interested in this subject, I highly recommend Organizing Genius in which Bennis and Biederman examine the collaborative efforts of those involved at the Disney studios which produced so many animation classics; at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) which developed the first personal computer; at Apple Computer which then took it to market; at the so-called \\"War Room\\" which helped to elect Bill Clinton President in 1992; those active in the so-called \\"Skunk Works\\" where so many of Lockheed's greatest designs were formulated; at Black Mountain College which \\"wasn't simply a place where creative collaboration took place. It was about creative collaboration\\"; and at Los Alamos (NM) and the University of Chicago where the Manhattan Project eventually produced a new weapon called \\"the Gadget.\\"This is an extremely well-organized and well-written book in which Davis and Harrison use the life and career of Edison for guidance to understanding subjects of major importance today such as breakthrough innovation, collaborative effort, the development and management of intellectual property, and effective organizational transformation. They suggest that companies (indeed all organizations) function in one or more of five levels which comprise \\"the hierarchy of value\\" for intellectual property, a model created at Andersen's Intellectual Property Management Practice and then at ICMG:1. Defensive: \\"If a corporation owns an intellectual asset (such as a great business concept), it can prevent competitors from using the asset.\\"2. Cost Control: \\"Companies focus on how to reduce the costs of filing and maintaining their IP portfolios.\\"3. Profit Center: \\"Having learned how to control many of their patent-related costs, companies at this level turn their attention to more proactive strategies that can generate millions of dollars of additional revenues while further continuing to trim costs.'4. Integrated Level: In this level the IP function ceases to focus on self-centered activities and reaches outwardly beyond its own department to serve a greater purpose within the organization as a whole.\\"5. Visionary Level: \\"Few companies have reached this level of looking outside the company and into the future. In this level, the IP function, having already become deeply ingrained in the company, takes on the challenge of identifying future trends in the industry and consumer preferences.\\"After an excellent Introduction, the authors devote a separate chapter to each of the five Levels and then provide a case study of the Dow Chemical Company, followed by three appendices: Mining a Portfolio for Value, Competitive Assessment, and Integrated Performance Reporting. They suggest all manner of similarities and differences between and among these five Levels, in process suggesting also a wealth of strategies and tactics to consider when attempting to achieve the desired results at any of these Levels.To a greater extent now than at any prior time in human history, with all due respect to major developments such as the light bulb, telephone, automobile, and personal computer, corporations (indeed entire societies) seek \\"exciting, new, novel, and discontinuous innovations....For centuries, companies have linked ideas and money by embedding their new ideas (legally protected or not) into products to be sold or bartered. Today, however, an exciting new concept is revolutionizing the way companies extract value from their ideas: an idea no longer needs to be embedded into a product or service to create value. Today ideas are licensed, sold, or bartered in their raw state for great value.\\" And they are getting that value through intellectual property management (IPM). Hence the importance of encouraging and supporting \\"The Edison Mindset.\\"Here in a single volume, the authors provide a comprehensive, cohesive, and cost-effective program. It remains for decision-makers in any organization now considering or at work on the design of an IPM to select whatever material in the book is most appropriate to their organization's specific needs. One value-added benefit of this book is that Davis and Harrison can assist with that selection process. A point made earlier, however, deserves repeating: &quot;benchmarking best practices without any regard for the underlying culture of the firm can be problematic.\\""},{"Title":"Edison in the Boardroom: How Leading Companies Realize Value from Their Intellectual Assets","review":"I throughly enjoyed the book, I read it in just a few hours. It is an informative text on how to make the most of your IP, especially for those companies that either have a great start by already having IP (patents) or those that want to get started developing it. This would have particular interest for those who want to start their journey in developing IP processes in their company. I have worked in this field for years and have read many books involving IP, but never has their been such a informative book. The nice thing is it is 100% up to date on what is going on and who is doing it. For instance, learn how Dow, probably the leader in the field of IP Practices, does what they do.Davis and Harrison have taken their vast experiences and knowledge that they have obtained over the years of work with their clients and codified these experiences in a &quot;best practices book&quot;, particularly focused on how to manage the IP you already have.If you don't read this and you have an interest in this field, you will be missing what is likely to be the cornerstone text of the field.John Cronin, CEO of ipCapitalGroup, Inc an IP Professional Services Company."},{"Title":"Edison in the Boardroom: How Leading Companies Realize Value from Their Intellectual Assets","review":"At last a book with both stories and practical frameworks! I found Kevin Rivette's book a nice story, but it had little substance, whereas Harrison's ICMG co-patriot Dr. Sullivan's books are rooted in the theory of what to do to manage intellectual assets, but sometimes tough to apply without the help of his company. This book is a good blend of the two, with company examples and an intuitive framework for managing intangibles. And its not too long to give to my execs to read on a plane. Good show!"},{"Title":"Edison in the Boardroom: How Leading Companies Realize Value from Their Intellectual Assets","review":"The authors provide an excellent framework for companies to manage their intellectual property - without using too much consultant speak.They quote examples at different levels of their framework and look at companies who are suceeding at managing and valuing their IP effectively.

This book can become a cornerstone text for any professional involved with intellectual property to direct his or her focus for additional study and to ensure his or her working knowledge of the challenges confronting professionals in other disciplines that together form a corporate intellectual property management program."},{"Title":"Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms: A Lifetime of Memories from Striking Out the Babe to Teeing It Up with the President","review":"&quot;Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms&quot; is a perfectly titled baseball yarn from an era when life was easier, gentler and the players did indeed wear flannel and travel from city to city by train. It wasn't so long ago when &quot;a western swing&quot; by the New York Yankees included a trip to Cleveland! The author was a &quot;submarine&quot; pitcher for the Tigers, Red Sox and St. Louis Browns (now the Orioles) in the 30s and 40s. His years with the Tigers are his main focus. He does not disappoint. Readers will be treated to a pleasant, leisurely journey through the halcyon American League. We visit with his favorite teammates and opponents; Mickey Cochrane, Joe DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg, Ted Williams, Charley Gehringer and Schoolboy Rowe (remember him?). This reviewer is too young to remember these guys as players, though I got DiMaggio's autograph as a kid and saw Rowe, then a Tiger coach, get thrown out of a game at Yankee Stadium for arguing with an umpire. This is all very old school, soothing and nostalgic- light years from the &quot;Bronx Zoo&quot; and &quot;Billy Ball&quot; of later years. And then? And then, the author proceeds to ruin his story by subjecting us, over the final 47 pages, to his boring, proper, upper class, (Republican?), country club, politically connected second life as a successful businessman and lobbyist. We get to visit with Gerry Ford, Joseph P. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan. Isn't this exciting? B-O-R-E-I-N-G! For what purpose? Why? For filler? For an ego boost? In my opinion, Mr. Auker seriously watered down an otherwise superior, compact and focussed biography. Readers can decide for themselves if he ruined it. In this reviewer's opinion, the effect of the final 47 pages is to render &quot;SCFU&quot; useless for all but Tiger fans. The rest of us should bring another sports (or train) tale to read in the club car."},{"Title":"Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms: A Lifetime of Memories from Striking Out the Babe to Teeing It Up with the President","review":"This is a great baseball book.

Elden Auker pitched in the major leagues from 1933 through 1942. He was a good pitcher, though never a great one. In this book, this good, humble man looks back on his career and the many personalities he came to know. Auker began his career by coming in out if the bullpen and striking out Babe Ruth. Some of his best tales are about the Babe. For instance, the Yankees had trouble finding a roomate for him because Ruth would often come in late and loud, and wake up his roomy. But Auker tells us the real reason no one wanted to room with Ruth was because he farted almost constantly throughout the night, and in a highly fragrant way. So the Yanks would stick the latest rookie with Ruth, and the rookie would invariably complain. Auker tells other tales about such greats as Ted Williams, Hank Greenberg, Charlie Gehringer, Lou Gehrig, Goose Goslin, Mickey Cochrane and Leo Durocher. This book is great entertainment and is recommended for anyone with an interest in baseball history."},{"Title":"Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms: A Lifetime of Memories from Striking Out the Babe to Teeing It Up with the President","review":"Former pitcher Eldon Auker (1910-2006) describes playing for the Detroit Tigers from 1933-1938, plus the Boston Red Sox (1939) and St. Louis Browns (1940-1942). Auker had a marvelous style for telling tales. Here he describes playing for the 1934-35 pennant winning Tigers, teamates like Charlier Gehringer and Hank Greenberg, opposing stars like Babe Ruth, Lou Gherig, Ted Williams, etc., and many ballplayers of lesser abilities. Auker also reveals facts about his submarine pitching, his favorite manager (Mickey Cochrane), train travel, playing three sports at Kansas State, etc. It was interesting to learn that young shortstop Leo Durocher apparently stole from Babe Ruth, resulting both in a beating and getting kicked off the team. It was also interesting to learn that some in Auker's home town of Norcatur, Kansas didn't know about pro baseball, and that contrary to myth, old time players also played for the money (if far less of it) rather than merely for a love of the game. Credit both Auker and co-author Tom Keegan for prose that is warm, readable, and very memorable. Too bad that Auker (who was 90 when this book was written) didn't give us more than 212 pages - one senses he could have talked for hours and always remained entertaining.This is a great read for baseball fans both young and old. Readers might also enjoy GLORY OF THEIR TIMES and WHEN THE GRASS WAS REAL, books that interview several aged former players about baseball in the bygone era."},{"Title":"Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms: A Lifetime of Memories from Striking Out the Babe to Teeing It Up with the President","review":"Elden Auker is the type of man you wish could live forever, because to know the man - even if it is just through reading this book - is to treasure him.

That means it's like Elden is across the table from you telling you stories. He tells them plain-and-simple no matter what the topic, and the book flies by. Before you know it, the book is done and you put it down with a smile on your face, just happy you got to know this man.Auker tells the good and the bad, the nice guys and the not-so-nice, and the general atmosphere in Major League baseball in the '30s.

Some of the stories I have read in other books, but Mr. Auker provides his own frank opinions on a number of baseball personalities. He pulls no punches in his dislike for Leo Durocher whom he regards as a thief for stealing The Babe's watch. Nevertheless, Leo was a great manager and he turned his life around before he died which should account for something. Auker believes Pete Rose should not be reinstated into baseball because baseball has ironclad evidence that he bet on baseball but Rose will never admit it. Auker states that Charles Comiskey is the one who should have been kicked out of baseball because Auker says that Joe Jackson was given $5,000 by the mob and when he turned it in to Comiskey and said, &quot;Here, I don't want this money. I don't want in on this deal.&quot;, Comiskey told him to keep his mouth shut. I have read quite a bit on the Black Sox scandal, but I have never come across this story. That Jackson accepted $5,000 I can agree with, but that he turned it in to Comiskey with the above comments, is certainly news to me.

Auker, a submarine pitcher who might be classified as a member of baseball's solid middle class of performers, had a long and successful career in business after his playing days. At age 90, he apparently continues to live independently with his wife of almost 70 years in retirement in Florida. His tales mostly ring true, allowing for the human habit of telling things in a way that enhances the role of the storyteller somewhat. This book ranks well above most baseball memoirs, if not, in my opinion, as high as &quot;Rowdy Richard&quot; (Dick Bartell's autobiography) or &quot;Cobb Would Have Caught It&quot; covering Detroit Tigers baseball over the years. I would have given this book 41/2 stars if that rating were available. I do question, as did one earlier reviewer, the story concerning Joe Jackson's effort to return mob money to Comiskey, who refused to take it; that is one I have never heard before, unlike the story of Durocher stealing from Babe Ruth &amp; being beaten up by the Babe as a result, a story long in circulation. One of the book's sidebars, presumably not by Auker, contains one of the biggest errors ever allowed to slip into a baseball memoir. It states that Babe Ruth hit .271 with 6 homers in 1934, the year he hit his 700th homer at Navin Field in Detroit. Who let this whopper slip by? A quick glance at the record books by the writer or editor would have disclosed that Ruth hit .288 with 22 homers &amp; 84 RBIs that year-not very Ruthian but hardly as putrid as the writer would have it. (Nor could it be a reference to his statistics at the time of the 700th homer which was his 14th of that season.) Where did those numbers come from? There is also a reference, in the body of the book, to Auker pitching in the first game of the 1935 World Series in Chicago; actually, the first game was in Detroit &amp; the third game of the series,which was the first game played in Chicago, is the game being referenced. Not technically an error but confusingly worded. These minor things aside, the book is a quick, fun read &amp; should be enjoyed by all baseball fans."},{"Title":"Sleeper Cars and Flannel Uniforms: A Lifetime of Memories from Striking Out the Babe to Teeing It Up with the President","review":"I was given this book as a gift and I think it's great!

First, let me say that I am an astrology hobbyist and not a professional. This book seemed more \`professional' or at least attempted to be. The book itself was easy to read but, at times, hard to understand. The author assumes a lot about the readers - namely, that we understand all these astrological/natal chart terms, and secondly, that we have astrology charts handy and by our side. I think that was a HUGE mistake on the author's part - the book never mentioned that you will need to have birth charts at the ready, yet the entire book relies upon having your own birth chart ready and also that of your partner, friends, family, etc. The text is pretty useless without having the charts. I figured this book would be more for laymen, but it wasn't. I expected a fun, light read and this wasn't that type of book. I don't have much respect for this author - she infuses the text with her own personal opinions (particularly about people who dislike the study of astrology), she hypes her own credentials throughout, she constantly mentions \\"read my other books for more information,\\" and she doesn't follow through with some of her own complaints. For instance, she talks about the importance of using imagery to get a better feel for astrology and how it works (ie imagine a crab (Cancer) working alongside a bull (Taurus)), and yet the book has very limited illustrations. Very unimpressed by this book. Theattempt to link psychology/astrology here fails, and there are other books out there that do a far better job of linking the two without actually attempting to. This was a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Approaches to Qualitative Research: A Reader on Theory and Practice","review":"We used this book in a senior undergraduate field research course within sociology. It was a fantastic learning aid, very comprehensive and well written.

There is even a chapter that deals with conducting research on race issues by showing how even the seemingly straightforward racial categorization of \\"white\\" needs to be challenged. It really forced the class to come to terms with their own assumptions.My favourite chapers were:- Prior's chapter on text and research, \\"Following in Foucault's Footsteps\\",- Miller & Crabtree's chapter on \\"Depth Interviewing\\"- Guba & Lincoln's chapter on how a researcher's personal ontology affects their methodology in \\"Competing Paradigms in Qualitative Research: Theories and Issues\\".- Charmaz' chapter on \\"Grounded Theory\\"The only quibble I have with the work in here is the chapter on online methods. It is rather outdated and based on old assumptions about the Internet. For example, when dealing with how to do research using email, it tells the budding researcher that they need to learn HTML in order to properly format their emails in an attractive manner and makes no mention of the online web-based survey tools widely available for online questionnaires. This small quibble aside, the book is great and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to explore qualitative methods or to someone who is looking to expand their repertoire of research methods but doesn't want to have to take an entire course."},{"Title":"Mesozoic Vertebrate Life:","review":"The title is misleading. If you're looking for information on pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, or Mesozoic crocs, this book probably isn't for you. However, if you want to get the skinny on Tyrannosaurus arm movement and what they were used for (yeah, amazing, eh?), new dinosaurs, and generally good information on dinosaurs, this is a good book to consider. Heavy on the second half of the Mesozoic, the book none the less manages to have a good variety of papers about various aspects of dinosaurian paleobiology, phylogeny, and behavior. A great volume."},{"Title":"Mesozoic Vertebrate Life:","review":"Mesozoic Vertebrate Life Edited By Darren H. Tanke and Kenneth Carpenter with Michael W. Skrepnick as the art editor is a new research inspired by the paleontology of Philip J. Currie is an excellent book... a book for the advanced dinosaur enthusiast. This book goes into detail about Theropods, Sauropods, Ornithischians, Dinosaurian Faunas, Paleopathologies, Ichnology, and Dinosaurs and Human History.This book has a whole host of contributors(46 to be exact). All of the men and women are tops in their respective fields, so this book is like reading a medical book with all of the resplendent medical terms. Ah, but doen't give up, there are some very excellent drawings that help explain what the author is talking about, so your not left in the dust choking on the dust. I've noticed that the best dinosaur book on detail are written in this style where a collaboration of many authors that are expert and on the cutting edge with break throughs are written this way.I would say this, the fossil record is telling the finder something... the finder has to study what he has found and make a determination and conclusion as to what he has found. All of this takes education, trial and error, and luck. So, you have the best guesses written here... things may stay as they were presented or they may change with insight, only time will tell.If you are more than just a casual dinosaur devotee, than this is the book for you. It is light on the early Mesozoic, but it makes up for it in the late Mesozoic. The book is mainly composed of North American Mesozoic, but there is representation in China, and South America included.There are excellent references included with there abstracts. This s not a book for children, this is an advanced case study of the dinosaura of the Mesozoic time. Those wishing for a book that compares jaws and endocarnial anatomy will relish this book. There is even an abstract on &quot;The Impact of Sedimentology on Vertebrate Track Studies&quot; which I found fascinating. I didn't know they went to that much detail, in models of track formation show clearly that the layer upon which the foot descends retains the most information of the impactor. Stresses are distributed radially away from the impact site and decrease exponentially with distance.If you want detail this book has it. There are seven sections as I mentioned above, and they are divided into 33 chapters. This took a while to read and digest the information. This would make an interesting additions to a home library."},{"Title":"Mesozoic Vertebrate Life:","review":"Despite the deceptively simple title, this book only covers dinosaurs (although there is a mention of mammal tracks in the chapters on ichnology). Further, the 33 individual papers (except for the last one on Dinosaurs in Fiction) are for advanced students and professionals. It would behoove you to have already read A.S. Romer's Osteology of the Reptiles and The Vertebrate Body as well as E.H. Colbert's Evolution of the Vertebrates and Michael Benton's Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution before embarking on this book.Still, if you already have the equivalent of a good undergraduate grounding in the field of paleontology, you will find this book a fascinating read. Well worth the money as long as you know what you're getting."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"I got this book never really thinking it would help.

What a joy to discover this book! I found Eason's methods easy to implement and have had wonderful success with them as well. His script for improving the quality of sleep was just what I needed. His methods are easily adapted for use in hypnotising someone else. I have used his methods a number of times with some of my Reiki clients. A word of warning however - this is one of the most poorly edited books I've ever read, even allowing for the difference between British English and American English.

The book arrived quickly which is great. The only comment I have, and it really isn't important to me, is that the previous owner underlined key passages in the book which were different from what I would have underlined, but for the terrific price, I can't be happier."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"I liked this book a lot and its easy to read.

Furthermore, you are then encouraged to be flexible in your use of that approach and adopt your own methods.The tone of this book is refreshingly unusual for a self-help book, it is light and humourous throughout as well as delivering lots of content, a rarity in my opinion.I also have a revised copy of the book which was easy to read and seemingly word perfect."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"This book is fantastic. You read all these books about NLP and quick persuasion and stuff like that but they never get really in depth with the topic of hypnosis or anything like that. You only get the over view of hypnosis and the point where the mind changes state or goes on auto pilot. This book on the other hand does not. It talks about hypnosis and the best bit is that it gives you steps on how to get into self hypnosis and if you were going to do it to someone else. After creating one of my own sessions and seeing if I could get into hypnosis did it work? Yes it did only because I wanted it too. That is the key! If you think that when you buy this book and think once you have done one of the sessions out of this book you will lose weight or give up smoking, no it doesn't work like that hypnosis only works if you want it to work. This books explains that as well. It if great to learn hypnosis and understand it better by actually being put into hypnosis.Get the book and give it a try."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"If you need to make any changes in your life (and let's be honest we all do) you will love this book.

Adam teaches you how to use self hypnosis to improve your life. Whether you need to stop smoking, lose weight or start making more money this book will show you how.I am reaping the benefits of this book. You can too!"},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"Some people have said in their reviews that this book is life changing, and I suppose I have to agree because it is the first book I bought on self hypnosis before deciding to become a Hypnotherapist.My initial reaction was that it was a great book and very comprehensive in the self hypnosis process. But I have now changed my opinion slightly because of all the other reading on the subject I have done.The detailed explanation of the self hypnosis technique is very thorough and the finer points about how to word the suggestions so that you don't pick up anything that doesn't fully help you is left out on every other book I've read on self hypnosis.Another great chapter is on how to record your scripts to CD which also is explained in detail.But...This book appears to have been put together in a hurry because in some places it does not flow from subject to subject. Like the author has chucked in some content as a bit of filler to pad the book out.Another reason the book looks hastily done is that it has a great number of spelling mistakes and doesn't look like it was professionally proof read or edited.These small flaws, however, do not take away from the fact that this book is better than the majority of self hypnosis texts in view of content. It is very thorough and detailed without confusing a beginner like I was when I first read it."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"Eason is not the best in the writing department but his info is very user friendly. I'm not one to do a lot of memorization, which he asks you to do in some parts, but he made it very simple through visual association. I tried one session to attract the perfect house, in the perfect place at the perfect price and now I'm sitting in it as I write. Go figure...

It's opened my mind to many new thoughts and possibilities. BUT... I can hardly stand to read it because of all the silly gramatical errors a simple proofread would have fixed.

The order he uses to teach self-hypnosis works well. The things I have planted using his book have, after a couple sessions, become part of my everyday consciousness (or uncounscious, as Mr. Eason would probably say.) In any case, this book has helped me create new good habits fairly easily."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"This book has changed my life.

The specific technique demonstrated here is very easy for anyone to use and allows anyone to apply it.Having applied much of the books content to myself as well, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning how to use self-hypnosis in this way. The settling techniques and accompanying explanations in this book are not found anywhere else in the many self-hypnosis books that I have read over the years. This alone made it worthwhile.I got one of the recently revised copies too and it is very easy to read and as I have said, for me it has been very useful for a variety of reasons."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"I got this book simply because my daughter bought it, raved about it and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Having only intended on \\"dipping my toe in\\" and casually reading a few pages I got drawn in and loved it. My husband and I have since spent lots of time in trances! This book is going to show you how to go into a trance, that is, how to get into a state of hypnosis. Then it gives a load of various ways to do things while in trance and use it for all the stuff that most people will buy the book for; stopping smoking, losing weight, all that kind of thing. I just found it interesting and a lot of fun even though I had no major issue to deal with. This is a great book; easy to read, easy to follow and not loaded with technical or academic terminology. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"As one of the previous reviews says, you will keep on referring to this book. My copy is very well thumbed already! You do have to read it through from cover to cover the first time, you can then refer to the parts that you want to concentrate on. I heard this guy Adam Eason speak on radio here in the US and he was funny and entertaining and that style comes through in this book.I bought the book to help to stop smoking and I have since stopped smoking using the techniques in this book. More than that, I have honestly found it much much easier than I expected.All in all it is excellent. I loved it and am a true convert. I was totally new to this kind of thing and am now getting right in to self-hypnosis, and goddam I love the feeling of it. It sure is a great way to feel good."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"It is always a pleasure to be able to review books written by members of the Hypnotherapy Association and to bring the work of our members to a wider audience.This time it was indeed a true pleasure as the book reviewed was one of the most readable books that I have come across in the many years I have been reviewing for the hypnotherapist journal. But in being readable it was NOT being patronising. It was ensuring that the valuable messages that it contained were broadcast in the most readily comprehended way by specialist and layman alike, It is a work which I feel goes in right at the top of the charts of \\"must have\\" books.I have seen no other book deal with Self Hypnosis in such an interesting, entertaining, informative and businesslike manner. It is a profound experience masterfully revealed and explained.\\"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis\\" is a ground-breaking, practical, step-by-step guide to harnessing the power of your unconscious mind.Using a structured and unique methodology, this book shows you how absolutely anyone can enter hypnosis easily, how to be in control of the state of hypnosis, how to deepen your experience of it and deliver powerful changes or make updates to your life; all by yourself!Released in August 2005, as I have said above, it is one of those books that should be on YOUR bookcase. NO! I don't mean that. It should be in your possession BUT I feel that you will refer to it so often that it will hardly be in the bookcase at all.Using the skills of self-hypnosis that Eason shares, here are just some of the things you can expect to learn:Increase ConfidenceManage and Overcome StressDevelop a Better MemoryDistort Your Perception of Time. That's right, learn how to slow it down and speed it up!Become a Non-smokerAchieve and Maintain Your Ideal WeightLet Go of PainHow to use language with yourselfRelease stressNurture a special relationship with yourselfSo much more.It is a work of art. It is a book for hypnotherapists and all those interested in hypnotherapy and people looking just for personal development; by a hypnotherapist who is also a skilled communicator, and is already finding deserved acclaim in the hypnotherapeutic world.The book provides the reader with an informative tour of the whole world of Self-Hypnosis. Myths are exploded and reality is clarified and developed.The book is a journey around into and behind the scenes of Self-Hypnosis. It has been expertly crafted by a man who obviously knows his subject in and out. It is not a \\" dip-in\\" book. It is a book that needs to be read from front to back so that each step is introduced, explained and developed and you move on only when that full explanation has been given. It builds brick by brick the foundation of your own understanding of this fascinating subject.I have to admit I pick up some review books and have to plough through them laboriously - especially when Liz is shouting deadline dates at me !! This was not the case with this book. It was written with the skill of a novelist who leads you on an exciting journey as you enthusiastically turn over the page to see what happens next.It is a riveting read. You may not agree with everything that he says BUT he doesn't expect or want you to. He wants you to think for yourself. In brief he seeks to facilitate our experience of Self Hypnosis. At no time does he try to dictate it and that I find wonderfully refreshing.The book is well produced. For one thing it is manageable. You don't need to be a weightlifter to carry it about. The print is clear and pleasing to the eye making it a very easy book to negotiate.I found the scripts within the text of great interest and have already begun developing their themes to suit my own style of working.That is what the book is about. Adam Eason is giving us the tools and the methodology so that we can get on with the jobI have no hesitation in drawing your attention to Section Four - Advanced Methodology and Application. This section is masterfully created and I feel will be well received by all readers. I was particularly pleased to see an element on Healing included too. The Healing Visualisation Script is one of the best I have come across, and I use it often and also recommend it to othersA refreshing read. A true milestone of hypnotherapy writing.The secrets of self hypnosis are there for you. I urge you to explore them !!David Slater: Official Book Reviewer for The Hypnotherapist Journal."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"This was nothing short of a joy to read throughout. It is fun and you can tell that the author writes truly wanting you to experience something wonderful and for the reader to benefit from the books content.I have referred back to this book and have been quoting sections of it continuously to friends and family alike. I have applied its theories and contents to most areas of my life and am finding them to be transformed with the slightest effort. I now use self-hypnosis before work and when wanting to get to sleep and I have even helped my self in ways that I never thought I would be able to.I bought this book because it was reviewed in \\"Changes\\" magazine, the magazine for the Anglo-American Book company and the editor of the magazine described the book as being truly fresh and standing out in this field. I concur with this.I found it to be practical and easy to read and I recommend it to anyone looking for a different approach to self-help."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"I bought this book having watched Adam Eason speak in Las Vegas at the end of 2005. Self-hypnosis works in many ways and most particularly for me, by using your internal dialogue in a new fashion.Meanwhile, Adam Eason is a delightful practitioner of his own techniques mostly because of his own obvious dedication to his subject, his sense of fun and his direct and uncomplicated interactions with people and his readers.This book, therefore, is in my opinion to the authors practice of self-hypnosis as any recipe book is to the process of cooking, delivering and consuming delicious food. Without a doubt, the recipe is there, and all of the ingredients are described fully and thoroughly, but even more than that, there is the flavour, the taste, the atmosphere and the human vivacity that lies at the heart of possessing these skills.When self-hypnosis works best for me, it is because my conscious minds communications are working in harmony with my unconscious (as well as with my own self interest and motives), and I have seen and heard Adam Eason deliver this notion with a joyful manner that is reflected throughout this book.What I have found striking about about this book and the information contained therein is not so much the language skills that you learn and develop in communicationg with your your self (which are impressive) or the structure of the process that you learn to apply self-hypnosis to your own life, but the compassion in which it is all delivered; there is an inherent ability within the pages to recognise, in a very short sentence, how someone can be helped to help themselves. You really do find that in the book. Terrific stuff."},{"Title":"The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis: Harnessing the Power of Your Unconscious Mind","review":"This is the finest book about self hypnosis I've ever read.

He starts you out with defining what each word means then moves along to all the basics like inductions. Then he shows you how to write new programs and so on.There are plenty of scripts and then lots of subjects that he covers in depth.

If you don't currently know anything or much about self-hypnosis this book will teach you a lot - and it will do so in a readily accessible way.

I'm reading it for the first time, alongside with the French original. I've already found some mistakes in the translation, and not small mistakes either.

If you can't read the original, though, this is not a bad alternative."},{"Title":"Dangerous Liaisons","review":"I bought this for my Kindle after having seen the movie. I have to say, as much as I loved the movie, it's amazing how much is lost without the epistolary element; the way Laclos juxtaposes things -- Valmont's manipulative letters to Danceny's ardent ones, Merteuil's accusations against Prevan to what Valmont actually does to Cecile -- is something that one misses when the letters are taken out of the mix. If there is one flaw to the book it is the heavy handed way in which Valmont finally achieves his great conquest with Madame de Tourvel...after so much subtlety it seemed cheap and melodramatic to use the tactic he did.This book is certainly dense, and there are entire letters which do not move the plot forward (Danceny's and Cecile's letters to each other are like a musical number in a pre-Oklahoma! stage show: they tell us more of what we already know, but rarely give us anything new) and one gets the sense that some things get lost in translation -- I especially felt that since I'm pretty sure I ran across several sentences that were just plain ungrammatical or generally made no sense, as if they'd been babelfished. However, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a juicy, lascivious classic."},{"Title":"Dangerous Liaisons","review":"Such corruption. Such ruthlessness.

The novel (adapted into a fine film with Glenn Close, John Malkovich, and Michelle Pfeifer in the 1980s) is one of the great works of world literature. Shocking in its sexual candor, even by modern standards, it offers great insight into the decadence of French aristocracy on the eve of the French Revolution as the two main characters set out to debase and destroy innocent lives - all for their own amusement."},{"Title":"Dangerous Liaisons","review":"I loved the movie Dangerous Liasons with Glenn Close and John Malkovich and decided to try this audio version of the book. I can't say it was better than the movie, but the audio is superb. It is on 3 CDs and so is longer than the movie and supplies more detail. Since it is in letter form, its style more closely follows the book. The readers show incredible and intense emotion in their voices - you can almost see them in your mind. It made my commuting a joy for several days - I was almost sorry when I got to the office or arrived back home and had to quit listening. Such devious-ness! Who is the most wicked?

Unfortunately there is no way to give different stars for Kindle versions."},{"Title":"Dangerous Liaisons","review":"Although this book represents a historical period from the past, which is the french aristocracy a few years before the french revolution, I believe Dangerous Liaisons is still of actuality. After all, libertinism is still popular in high circles of society, whether political or artistic such as Hollywood, while adultery, cruelty and manipulations are weapons still used by several couples and certain people, in all circles of society, whether they are rich or poor. For the success of Dangerous Liaisons is not only due to its excellent representation of the french aristocracy, but it is also a masterpiece of storytelling where several characters fall into a pit of vengeance, lust and cruelty, which Madame de Merteuil, a powerful but dangerous Marquise, employs as she pulls the strings of this story and manipulates all she meets in order to accomplish her projects. Of course, the Vicomte de Valmont is her equal in terms of cruelty and lust, but Madame de Merteuil remains the most diabolical as her thoughts and actions are revealed through her letters, along with the other characters, whose letters are all condensed in this epistolary novel, which inspired Heiner Muller to write a play called Quartett, with the same characters, a theater adaptation by Christpher Hampton, and a movie by Stephen Frears whom several people consider a masterpiece.

Thubron examines day-to-day life in Western Russia, Estonia, Belarus (\\"White Russia\\"), Ukraine, and Georgia, near the end of Leonid Brezhnev's premiership. He finds despair and cynicism, as well as an unshakeable sense of humor about life under communist rule.Thubron's work is a travel narrative, an account of a car trip that he took alone in 1980 that was planned and approved by the Intotourist, the Soviet tourism board. Traveling as a \\"building company director,\\" Thubron meets many people along the way. He talks with Russian and eastern bloc tourists at the campsites where he spends the night, locals in cities and towns, and dissidents whose addresses he has received from associates in Great Britain. Thubron also describes run-ins with police officials who are shocked to see a foreigner traveling alone by car in a British car. The first question he is asked while registering for his first overnight campsite stay is \\"Are you a group?,\\" which Thubron describes as a \\"quintessential Russian question.\\"Intermingled with his descriptions of the landscape and important historical sites, Thubron recounts various escapades, stories of people offering to buy his clothes (especially his jeans), of the advances lonely women who see him as a way to escape to the West (or to have an escape for a day), of many vodka guzzling evenings, of officious Intourist tourist guides, and of the talk of dissidents who seem unconcerned that their homes are bugged. Thubron offers his own insights about lesser known sites, like the Josef Stalin museum in Gori, Georgia, Stalin's hometown. In an exciting passage near the end of the work, Thubron describes how security personel in two white Volgas tail him all the way to the Romanian border.Throughout, Thubron expresses a Western sensibility and skepticism about the Soviet Union. His narrative mixes a blend of awe for the accomplishments of the Russian people and horror for what the Russians have endured and suffered. In fact, the book begins with an admission of his long-held fears about Russia, dating back to grade school when he first viewed in awe maps of the Soviet Union stretching across the globe.Thubron's prose style is both poetic and urbane (with an impressive vocabulary); he recounts many unforgettable episodes. The book ends where it begins with Thubron marveling at the vastness of Russia, an impression that the reader will remember, too."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Ride around with Thubron in the last years of the crumbling Soviet Union. He takes you into the apartment buildings to find some of the most interesting -- and heartening -- testaments to human color ever encountered in travel writing.There are some truly jaw-dropping observations made by our driver as he stumbles upon people who are dealing with oppression in ways that &quot;westerners&quot; have never had to imagine.Through the vodka, through the endlessly repeating housing blocs, Thubron takes us to a deeper, more personal understanding of life under the Soviets. On the way, he introduces us to individuals (yes, strong individuals) that are not easy to forget."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"As an interested reader of the Soviet Union and Russian culture, I picked this book up two years after I read In Siberia. I was amazed at the amount of detail the author poured into his journeys across the Soviet Union. He was able to visit the Russian citizens, homesteads of famous icons of years back (Tolstoy among them) and see cathedrals we can only see in pictures. His writing style and demeanor may strike readers as distant and unattached but he went over there to observe and he did not observe this place through rose-colored lenses-he showed us what Russia was really like in 1980. If you strictly want to read about Russia, you may be disappointed when you read the material towards the end which is about Georgia and Armenia, but my ignorance of those former republics were replaced with notions that they might be more beautiful and more interesting than all of Western Russia. The whole way through you will be captivated, appalled and intrigued with his journey. This is a must-read for anyone interested in Russian culture."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"Written by someone who somehow managed to drive a clunker with UK plates through the Iron Curtain between West and East Germany and all the way to Moscow. Thubron then motors all the way to present day Azerbaijan and St.Petersburg. It is a snapshot not of present day Russia but of 1980 Soviet Union.The faint glimmers of hope that these people held on to and their continual amazement at the fact the author would explain the West was afraid of them are an excellent historical reference. Told that we are the threat to the Soviet Union a lot of the people were both in awe and afraid of the author.The amazing fact that he camped his way around a closed country is a great read of how they perceived us as much as a straight travelogue.Well recommended"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"If this gives any indication of enjoying a book :I read it in two gulps / just could not put it down !This writer is just captivating .I ESPECIALLY was charmed by the poignant descriptions of peoples' faces ..A MUST READ especially , if you are curious to understand the puzzling dichotomy of repressionand, too authentic warmth and hunger for beauty that comprises this fascinating country, Russia..Spaceba!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"This is a good account of traveling through Russia in recent times.

Thubron is a vivid writer who paints memorable portrait of the people and places that he explores. The only knock on this book is that it is becoming dated. Originally published in 1983 it tells more about who the Russians used to be, rather than who they are. Still worth a read though."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"I wondered, when ordering \\"Among the Russians\\", whether the fact that it had been written a quarter of a century ago, about a world that had apparently disappeared, would detract from the impact of the journey. I need not have worried as it has the immediacy of a trip completed yesterday.The book perhaps - and understandably so - does not quite have the fine polish of the recent \\"Shadow of the Silk Road\\", my first experience of Thubron, but is none the less beautifully written and absolutely fascinating. The combination of the unorthodox travel arrangements for the time (a car), the poetic and precise (I checked Google Images while reading \\"Shadow of the Silk Road\\"!) descriptions of places, the intimate and thoughtful portraits of people and, particularly impressive, the provision of a detailed historical context, make for a compelling read. Extra thrills, including a dramatic conclusion to the book, were thoughtfully provided by the KGB.With all this it might seem unnecessarily querulous to ask for more. But in both these books we are left with a feeling that the author has, perhaps unconsciously, fenced off a part of his personality and his activities. In this age of \\"letting it all hang out\\" we are sometimes left with unanswered questions, sometimes on simple practical matters.On the one hand, a voyage, especially a solitary one, involves constant and often stressful interaction between the traveler and his surroundings. We do see a lot of this but are often left trying to imagine details. On the other, it is often marked by long periods of silence when the traveler, a long way from home, will reflect on his life, loves, beliefs and hopes. Aside from a few memorable incidents, we do not see very much of this.A writer is fully entitled to reveal, or to hide, as much as himself as he chooses. But a bit more of Colin Thubron, the man, would give his travel books an additional vital dimension. Perhaps - after reading \\"In Siberia\\" - I should try his novels!"},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"As a cultural anthropologist who was been living and working in St. Petersburg, Russia for several years I can recommend this book for only what it is now. This is a travel narrative written over a period of weeks by one person, who did not speak Russian, in a tightly regulated tourist industry. Firstly, most people would agree that not speaking a language of a culture seriously inhibits your ability to assess what is actually happening and why. Secondly, at the time this was originally written, the Soviet Union, nor anyone else thought that it was in decline (1980 was also the year that the Olympics were held in Russia and an year after the invasion of Afghanistan)and seeing it as such is only because of hindsight.Thuborn's travel is from the in-tourist perspective, several other Western travelers who visited for conferences and business trips might explain something completely different. I know one such American photographer, Demarest Peterson, who traveled to Russia in the 1950's who was virtually uninhibited by the tourist guides from the in-tourist department, and was even able to take pictures of worshipers in a Russian Orthodox church during this time!Consider the alternative, imagine a Russian who was able to visit the US, under false pretenses, at about the same time, alone, poor in English and by car (if this would ever have been allowed). Would they be allowed to travel independently? Probably not. Would they be monitored by governmental officials? Probably yes. Would they be requested to join an official tour group to \\"give them a better traveling experience\\" (to keep an eye on them)? Yes, most certainly. Would their documents have been examined? Yes. Seeing it from the other side may help to explain the experiences that Thuborn had. Very few traveled to Russia from the West during this time which may help to explain the enigma of Russia more than one persons two week journal.I can recommend this book from only this perspective, as a historical narrative, and not as something to be considered for 2010. Russia has changed greatly in the last 10 years alone and it resembles nothing of the Soviet Union in 1980. If taken as a guide this book, now, will only heighten one's sense of cultural shock. And when you return, write of your own experiences, they are sorely needed."},{"Title":"Among the Russians","review":"I should preface my review by making it clear that I am not generally a fan of hyper-descriptive, verbose writers in the vein of Hemingway. That said/understood, I found Among the Russians to be so long-winded and detail oriented (in terms of describing places, buildings, forests, etc) that it was difficult to get a sense of the people. He interjects tales of his human interactions sparingly and a bit chaotically, so it isn't the type of book that I enjoy. A balance of description, history, and on-the-ground human interaction is key in making a book like this readable and entertaining. His style misses this by quite a bit. That said, it is an interesting account of 1980's Soviet Russia.

In between, he took some parting shots at college professors and women. He coined a new word \`Booboisie,' which to him signified those whom he considered to be intellectualism's weakest link. He was an elitist who had no love for democracy, the common man, or anyone else who disagreed with his exalted opinions. He leaves no doubt in THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE that he bemoans the lack of an educated, ruling class in America: \`The capital defect in the culture of These States (phrase borrowed from Whitman) is the lack of a civilized aristocracy, secure in its position, animated by an intellectual curiosity, skeptical of all facile generalizations, superior to the sentimentality of the mob (mob: a term often used by Mencken), and delighting in the battle of ideas for its own sake.' Mencken sees a fake aristocracy of intellectual has-beens, wanna-bes, and never-wases as constituting the current ruling intellectual clique: \`But this bugaboo aristocracy is actually bogus, and the evidence of its bogusness lies in the fact that it is insecure.' He would much rather see \`a genuine aristocracy founded upon very much different principles. Its first and most salient character is its interior security.' He bitterly adds: \`No such aristocracy...is now on view in the United States.' He describes the current sad state of intellectual degeneracy as a sort of perverted hierarchy: \`What one beholds, sweeping the eye over the land is a culture that, like the national literature, is in 3 layers--the plutocracy on top, a vast mass of undifferentiated human blanks (notice the elitist disgust here) bossed by demagogues at the bottom, and a forlorn intelligentsia gasping out a precarious life between.'When Mencken took time off from bashing his numerous targets of his intellectual bulls-eyes, he occasionally had something germane to add to literature and language. He was a firm believer that American language, culture and literature were superior to that of its English ancestors. In THE AMERICAN LANGUAGE he asserts that the American language is free from the distracting variations of the English used in Great Britain: \`The characters chiefly noted in American English...are, first, its general uniformity throughout the country; second, its impatient disregard for grammatical, syntactical and phonological rule and precedent; and third, its large capacity...for taking in new words and phrases from outside sources, and for manufacturing them of its own materials. The first of these characters has struck every observer, native and foreign. In place of the discordant local dialects of all the other major countries, including England, we have a general Volkssprache for the whole nation, and if it is conditioned at all it is only by minor differences in pronunciation and vocabulary, and by the linguistic struggles of various groups of new-comers.' He also adds that rhetorical flourishes are another peculiar American trait that the English sorely lack: \`The American, from the beginning, has been the most ardent of recorded rhetoricians. His politics bristles with pungent epithets; his whole history has been bedizened with tall talk; his fundamental institutions rest far more upon brilliant phrases than upon logical ideas.' He concludes with an invidious comparison of American freedom from stifling English formalizations to the English habit of stuffing words and phrases with dead and dying images: \`But if you will put the English of today beside the American of today you will see at once how much more forcibly they (the inevitable processes of linguistic evolution) are in operation in the latter than in the former.' English in England, Mencken concludes \`shows no living changes since the reign of Samuel Johnson.' It is difficult to imagine that so politically incorrect a writer as Mencken could possibly be taken seriously today. But perhaps it is this very trait that renders his ascerbic tongue as welcome today as back in his."},{"Title":"The American Language","review":"I can't really say I *read* it so much as I *scanned* it.

As a Shodan in Tomiki Aikido who no longer regularly practices the style (I've shifted to traditional Aikido to \\"expand my horizons\\"), this book is a great reference guide when I want to practice \\"the good stuff\\".In addition to the basics of technique/terminology/breakfalls/history of Aikido, Sensei Saunders comprehensivelty takes the reader through each of the major katas associated with Tomiki Aikido. The photos are plentiful, and effectively outline each and every technique step-by-step in a way that has not been done before in any other Tomiki Aikido book to date. However, it is interesting to note that several of the techniques Sensei Saunders presents in these katas, although technically correct, are not the versions of these techniques associated with the Aikido that Kenji Tomiki originally taught. The techniques are not wrong, just different, modern versions. Something to keep in mind.On a side note, although I agree with the poor production values that KHPatton has described about Sensei Higashi's book, I can assure you that not only is Sensei Higashi's ability the real deal (Yes I've been on the receiving end of them), the techniques descibed in his book are actually closer to the original style that Kenji Tomiki taught. Modern Tomiki/Shodokan Aikido has actually left behind some of its Judo roots and embraced some of the more flowing styles of traditional Aikido. Sensei Higashi's book is a reminder of where Tomiki Aikido originated, and that there is often little need to change.I disagree, however, with KHPatton's assessment of Sensei Narayama's Aikido: Tradition and New Tomiki Free Fighting Method book. Although the photos in Neil Saunders' book are far superior, Sensei Narayama (the current global head of Tomiki/Aikido) has a very clear precise and POWERFUL technique, and his book is written in a very direct, honest prose. The photos of Sensei Narayama in this book demonstrate how Tomiki/Shodokan Aikido allows you to put a lot of direct power into the techniques when they are correctly applied. Although they are not pretty, they are very effective. And yes, I've been on the receiving end of his techniques as well at seminars.A third book I would recommend would be Dr Lee Ah Loi's Tomiki Aikido (Randori and Koryu no Kata). The photos in this book are not very good, missing a lot in the transitions between techniques. However, Dr Loi outlines the techniques for all of the Koryu no Katas, and presents a traditional, but softer, style of Tomiki Aikido, and proves that women can effectively execute this style of Aikido as well as larger, muscular men like Higashi and Narayama.In short, I highly recommend Neil Saunders book. It should be considered an essential reference for the modern Tomiki Aikido student. However, it is important to remember that it mostly presents the style of modern Tomiki Aikido that has been influenced somewhat by Ueshiba's traditional style. Saunders even wears a Hakama throughout the book - a big no-no among most Tomiki Aikido practitioners. This book should therefore be supplemented with the other books mentioned above, as they represent both original form and modern variations of this very, very underrated style of Aikido."},{"Title":"Aikido: The Tomiki Way","review":"I thought the book was excellent, it provided easy to follow pictures for not only techniques, but also for etiquette.

The photos in the Kindle edition are very small and essentially unusable. To take an example, the first of the Randori-no-Kata (shomen-ate) is illustrated with 5 photos. Instead of being able to enlarge each individual photo to see the detail, the Kindle treats this group of photos as one, and because the group of five photos is already the size of the page, clicking on the enlarge button doesn't actually enlarge anything.

KHPatton's assertion that Higashi Sensei wrote the book for a \\"quick buck\\" is shameless and dishonorable since Higashi Sensei has totally dedicated his life to the propogation of the martial arts in the US.

She dreamed of being taken away by a member of her rich family, as one of her friends did. One day, her dream comes true. Her father, Sir Charles Travenning, takes her away. However, she does not know he is her father. He tells her he knew her father, and is doing him a favor. In fact, he is doing the favor to his ill-fated lover, Melisande's dead mother.Once she goes to Sir Charles' home, she is made a companion to his soon to be married daughter Caroline, Melisande's half-sister. There, Melisande falls in love with Fermor, Caroline's fiancee, and after that turns dangerous, she falls in love with Leon, an escaped French aristocrat. She is soon betrayed by both, and flees to Fenella's dress shop, where she displays clothes to the wealthy. Once again, she falls in love, this time a lawyer. She is betrayed again, and flees again. This time, the final time, as a lady's maid. Here is where tragedy strikes the tragic heroine of this story. She is to stand trial. . .for murder.I didn't think to much of this book when I started reading it. I was soon sucked in the story. It is wonderfully written, as are all of Plaidy's works, but this one is special. The last few pages has words so beautiful, it brought me to tears. Unfortunately, I was in school when I read it, and had to stifle them. This book is perfect for anyone interested in a good book with a beautiful ending."},{"Title":"It Began in Vauxhall Gardens","review":"Jean Plaidy was one of my favorite authors when I was in my 20s -- I read most of her books on the Norman and Plantaganet dynasties of England. This book I found on a library shelf about 10 years ago and it made a strong impact on me. I remember insisting that a friend read it (which is something I almost never do with books), and I have never forgotten it.So when I recently re-discovered this book I was eager to purchase a copy that I could re-read and keep on my bookshelf. The book is a departure from what the author normally wrote under her Jean Plaidy pseudonym. Rather than part of a series on English royalty, it is a stand-alone book based -- according to a very brief note on the copyright page -- on an actual event. The way the note is worded indicates that the author's story is an imagined version of what might have happened.The book traces the life of Melisande, a beautiful girl born from the illicit affair between a wealthy Cornish gentleman and a poor but beautiful commoner. It is a somewhat sad story, as Melisande's life has been dictated -- though she does not realize it until near the end of the story -- by her father's desire to keep their relationship secret so as not to ruin his impeccable reputation. In spite of her sad beginning and somewhat dreary childhood in a French convent, Melisande is a spirited, hopeful girl who desires nothing more than to make her own choices and have some control over her own fate.When at age 16 her father finally takes her from the convent and brings her to England, it appears that she may finally get her chance to do just that. Melisande's beauty and charm, as well as her naive and generous nature, captivate everyone (almost) she meets. Nevertheless, it is her very qualities of charm, naivete and loyalty that result in the ultimate tragedy of her life.Although the course of Melisande's life is more tragic than happy, and though the story has a sad conclusion, it ends on a hopeful note. Melisande has three courses open to her, and the author ends the book without telling the reader which one Melisande will choose. I like that she ends it that way -- inconclusive endings where the reader is left to speculate make for more satisfying and stronger books.Although I did enjoy this book, I have to say the second time around it seemed far less remarkable to me. I don't believe this is due to any flaw in the book, but just that I have outgrown Jean Plaidy's style. Her writing style -- both in her books written as Jean Plaidy and those written as Victoria Holt -- is simple and, especially in the dialogue between characters, often repetitive and stilted. It is well-suited, I suppose, to the Victorian settings that she most often chose for her stories. As a teenager Victoria Holt books were among my favorites. However, I read one a few years ago and found that it just didn't do anything for me; I had outgrown her style. I think the same is true of this book. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable read that I would recommend."},{"Title":"It Began in Vauxhall Gardens","review":"This book is based upon a true story that occurred in nineteenth century England and went on to become one of its most notorious scandals.

Each story is a delightful read! Whether you like Poirot, Miss Marple, or her other lesser known characters there is a story in here for everyone!"},{"Title":"13 For Luck","review":"While Agatha Christie is an excellent writer of mystery stories, one has to digest them within the context of the English society she was a part of. The characters are very British in dress and demeanor, which can have an adverse affect on your enjoyment of the story. At times, the characters are stiff and a little too proper, which does at time seem quaint.Nevertheless, the 13 stories are still fun to read and ponder. Four of them feature Hercule Poirot, three star Miss Marple, two have the talents Harley Quin, two showcase personal consultant Mr. Parker Pyne, one utilizes the intellect of Tommy and Tuppence and a last one describes the demise of the great Inspector Evans. Short and generally to the point, each of the stories in this collection is an excellent selection for reading at night before the lights go out."},{"Title":"13 For Luck","review":"It's thirteen short stories with all the favourite characters from her normal books, but condensed into a short version of a Christy novel.I like it, because instead of taking an extremly long time to read a long novel when I'm in a mood for Christie, I could read one of her typical brilliant stories on the way to school, and still love it as though I had read an entire one in half the time. Hercule Poiroit, Miss Marple, Parker Pyne... it's a tea-lightful blend of the most refreshing sort....not a book to be scone-full of."},{"Title":"Darker Places","review":"Darker Places is a spectacular collection of never before published stories by Matheson. While reading, I found myself asking \\"Why?\\" Why were these stories never released? Why did he hold back on us? Luckily I don't have his phone number, so I couldn't call and ask. But boy, did I want to! This collection is definitely an excellent read!The first few stories have an animal theme, as the main focal point was a dog. I found this rather interesting. I think Matheson was ahead of his time with the first story. The dog in \\"The Revolution\\" swayed the characters to start thinking about vegetarianism and was in league with other animals in the world to start a revolution. I'm not sure when Matheson wrote this particular piece, but throughout the whole book I felt as though I was traveling through the episodes of the \\"Twilight Zone\\".In \\"The Puppy\\" we are taken through a \\"Pet Semetary\\" like journey. It begins with a boy desperately wanting a puppy, and the mother refuses... In the end the boy finally gets the puppy. In order to appreciate this story, you have to learn how the puppy gets to their apartment in the first place, as well as, all the trouble that is gone through to terminate this animal.My favorite story in this collection has to be, without a doubt, \\"Little Girl Knocking On My Door.\\" The dog in this story plays a small role, but he is there nonetheless. The main focus of this story is a little girl who comes knocking on the door of a family's house to see if the girl living there can play. No one knows where she comes from, and has never seen her before in the neighborhood. The best part is when the mother and father finds out that the address that this anonymous girl gives as her address is in reality, not a home. Definitely a spooky story!While reading, I visualized these stories in black and white television. I could feel the stereotypical comforts of the 50's and 60's through the dialogue given by the characters. I could feel the pain, confusion, and fear that each character held. There are a total of 5 stories and 2 scripts in this collection. These stories definitely take you to darker places. Absolutely amazing!5 Stars from me!"},{"Title":"Finding Hippocrates","review":"This is a powerful book which I thoroughly enjoyed reading. Before commenting about the book, I feel I must digress for about 100 or so words. When I came to Amazon to write this review I couldn't help but see the review written by a Mr. William B. Davis of Bridgeport Connecticut. Mr. Davis obviously didn't read the same book I read. He has a substantial problem with the medical profession and, perhaps he should actually read a book before he reviews one.Nevertheless Mr. Davis was correct in one account; this book is written through the eyes of a physician. It's name, Finding Hippocrates does not disquise whose perspective this book may represent. But this author is no &quot;ersewhile doctor.&quot; Instead, he writes with a passion about these issues that more physicians...many more physicians... need to rekindle. That is why this book is so beautiful.This author does not whine about managed care's intrusion in his earning potential. In fact, nothing in the book even suggests this. He talks about physicians who are medical predators and he makes a very pithy statement that &quot;the licence to practice medicine is not a licence to steel.&quot; Although he is a disillusioned physician he is not a disgruntled one.None the less, he does admit to being angry. However, he is not angry at health plans; instead, he is angry at hospitals, the government, patients, the medical profession and himself. This doesn't sound like some self-serving polemic to justify an attack on the insurance industry to me. The author's anger is not misdirected and because of this he directs his anger to find a solution. First he explores the history of health insurance in a very understandable way. Then, he examines the efforts of Bill Clinton to reform health care in an extraordinarily honest and absolutely brilliant expose' which makes one wonder if he was an insider to these proceedings when they were occurring. Finally, he offers a solution which is so compelling that it makes me hope and pray that it is read by those in positions who have the power to realize this vision. This is an extreemly well written book. It clearly articulates the authors passion and vision. It provided a comprehensive and understandable explanation of the health care system and health care legislation from the turn of the century to ERISA and the Patient Bill of Rights. It concludes by creating a future paradigm for health care policy that sounds completely workable and logical. Most extraordinarily it does all this in only 206 pages, an accomplishment, itself, worthy of immediate kudos. I wish this author well and can honestly say that medicine needs more doctors with the vision of Howard Smith, M.D."},{"Title":"Finding Hippocrates","review":"Finding Hippocrates: Discovering Universal Health Care for the Millennium is an exceptional discussion of the present state of American health care. It is written in a clear and totally unambiguous style which flows seamlessly from chapter to chapter enabling the reader to finish this book in a single sitting and come away from it enthalled about the content and excited over its vision for the future.The author, himself a physician, makes no bones about the faults of the medical profession and speaks openly and honestly about physicians who place the interests of health plans above those of their patients. He presents five horrifying examples of the ultimate harm this ethical adulteration has caused to patients and devines the common denominator in each example to be the relationships providers have with health plans. He argues elogently that managed care is the ultimate seduction of the &quot;physician&quot; which causes them to place their economic survival above the survival of those for whom they care and to whom they owe a duty.What is most frightening about these examples is that the medical conditions treated in each were not complicated problems, but, instead, were common simple things for which anyone of us could go to a doctor. In his summation of these anecdotes he says of managed care, &quot;Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, told a story about a doctor who created a monster. These chapters tell a story about a monster that created a doctor.&quot;Even so, this book is not merely a collection of medical horror stories. These stories are more for effect than style. They are used by the author as a devise to set up his argument that health care is a fundamental right for all Americans. The ultimatate purpose of the book is to formulate a new paradigm for American health care based on this principle. I must say that the author does so in a very compelling manner.He presents his vision as the hypothetical &quot;Ideal Universal Health Care Act.&quot; Although fantasful legislation, it is not merely a product of the author's imagination; instead, it is very plausable. His vision is the product of a thoughtful mind and, consequently, it is and should be thought provoking to anyone who reads it.For a first time author, Dr. Smith makes a very important statement and I hope this book receives the recognition that it deserves."},{"Title":"Finding Hippocrates","review":"This is a powerful book which I thoroughly enjoyed reading.

First of all, it would appear that the entire viewpoint is from a Doctor (since the author IS one). Of course he feels that the current medical managed care program is terrible. The HMO's are restricting how much money he makes, thus is not allowing him to get rich. So, what does this erstwhile doctor do? He decides to write a book and tell his sob story of how managed care is hurting him, the profession, and the people.Managed care CAN be a good thing, if used right. However, there is a point to where doctors get greedy. So many times there are tests that are performed that aren't really necessary, but if the doctor can perform them, then they will - and bill the insurance for as much as they can get. Granted, if they don't have insurance, the patient eventually gets harassed by bill collectors. But, what is NOT mentioned in here is how doctors still get paid, even if the bill goes unpaid by a patient. They have insurance for that, to which they cry for as much money as possible.I apologize to this author, but what has been written here is pure hogwash. Managed care does have its problems, but what it DOES do is prohibits doctors from gutting the American citizen's wallets and lining their own. Clearly, this book is an attempt by this doctor to coax money from the people in order to make up for what managed care has cost him to lose."},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"This book collects five essays by scholars on different aspects of slavery in the Muslim Middle East. Contrary to the title, it is not a comprehensive review of the phenomenon -- vast in time, space, and social, political, and economic features -- but snapshots of slavery in a few limited contexts. Perhaps the essay that will appeal most to non-specialists is John Hunwick's discussion of the role race played in enslavement in northern and western Africa; he teases out the various conflicting strands of legal-religious theory and practice on the ground to bring to life a relationship between slavery and race with tantalizing differences from and similarities to the system Americans are most familiar with. Also good are the editor's (Shaun Marmon) discussion of domestic slavery among the Mamluks and Yvonne Seng's on slavery in Istanbul. Michel Le Gall contributes a translation of an account by a French doctor of the slave trade in late eighteenth-century Cairo; it contains some useful data and has been judiciously annotated, but anyone who wants to use it seriously will no doubt consult the original French. The volume ends with a posthumous essay ranging broadly over time and space by the great scholar David Ayalon. While there is probably nothing much new here, it is fun to watch a great mind playing with history on the broad scale. It is a pity that the editor did not feel the need to supply the references that a scholar like Ayalon would surely have included in a final revision had he lived to complete it."},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"Compiled and edited by Shaun E. Marmon, Slavery In The Islamic Middle East is an impressive and informative selection of scholarly essays examining the institution of slavery as recognized and regulated by Islamic law, and as incorporated into Muslim societies well into the modern day. Looking at military slavery in Islam in the pre-modern period, the connection between skin color and slavery, a memoir portraying a raw and real look at victims of the African slave trade, and more, Slavery In The Islamic Middle East is a welcome and invaluable addition to Middle Eastern History and Islamic Studies reference shelves and reading lists."},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"The five essays in this book were not intended to offer a comprehensive look at slavery in the Islamic world, but to serve \\"as contributions to the ongoing study of slavery in Islamic societies,\\" according to editor Shaun Elizabeth Marmon.In her article, the first, the editor focuses on the representations of slavery and all its aspects in narrative Mamluk Egyptian sources. But she focuses mostly on the domestic slaves, who were \\"omnipresent in Mamluk urban society.\\" As she notes in the article, \\"The enslaved individual suffered a kind of legal and social metamorphosis. He left the realm of human beings and entered the real of commodities (al-sila) thus losing his legal capacity (ahliyya) to act of and for himself.\\" Thus, the slave had no rights whatever-- to marry of his own accord, to own property, to act as a witness, to inherit or bequeath, to be in authority of any kind, or to execute any contracts, to control one's sexual life or even to control her own offspring. Moreover, religious admonishments to beat a slave \\"point to a harsh reality.\\" And make no mistake, the society was built upon the labors of slaves.Next, Yvonne Seng discusses slavery in 16th century Istanbul. This study, too, is based on contemporary documents, studied at the Muftuluk Archives in Istanbul. These archives reveal that the slaves were treated as objects in various inventories of household goods. Unlike \\"mute property,\\" they were considered \\"property with voice\\" (mal-i-natik), albeit sharing a demeaned position equal to that of livestock.To a large extent, slaves ended up as part of the freed, subject population, or reaya, but they ended in this undesirable position as a result of the barbaric devshirme, the annual tax on subject peoples taken in human children. But \\"Slaves [also] began their passage into local communities through capture during either military campaigns or commercial slave raids.\\" The primary collection points were via Ottoman campaigns into the Balkans and Crimean raids into Russia and Poland. Slaves also included Hungarian, Wallachian, Bulgarian, African, Circassian, Albanian and Greek victims. Slaves were inculcated in Islamic practice and forced to convert, thus sometimes moving from infidel slave to Muslim Ottoman subject.John Hunwick then takes on \\"Islamic Law and Polemics over Race and Slavery in North and West Africa\\" in the 16th through 19th centuries. As he notes at the start, race was always a secondary factor after belief. \\"In the Muslim world, attitudes towards various human groups have been most obviously an artifact of the single greatest prejudice of Muslim peoples-the prejudice against 'unbelievers,' for these were the archetypal 'other'.\\" Slavery was seen as both \\"a result of unbelief and, in most cases, a cure for it.\\" Nevertheless, Black Africans were a group, clearly identifiable by race, who had been transported to the Mediterranean Muslim region as slaves (and as former infidels). Even after manumition, there was \\"a clear tension between the idealism of the shari'a and certain attitudes--no doubt of long standing--about black Africans.\\"Michel Le Gall has translated an 1802 memoir of Dr. Louis Frank, who describes in great detail the deplorable conditions of Sudanese slaves held in Muslim Egypt, and specifically Cairo. This includes the prejudices of slave-owners and the many diseases encountered by the slaves. As a result of Islamic wars of conquest, the subjects of the vanquished rulers became the sultan's \\"captives and they are either kept in his service or are sold or exchanges for commodities such as linen, towels, clothing, cows, camels, horses, etc.\\" Secondly, slaves were kidnapped, a practice which brought \\"a smaller number of these unhappy wretches into a state of slavery.\\" Thirdly, Islamic warlords trailed \\"wandering hordes\\" with no religion or government to protect them. The besieged men, overcome by hunger and thirst, were then bound with cords and chains, and sold or exchanged for other commodities.Finally, we read the work of the late scholar, David Ayalon on the importance of the Mamluks to Islam's military might. \\"They were taken from their homelands at or near the age of puberty,\\" he writes. Upon reaching the Muslim lands, under force, \\"they were converted to Islam.\\" Unfortunately, the scholar wrongly concludes that the boys could quite often better their lot via this route. The fact is, only \\"the best\\" were chosen as Mamluks, and in any case, they were slaves, forced to comply with their masters' wishes. To conclude that this lot was somehow better than life with their families in Europe defies logic.Nevertheless, this is an important collection.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Slavery in the Islamic Middle East","review":"I just reread this book for the second time in ten years. I first read it in 2002. While I admit the book was somewhat interesting, it did not provide me with enough interest to give it a Four-Star rating. I felt the differing authors provided no consistency in thesis which only made me question where the essay was going.The book contains five essays that are rather disjointed in time and descriptions. The last review by the late Professor David Ayalon had very little to do with slavery. Indeed, it seemed to be more about Islam's descent from major power to nominal participant in the world scene by late 20th/early 21st century. Which would be fine in a geopolitical book, but this was a book that was supposed to deal with Slavery In The Middle East.There was little that I learned from this book. However, the two best essays were written by John Hunwick and Michel Le Gall (Le Gall's Being A Translation Of Louis Frank's 19th Century Essay). The rest are not worth mentioning, although I admit I was interested in Ayalon's essay from the standpoint of his explanations of why Islamic societies fell short of Western Societies in technology. \\"The Cause of Western Superiority--A Tentative Explanation\\" discussed in detail the reasons why Islamic societies have fallen short of Christian societies. Indeed, his viewpoints were expanded in full by Bernard Lewis in his text What Went Wrong. I plan to read that book at some point.In short, this book is best read as an ancillary document to other, better researched titles. I have read and reviewed on Amazon the book Slavery In The Arab World, written by Murray Gordon. That was an excellent book and one I highly recommend for both professional scholars and serious amateurs. I also read some years ago Race & Slavery In The Middle East written by the great Bernard Lewis. This book too I recommend, although I have yet to review it for Amazon. Indeed, John Hunwick even cites Bernard Lewis in his essay \\"Islamic Law & Polemics Over Race & Slavery In North & West Africa (16th-19th Century),\\" on pages 43 & 63. This only shows how Bernard Lewis affected so many other historians (Even Murray Gordon), and how he will always be the scholar of note for Islamic/African studies.A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."},{"Title":"Just for the Record","review":"The memoir by David Allan Coe is nearly unreadable. Obviously self published, Coe does not even appear to have subjected himself to an editor. Typos and grammatical errors are so plentiful as to distract from the content. One interesting aspect of the book is Coe's account of his time in prison and the infamous killing which put him on death row. What he attempts to clarify is the investigation into the suspected killing of a fellow inmate who made a homosexual advance on him. After allegedly dispensing of the offender with the wringer from a mop bucket, Coe was placed in a block with death row inmates, so he says. Not the same as a sentence of death. This account fly's in the face of public statements going back to the 70's to press and audiences at his live performances. The book settles the question of Coe as a racist. It does not appear he thinks any less of blacks than he does anyone else. As an avid Coe collector for many years, I had to have this book and ended up paying crazy money for it. After reading it I realized it is not highly collectable because it is loved or especially compelling reading. It's collectable because it's rare as relatively few were printed. That's probably not a bad thing. For a more interesting Coe collectable from this era, seek out the May 1978 Easyriders Magazine which features a candid interview with revealing photos of Coe and his them multiple wives."},{"Title":"Spaceling","review":"OK, look. I have read probably around 10,000 science fiction books in my life. I am always looking for ones that have original and imaginative backgrounds, not just another \\"this is an FTL starship approaching a lost colony or newly discovered planet\\" or \\"this is an urban wasteland of the mid-21st Century\\" so many seem to be. _Spaceling_ is the best of these by far. When I had to sell my library, this is one of the few I kept. This is a background I wish I could enter into as a character. A few people are born with the ability to enter new worlds and change into a form appropriate for those worlds. Objects can be brought to different worlds by the characters, and \\"morph\\" themselves in various ways (experiment). How society, both the muters and the normals, react to this is well thought out. The ending features at least a couple twists that took me by surprise, and that takes some doing. I would give this one six stars if I could...I have actually dreamed about it!2013 Update:First, let me apologize for reviewing here, instead of the hardcover (which is my copy). Second, since the book was written in the late Seventies and seemed to be set approximately a third of a century into the future (ie, about now) I thought I would look at how it is holding up. It is a very different world from ours, even disregarding the One Impossible Assumption of muters. Piserchia failed to foresee the changes brought about by the Computer Revolution (as did virtually all pre-1980 science fiction except \\"A Logic Named Joe\\") and had a background featuring global cooling (which was a plausible future then) and Peak Oil (still a looming problem. IMHO). This might bother some readers, but it does not bother me and I purchased this for my Kindle, even though I have the book in hardcover."},{"Title":"Spaceling","review":"If you've read Piserchia before, don't be afraid--this is by far her most cohesive SF adventure and well worth reading. This is one of the most empowering (if I can use that word without throwing up) adventures that I can remember reading as a teenager with a FEMALE main character, who travels through different dimensions by muting through different rings she sees in the sky--something non-muters can't see or understand.

While I'll read just about anything, particularly sf and fantasy, Spaceling is *definitely* one of my absolute favorites. The story has so many twists and turns that the truth doesn't come out until the last few pages, one of very few books I've read where I haven't been able to guess what's going on somewhere in the middle. I've never read anything else by Doris Piserchia, and I'm not even sure she's written anything else, but I certainly hope she has, because Spaceling is about as good as it gets, and I'd like to see if she could top it. I highly recomend Spaceling, for teenagers *and* adults--it's interesting enough to hold just about anyone's attention, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Spaceling","review":"As soon as I saw this available for the Kindle (I check several times a year) I immediately purchased it. I look forward to being able to explore this book by word, and to re-experience the world it depicts. I placed my main review by mistake on the paperback instead of the hardcover version of the book, please see there for my updated review."},{"Title":"Spaceling","review":"I read Spaceling when it was first published, several decades ago. I was a preteen and was having a hard time finding female protagonists that I liked. I fell in love with this story. I still love it, even after all these years, and having read thousands and thousands of books since that time (I am now in my mid-40's). I wish it was still in print for pre-teens. Having read so many Youth novels of late (screening them for my pre-teen daughter), I am disappointed in the lack of unique stories for that age group. They mostly seem to be copies of Harry Potter, Twilight, or the Hunger Games series. Spaceling is still, after all this time, a unique story. My one regret with this tale is that Pischerchia never desired to write sequels. There are so many possibilities with the premise she created..."},{"Title":"Spaceling","review":"I read this book around the time it was first published, when I was 7 or 8 years old. Elements of the story stayed with me for decades, long after I had forgotten the title or author's name. Wanting to re-read it, I would sometimes ask fans of science fiction if they knew the book but, based on my description at least, nobody could help. More recently I began posting about the book on science fiction fan websites and the discussion boards on Amazon.com itself. Eventually, not being certain it was the right book, I got my hands on Spaceling. Bingo.It's such an unusual book. The narrative gaps, the weird lapses of time, the odd relationships between the characters. So often these would be the mark of a poorly written text. However, in this case it merely strengthens the tale -- the odd circumstances of the narrator and the world in which she lives dictate that if people behaved the same as they do in our world, and it were similarly described, it would have been less believable.The story in Spaceling is too complex to be well summarized here. Suffice it to say that it involves an amnesiac girl who has the ability to travel through dimensional portals. Others share this ability, though she is unusually good at it. She finds herself with allies and dangerous opponents, though she is never entirely clear why and she makes some bad decisions about whom to trust, This is set in a world that is probably an alternate U.S. of the 1970s (the date is never made clear). At some point in the past (shortly after WWII perhaps?) mutants in the population began to discern the portals and could travel through them, and even use them as manufacturing devices. A period of great wealth follows (never fully described), followed by chronic energy shortages (never explained) and perhaps social decay (certainly not complete decay, the precise situation is never made clear to the reader).The main character's adventures are gripping, the ending is unexpected and leaves many loose ends, but rather than being frustrating, these elevate the book to a more mature level than the MockingJays and Harry Potter books of the world in which every plot point is obsessively resolved."},{"Title":"Timber Construction Manual","review":"since i R kinda a technical guy this book was up my alley. even though this book is about timber construction it is a very and i mean technical book. it gives the load baring for different dimensions of wood. what to factor in at different temperatures, what angle to use for different factors. for the lay person this is not the book for you. but for the person who wants to build his timber frame house himself and is technically minded give it a read, you might learn something."},{"Title":"Timber Construction Manual","review":"This is definitely a most comprehensive guide for timber construction.

It is the sixth edition, compiled by the American Instititute of Timber Construction; the first having been published in 1966. In addition to sawn wood, it deals extensively with \\"glulam\\", glued laminated timber. Even a layperson will find some of the information fascinating when discovering, for instance, the superiority of glulam framing to metals in high heat/fire situations. But basically it is a highly technical manual, certainly not applicable for the back-to-the-lander, ha.

In this edition the authors have updated a few of the key areas concerning the application of new technology and software towards construction of laminated timber. The majority of the information has not changed since previous editions.The contents of this text are geared towards a few industries as well as students. Timber and beam construction firms are the most obvious beneficiaries. The text is also applicable towards home building and home design; commercial building design and engineering; and bridge construction engineering.The text covers the two common types of timber: sawed wood beams and laminate, glued wood (glulam). The text discusses grading of each type as well as support, stress levels, and maximum tension of particular sizes and grades of lumber and glulam. Engineers will find the beam and join load and tension capacity sections very informative and well written.

Her mother was a famous soprano who married a handsome English lord, but he was not Mirelle's father. No, Mirelle's father was the Hungarian portrait painter, Lajos Neagu, who had an affair with Mirelle's mother while he painted her. In order to save her marriage, Mirelle's mother was forced to send her to live with a friend in the US where Mirelle grew up. Mirelle knew that her background was unusual, but she didn't really think it was anything to be ashamed of, until she met Steve. Steve was wonderful when they first met, so handsome and playful with her, unlike all of the other men that she knew. After they married, Mirelle tried her hardest to become the perfect wife and mother for their three children. Her past did not come up often and it didn't seem to matter to anyone - until her father died and left her some art in his will, acknowledging her as his daughter. Steve's parents were humiliated and made Mirelle feel cheap and unwanted. In order to spare them any embarrassment, Mirelle never talked about her past and tried to give up her sculpting to see to Steve's needs.Steve was a salesman and traveled a lot in his work for the company. Mirelle tried to make new friends when they moved and that is how she first met Lucy, who tried to make Mirelle stand up for herself and her art and to be someone instead of just Steve's wife. But when Steve's job forced them to move again, Mirelle couldn't stand the heartbreak of leaving more friends behind so she isolated herself. When she heard of Lucy's death, it sparked a change within her and Mirelle started sculpting again, started living again. Then she met James Howell, the handsome pianist who lived nearby and an attraction developed between them. Mirelle was lonely and Steve was so judgmental these days, she needed someone who understood the urge to create and to display talent in an artistic way. But was Mirelle ready to make such big changes in her life? As Mirelle lives through the year after her friend's death, she risks everything to make her life more meaningful...As I expected from McCaffrey, this book is well written and the characters are quite engaging, especially Mirelle, who really blossomed in this book. I wish that we could have seem more of Lucy and I felt that Steve was a kind of shadow figure, but, for the most part, the secondary characters were fun to get to know. I didn't particularly enjoy the relationship between Mirelle & James, who became more than just friends at one point in the book. Mirelle is married and knows that Steve has cheated on her while he is away on sales trips, but she justifies her relationship with James by saying that she doesn't care about sex, it is just an act and means nothing. This really turned me off and I felt that the romance between Steve & Mirelle and Mirelle & James was shallow and neither man meant that much to Mirelle. I enjoyed watching Mirelle grow and her sculpting develop, but this book is basically a story about two love triangles, Mirelle's mother, her husband & the handsome painter and Mirelle, her husband & her handsome neighbor with history being repeated. I can understand why the book went out of print because it is a bit dated in its context and it is hard to justify a husband and wife both cheating on each other and thinking that it didn't matter."},{"Title":"The Year of the Lucy","review":"I've read this book multiple times - bought it when it was first published, and go back to it every few years. The characterizations are either not as strong as those in the Pern/Talents/Crystal Singer books, or the speculative fiction elements in those books overshadow the characters enough so that it's not as noticeable.I've always felt that this book was an interesting study of those times that many marriages go through where the partners are re-evaluating their growth as compared with the growth of the marriage. In this case, the story posits a more dramatic reconsideration than I think many go through, but the growth in the main character was done well. I liked that secondary characters had lives of their own outside their relationship with the main character, as well as the atypical careers that most of the characters held (tell me, how often do you see a concern accompianist or a sculptor in a book??).Dated, of course by now, but even a bit dated in the mid-80's when published. Attitudes and mores more typical of late 60's-early 70's, but we don't know how long it sat in a drawer before it was published.Satisfying at times, just don't expect dragons!"},{"Title":"The Year of the Lucy","review":"The heroine is a wonderful artist hiding her talent because of a difficult mother-in-law.

People in this time of age are more concerned with morals and values -sex before marriage is completely out of the question. Catherine Landry is portrayed to bring out the goodness in her family particularily in her corrupted husband, Jack. Her daughter, Gabriel however does not even listen to her mother's beliefs of Pierre who is merely using her youthful body for the sake of his own satisfaction. Gabriel does whatever she wishes, ends up pregnant, and just adds to her mother's misery. Her mother, however who is preaching such values is a hypocrite for she too became pregnant with Gabriel before her marriage to Jack. Gabriel and her mother both lack respect and this shows us that the Landry family are not in fact that concerned with morality and values in a time of age in which those attributes of life are most important."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I enjoyed the book very much.

The book was good, but does anyone else get the feeling that the person writing this book was not paying attention to details in 'Ruby' or vice versa? I mean in 'Tarnished' Gabriel (Gabrielle) is blonde, innocent, naieve and raped by Pierre Tate. But in ruby she is described as having red/auburn hair, being kind of a tease (taking advantage of her looks and the fact that boys like her), and had an affair with Pierre tate. And Gladys tate was described as fair and blonde in 'Tarnished' and totally afraid of sex, which didn't seem like it would go away soon. And then in Ruby she is described as 'dark' and has 2 kids after Paul. Argh!It just really bugs me that those details couldn't even be kept the same considering they are in the same series and I believe the same ghost writer. I never realized it the first time I read it because it was over 10 years ago, but man it really makes this ghost writer look bad.

This is absolutely the worst book in the Landry series. This book is even worse than the entire horrendous Melody series.Why do I hate this book so much?Well, it's absolutely, 100% unbelievable. The GW tries his best to write from the viewpoint of a teenage girl, but fails miserably. None of the characters in this book felt developed at all to me. They were all stereotypical and flat, and the plot was just the same plot we've seen since V.C.'s death replayed once again with different characters and a different setting.There was no flow to the story, the major plot points weren't built up to properly, or at all. All of the actions undertaken by the heroine were completely unbelievable. Again, I believe this is the fault of a writer unskilled at writing from the viewpoint of a young woman.The main problem with the story is the romance between Gabrielle (or Gabriel as she is referred to in this book) and Pierre. In what I can only assume is an effort to keep the book to an acceptable number of pages, the relationship develops much too quickly, with the two being pained to be apart instantly. What follows is just too flowery and awful to endure, really. Then, the relationship ends just as abruptly, and it all goes downhill from there.I honestly cannot think of even one redeeming quality about this book, and cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Tarnished Gold is an interesting book, but i think that the plot is not that great. Why would Gabriel give up her babies? The first time she gave up Paul, I understood. Frankly, I felt sorry for her. But the second time, Gabriel is just so dumb. Although she kept one of the twins, why would she agree to give up her baby for Daphne?? Why?? Because Daphne sweet talk her. I think that Gabrielle doesn't really love her babies. Once she met Pierre, she forgot about Paul(the baby she gave up!) I think that Gabrielle is just infatuated (not in love with Pierre). I can't believe some said that this book has impacted in their lives. Tis true that Gabrielles struggle to keep her life together is truely inspiring...but giving away your babies just because of reputation?? Gabrielle even said that she gave up Paul so he can have a good life. How can Paul have a good life? Octavious (his supposed-to-be-father is a rapist) and Gladys (eccentric supposed-to-be-mother) doesn't even care for him. Gabrielle knows this but still she doesn't care. Like she said...\\"This is the best for Paul.\\" Well, it isn't! The best for Paul is for you to take care of him!Sorry, I got so carried away to the story.

I think she was kind of dumb to keep falling in love with Pierre after she found out that he was married. If that was me, I would of got rid of him the first chance that i had but I guess that is not easy when your in love as much she was. When she gave up the first child that she had after she got raped by Octvious and then got pregant. I thought she would of had some sense in her mind to not give up the second baby. I think she was smart to keep the other twin when she was pregant the second time by Pierre, because now she can feel what the tate's feeled when she gave the first baby to them after she was raped by Octvious."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Pierre and gabrielle the prefect coupal if oly pierre wasnt married!

This was the very first VCA book I read and never had I been so touched. I have never met a character quite like like Gabrielle, so absorbed in nature and so unaffected by material possesions, boys, and other teenager wants. Her mother is one fantastic woman, and her father, well, a well dimensioned snake. All the characters were exceptionally complex, Gladys was one deranged woman, Octavious a confused sinner yet sinned against fool, Pierre an idealistic weakling. The plots were gripping and taught a very important lesson: innocence is precious but never be too trusting and project your own innocence onto others, expecting everyone to be just as good natured as you."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"According to the blurb on the book jacket, this fifth book in the Landry series is actually the prequel, and in fact, I'm reading it at the right time ie. before I read any of the others. This famous series has been made into movies, including \\"Flowers in the Attic\\". Gabriel Landry is the daughter of two Cajuns, living in the swamp land of a Louisiana bayou. Her mother Catherine is a \\"traiteur\\", a healer and a midwife and is much loved and respected by all. Her father Jack is a whiskey swilling, no-good dead beat who is always looking for an easy way to make money without working for it. Gabriel is completely at home in the swamps with her animals and plants and falls easy prey to a lecherous, wealthy neighbour who rapes her when he finds her alone in the swamp. When she discovers she is pregnant, her father makes a deal with the neighbour's wife to hide Gabriel in her house until the baby is born so that no one will know of Gabriel's disgrace and the neighbours may pass off the baby as their own. After the birth, Gabriel sees her baby son only a few times and from a distance. A year passes and this poor, naive(stupid?) girl once again falls victim to a rich man, but this time, very willingly, and the same process starts again, with Gabriel agreeing to give up her baby to the rich couple, to raise as their own. The baby, Ruby, is apparently the star of M/s Andrews first book, and, although this review reads like a gigantic soapie, I'll now simply HAVE to find this first book, Ruby!"},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"This is the 5th V.C. Andrews series that I've read & I need to start taking my own advice and read the 5th book in the series before I read the others. The 5th book is always the actual beginning of the series & I have no clue why it's like that. You already know everything that happens so I can never make myself finish the last book because there are other books that I'd rather be reading. I'm sure if I had read this book first I would've really enjoyed it but I just see no reason to read a book where you already no everything that happens. Overall though, this is my least favorite V.C. Andrews's series. It was just o.k. for me. Nothing special."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"You know right away what happens to Gabriel when you start reading 'Ruby', so reading this book is a bittersweet experience. It was nice to see a time where Jack and Catherine were happy together - at least some of the time. I can't help but wonder what would happen if Gisselle had inherited some kind of gift, since it seems to run in the Grandmere bloodline. Anyhoo, Gabriel comes off as a very likeable character. She's very sweet and loving - maybe a bit too sweet for some - but she was a character I was genuinely fond of so it's hard to take what happens to her at the hands of Octavarius Tate.I feel that Gladys was a bit overdone with the revelation of what had happened to her as a child, and she knew of Jack's reputation, so she should have made her offer directly to Gabriel, or Catherine should have been the one Gladys went to Still, this is a good book, and a rather bittersweet one. Definitely one of the ghostwriter's better books."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I have read every book by VCA herself and every VCA book that the GW has written. I am also the webmaster of a large VCA site called Midnight Whispers and feel that I am qualified enough to say that this book was the best in the series and one of the best books yet. You can really feel for Gabrielle as she goes through the trials and tribulations that occured in her short life. Her romance with Pierre is just like Romeo and Juliet - sweet and tragic. You can't help but picture the setting of New Orleans during the time of the book and you can almost feel as if you are there. The imagery is wonderful and complex and the book just flows. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"Virginia sait toujours trouver les mots pour nous transporter dans ces merveilleuses aventures.J'ai devorer ce livre.Je l'ai lut en 2 jours.Le pere de Gabrielle etait vraiment sans coeur,avavt de mourir Gabrielle aura connut l'amour avec son beau Pierre..."},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"I usually hate reading books, but when i started reading V.C. Andrew's book entitled, Tarnished Gold I couldn't stop reading. This book kept me wanting to continue to read to find out what happens next.A southern girl named Gabriel goes through many ordeals in this book. She faces many situations that causes her heart to break and teaches her lessons. At the beginning of the book, Gabriel is just a little girl playing outside in her yard. She finds a dying bird under a tree and wants her mother to heal the baby bird. Her mother could throw away her baby and her mother tells Gabriel with time she will understand. Gabriel later on understands when she gets raped by a rich man named Octavious Tate and gets pregnant. Gabriel decides to allow Octavious's wife Gladys to act pregnant and take the baby as her own. Gabriel had to live in the Tate mansion during her entire pregnancy, secluded from everything around her. She felt the baby would have a better life living with the Tate's rather than herself. For months a plague rested in Gabriel's heart causing her lots of pain. This gives meaning to the saying, \\"you don't know what you got till its gone.\\" Everything is gloomy until she meets a young man from New Orleans named Pierre Dumas. He gives her a new meaning of life and they fall in love with each other. Gabriel thing finds out Pierre is married, but is very much unhappy and not in love with his wife. She is torn on what she should do; follow her heart or mind. I don't want to give away what happens so go read the book.This book contains romance, deceit, and lust. It had me laughing one minute and crying the next. Everything was wonderful about this book except for the very last page. I was on the edge of my seat every moment of the way while reading this book, until the end when the breaks got slammed and threw my body back into the seat. It lessened my views about this book but not completely. Tarnished Gold is still a very exciting and wonderful book so don't let the ending stray you away from reading it. [I didn't like the ending], but everyone has different views on certain endings. So you never know if you are the kind who fancies the ending like the one in Tarnished Gold.I recommend this book to anyone wo loves novels that contain sex drive and romance. This book is also more for teenage women. Southern women could be drawn to this book because of the fact it is located in Louisianna Bayo. I would not recommend this book to people who like novels wit sci-fi or lots of action. I would also not recommend this book for any man becuase this book is extremely sexist against them. Please do not let any of these recommendations change your decisions on reading Tarnished Gold. If you think you would like to read this book then I say, \\"Go for it!\\""},{"Title":"Tarnished Gold: The Record Industry Revisited","review":"This final book in the wonderful Landry series goes back to before Ruby's time, to Gabriel Landry, her mother. I can't say that this was my favorite book in the series, but then, that's only because each seperate book has, in my mind, molded together to form one story, and I even find it difficult to distinguish them sometimes. Anyway, I just want to say that this series is absolutely addictive, and anyone and everyone can get attached to it in a split second. This is also one of the most well thought out and well writen endings I have ever read (which is not uncommon with V.C. Andrews' books), despite how sad and empty it made me feel afterward. But that's only because I get really involved in my books. Anyway, I reccommend this books to all the V.C. Andrews fans out there, and to anyone else who's looking 4 some inspiration and insight on life. And just by the way, I'm only 14, and I can't even begin to describe how deeply this book has impacted my life. That's how touching and beautiful it is...V.C.

It is so full of surprises that it is hard to put down even for a second."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"The Penguin production of Richard II is full length and well done. The other version(s) are abridged and not so good. I find it increases understanding and satisfaction of Shakespeare to listen to the tapes while reading."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare should have had some dialogues where the characters discussed crucial history before the play opens. Gloucester (murdered or dead before the play but mentioned several times) had tried to usurp Richard's crown too many times. History itself is not sure if Gloucester died or was murdered. Bolingbroke for a while conspired with Gloucester and now sees another oppurtunity to usurp the crown.The virtuous John of Gaunt served Richard with honor and integrity and eventually moved parliament into arresting Gloucester for treason. This would of made John of Gaunt's rages all the more valid. Otherwise this play is outstanding! Richard shows himself to be capable of ruling at times, but gains our contempt when he seizes his the honorable John of Gaunt's wealth. John of Gaunt's final rage in 2.1 is a passage of immense rageful beauty. Also, Shakespeare moves us into strongly suspecting that Richard had Gloucester murdered. However, despite Richard's crime, Shakespeare masterfully reverses our feelings and moves us into having deep pity for Richard when he is deposed. The Bishop of Carlisle (Richard's true friend) provides some powerful passages of his own. I can not overestimate the grace in which Shakespeare increases our new won pity for Richard when Bolingbroke (Gaunt's rightful heir) regains his wealth and the death of Gloucester is left ambiguous. 5.1, when Richard sadly leaves his queen and can see that Henry IV and his followers will eventually divide is a scene of sorrowful beauty. 5.4 is chilling when Exton plots Richard's murder. 5.5 is chilling and captivating when Richard dies but manages to take two of the thugs down with him. The icing on the cake is that Bolingbroke (Henry IV) can only regret his actions and realize that he has gotten himself into a troublesome situation. But that will be covered in &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;2 Henry IV.&quot; We can easily argue that it is in &quot;Richard II&quot; where we see Shakespeare's mastery of the language at its finest."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"This is a review of the Arden Second Series edition of King Richard II -- an edition edited by Peter Ure and now superseded by the Third Series, but still available on Amazon and lots of other places.(Why there are people on this site giving their opinions of the play itself is beyond me. Of course it is masterful.)I love Arden's editions of Shakespeare because the notes are excellent, the introductions thorough, and the quality of the books themselves -- that is, their sturdiness -- extremely high.But this one falls short. Ure is so fascinated by Shakespeare's sources and his various departures from those sources that the notes are essentially worthless for any other purpose. It is so rare that a note has anything to say other than a remark about the sources that after a while I stopped going to them. The introduction is the same way. I am sure that the question of the sources is very interesting, it just isn't interesting to me, and certainly not in the detail provided here. I would have liked to read about other features of the play too (they are there, just buried in endless discussion of how Shakespeare did or did not use Holingshed for some particular detail).Lastly, if this review is showing up on the page for the Penguin or Folger or Signet or any other of the fine editions of Shakespeare -- my apologies. Amazon does this, not me. I've posted this where it belongs, on the Arden 2d Series Richard II page!"},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"I'm not terribly fond of this publisher's edition. The first thing I noticed was that the book is bulky and cumbersome; it is far too thick for a book of its size, rendering one-handed reading highly difficult. The notes and supplemental material cover as thick a section as the text itself--which isn't inherently a bad thing--but it makes keeping the book open wide enough to read without cracking the spine almost impossible.In addition to the book's width being too short to comfortably hold, it also means numerous lines must carry over into the next line. While this is annoying, it would not be an issue, except the line numberings appear to be done automatically and so include these one- or two-word spillovers as a separate line. This means that when my professor references a certain line number from his edition, I have to hunt around to find the corresponding section. I feel that a work such as this, with distinctive, predetermined lines, should not undergo different numbering conventions.Finally, I believe the annotations are poorly done. I have read many different publishers' versions of Shakespeare, and I have to say this is one of the few times I've ever wished more information were provided. Often I feel books annotate more than necessary with commonly recognized definitions or explaining easily understood syntax. However, I have found myself repeatedly looking to the annotations for a definition to some archaic word or unclear usage only to be disappointed. Also, --and this is more just a pet peeve-- the annotated words do not have any sort of textual indication, such as a number or bubble. I used to think that was distracting and wished it gone; well, now I have an edition without it and it is even more inconvenient, as I have to check the annotations page to see whether a word even has an explanation. The annotations also often spill over onto the next page, causing the reader to have to flip back and forth.Overall, I feel the text and annotations of this edition were poorly organized, resulting in difficulty for the reader."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"This is a very poor quality audio which has been abridged to leave out some of the best parts of the play.

Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student. It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers. This was just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances would I have read this book. And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the book. I purchased the audio cassette from &quot;Amazon.com.\\" After completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words, I decided to get my hands on the book itself.

You will certainly need it to stay awake. I hope I was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's response."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"The thing with Shakespeare histories is that almost no one reads them, as opposed to his tragedies and comedies. I don't know why that is. The histories that are read are either Henry V (largely due to Branagh's movie), Richard III (because the hunchback king is so over-the-top evil), or the gargantuan trilogy of Henry VI, with the nearly saintly king (at least by Part III) who much prefers contemplating religion and ethics to ruling and dealing with the cabals among his nobles.So why read a relatively obscure history about a relatively obscure king? Aside from the obvious (it's Shakespeare, stupid), it is a wonderful piece of writing - intense, lyrical, and subtle. Richard II is morally ambiguous, initially an arrogant, callous figure who heeds no warnings against his behavior. Of course, his behavior, which includes seizing the property of nobles without regard for their heirs, leads to his downfall. Nothing in his character or behavior inspires his subjects so he has no passionate defenders when one of the wronged heirs leads a rebellion to depose Richard II. But Richard now becomes a much more sympathetic figure -especially in the scene where he confronts the usurper, Richard acknowledges his mistakes, but eloquently wonders what happens when the wronged subjects can depose the leader when they are wronged. What then of the monarchy, what then of England?On top of the profound political musings, you get some extraordinarily lyrical Shakespeare (and that is truly extraordinary). Most well known may be the description of England that was used in the airline commercial a few years back... &quot;This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, ...&quot;If you like Shakespeare and haven't read this play, you've missed a gem."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"Richard II was incompetent, wastefully extravagant, overtaxed his nobles and peasants, ignored his senior advisors, and lavished dukedoms on his favorites. His rival, Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV), was popular with the common man and undeservingly suffered banishment and loss of all his property. And yet two centuries later Elizabethans viewed the overthrow of Richard II as fundamentally wrong and ultimately responsible for 100 years of crisis and civil war. Queen Elizabeth's government even censored Shakespeare's play.Shakespeare masterfully manipulates our feelings and attitude toward Richard II and Bolingbroke. We initially watch Richard II try to reconcile differences between two apparently loyal subjects each challenging the other's loyalty to the king. He seemingly reluctantly approves a trial by combat. But a month later, only minutes before combat begins, he banishes both form England. We begin to question Richard's motivation.Richard's subsequent behavior, especially his illegal seizure of Bolingbroke's land and title, persuades us that his overthrow is justified. But as King Richard's position declines, a more kingly, more contemplative ruler emerges. He faces overthrow and eventual death with dignity and courage. Meanwhile we see Bolingbroke, now Henry IV, beset with unease, uncertainty, and eventually guilt for his action.Shakespeare also leaves us in in a state of uncertainty. What is the role of a subject? What are the limits of passive obedience? How do we reconcile the overthrow of an incompetent ruler with the divine right of kings? Will Henry IV, his children, or England itself suffer retribution?Richard II has elements of a tragedy, but is fundamentally a historical play. I was late coming to Shakespeare's English histories and despite my familiarity with many of his works I found myself somewhat disoriented. I did not appreciate the complex relationships between the aristocratic families, nor what had happened before. Fortunately I was rescued by Peter Saccio, the author of &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;. Saccio's delightful book explores how Shakespeare's imagination and actual history are intertwined.I hope you enjoy Richard II as much as I have. It is the gateway to Henry IV (Parts 1 and 2) and Henry V, all exceptional plays."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"This is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, but in the Kindle edition the footnotes are not activated.

I have bought many products from Amazon with no problems."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"While many of Shakespeare's works play on English pride, we can say patriotism sets two of his plays apart from the others. Obviously there's Henry V with its depiction of the king who delivered England's greatest military victory and that's a winner-take-all heroic epic. The other play is this one, Richard II.Both plays belong to the same cycle of four histories that also includes Henry IV parts 1 and 2. In Richard II, Shakespeare launches the cycle with a tragedy.The play starts with Richard presiding over a trial by combat. Henry Bolingbroke (who later becomes King Henry IV) and Thomas Mowbray each accuses the other of treason and are going to fight it out. In a trial by combat, God himself decides the issue by lending strength to the righteous. Whoever wins, though, will put Richard in a delicate position, so he stops the combat and exiles both men; Bolingbroke to a few years of banishment but Mowbray forever.This is wrong. King though he may be, Richard is not God and by stopping the duel, he usurps divine providence.Why? Bolingbroke's father and Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, is a rich man and Richard needs money. In exiling the son from his old and frail father, he hastens the man's end. This gives Richard the opportunity to seize Bolingbroke's inheritance. Bolingbroke returns to reclaim his birthright and wars upon Richard, using as a pretext that his courtiers have given him evil counsel. Bolingbroke wins, seizes the crown and becomes Henry IV. Richard is deposed, imprisoned, and dies.Shakespeare offers two remarkable soliloquies by dying characters. As he dies, John of Gaunt extols the virtues of England.\\"This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle,This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,This other Eden, demi-paradiseThis fortress built by nature for herselfAgainst infection and the hand of war.This happy breed of men, this little world.This precious stone set in the silver sea...\\"Patriotic stuff! The whole play is about how a king for reasons of personal ambition, through negligence and incompetence, betrayed his duty towards his holy realm. By the end of the play, we witness Richard reaching this conclusion. But thinking it through pains him.\\"I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,My soul the father; and these two begetA generation of still-breeding thoughts...\\"Where John of Gaunt dies full of worries over England's fate yet still conscious of her glory, Richard dies in despair. He is at a loss as to what he could have done to avoid his predicament, yet he is conscious the error belongs to him.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"The product came within a couple days of ordering it, which was amazing because I needed it for school.

It was from a library, so it had the plastic still on it, which preserved the book itself."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"\\"Richard II\\" is a lyrical treat for the reader, and one marvels at the creation of a character as complex as Richard. King Richard is a hopelessly deluded and inept monarch who believes supremely in the divine ordination of kings. He leans on this belief to the exclusion of all of the other king's responsibilities. He makes one poor decision after another, and never reflects on the choice or its consequences before he makes them. However, we still feel a tug at the heart when this monarch is murdered, and this is attributable only to his glorious poetry. Richard speaks in some of Shakespeare's finest verse, and he has the mind for metaphor. I would recommend reading Shakespeare's History plays in order of the king's reign, and one comes to appreciate the complexities and strength of Shakespeare's storytelling.There really are no exceptional characters in this play other than Richard. His antagonist Henry Bolingbroke is a cold hearted dud (and master politician) who plays to the common man and ruthlessly kills those who oppose him. All the while, telling us, and himself, that all his actions are justified and are the results of other's choices. Really he is no different from Richard, except he lacks the King's sense of poetry and theater. There are also some good speeches from secondary characters in this text, especially John of Gaunt. Shakespeare's genius is too large to be contained to only the main characters.\\"Richard II\\" is worthy of a read, if only for the extraordinary experience of feeling revulsion AND pity for the title character."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard the Second","review":"Shakespeare's age was the high renaissance in England. Most of the plays were performed at the Globe. The date of the writing and the first performance of RICHARD II is 1592. Richard has two roles. They are God's deputy and Adam's heir.A Machiavellian conflict between the king and his usurper is set forth in the play. Richard exiles Mowbray and Bolingbroke. John of Gaunt is sick and England is sick. England is subject to misrule by Richard, Gaunt asserts.Following the death of John of Gaunt, traitors, so-called, appear. Many of the nobles in the kingdom go over to the side of Bolingbroke, (Gaunt's son, also known as Henry IV).It is Act III and Richard lands in Wales. His rule still shows outward splendor. When he learns of Bolingbroke's advance, he loses his air of authority. Richard learns that his uncle, the Duke of York, has joined with Bolingbroke's forces.Bolingbroke seeks to have his banishment reversed and his lands restored.

Mr. Mannix's collection of pictures alone is likely worth the price of the book for many - I was, however, seeking something a little more researched and scholarly (not boring, just well put together and intelligent).Mr. Mannix establishes himself in the first four or five pages an unapologetic reporter of inaccuracies (e.g. when he uses Helen Keller as an example of a 'freak', stating that she was born a blind, deaf mute... She was, in fact, born normal, and suffered these impairments as a result of a nearly lethal fever in infancy), and the publisher seems to have only given the text the most cursory of proofreadings (one 'freak', a midget, is referred to as having been the State Treasurer of &quot;taxes&quot; (he was the State Treasurer of TEXAS).Am I picking nits? Absolutely. However, when I purchase a book I tend to expect something with a little more polish and depth than a high school research paper.

Mannix is clearly fueled by anger that political correctness has deprived these people of their means of earning a living and forced them into institutions. It is a way of thinking that I had not encountered before this book. He covers giants, midgets, people with parasitic twins, hermaphrodites, fat people, wild people and many others-- telling stories and anecdotes of his time on the road.

Mannix clearly holds a bias in favour of freak shows and this can be interesting to consider in a time when we are overwhelmed by political correctness.Some of the photos in the book are startling and disturbing, but the text is very accessible and easy to read, not unlike a journal. The book is a good choice for those wanting an introduction into the world of Freaks, or just a little trivia about some of the actors from the Wizard of Oz.The nature of the material can be sad at times but Mannix maintains a very optimistic tone. His style is very casual and conversational.I recommend taking a look at this book for the historical content, personal experience and general curiousity. This may be one of the few times in your life you will be allowed to gawk unabashedly at that which you have been trained to turn away from. Step Right Up, Ladies and Gentlemen!"},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"Originally released in 1976, 'Freaks: We Who Are Not As Others' is a bit dated in that many of the people mentioned have since passed on. When first released, the book was quickly pulled for reasons I can only guess at, foremost it probably being too graphic for the times. Its large size and many pictures more than make up for its slimness (only 120 pages).Author Daniel Mannix gives us and inside and personal look at the old-fashioned \\"Ten-In-One\\" show: the Freak Show. Mannix worked in the carnival business and personally knew many of the people he speaks about, such as Pricilla The Monkey Girl and Emmett The Alligator Man (who were happily married). Before \\"political correctness\\" and phrases like \\"Differently Abled\\" came along, the Ten-In-One was often a haven and a home for those born with birth defects.Midgets, dwarves, giants, obese folk, \\"the human skeleton\\", bearded women, co-joined twins, those born without arms or legs, pinheads, hermaphrodites, skin conditions, the double-jointed, and deformities - all were welcomed at the Ten-In-One and many made a great deal of money at it. This isn't a book making fun of these oddities, its book that celebrates their differences, their lives, and their ability to love.Mannix's prose is informative and conversational, the stories are true (though he admits a few have questionable roots), and the many pictures are captivating, graphic, and ... well, freakish. I found the book so absorbing that I read it through in one sitting. There's a lot of history addressed, from the court jesters of historic kings to an intimate look at the most famous Siamese twins Chang and Eng, to the reasons why its an insult to call a dwarf a midget or a midget a dwarf. Mannix keeps the book thoughtful and respectful while giving insight into the origin and history of the Freak Show.Whether curious or simply researching, this is one of the best books ever written about the old-fashioned sideshows. If your interested in the subject, then don't miss out on this informative and graphic story of a group of amazing people living in the amazing world of the carnival. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"This book contains some great photos of freaks but the writing is definitely not what I expected. It is mostly accounts of freaks who served in courts as jesters and other jobs. Yet, all the photos are of sideshow freaks from the late 1800's and early 1900's. I had assumed that the writing would be about the performers shown but most were not even mentioned. All in all, I did not like the way that the book was put together and wish I had not spent the money on it. For some though, the photos are worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"We who are not as others: A book about &quot;freaks&quot; written by a freak, is obviously a labor of love by the author. Daniel P. Mannix presents a well-researched study of the physically challenged, not only in our time, but throughout history. He presents human oddities, not as something to gawk at and scare little children, but as warm, loving and feeling people with dreams and aspirations the same as everyone. He presents his own kind with hopes that the reader will understand: these people are not as others, yet very much the same. Modern day &quot;freak shows&quot; are mostly made up of people who want to be freaks and make a buck, but the people in this book are the real thing and had no choice. Read this book with an open mind and an open heart. It can change your outlook on life."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"What a bizarre and delightful book! Mannix's bok on Freaks has numerous photographs of the strange, the deformed, the odd and the grotesque. This is the place to find photographs of pinheads, cyclopses, and much more. Well known freaks (Prince Randian the Human Torso, Joe-Joe the Dog Faced Boy) share the pages with more obscure ones.Mannix deserves great credit for not allowing this book to become *just* a picture book of weird people, although it could certainly be used as that. There is plenty of text to tell these people's stories, to put a personal touch to their photos. He shows us how they lived, not just how they looked. An excellent coffee-table book."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"This book was given to me as a gift a few years back and has become one of my prized possesions. Everyone that comes to the house asks to see it. In addition to the wonderful photographs, thoughtful attention has been paid to describing the lives of the people discussed, along an interesting personal and historical perspective one doesn't often find in the more recent tomes concerned with &quot;political correctness.&quot; This book's only failing is that there isn't more of it."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"i read this book in one day. it was that much of a page-turner. mannix introduces his reader to freaks of every nature. this book is more of a personal account of their lives, rather than a historical or scientific one (although it touches gently on those aspects). mannix lets his reader look into the lives of percilla the \\"monkey woman\\", myrtle corbin the \\"4-legged woman\\", emmett the \\"alligator man\\", \\"happy jack eckert\\", and countless others. this book is a must-read!"},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"My sister, ever since I lent her \\"Geek Love,\\" is really into books set in carnivals, circuses, or with sideshow characters. This book, my first foray into nonfiction, was definitely something different.I was surprised to see upon shipping that it is actually more like a textbook than a paperback novel. It is larger in order to show more details in the photos, and like other reviewers mentioned, some of the photos are extremely graphic. This book is not appropriate for children. Also, the narrative is somewhat lacking. The writing is fine, especially because it humanizes sideshow folk, but the photos often don't match up to what is being said on that page, and sometimes photos don't have back story within the text.That said, my sister loved it. She liked getting the real story about these real people, and how they interacted with others and amongst themselves. It was a great birthday present, and I'm glad I chose it for her!"},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"This is a very good book for the lover of oddities out there. I especially love the photos and the stories of these people. Very god book!! I recomend anyone interested in oddities to pick thsi gem up. There are many wonderful pictures. I am a huge fan of Jo-Jo The dog Faced boy."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"This book is the end all best collection of sideshow anomalies that includes both people with congenital deformities and just those with special talents. The book provides graphic pictures, detailed explanation of defects (and talents) and personal stories about famed \\"freaks\\" that are blessed (or suffer) from their uniqueness. There are more pictures then anything else and it can be quite vivid for certain ages. The book includes midgets, giants, conjoined twins, parasitic twins, bearded women, dog faced boys, rare skin condition, lobster limbs, missing limbs, fossilized bodies, those with half bodies, hermaphrodites, and many other curiosities.The book is very easy to follow, the infomation is thorough, and it contains rare photography that I have not seen in any other book or website (such as freque.com). I am not going to be crude, but I respect people's differences and like to see what the lure was of these people in their heyday, so this book was incredibly engrossing. This definately may not be for everyone, but it is a great book on a unique subject."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"Gave this as a gift to a couple of buddies and they seem to really enjoy it. Lot of laughs. I would recommend to anyone into freaks and/or freak shows."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"This is a fascinating little book. There are lots of pictures. An intimate look at those &#34;who are not as others.&#34; I love to show this book to my friends and just watch their jaws drop again and again as they page through it. The pictures are accompanied by interesting stories and tidbits of information. A lot is mentioned about the carnivals, freak culture, freakshows, etc. This is a Re/Search book, known for pushing the &#34;ultra-alternative.&#34; Daniel P. Mannix is also the author of two other books I highly recommended, The Hell-fire Club and For Those About To Die. I was quite pleased by it, and since I am endlessly amused by how much it seems to freak people out, its a coffee table display book in my house."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"Really dug it. Heard about it from a Tom Waits interview on his \\"Alice\\" album. It's like a documentary/autobiography on the life of circus people. Amazing."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"Human physical oddities have always fascinated fans of the circus, the movies, and anthropology. This book is in a way inspirational, because it addresses the question of \\"who is truly disabled, and who is not?\\" The approach is clinical, and does not pander to sensationalism."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. It tells you about all types of people that lived the carnival life."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"The obvious and initial impression of Mannix's book is that it contains 120 pages of large print text alongside pictures of popular and historic carnival freaks. This is a book whose initial publication harks from the mid seventies, so one may assume that much of the information provided, such as the prevalence of side shows and the handling of \\"freaks,\\" is outdated twenty-seven years in the future. What is both relevant and helpful within the bounds of this text is the historicity of the given events and personas portrayed. There is some question as to the veracity of the statements made in that some of what Mannix writes in context does not seem to be very formal or serious. We may desire to look over this fact in that much of what Mannix writes in Freaks seems to be of great personal value and experience though it may not alleviate the strain. Daniel Mannix handles his subject matter comfortably. The pictures are often helpful, though sometimes graphic. The greatest complaint that I hold in regard to the pictures is that they seem to be somewhat disorganized in relation to the text; it is often helpful to place photographs of your subject matter with the text of your subject matter as opposed to the apparent alternative. Another point to make in the overall organization of the book is that it is sometimes redundant as Mannix tends to repeat information in latter chapters that he had already provided in former ones.Freaks grants us a view of freakdom from the end those who are labeled as freaks due (generally) to a condition retained from a birth and existence that does not conform to the norms of our idea of normal. Some of those highlighted within the text are monstrously obese, others have three legs, a few even have two heads (or faces, such as Edward Mordake ), and still, Mannix tries to reveal these to live in some sort of paradox wherein they are the same while remaining unequivocally different than all of the world. One of the biggest points that Mannix tries to get across is that this difference has been, for centuries past, the livelihood for many of these freaks. From the times wherein they were found to be bound to kings and courts to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as depicted in circus sideshows and carnivals, \\"freaks\\" have made fortunes by taking advantage of their mutated traits. The delineation may have been unknown, and yet their popularity as well unmatched by what other forms of \\"entertainment\\" existed during their time. The information provided, though seemingly first hand or closely networked, does not seem to be well researched or annotated. On the basis of this, we may not necessarily retain that Mannix's text is necessarily reliable nor may we ascertain that many of his stories of freaks past are essentially true (he even said that some of the stories were questionable). As a very general and entertaining work, this book may suffice. As an informative source, it does provide more information on freaks than I have personally read anywhere else (though I have never read any other works on freaks). This book has worked well to help whet my mind in the area of freaks, though I still think it a bit sketchy in the area of reliability."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"The pictures are extremely graphic. Very interesting book though, but felt guilt for getting entertainment from their oddities."},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"this book is an ok read. not enough pictures of the characters he refers to. pictures are of random freaks. x-rated if you are thinking of this for a child. makes you wonder if you dare to have children!"},{"Title":"Freaks","review":"I absolutely HATE it when authors release books without doing their homework. If i'm going to read a book based on fact I don't want any inaccuracies. This author should be ashamed of himself and if I had it my way he would be banned from writing any further books. There is no excuse for this. ABSOLUTELY NONE. You know I really should go into writing books that authors put out that corrects their factual errors maybe then there would be some sort of penalty in exposing them for their incompetence."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Ice Creepers (Rowan of Rin)","review":"Not filled with quite as much excitement as I hoped - but sufficient! Winters in Rin have been growing steadily colder and longer, and now it is too cold too bear. Rin moves down to the coast, leaving a few behind. Rowan begins another quest, this time to banish the evil Ice Creepers and warm the land once more. He and two others follow the Bukshah through the mountain, discovering evil things. Finally they discover the secret of the Mountain - and another one as well, one concerning the ancestry of the people of Rin."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Ice Creepers (Rowan of Rin)","review":"I will need to return this copy because the cover is torn or cracked away from the pages.I believe these books are poorly made from the start. The copy I owned before I saw thiscopy has the same damage."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Ice Creepers (Rowan of Rin)","review":"This book is alright, but a drastic change from the previous four. I personally, enjoyed the previous ones much more. It is very gripping and heart-stopping, fantasy-esque and unnatural. It is well-written, but it's jerks and twists are very, very dramatic."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Ice Creepers (Rowan of Rin)","review":"Rowan and the ice creepers is filled with magical mystery and fantastic fantasy. In this admiring adventure Rowan and his freinds follow a prophecy. the prophecy is the only clue to stop the ice creepers from destroying the the city of rin. this book was okay in my oppinion. I would recommend this book for fictional friends."},{"Title":"Rowan and the Ice Creepers (Rowan of Rin)","review":"The auther put thought into the characters and the Ice Creepers. Most of this book is placed in the mountains near the city of Rin. The characters were well written u really got a feel for the characters. Rowan of the Bukshaw its definitely well put in this story his journey you really get the feeling that you are in the story feeling his pain. Feel his love for his friends and the hate for the Ice Creepers.personally this book was great and its the best book that i've read in a while. this book i could read it over and over and still be interested."},{"Title":"A View from the Inland Northwest: Everyday Life in America","review":"In 1995 my Dad, Ben Benthien, allowed Stephen Lyons a glimpse into his world. Today (May 2008) I gave him this book for his 66th Birthday. Prior to today he had read a short magazine article about his time with Stephen. Through laughter & sadness induced tears he read the essay about himself. It was a joy to watch him bluster over the author's embellishments. He was pleased with the number of pages dedicated to him and his story. Mom and I watched him carefully as he read the \\"hard parts.\\" Enough time has passed to ease some of his pain. He was ready to revisit those painful memories. Through this book I got to know my Dad a little bit better, embellishments and all."},{"Title":"A View from the Inland Northwest: Everyday Life in America","review":"I bought, read and reviewed Stephen's previous book a few years ago, and now I'm happy to do it again with his newest book. As before Stephen's writing is excellent. No matter the topic he writes with insight and clarity; he's also bitingly funny when he needs to be. Like me Stephen is a fan of the late, great Edward Abbey, and Ed's skill as a writer has rubbed off on at least one of us. I hope Stephen writes some more books. I hope he's doing okay Back East. I'm still Out West, but I'll buy Stephen's books no matter where he writes them. Chicago's a great place; two of my favorite musicians came from there - Terry Kath and Joe Farrell - though both ended up dying in Los Angeles. And the great writer Charles Bowden is from there, though he remains Out West. And you've got the Cubs and Wrigley Field. So, Stephen, please write some more books! Meanwhile I am enjoying this one, savoring each essay, each story of an America I can relate to."},{"Title":"A View from the Inland Northwest: Everyday Life in America","review":"The Inland Northwest might best be described climatologically and geographically as the rain shadow of the Cascades.Lyons presents a series of miniatures, crafted essays about the people who live here and their interactions with this land.He punctures some Western myths without being a deliberate cynic, and gives his own take on the Inland Northwest's version of the decline of extractive industries and explosion of population, often for second homes, along with environmentalist conflicts with both these groups.But this is ultimately a more-intimate level social history of the area, and here Lyons is at his best."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"I have read Date's two previous books &quot;Final Orbit&quot; and &quot;Speed Week&quot; with each being better than the previous. After reading Smokeout, I can only wait for his next novel to arrive.Smokeout is a high paced book that picks up more and more momentum as the story continues. The nonstop action made it hard to find a point to put down the book. Date's development of his characters and situations is such that I felt like I was in the Florida capital at the scene of the crimes.I would not have believed that the story line in Smokeout was based on fact if I hadn't heard NPR's Fresh Air 11/9/00 interview with Date. If you have 15 minutes and the patience for NPR to launch the file, it really is worth listening to.I highly recommend Smokeout as a read for the New Year."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"Once again, S.V. Date, with brilliant wit and flawless style, captures the essence of those who make up Florida's political and social scene. As he did in &quot;Final Orbit&quot; and &quot;Speed Week,&quot; here too he creates characters that are more like caricutures of those who impact Florida politics. This is all done with his usual stylistic brilliance and entertaining plot twists."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"Featuring abjectly corrupt politicians, a loco hit man and a corporate CEO practicing business the way Attila intended, &quot;Smokeout&quot; is furious fun, especially for those who've had the, ahem, pleasure of seeing the Florida Legislature up close. It mostly reads like a true-crime book because much of what's in the plot is akin to what happens everyday in Tallahassee.The only time the fast-paced, inventive yarn strains credibility is when it finds a few laudable types trying to do the right thing amid the population of bumbling bottom feaders. Readers will be rewarded with enough laughs to not care."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"S. V. Date's funny madcap farce about the sleazy Florida legislature is a sure fire hit. Very funny from start to finish. A quick read; once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. The Florida newspapers who have given it positive notice are all standing up for a colleague. Beware! This is no Hiaasen! It is impenetrable, obvious and not at all funny...I bet the other reviews by &quot;readers&quot; here are publicity people."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"A key vote coming up soon for the Florida legislature will determine whether individuals can sue big tobacco companies. The Sunshine State power brokers from lobbyists to concerned citizens to CEOs merge in Tallahassee to twist the arms of the politicians.Especially concerned about the state bill is Bartholomew Simons, CEO of tobacco giant Roper-Joyner Holdings (RJH). He wants the bill killed and tosses money around to ensure it happens. Bartholomew also is panicking because an infamous memo with his signature that makes RJH and the industry look like serial killers is loose and if the opposition gain possession of it his career is dead. With sexy lobbyists offering their wares for support, Tallahassee looks like a den of iniquity where morals mean nothing instead of a college town capital. On top of this mess, the media seeks scandals even if they have to serve as catalysts causing a headline or two.SMOKEOUT is a wild, almost out of control satire on the incestuous triangular relationship between big business, the media, and holier than thou politicians. The story line is amusing and never drops under a hundred miles an hour on the accelerator even with the interstate gridlocked as much as the legislature. No one including the nearly extinct honest citizen escapes S.V. Date's ironic look at Florida politics.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"This book is excruciatingly bad: forced, predictable, obvious, and riddled with cliches, most of them about Florida.

And yes, I am over the age of 13; is the author?"},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"This book with its wild antics of the Florida legislature is especially appropriate now since the entire country has watched Florida politics at work in the presidential election. It's a quick, fun read, and gets more and more outrageous as you go along."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"Not since Buckley's Thank You For Smoking have I heard myself guffawing out loud so many times. You won't need any urging after the first chapter. But, best of all, there's a message here. Perhaps money doesn't rule so completely in our Democracy as the author pictures it in these pages. At least, I hope it doesn't"},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"Many commentators have often pointed out that the difference between fact and fiction, is that fictional stories have to eventually make sense. Unfortunately, this book falls short in that category.Yes there are some funny scenes and funny dialogue, but the story about sinister politicians and tobacco executives just falls apart at the end.Date has been compared to other political authors who can be humorous (Carl Hiassan) but it's a poor comparison. Hiassan is funny because he can slip in the unexpected. Every once in awhile one of his characters acts out of type. Not so in this book, every tobacco executive is evil and every politician has a nefarious hidden agenda.I am sympathetic to the anti-tobacco cause, but Date is so ham-fisted about the issue in this book. Let's face it, people live their lives in various shades of gray and not black and white. Some of our heroes have bad habits and secret lives and some of our villans can have a soft positive side. The problem with this book and everything else I've read of Mr. Date is that you can tell who the good guys and the bad guys are only sentences after being introduced to them."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"Date's certainly got the amorality of Tallahassee politics captured here, but frankly his big-government-should-control-every-aspect-of-your-behavior politics is what ruins this book. Hiaasen's novels make it clear that BOTH sides, all sides of politics are immoral. Date's attempt to hijack the Hiaasen style for a narrow political purpose make this novel not art, but propaganda. Moreover, I didn't even laugh once. If you or I had written this, instead of a well-connected reporter, it would never have been printed--and shouldn't have been."},{"Title":"Smokeout","review":"Good story idea, but poor delivery. The author's obviously forced attempts to be outrageous are so transparent this late in the game that Haiassen created that there's little humor in it. Those around the Tallahassee scene will have 5 minutes of fun identifying the characters which Date has thinly veiled and has hyperbolized to the point of seeming personal attack. After that, the fun's over.The author should keep his day job and stick with the fiction he passes off as serious journalism."},{"Title":"The Faded Sun: Shon'jir","review":"Surviving a graceful extinction, the two remaining Mri are kept alive in the labs of human scientists and protected from Regul - for now.The Regul have destroyed all that remains of the Mri base on Kesrith, and look to exterminate them completely.With a great weight of guilt for betraying what he knows Melein & Niun's wishes must be, Duncan is sent with the Mri and two Dusei to pilot their return to the origin of all Mri life: their ancient homeworld.Dangerously quartered with them, Duncan must come to some uneasy arrangement, and it seems that nothing will do but that he renounces his humanity and becomes absorbed by the Kel.Trailed by human warships bent on discovering the extent of the Mri threat, and by Regul ship also, it is a race against time to arrive, forewarn, and prepare.As the trail of dead planets begin to streak past, all begin to fear for what will remain in the cradle of Mri civilization: Kutath.kotori ojadis@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"The Faded Sun: Shon'jir","review":"Again, as with _Kesrith,_ this is not a separate work, but merely the middle third of a very long novel about the postwar relationships between three very different species: the regul, non-warlike, physically unable to lie, who for two thousand years have hired the much more humanoid mri to fight their wars for them, and who have greatly benefitted thereby; the mri, psychologically as alien from humans as the regul, though they don't look it, and who will always do everything their own way, even if it means personal death and the end of their species; and humans, who seem not to have changed much after centuries in space. At the end of the first volume, the two surviving mri had been taken into the care (and control) of the humans, newly in control of Kesrith. Now, for reasons of his own, the governor has turned them loose in a ship with a navigational tape taken from one of their holy objects, which humans believe may lead them to unknown mri bases, but which the mri know will take them home -- back to the planet of their origins, which they had left apparently 100,000 years or so before. Accompanying them is Sten Duncan, a behind-the-lines tactical specialist who has become sympathetic to the mri. More than that, he finds that on this voyage he will not merely have to \\"go native,\\" he will have to become as much a mri warrior as it is possible to become. And in that he eventually finds his true self. Cherryh continues to show the reader what each of the three species looks like in the eyes of the other two, which makes this trilogy a near-masterpiece of psycho-sociological inventiveness and understanding. Be sure to have the third volume close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Faded Sun: Shon'jir","review":"Shon'jir, the 2nd book in the &quot;Faded Sun&quot; trilogy, is much better than Kesrith (the 1st book). It's not a matter of writing styles or ability (which are the same in both books: very good). It's just that in Shon'jir something actually happens. It even ends at a reasonable point (for the 2nd book in a trilogy). In the 1st book, Cherryh basically introduces the mri and the main characters In this book, she brings us through Duncan's journey (in all senses) towards the mri. A very good, very interesting book."},{"Title":"Wounds Not Healed by Time: The Power of Repentance and Forgiveness","review":"Jewish readers will probably be tempted to read this book because the author explores forgiveness through a Hebrew lens: from the perspectives of the Bible, the Talmud, and modern psychotherapy. At times the author contrasts the Jewish view of forgiveness and repentance with Christian and Islamic models. Perhaps the best part of the book is the discussion of \\"steps\\" that can be taken by individuals who struggle to forgive those who have offended them. Indeed, if I find myself becoming hostile to another due to his/her wrongful conduct, I go back to this book to learn the techniques to soften my anger. As put by the author: \\"Mature forgiveness entails difficult emotional and intellectual work. It is a skill that needs to be cultivated, a virtue that needs to be acquired by self-training. When practiced thoughtlessly or simplistically, it is ineffective and counterproductive and can even be dangerous to oneself, to the person forgiven, and to society.\\" Mr. Schimmel does not discuss his themes in \\"folksy\\" language. The author explores his topics intellectually, citing Maimonides, Freud, the Babylonian Talmud, Martin Buber, John Paul II, and Shakespeare. Very interesting...almost a classic."},{"Title":"Wounds Not Healed by Time: The Power of Repentance and Forgiveness","review":"Dr. Schimmel offers an interesting look at the problems of forgiveness and repentance. He is not content with easy answers or platitudes; instead, he probes hard to try to find reasonable and satisfying answers to difficult questions about how, why, and when repentance can be completed and forgiveness extended. This is definitely not a \\"feel-good\\" book offering a quick, easy way out of our feelings of guilt and remorse, but it offers much food for thought to those who hunger for a greater understanding of the human situation."},{"Title":"Pure & Simple: An Incircle Cookbook","review":"Although I have almost 2,000 cookbooks, this remains one of my all-time favorites, to which I turn again and again.

I have tried many of the recipes, and have been unfailingly thrilled with the results.Best of all, most of the contributors wrote brief descriptions of what makes their recipes so special and popular -- so the book is as much fun to read as to cook from, and virtually guarantees stellar results.Although I own well over a thousand cookbooks, this remains my number one favorite.

Sinai with the Ten Commandments in hand. Yet, there is much more to the character, and Ms. Hunt uses the women of his life to show modern readers that.His sister Miryam sees Moses' (Moshe) life begin. Though under orders from their Egyptian overlords to kill all newborn males, her mother tries to hide her child, until it is absalutely neccessary to place him an in ark like Noah's, and put him in the Nile. There he is found by Pharoh's daughter - wife, Merytam, the child of Ramses most loved wife, Neferrtitti, and Pharoh's most recent wife. She is barren, and seeks an answer from her gods to hide the condition that would exile her to the harems for the rest of her life. Finding the baby solves her problem, though keeping him alive in the face of coniving, jealous court advisors will not be easy. Perhaps it is only her desperate prayer to the unknown God of the Hebrews that saves her \\"son's\\" life.Moses grows to adulthood, never dreaming that he is one of the \\"mud people\\" that his people have enslaved. Learning the truth triggers an incident that sets off his rage and reveals his secret. Exiled and outcast, Moses flees to the lands far from Egypt, and makes a new life as a shepherd, until he is sent back to Egypt by God, with the mission of freeing his people.Moses is a man without a people, though. He is rejected by Egyptian and Hebrew alike, but he is determined in his quest, and through God's power, he is able to bring his people into the wilderness. As they travel towards the Promised Land, the way is hard, and the people rebellious. On the way, he suffers great loss and many trials. Through them all, his wife and sister watch and support him, despite their resentments and misgivings.**** If you have ever thought a historical novel would be boring, then read this one and change your mind. It is fascinating and true to the Biblical account, though more detailed and sheds light on things that may mystify readers of the Bible. Like the MISTS OF AVALON, the story is told by varied perspectives, but in this case, it is a true story, and one that will increase your faith."},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"Most of us know the story of Moses through movies like The Ten Commandments and Prince of Egypt. The Shadow Women gives you a new way to see the story: through the eyes of the women who loved him. From the Egyptian princess who adopted him, to the Canaanite woman he married, and his sister, Miryam, you'll see the story in a whole new way.Angela Elwell Hunt expertly weaves together Biblical fact and thorough research into a compelling tapestry. Nuggets of information mined through her research illuminate puzzling parts of the Biblical account and give the story freshness.You won't be disappointed whether you approach The Shadow Women as inspiration or entertainment. You'll find richly detailed settings, intriguing characters, and storytelling at its best. The Shadow Women is a book you can come back to again and again, gleaning fresh insight and inspiration each time."},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"Hebrew slave baby, prince of Egypt, wandering shepherd, Israelite leader, friend of God-Moses is certainly one of the most complex, intriguing characters in the Judeo-Christian faith. In this imaginative epic, his story is told by three extraordinary women who inhabited the shadows of his life. There are Merytamon, the Egyptian princess who rescues Moses from the bulrushes and her father's dreadful edict and perpetuates a lie that will haunt her life; Miryam, who's never quite able to relinquish her big-sister role; and Zipporah, Moses' Midianite wife, who struggles to understand the God Who has first claim on her husband's life. Together they give us a unique portrait of Moses as son, brother, husband, and man.Hunt's meticulous research and superb storytelling have created a masterpiece. This poignant story breathes life into the historical figure of Moses. It's also a vivid portrayal of a holy God Who is always just, but seldom safe.-Kristine Wilson"},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"Forget about Moses. His story has been told and retold. But the story of the enslavement and salvation of the Israelites from Egypt has never been told like this.&quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; is brought to mind by this book. We see the familiar tale told this time through the eyes of the women who lived this story. The story is told by the Princess of Egypt whose barrenness terrified her until she found salvation in a Hebrew child, by Miriam whose enforced role as the protector of her family leads her to bitter self revelation and by Zipphorah whose love of a strange refugee from Egypt place this desert girl center stage in a drama written by a God she does not understand.Marion Zimmer Bradley couldn't have done this saga better. Each woman's voice is distinctive and each character fully fleshed and developed. If you miss this book, you will miss a real gem."},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"This is a book based on the views of the key women in Moses' life. It is written very much as how a diary would be written, with each woman writing her thoughts, feelings, and perspectives on various circumstances.The 1st part of the book is focused on Moses' Egyptian mother, Merytamon. While another reviewer stated that this book was slow I found that only to be true during Merytamon's chapters. However, the author filled this portion of the book with many details of the Egyptians' medical procedures, customs, gods, and culture. It was very eye opening and educational. I had no idea that Pharaohs typically married their sisters and daughters in order to preserve the throne. They were very superstitious people, very pre-occupied with death. The author did extensive research on the ancient Egyptians and her resources are listed in the back of the book.Zipporah, Moses' wife, wrote her perspective of what living was like out in the dessert in a pagan culture. She seemed to be a very faithful woman towards her roles in life. Her meeting Moses, spending time with him, and ultimately marrying him was wonderful to read.Miryam, Moses' sister, was most interesting. She is portrayed as a strong-willed, prideful, and a somewhat controlling older sister. Her life was filled with resentment and bitterness towards her lot in life. She was self-righteousness and judgmental toward the women in the camp who were not Hebrews (i.e. Zipporah). It was very interesting how God broke her pride and led her toward humility, healing and reconciliation.Although this is a fictional book, the author did use scripture as her base. She has a Q&A; section in the back addressing questions.This isn't your typical historical fiction romance from Angela Hunt, but it is worth reading, especially since it helps to capture what it would have been like living in the times of Moses."},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"I am always eager to read a biblical story from a different point of view; to see the events unfold through the eyes of a participant that has never before been given a voice in the matter. In SHADOW WOMEN, you get to view the life of Moses through not one; not two; but three different witnesses: His Egyptian foster mother, Merytamon; his Midianite wife, Zapporah; and finally, his older sister, Miryam.Merytomon is the daughter and newest wife of Pharaoh. She is barren, believing that one of the multitudinous gods of Egypt has stolen her womb out of jealousy. She knows that unless she produces a son for Pharaoh, she will be demoted from her most-favored-wife position and banished to his harem to live out her life amidst the myriad of wives who have lost the attention of their husband. After learning of the Pharaohs decree that all Hebrew baby boys are to be sacrificed to the river god, she conspires to take one of these babies and present it to her husband as a gift from the god of the Nile.In addition to the retelling of Moses rescue from the Nile and his Egyptian rearing, we are made privy to the unique life of one so close to the throne. Merytomons love for Moses is touching and tragic as she suffers under the burden of her deception, knowing that the discovery of Moses true origin would very likely result in not only her death but the death of her beloved adopted son.After Moses secret is revealed and he flees into the wilderness, we meet Zapporah, his nomadic wife. Here the story takes on new depth as we learn more about the character and life of this remarkable woman.Finally, we are reintroduced to Miryam, Moses headstrong sister. We see her in a totally new light as the author puts flesh to the bare bones of information we are given in scripture.Even though the author takes great literary liberty in fleshing out the character and lives of these three women, there is nothing anti-scriptural in her exciting embellishments and therefore, I found them to be most enjoyable and their stories very plausible. I highly recommend you add this to your reading list!P.S. Be sure to read the quotation before the title page to understand where the author got the title THE SHADOW WOMEN from...very cool!"},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"If you like Biblical History this is the book for you.Fills in the spaces about the women in the life of Moses.

Now as I read through the actual passages, I find myself able to visualize events more clearly and with greater understanding. I'm able to connect with the stories more. The Shadow Women is a great piece of Biblical fiction and shouldn't be passed up"},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"THE SHADOW WOMEN is an interesting biographical fiction focusing on the life of Moses through the first hand accounts of the three women who most influenced his life by loving and caring for him. Readers obtain an insightful perspective of the Hebrew leader filtered through the lenses of his sister Miryam, his Egyptian mother Merytamon, and his Bedouin wife Zipporah as each tell their side of the story.Seven years old Miryam saves her infant brother's life and as an adult lives more like a male leader until her personal encounter with God. Merytamon, needing a baby to cement her position, finds the infant floating amidst the reeds and raises the child with love as if he came from her womb. Zipporah shows her courage when she marries her \\"teacher\\" whom in many ways seems her superior yet she proves that she is his loving partner.The background descriptions are quite powerful reminiscent of Anita DIAMANT'S THE RED TENT, but avoiding the sexual connotations of the latter novel as the targeted audience is quite obvious conservative Christian, especially with the controversial ending. Though inconsistent at times, Angela Elwell Hunt sculptures an engaging look at the man who never quite made it into Canaan that will please her chosen readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"Angela Elwell Hunt is one of my favorite Christian authors. Therefore, at the release of \\"The Shadow Women\\", I practically jumped into a chair to begin my reading.I was sorely disappointed.Hunt is brilliant with character development, and she develops the women of Moses' life- Merytamon (mother), Miriam (sister), and Zipporah (wife)- with her usual vigor. The obvious and expected spiritual themes in this book are outstanding, inspirational, and Hunt does deliver on these two qualities she always brings out in her stories.My problem is with the pace of the book- very, very slow. We all know this Biblical story so well that, in reading a book about the women in Moses' life, I expected to hear a twist on the tale, new angles, new stories.Well, I got some new angles for certain, but new stories? Hardly. Hunt retells the entire life of Moses as we know it using the women in his life as narrators. Though I learned several new facts about life in Egyptian palaces and a possible, very different alternate history to the love story of Moses & Zipporah (let's just say the Ten Commandments is its polar opposite), I was expecting more twist and insight into the lives of the \\"shadow women\\".*potential spoilers*I know that Hunt can in essence completely retell a biblical story through her series about Joseph, vizier of Egypt. But she did not make such an attempt here. Merytamon dies halfway through the book, leaving her perspective in the cold. Miriam is made out to be a cold-hearted, self centered, conniving old woman up until the last few chapters. The only parts I truly enjoyed reading were Zipporah's, and even hers were far too biblically repetitive.In short, these are not the women of Moses as we know them. In fact, this book is more about the life of Moses and his human interactions with women who were around them then about the lives and stories of his mother, sister, and wife and their consequent interactions with HIM.For all its spiritual insights, the book followed Moses too closely and left his women in the dust.JK"},{"Title":"The Shadow Women","review":"When I pick up a book claiming to be 'historical,' I expect the author to have done some serious research into the time period. I get the strong impression from this book that its author probably browsed for a few minutes through a couple of brief commentaries on the Old Testament and thought that was adequate. It wasn't. I think the problem for me was that I have read a lot about ancient Egypt and the Exodus, and I found glaring mistakes on practically every page of this book. Since this author has published a number of book, including some 'historical' ones, her regular readers probably will not be aware of the many errors in this book. Publishers, particularly Christian ones, tend to be very slack in screening books like this for historical accuracy. Aside from the inaccuracies and anachronisms, the book frankly doesn't tell a particularly lively story. There are some biblical novels that flesh out the Bible and make it come alive. In cases like this one, the reader would do herself a favor and stick with the source, namely the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"While I'm not going to be travelling anytime soon to a bird flu type area, you still hear so much about it in the news and everyone has a different opinion that you don't know what's true and what's not. I know that Dr Marc Siegel is meant to be highly regarded as a doctor and I thought that this would clear up the fact from fiction. I found good info in here. He doesn't think we should ignore what we hear in the news, but at the same time it might be a little over-hyped. Personal stock-piling of Tamiflu etc might be of no good at all when you don't need to be taking it. That's when people become resistant to these drugs and when you do need them, your immune won't accept them. He thinks more should be done to immunise the birds themselves. It is heavy reading - so much more to talk about than what my review will allow for, but it's really interesting - even if you (like me) won't need to worry about being in a bird-flu area. At least after reading this, you will have a much clearer idea about this disease and form your own opinions on your own health regarding this and even just with the regular flu. You'll be more concious about your chances for either catching flu in general or if you have it, spreading it to other people. He also speaks in laymans terms which makes it so much more easy to understand and absorb. Good book."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"I think Dr. Siegel has taken a very rational view of the likelihood of an avian flu epidemic and I always like to read his books because of the way he interprets and understands the factual issues. Sure, there may be a spread of bird flu, but it's not very likely and he encourages people to be aware of the possibility but not go into hiding to avoid it. He does agree s that it might be a good idea in general to have emergency supplies of food and water around but in an method of downplaying any fear attached to avian flue, not not label them for bird flu use, because that gives these supplies too much prominence.I have heard Dr. Siegel many times on radio and seen him on TV and have always been impressed by his command of information and his logical conclusions."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Siegel believes that it is not likely that the bird flu will mutate to human form, and that even if it does, it will be less lethal than currently. In addition, generally unreported evidence from Hong Kong (about 16% of those tested had antibodies to the H5N1 virus) indicates it is less virulent than believed.Siegel also suggests looking at the downward trend in U.S. flu pandemic deaths - about 500,000 in the 1918 Spanish Flu, 70,000 in the 1957 Asian Flu pandemic, and 34,000 during the 1968 Hong Kong Flu. He attributes this to improved sanitation and the use of pneumonia vaccines (pneumonia causing about half the deaths attributed to flu). Finally, he also points out that cooking poultry kills 100% of the flu virus.The greatest problem with the avian flu, according to Siegel, is our tendency to panic and over-react. He does not recommend that citizens stockpile Tamiflu because it is expensive, only has about a three-year shelf life, and most citizens would probably waste it because they wouldn't know when to properly use it.Siegel's \\"Bottom-Line:\\" We should be focusing more on the pandemic we already have - AIDS/HIV."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Superb. Dr. Marc Siegel's book \\"Bird Flu\\" portrays a concise, realistic and informative outlook on a media bred epidemic: fear and anxiety. Certainly an epidemic from bird flu is possible, I know of no one who disagrees. One, however, needs not confuse the terms possibility with probability. The irrational belief that the bird flu virus has a greater chance of mutating to humans in opposition to the thousands of other viruses currently in existence is unfounded. Certainly we should not remain nave of such possibilities but we also need to take into consideration the probability of an epidemic from one particular virus that has yet to master the chain of specific mutations it would need in order to become pandemic. Even if this virus mutated to infect humans on a large scale, who is to say that its virility and potential deadly effects would also not alter and wither. If we resort to stockpiling antidotes to this one particular virus, must we then stockpile antidotes for every other potential viral metamorphosis? It is not only impossible to achieve, it is also illogical to think that we should. More research to develop means of developing appropriate vaccines quickly as well as global containment preparedness would be better served. To Dr. Siegel I say \\"BRAVO\\" and I hope that you continue educating your readers with such rational approaches."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Unlike the last reviewer, who seems to see danger lurking in every adverse event, I like Dr. Siegel's approach that indicates a pandemic is not created by easily occurring events. In reality, several steps must occur before a pandemic could develop. That these steps would all actually occur should not be assumed.Dr. Siegel does a good job in presenting a balanced appraisal of the risk; it does a disservice to this enlightened voice when a reviewer clearly seems not to have read the entire book.If all medical pundits were as knowledgeable and well reasoned as Dr. Siegel, there might be far less alarm, less fear-mongering, and therefore less profit in medical books -- but there might be more genuinely helpful information for those of us who need to know."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Dr. Siegel, in this book and in his many articles in the popular press and media appearances, takes the line that people are TOO AFRAID of the possibility of an influenza pandemic. There may be a few such people, but on the contrary, almost all of those who encounter his viewpoints are NOT AFRAID ENOUGH to take the precautions they ought to. Reading this book will reinforce their complacency.Here's a quote from page 18 of his book:Should I prepare emergency suppliesof food and water just in case?Absolutely not. We've been asking one another this questionever since experts told us that the year 2000 bug inour computers would shut down communications andbanking nationwide.Sinister things scare us out of proportion to theiractual risk of affecting us, and we respond, quite naturally,by wanting to be afraid. But bird flu can be seen asone in a long line of things we've been warned about, andfor which we supposedly need some kind of \\"safe room\\"with an ample supply of food and water just in case.[end of quote]Three comments about this passage:1)It gives the \\"year 2000 bug\\" as an example of an unfounded fear. Does Dr. Siegel realize that many computer professionals worked long and hard, and many companies spent millions of dollars, to prevent the Y2K meltdown from happening, as it certainly would have if the mitigation efforts had not been successful?2)It conflicts with the advice of the U.S. government, which states, at their \\"Individuals and Families Planning\\" page at www.pandemicflu.gov, \\"Stock a supply of water and food. During a pandemic you may not be able to get to a store. Even if you can get to a store, it may be out of supplies. Public waterworks services may also be interrupted. Stocking supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies, such as power outages and disasters.\\"3)It even conflicts with what Siegel says on his page 37, \\"In the United States, we are dependent on other societies for many of our major products. In the event of a major pandemic, we might be cut off, so our government needs to improve on its domestic supply of essential goods, from food to energy to medicine.\\"Siegel seems not to realize that under major pandemic conditions, domestic as well as international commerce would be impaired, with absenteeism and illness resulting in shortage of workers for many essential tasks. Supply chain disruptions (for every sort of commerce) and insufficient surge capacity (for the medical care system) are possibilities that need to be planned for. Siegel seems blissfully unaware of these dangers.With regard to previous reviewers, who state that Siegel is in favor of stockpiling food, water, flashlights and batteries (but only if you DON'T call them \\"pandemic preparations\\"), I'd like to see citations for those claims. My use of Amazon's book searching capacities for these topics in this book came up empty.David Jodrey, Ph.D."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Don't bother with this book unless you enjoy being talked down to by a condescending physician. He treats the readers as if they are imbeciles. The quality of the writing and research is abominable, and it is obvious that the author is just trying to make a buck off book sales. If you want the facts about avian influenza, don't read this. You won't find any facts or advice here."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"As \\"bd\\" points out, in response to an earlier review, Dr. Siegel does advocate having emergency supplies of food and water. It is also important to note that he discourages labelling them as \\"for bird flu use\\", because to do so would increase panic."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Dr. Siegel's new book, Bird Flu, is a careful mixture of history and personal story, of birds and people. This balanced portrayal tracks avian influenza throughout history and in recent times, man's attempts to cope with it. Dr. Siegel has lengthy interviews with the top avian flu experts in the world, and he weighs the pandemic risks of the current H5N1 bird flu that is currently receiving so much attention. He tells us how to prepare, but also how not to overreact. This terrific book is very informative interesting reading."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Marc Siegel, MD does not believe there will be a bird flu pandemic. On page 18 he says, \\"I do not think a massive bird flu pandemic that kills many millions of people worldwide is about to happen...\\" He then explains all the reasons why a major epidemic is unlikely to strike. He goes further to say, \\"Currently fear of bird flu is much more a human problem than bird flu itself.\\" In fact, he devotes a whole chapter to the issue of fear and how to deal with it in your life.Essentially, Siegel's take on the \\"Asian avian flu\\", strain H5N1, is this:1. There is nothing to worry about yet. And it is unlikely that there will be anything to worry about in the future. Even if the flu virus mutates, scientists and modern medicine will address it when the time comes.2. The Bird Flu hysteria will likely go the way of other epidemic scares: SARS, AIDS, West Nile, Lyme disease, etc.3. Physicians are the best ones to handle treatment issues for the masses, no need to stockpile remedies like Tamiflu, Renzala, or other remedies.4. The government is the best agent to distribute vaccines, when and if they become available.5. This is much ado about nothing, by and large. The best thing people can do for a long and healthy life is to eat sensibly and exercise regularly.I wonder if the families of the two hundred dead victims of Bird Flu virus H5N1 would agree. It seems to me there is something more ominous here than just another influenza strain. This one kills half of the people who get it in a matter of a few days.I suspect the proper response to the Bird Flu lies somewhere between hysteria and denial. This book, \\"Bird Flu: Everything you need to know about the next pandemic\\" stakes out the position firmly with the latter. Don't worry, be happy.Let's hope Siegel is right. But if he isn't..."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Having read other books by Marc Siegel, MD, beginning with his first novel Bellevue I am completely comfortable with a topic such as Bird Flu as explained by the author.Marc Siegel has managed to allow reason without hysteria, explaining how he feels that there are several steps before Bird Flu could happen. Yes, the author expresses that a pandemic most likely will happen, but in the same breath tells us that there are steps we can take which are simply not to be assumed. In his explanation, I as a layman found it not as frightening and much more factual than listening to the News on TV or reading about it in a newspaper.I especially found it fascinating that Bird Flu probably existed in 1918; 88 years to come to the surface again.Through Marc Siegel's style as in all his books there is an entertaining quality, which allows a layman as myself to absorb his writing, and not be blocked by the fear of the topic. He is clear, with reason and most of all logical in that we must have a plan for the eventuality of Bird Flu. The fact that Marc Siegel is able to show both sides,and emphasizes that we must have a plan for it, allows me to strongly recommend this book to all individuals. You will find it geared toward the professionals in the field of medicine, but equally important for the average layman."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"I read this book when it was first available, and didn't feel the need to write this until I say the truly bird-brained review, under the name \\"bird brain,\\" that appeared since then. It is shocking that someone would take a swipe at this book without having any idea what it says. It is clear that \\"bird brain\\" didn't read the book, because, for instance, \\"bird brain\\" criticizes the book and the author for being against increased government stockpiles of Tamiflu - but the book is in favor increased government stockpiles!!Moreover, any reader will easily appreciate the history, science and technology which have informed Dr. Siegel; whereas the \\"bird brain\\" represents the saddest form of opinionated pundit - someone who feels the need to trash a fine work without even knowing what it says, and getting it all wrong.As someone who has read the book (and from the other reviews I am obviously not alone) I found the book to be easy-to-read and surprisingly entertaining. Dr. Siegel explains the seriousness of flu pandemic clearly, and why the subject gets so much attention in light of the appearance and spread of H5N1 in recent years. The explanations are direct, understandable, jargon-free and also free of hyperbole. Information and understanding have allowed me to understand (and support) our government is spending billions on flu preparedness, without losing sleep over the chicken on my dinner plate or the egrets in the pond behind my house. Among the things this book taught me, my favorites included a wealth of knowledge on viral mutations and on infectious diseases - ideas and information that everyone should know.If you are reading this you are probably considering buying this book. Buy it. Read it. You'll learn a lot, understand a lot, and you'll never be confused with a \\"bird brain.\\" :)"},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"terrific book- well organized and gives a range of information from the detailsof personal experience to the wider world view"},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Bird Flu, Bird Flu, Bird Flu. What to do?Currently, the latest and most popular medical \\"crisis\\" of the day is, of course, that we are all going to get Bird Flu. Yet, we really don't know much, if anything, about this disease. Another media, political, pharmacological and social \\" blitzkrieg\\" is upon us.What are we to do? How dangerous is it? How likely is it? Will there be another 1918 pandemic? On and on it goes. Fear without facts, is, as Dr. Marc Siegel has pointed out in his previous book \\"False Alarm\\" can be worse than the disease itself.His current book \\"Bird Flu\\" takes on these (and many other) questions about our latest \\"bug\\". The facts, (and the fancies) are cogently presented; the real risks analysed; what we should and should not do; and, most importantly, how to deal rationally with our fears.This book is timely, excellent and important. Read it!Howard Williams, M.D."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"For Americans, with yet another media hyped event the responses run the gamut from feigned interest to outright hysteria. Without a hint of pretense, our system has once again failed us and for all intents and purposes, we are left to our own devices. This 'dance with the one that brung ya' mentality needs to be altered to a seemingly unattainable level of proper preparation, respect, and optimism. Civility and acquiescence of the status quo is simply not acceptable and an option not subscribed to by Dr. Siegel. He advocates preperatory means, but universally applicable to all scenarios through temperance and composure. Avian Flu is yet unfortunately another conduit for our mental scenarios and phobias. Calming and accurate reporting is exactly the prescription this book fills. It seems we are consistently behind the learning curve in reference to proactive measures. Vaccinations rather than vacuity would seem to be the call for the day. Let us combine our efforts in order to continue to live our lives with a bit more information and keeping all things in their true perspective. A wonderful addition to your collections and your reactions."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"From Publishers Weekly: \\" . . . Siegel contends, a new bird flu pandemic would face effective public health measures and medical treatments\\".YIKES!!!The U.S. has enough Tamiflu for under 5% of it citizens IF it is even effective for the strain that could mutate to allow Human to Human (H2H) transmission. Our hospitals have less than 2% capicity available on average and the normal flu season often strains the system. . .This book produces more hot air than the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Book reviewers who say Dr. Siegel's book makes light of the danger of bird flu should go back to school to learn how to read a book critically.The book does not say a pandemic won't happen; it says that there are several steps before it could happen and that a pandemic should not simply be assumed. Dr. Siegel is not for stockpiling because by the time the virus hits (if it hits) it will have gone through several mutations such that current vaccines like Tamiflu may not protect against the new strain. In addition, stockpiled vaccine may be past it's shelf life.Siegel's book has the opposite of a laid back approach to the possibility of a pandemic. It is for preparedness. It is not for hysteria. The book calls for updated techniques for vaccine research and for increased surge capacity of hospitals, to name a few of the book's suggestions for preparedness.This book helps readers 1) put bird flu in perspective, 2) evaluate choices lawmakers and health professionals face in getting ready for any pandemic and public health crisis, 3) learn how to protect ourselves by recognizing that living in constant fear of a pandemic limits our emotional, intellectual, and physical abilities to evaluate and respond to a crisis should it occur."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"In reading Dr. Siegel's ground-breaking book, I was reminded of the poem by Kipling which begins, \\"If you can keep your head/When all about you are losing theirs...\\" In the midst of what appears another panic that may be an over-reaction, Dr. Siegel again -- see his previous book, \\"False Alarm\\" -- reminds us, well, urges us, to keep our heads and see the forest for the trees. It is the best antidote for a lot of what often ails society in general, in fact. The book should be read immediately, and by everybody! -- Dolores Case"},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"This is a really timely follow-up to his previous book about the epidemic of fear in our society. In this book he zeroes in on a subject that is already a hot topic and will remain so for a while. 24-7 media coverage of the bird flu story is escalating, and this book will vaccinate the reader against the natural tendency to panic when the talking heads on the news shows present the worst-case scenarios. Marc Siegel draws upon his skill as a writer and his first-hand knowledge of media and medicine to present a balanced analysis of the situation. His advice on what you should and should not be doing is very clear, so besides providing intellectual stimulation this book gives very practical advice from an expert clinician."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Dr. Marc Siegel is the real thing--a doctor who speaks in a way patients (and readers) can understand. Read \\"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic.\\" You will have an informed opinion to filter all the media hype about the issue. And you will have better judgment should a crisis occur. An added bonus to the book is that you learn the fascinating back stories of past influenza epidemics, such as the Spanish Flu of 1918, which read like historical vignettes and allow you to see Bird Flu in its deeper context. The status and direction of current vaccine research explained in Dr. Siegel's book is an issue which I am now more conscious of and because of that raised consciousness,I expect more from legislators in modernizing and furthering research techniques."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Hopefully more than just the Amazon community is reading Dr. Siegel's work 'Bird Flu : Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic'. This is where our trusted servants and the media community should be on this issue. It takes a clear brave voice like Dr. Siegel's to wake us all up to the emotional rollercoaster we have been subjected to. He is the voice of sanity, reason and wisdom. Can we get this man elected or at least advising the one's who we have elected? Now that sounds like a good idea."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Dr. Marc Siegel's book delivers what has been sorely missing in the discussion of bird flu--a balanced, reasonable, and objective view of this possible threat to our health. Dr. Siegel carefully explains that calls for alarm are not appropriate based on current scientific knowledge and only serve to raise the fear level. At the same time he outlines steps such as upgrading vaccine manufacture and government responsiveness in case a real threat materializes. His basic advice which is to eat smart, exercise, and reduce anxiety, will likely help all of us to live longer. This highly readable and informative book is really \\"everything you need to know\\" about this subject."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"The spread of a lethal strain of bird flu in the past two years has sparked fears of a new pandemic. In Bird Flu, Dr. Marc Siegel looks through the facts, the fears, and the realities to explain what has the experts so worried and why there's still plenty of reason to be calm. Regardless of whether a bird flu outbreak will occur this year in the United States, there's still plenty of work to be done in preparing America for outbreaks of any kind."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"What a relief! Finally a book that tells the truth about what we should and should NOT be worried about when it comes to Bird Flu. With \\"experts\\" running amok in the media with exaggerations and outright lies, Dr. Siegel offers a reassuring and realistic check on what's TRUE about Bird Flu... and (most importantly) what's not.And a quick response to another review - Dr. Siegel actually DOES recommend storing emergency supplies of food and water (as well as flashlights and batteries) - but he does so because it's prudent for everyone to have these things on hand for any emergency, NOT because a bird flu pandemic is \\"imminent\\"."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"Before you rush out to harrass your doctor for a Tamiflu script, sit down and get acquainted with the facts. This book can help you get your H5N1 ducks in a row. Dr. Marc Siegal cuts through the media-induced nonsense with a laser scalpel and excises only the facts for us. Fewer than a hundred people have died from Avian Flu since January 2004, yet more than 600 people die every single day from AIDS in Africa. Avain Flu is like \\"Missing White Girl Syndrome\\" for the rest of us (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_Pretty_Girl_Syndrome).In the US, more people have been shot by Dick Cheney than have contracted Avian Flu. Yes, we are all going to die, but not from H5N1. Thank you Dr. Siegal for standing up to Group Think, Herd Mentality, and thoughtless reactionism."},{"Title":"Bird Flu: Everything You Need to Know About the Next Pandemic","review":"As a medical research scientist, I can say beyond a doubt that a flu pandemic is brewing that may change modern civilization in ways that will go beyond our wildest imagination soon. Physicians are observing the creation of a super strain of the avian influenza virus, H5N1, so-called bird flu, that has the potential to kill millions of men, women, and children in every nation -- not to mention destroy our food supply and the transportation systems they employ.According to the World Health Organization, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a recipe for disaster is clearly in the early genetic-mixing stage. We stand on the abyss of a global wildfire event that will start with the flick of a \\"viral\\" matchstick, burn everything in its path, leaving civil disorder and misery in its aftermath on an unprecedented-scale. But what can we do other than prepare ourselves for the inevitable death of our society as we know it? Other than prudent safety precautions, we can also boost our immune systems psychologically against the true number one killer: s-t-r-e-s-s.Just look at what happened to millions of people impacted by natural disasters in the past year alone from earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis worldwide: They are suffering from PTSD--Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Guess what stress does to your ability to fight bacterial and viral infections? Do you know that when a pandemic strikes within 30-days 100% of the population will be exposed to the virus, but that only 50% will get ill? Did you know that a pandemic comes in 3 phases with the second being the most deadly? Did you know that the most susceptible age group when the virus \\"hits\\" is not the young or the old, but the tender-age group 20 to 30? In plain terms, this book will give you the rest of the story; how nature ensures the \\"survival of the smartest!\\" Indeed information is power and it will make the difference between life and death in the coming pandemics!So get smart and raise your I.Q.: \\"immunity quotient!\\"Dr. John Jay Harper is executive director of the not-for-profit, American Delphi Academy, Spokane, Washington, author of Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century, and a bird flu report website at johnjayharper.com"},{"Title":"Francis Of Assisi: Writer And Spiritual Master","review":"The author, an eminent Franciscan scholar, bases this work on the 30 written pieces produced by Francis of Assisi, laying out a spiritual path developed for his contemporaries but equally valuable for present day Christians. Matura introduces Francis as a \\"true spiritual master of a special genre since he is a layperson without any school learning.\\"We learn that the path Francis proposed is one of love and adoration of God, communion with the church, love and service to all, and radical poverty. Francis's writings feature both positive and negative views of the human condition. On one hand men and women called to divine communion are made up of beautiful bodies, intellectual capabilities, perceptiveness, power, and knowledge. On the darker side, Francis writes, \\"We can claim as our own only our vices and our sins.\\"This book, while written in a clear style, is filled with complex ideas that an individual or group could explore in great depth.

Now we have confidence in the long-term success of our relationship as never before. We have stability now. We also have both experienced remarkable improvements in all our other relationships -- professional and personal. The book is easy and entertaining reading. We keep it for review.

What would be helpful for readers is to understand exactly what medication does, its side effects and how it works. Sure, we can surf the net for that info, but I'd like to hear from an expert, as well as other practical strategies for improvement.

While A.D.D. & ROMANCE at first glance is concerned about the interaction of couples where one or both of members have A.D.D., this book opened more doors, for me, into understanding how A.D.D. behavior impacts everyone that an A.D.D. person has a relationships with: at work, in social groups, and even casual friendships.Jonathan Halverstadt, through his work with Dr. Daniel Amen, a pioneering specialist with A.D.D. and the use of SPECTs in showing that the lack of flow of blood in the brain contributes to A.D.D., uses these experiences to write a realistic book on the roadblocks to relationships when one has A.D.D., offering guidance that centers on a person getting help from professionals.I would highly recommend it to those who have been diagnosed with A.D.D./A.D.H.D."},{"Title":"A.D.D. & Romance: Finding Fulfillment in Love, Sex, & Relationships","review":"I suppose it is best to say that I *wanted* to like this book. Though I do think Halverstadt shares some meaningful insights into and suggestions about navigating ADD relationships, I also think his perspective is both limited and limiting.Specifically, Halverstadt's chapter on sexuality seems to be based on outdated research and misguided cultural stereotypes regarding sexuality and gender, demonstrating little understanding of the wide range of healthy human sexual and gender expression. Rather than taking the opportunity to explore the many gifts that an ADD-brain can bring to sex, he uses a non-ADD model of sexuality as normative.Additionally the author's bias is strongly heterosexual, monogamous, married (or moving in that direction), and Christian, which may alienate some readers.I would suggest reading for the occasional insightful \\"gem\\" while maintaining awareness of the book's strong limitations."},{"Title":"A.D.D. & Romance: Finding Fulfillment in Love, Sex, & Relationships","review":"The book provides insight as to the impact of your actions, providing several best practices on how to prevent them in the first place.

I will say though that there is no clear cut answer. There are no magic steps to get back to where you used to be. Basically, the way to fix these problems are through medication and therapy.

These may not be issues for many, but there are plenty of us out there who would like to know these things:1. This book is completely heteronormative. All relationships discussed are M/F.2. The book assumes the relationship in question is marriage or imminently headed in that direction3. The book assumes traditional monogamy as the only non-harmful form of relationship.4. As the book progresses there is more and more Christianity slipped in. First there are more and more references to God and praying for help. Then there is a recommendation of the Promise Keepers, and reading the Bible together.5. The book very strongly recommends medication for ADD partners, with no real discussion of options or strategies for people who may not be comfortable with being medicated. The implication is that if you care about your relationship, you will medicate.6. It is hard to understand how the three children of the book's \\"model couple\\" as a success story of an ADD relationship get taken care of, given all the things this couple do to keep their relationship strong. I read it thinking they must have a live-in nanny, which just isn't realistic for the vast majority of people.If any of these things are going to turn you off or irritate you, you may want to check out a different book on this topic."},{"Title":"A.D.D. & Romance: Finding Fulfillment in Love, Sex, & Relationships","review":"I found this book to very helpful in dealing with my relationship with my husband and sister who have adult ADD/ADHD.

It does help one to think about ADHD and relationships.2. It does help create talking points with your partner about your relationship.Cons:1. It uses pseudoscience and unproven theories of how ADHD works as some of its basis for discussion.2. It is very heavy on the belief that medication can make one with ADHD \\"normal\\". While psychopharmacological assistance for people with ADHD is good, psychological is also good, and the book tends to ignore that aspect.3. It is based on a traditional M/F married relationship.Overall, I don't know that there is anything better out there.

It was at turns fascinating and familiar, then frustrating and detached. I was simply amazed at the ability of Lynch to create a narrative that seemed so disjointed, and yet oddly and strangely complete.Slavoj Zizek however, has no trouble distilling the tale to what he believes are its basic elements. He views the tale through the lens of Jacques Lacan, (A Freudian revisionist.) He exhaustively discusses the implications of Fred's impotence and (possible) fantasy of violence and escape, and the construction of a fantasy that includes a virile version of himself, and a disjointededly evil &quot;Father&quot; figure in Mr. Eddy. He boils the tale down to the implications of such contructions and their inherent and necessary failure, because the very fears that call them into play tear them apart. (As seen by the re-introduction of dark haired Renee and Fred's Physical form in the second half of the film.)He also addresses other aspects of the work, first, as the title suggests, he discusses this work as a film that addresses both a &quot;known&quot; reality, (the convoluted plot) and an ineffable, yet unconsciously addressable sort of hyper reality (the &quot;Real&quot; meaning behind the work.) He does this by exploring many themes, reducing them often to cliche's drawn from popular culture. He looks at Renee/Alice's role as femme fatale in a &quot;neo-noir&quot; setting, the issues of male construction of phallic fantasy and sexual objectivism, the role of ultimate evil and impossible beauty in the Lynch catalogue, and he finally hails Lost Highway as an example of what movies can become in the future, a sort of hypertexed jungle of possibilities and superimposed realities, where the viewer can control (or believe they can control,) the outcome of the film.He really helped me appreciate the forces at play (whether they are intentionally placed there by the author or no,) in a film that I already thoroughly enjoyed. He lets me explore the aspects of this film that &quot;Spoke&quot; to me on a level that I could not previously express, and yet somehow I understood.Finally, a word on the craft aspect of this book. This is less a paperback book than it is a pamphlet or portfolio. Nonetheless, the 40 pages of essay are meaty enough for several readings, and the issues covered will have you watching Lost Highway about eight more times, and getting more and more out of it as you pick up on moments in the plot that help you expound on Zizek's ideas. It is well worth the price, and easily accessable to the reader that has no knowledge of Freud or Lacan. Zizek is an outstanding writer. He does not insult his reader in an attempt to dumb his subject down, nor does he fill his prose with lengthy words that leave one scrambling for the dictionary."},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","review":"Stand forewarned! Are you familiar with Lacanian psychoanalysis? If not, then what you are going to get out of this tome will be limited. Unfortunately, I think Zizek's exegesis of Lynch's film is one of the best and most interesting- so you may have to study up to get anything out of this...For instance, Zizek talks frequently about The Real, The Imaginary, The Symbolic, The Fantasy, Transversing the Fantasy, Perversion, The Name of the Father, etc. If you don't know what these terms are, you will not be able to just \\"figure it out\\" on the fly, because even \\"pervert\\" and \\"fantasy\\" are being used in technical ways which are different from their popular uses. For instance, a \\"pervert\\" is not someone who is horny all the time (though they may be, but that's beside the point), they are people who went through the stage of \\"alientation\\" but did not fully complete \\"seperation,\\" and therefore have to supplement their lack of a fully completed \\"symbolic castration\\" by a bolstered \\"Imaginary.\\" When this Imaginary loses its cohesion and begins to fail, the subject resorts to other strategies such as fetishism, masochism, or sadism.The point here is this is really a book for Lacanians, and not for people who are just interested in Lynch. If you are the latter, you will probably just going to get disgusted and frustrated because Zizek is assuming a basic knowledege in this field. That being said, Zizek is still one of the most entertaining and popular writers of Non-Essentialist Hegelian Lacanian Post-Marxism, and I found this book typical of his output.To use a warfare simile (I am an American, after all), I would suggest that Zizek is less like a surgical strike, and more like a cluster bomb. In this book, which is forty odd pages, he only really writes about Lynch and the movie for a handful, talking about all kinds of other stuff as well, such as cyberspace, mexican soap operas, Spielberg, film Noir, Stalinism, Ideology, Totalitarianism. Zizek has mastered the art of the interesting digression like no other, except for perhaps Trstram Shandy from the Laurence Sterne novel. If you are familiar with Zizek, then you know the routine and probably love it- but for others wanting a clear and focused account of Lost Highway will be frustrated.For a easier account of the same theory, watch the Zizek film The Pervert's Guide to Cinema where Zizek talks at length about Lynch and Lost Highway and gives an even clearer and more popular explanation of his idea(s). Its a great film and a good place to start with Zizek and even Lacanian psychoanalysis.I have felt that sometimes Zizek's publishers (I am guessing it is his publishers), give his books misleading titles. For instance, the Zizek book Looking Awry: An Introduction to Jacques Lacan Using Popular Culture, I feel to be a terrible introduction to Lacan and Lacanian theory. Its a good book, but not as an intrduction to Lacan. Likewise with this book, I feel like Zizek just wrote a book which had a sizable chunk dedicated to Lynch and therefore they decided to name Lynch in the title. It is a bit misleading, but if you already read Zizek you won't care.Really, the best thing about the book and Lacan's theory about the movie is how it makes clear a \\"part\\" of Lacanian theory, namely how \\"fantasy\\" functions. There is some other good stuff here which I have found really useful, such as a discussion of how \\"systems\\" usually function on two levels- an ego ideal level and a superego level, which mean that they simultaneously give contradictory \\"orders\\" and therefore the best way to bring a system down is to follow it to the letter of the law. I spent some time with a friend coming up with all kinds of examples and the model seems to work very well.In any case, if you are a Zizek fan and a Lynch fan, check this out. Otherwise perhaps read The Impossible David Lynch by Todd McGowan which is also Lacanian but much clearer and more concise, and also film The Pervert's Guide to Cinema which can be bought online."},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","review":"This is an excellent examination of David Lynch's \\"Lost Highway\\". It is absolutely crucial that one approaches this text with some background on a) Jacques Lacan or b) postmodern philosophy, specifically, Derrida and Baudrillard. If you are familiar with both, that's even better. When I read this book, I had a solid understanding of postmodernism, but a fairly tenuous grasp on Lacanian psychoanalysis, most of which was from Zizek's own \\"Enjoy Your Symptom! Jacques Lacan in Hollywood and Out\\". The book was perfectly understandable and cogent throughout, if you excuse the occasional digression. Without an understanding of Lacan or postmodernism, this book is sure to be difficult and obscure as many of the previous reviewers will attest. It is, however, by no means unclear or impenetrable. Zizek is perfectly lucid, IF you have the proper background. Don't expect him to explain Lacan in a 48 page paperback.As for Zizek's reading of Lost Highway, you will ultimately decide for yourself. I found it illuminating. Sure, the Jungian reading fits really well, but isn't that a bit too easy? Lynch is operating on so many levels simultaneously, so why would he tell a simple story of soul transmigration? The Jungian reading ignores Lynch's other works, such as \\"Mulholland Drive\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\". When one examines Lynch's oeuvre, Zizek's analysis begins to make more and more sense.There are a couple noteworthy issues. Lost Highway, at times, feels more like a pretext for Zizek to offer yet another example of Lacanian psychoanalytical technique rather than a book devoted to Lynch's film. Is this a problem? Not necessarily. It depends on what you're looking for. One reviewer alleges that Zizek mixes up certain diegetic elements (mostly names and places). I did not find this to be true. I've seen Lost Highway at least ten times and I didn't notice any errors. Finally, the book itself is extremely brief. If you're hoping for a really in-depth examination, you may be disappointed. Overall, I found the book to be a very enjoyable, entertaining, and informative read."},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","review":"At the risk of courting redundancy, I hereby feel it is my duty to warn prospective prospective buyers that ART OF THE RIDICULOUS SUBLIME is a book for pseudo-intellectuals and hardore Zizek enthusiasts only. This is a book about Slavoj Zizek and his interest in Lacan, not a book about David Lynch or LOST HIGHWAY.True to form, Zizek's interpretation here is highly energetic, creative, and self-assured, but almost hilariously off the mark. His long winded explications amount to little more than tiresome, self-obsessed psycho-blather. It's just a pity that all of his inspired meanderings lead nowhere, ironically and unintentionally leading us down a lost highway of wasted time, ink, and paper.So what then is the actual key to understanding LOST HIGHWAY? Simple: concentrate on understanding the work of David Lynch, or at least some of his major works leading up to the film. The only school of philisophical thought that will help you decipher this sublimely complex and fascinating film is not Jungian, not Freudian, certainly not Lacanian or Zizekian, but - did you guess it? - Lynchian.Understand Lynch's work and you understand Lynch's idiosyncratic, yet surprisingly consistent, system of thought. My best advice is to go back and watch ERASERHEAD, BLUE VELVET, the final episode of TWIN PEAKS, and TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME - especially the latter two with a rigorous critical ear and eye, and preferably with notebook in hand. Note the ubiquitous recurring themes and Lynch's specific way of telling stories and treating the material.Pay special attention to the character called The Mystery Man (aka \\"the fence\\"), because he is at the very epicenter of the story. In his fantastic essay entitled \\"David Lynch Keeps His Head,\\" David Foster Wallace describes him as \\"Mephistophilian\\" and goes on to add, with characteristic hyper-lucidity, that MM is \\"pretty clearly the devil, or at least somebody's very troubling idea of the devil.\\" With this one statement, DFW displayed more insight into LOST HIGHWAY than Zizek managed over the course of his entire book.So one star only for this preposterously pretentious stinker."},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","review":"Probably the most hilarious interpretation of David Lynch ever written, and I'm pretty interested in wondering how Lynch himself would feel if he noticed that his art has been hijacked by the post-modern academic elite. Actually, Martha Notchimson's &quot;Passion of David Lynch&quot; probably got Lynch down better than any of his critics, but to reduce her interpretations to New Agism is really just an exemplification of fringe criticism's dread of Jungian thought in the first place - not that Lynch is a Jungian, but he is all about transcendental meditation and reincarnation, and his pictures seem to have a similar spiritual center and energy. Zizek is extremely intelligent, but ultimately he's fishing for minnows while sitting on a whale. If you interpret Lynch in regards to a system (Lacanian for instance) instead of humanity, you end up with what Lynch would probably call &quot;phoney baloney&quot;."},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","review":"This is my first exposure to the work of Slavoj Zizek, but it probably will not be my last. Undeniably studied, Zizek is able to write with an unusual fusion of irreverent pop-cultural wit and stuffy intellectual jargon. That makes this breezy (43 page) study easy to read and profoundly deep at the same time. But don't mistake \\"profoundly deep\\" for \\"profoundly revealing\\" or \\"profoundly correct\\", as it is none of the above.A self-proclaimed Lacanian, Zizek makes a case for an anti-Fruedian, anti-Jungian psychoanalytic interpretation of what is perhaps David Lynch's most obscure feature film since Eraserhead. As published on Amazon.com and elsewhere, I prefer a Jungian interpretation of Lost Highway, and for good reason: it fits extremely well. To deny this is to deny the evidence of one's own eyes.All the same, Zizek's intellect is beyond dispute, and his reading of Lost Highway should be of great interest to film theorists and serious David Lynch fans alike."},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","review":"anything that has to do with david lynch's movie the lost highway is bound to be worth its weight in gold. this book goes into explanations on the nature of the though processes created by the characters in the movie. the situations only lead one to wonder, how is this even possible. the movies concept of change is to show that there are more ways to view a situation, whether they are good or not and it follows the nature of human beings when they are placed in strange surroundings. hope this was helpful."},{"Title":"Eighty Million Dollars 87th Precinct Mystery Novel","review":"I found this new mystery interest which caused me to read its entirety in short order.

From the childhood trauma of losing his mother to the moving love that Zhivago feels for both his wife and Lara, Pasternak manages to tell a story that weaves tragedy and joy in the one novel. However, what truly makes the book worth reading are the passages of beautifully crafted writing that border on prose. A fuller appreciation for these passages growing with each additional reading of the novel.Although a complex and initially difficult read, Dr. Zhivago blossoms into a novel which sweeps you into its story and carries you to an end that leaves you feeling saddened and yet richer for the experience. I would doubt that few can read this novel without it changing them and that fewer still can resist reading it again and again."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"this is a an epic that could have been. at times it reaches the intensity of genius and the rythym of great prose, but those times are rare. i'm not sure whether to blame that on the translation of the work or on the work itself, but something is lacking, and it smells fishy.overall, the novel is enjoyable, though dissapointing at times. pasternak admirably conveys the horrors of the revolutionary years, and asks the proper question regarding man and the history that he makes. this is a novel about great historical forces affecting individuals, and at times i cannot help but to compare it to the grapes of wrath. it is before anything though, a russian novel, and if your taste runs to that far east, this novel will not dissapoint."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"The movie may have won a few Oscars but the book is definitely not much to write home about.

By the end of the book I was so frustrated that I just finished the book without understanding the significance of half the characters.

The next and most emotionally powerful passage is during the Civil War when Zhvago is with the Red Partisans in Siberia. Then there is the end section on the Great Patriotic War. But it ends there, the rest of the book just takes up strands of the plot and leads them to dead ends. I didnt like Lara, Komorovsky, and Strelnikov at all. Pasternak is not a writer he is a poet, his poetry is wounderful and that is what we should read him for. This work simply does not live up to its reputation. It is not the great love stroy David lean filmed in 1965 or the Cold War tool that people make it out to be. Its just a novel with very big ups and downs.

The author won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1958, but his government denied him permission to accept the prize.The novel is a compelling tale of the events during and after the Russian revolution. People are caught up in events not of their own choosing, over which they have no control. The old order collapses to be replaced by a new order coming out of the revolution. Families are torn apart. Dr. Zhivago is separated from Lara, never to find her again (the motion picture includes the enduring song, \\"Somewhere, My Love\\").One of the scenes that sticks in my mind is a battle where men are ordered to fire on the \\"enemies,\\" i.e., people opposing the politicians running their side of the struggle. One man simply aims at a tree on the battlefield. Occasionally someone chances to come between him and the tree. He considers it a matter over which he has no control.It is an example of politicians using people as pawns to fight their opponents, the opponents being people who might otherwise have been their friends."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I haven't seen the movie yet, but I already have a feeling it will be better than the book.This is one of those epic stories that just needs a big screen to be told properly. There is something about the blandness of print that simply doesn't do it justice. I need to hear the train, feel the cold, howling wind, and absorb the vast Russian landscape through all my senses.How is it possible that there is all this debate about whether Dr. Zhivago was a political novel? Seriously, how could it not be? Yes, it is certainly more than that, but at its heart this is a novel that wants to make a statement. Pasternak made little attempt to hide this. And any card-carrying Communist from mother Russia would be able to spot it for what it is.And in case you needed any more proof, it won Pasternak the Nobel Prize, which as we all know has nothing to do with good writing and everything to do with politics. Look through the list of winners - the few who are actually a pleasure to read (Marquez, Steinbeck, and Coetzee are on that short list) are far outnumbered by those who are a pain to read but had an important message (Xingjian, Gide, Laxness, and Grass, to name just a few on this much longer list).Dr. Zhivago is an important book, but not a great book. Great books have important messages, but those messages are gently nestled inside a well-told story.

Much more accessible than the much studied War and Peace, Dr Zhivago is essentially russian and more poignantly human. Pasternack chooses the moments of life that give pristine clarity to the human experience. The history of the russian revolution is sprinkled throughout this story of a young doctor/poet, a zealous revolutionary, a jaded lawyer and the woman they love: Lara, a strong, beautiful, independent and unsentimental survivor. Much is made of Yuri Zhivago in most reviews and descriptions of this book, but this is really the story of four main characters and one dramatic, powerful event in history. I have had the pleasure of being exposed to this classic as a novel, a movie and an abridged audio book read by the now deceased actor, Paul Schofield. Of the three, the audio book was magical, but actually reading Pasternack as he meant us to understand his story is worthwhile because he is a truly breathtaking storyteller!"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Like most folks, I've seen the magnificent movie which was based upon this Boris Pasternak novel numerous times. It is an epic motion picture. In retrospect, it is a good thing that I did; otherwise I might not have survived the first 100 pages.While I was prepared for the somewhat dense prose that can be expected from Russian writers of the period, the virtual avalanche of Russian names almost did me in. It was only my familiarity with the story that allowed me to follow the events preceding Zhivago's arrival in Yuriatin. By this time, the characters had become familiar, in all of their various names and diminutives.As I mentioned, the writing can be dense at times, and as Pasternak was considered a more accomplished poet than novelist, somewhat florid. Nevertheless, the writing can be captivating and the imagery, when taken in conjunction with images from the motion picture, is, at times, spellbinding.The story, Russia in a state of political and economic chaos during the period surrounding WWI and the Bolshevik revolution, is informative and educational. Only viewing the events through the trials and tribulations of individuals can the challenges of the period be fully appreciated.If you are familiar with other works by Russian writers of the period and are comfortable with their style, you will likely enjoy this work. If you read it simply because you enjoyed the movie, you might not give it high marks."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This is at the very least, a wonderful novel.The film tells the story of the love affair, but in the novel the love affair is set against the backdrop of two revolutions, the first world war, the civil war, the new economic plan etc etc. There is very little of this in the film.The novel is a meditation on the decades of continual upheaval and violence, on love, religion, politics and the meaning of life.

Pasternack opens a window to a time of violent change, of challenges to personal liberty and expression under the devastating communist wave. Written in another age, present day readers may find it cumbersome and hard to keep track of some characters (referred to with all four names, usually).

It begins a few years before the Bolshevik Revolution and follows events that lead to Civil War and the establishment of the Soviet government. The main character is Dr. Zhivago, a kind and passionate man, who is constantly affected by these events.The book has excellent historical value as well as detail of its characters so that it fully embodies the disorderly mindset of the people. This is most evident in Dr. Zhivago's relationship with a woman named Lara. He and his wife Tonya were happily married but when he was drafted to a medical outpost he fell in love with the nurse Lara. Though the Doctor is a good man he is torn between his two loves and inevitably cheats on Tonya. His relationship with Lara beautifully parallels the political struggle that was taking place in Russia. She represents the Communist Russia that the people longed for. She is so close yet unattainable; every time the doctor begins to settle with her they experience pain and hardship, whether it be by outside forces or their own actions. She is impossible to reach, impossible to forget, and their relationship, like the revolution, was impossible stop once it began. Dr. Zhivago allows the reader to witness a struggle of the human mind's judgment and its desires. It demonstrates that our decisions can start us in one direction and that life's unforeseeable circumstances can easily lead us astray."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak is quite remarkably a poet's novel: the writer was a poet, and hence each page is full of beautiful imagery, metaphors and word play. The protagonist is a poet, the novel revolves around his love and life in the first half of twentieth century Russia. The reader, by association, has to be a poet to really relish the saga.It is one of those novels from last century that everyone must read. The ghosts of socialism and Marxism, the excesses that occured in name of revolution, the transformation of the largest country of the world from ceturies old system into a failed ideal: the novel has enough historical significance. Last century was guided, molded, scarred, decorated and defined by the events and ideas that crop up as part of Doctor Zhivago's life. The literary underpinnings are gigantic: a love story with the Russian Revolution as background score: a Nobel was the least he could have got.Besides the historical perspective, the story itself is a delightful one. The homely Tonya, Dr Zhivago's wife and first love and mother of his children, the sensuous Lara who weaves into and out of Yuri (Dr Zhivago's) life, her husband Pasha Antipov, who at every junction of his life must fight against ghosts and demons of his wife's past and present and in attempt outclass himself, the Uncle Koyla, the intellectual: the list is unending. Characters are crafted from all sections of society, making this novel a representation of whole society at that time. Like Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, the novel provides four or five chief characters, who are immense in their own potrayal, parting with their thoughts, ideas, ideals and philosophies, and possessing unique well-defined characteristics, the novel has another string of about twenty characters who are unforgettable for whatever roles they are assigned.The harshness of winter, the beauty of forests and fields, the man divided in his love for wife Tonya and lover Lara, the poet in exile, the idealists seeking to change the world, Russian history and customs: such ideas find Pasternak displaying hs poetic prowess. Many passages in the book are sheer poetry, and I am amazed at seeing how powerful they are in translated language: I wish I knew Russian to find out how delightful the original must have been.It is a long novel, with graphic pleasant and unpleasant sequences and a writing style where its apparent that either because it is a translation or ther writer was a poet attempting prose, the writing is not a easy read. Requires lot of time and effort and most people prefer the movie that was made in 1965 or so. I think reading Doctor Zhivago is an experience in itself, and in this post cold war era, it contains the perspective and historical lessons that we all must know and understand.An excerpt that presents a preview of all the things this novel incorporates into the love saga of Yuri, where his heart is in strife in his love for two women as is it in strife witnesses changes that challenge every aspect of his being and thinking:\\"Even more than what they had in common, they were united by what separated them from the rest of the world. They were both repelled by what was tragically typical of the modern man, his shrill textbook admirations, his forced enthusiam, and the deadly stillness coldly preached and practiced by the countless workers in the field of art and science in order that the genius must remain extremely rare.They loved each other greatly. Most people experience love, without noticing there is anything remarkable about it.To them- and this made them unusual- the moments when passion visited their doomed human existence like a breath of timelessnesses were moments of revelation, of ever greater understanding of life and of themselves.\\"Loved it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I read Zhivago for the first time in high school. I loved it, but didn't pick it up again for 20 years. I was surprised to find it rough going at the beginning. When I had first read the book, it had been precisely the first 100 or so pages that had enchanted me and pulled me into the novel. This time around, it was the complex and often frustrating last half of the book that really moved me. I guess this is a measure of how the book grows with the reader.Doctor Zhivago is a complicated book that seems to me largely about how people get involved with circumstances (politics, love affairs) that do not interest them, simply because life leaves them vulnerable. That makes for a strange reading experience, because it is not a message that wraps itself up neatly. The texture of the novel is in part about ends-- loose ends, dead ends, character cul-de-sacs. A more experienced author wouldn't have tried to work this theme out in prose using the same methods that Pasternak employed. The book rolls from melodrama to nearly documentary realism. He uses diary form, letters, even poetry to complete the work. I guess it was his lack of experience that allowed him to (very nearly) achieve the impossible. The feeling of the book is an awful lot like life.There are certainly more polished and perfect novels and novelists out there. Doctor Zhivago would not have profited from their example. As the title of this review says, Zhivago is great precisely because it isn't perfect. It is a great sprawling messy wonderful world of a book.Recommended for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"The events of the novel revolve around a doctor and poet by the name of Yurii Andreievich Zhivago whom we first meet at a crucial point in his life. From the day of his mother's funeral to the day of his own, we follow Zhivago on his travels throughout Russia. He travels to the warfront, flees to Siberia, and is drafted into the Red Army before making his way back to Moscow. Over the course of these two decades, Zhivago repeatedly encounters a beautiful woman who essence fills his thoughts and heart. He is loyal to his wife Tonia and his little son Sasha, but he cannot help falling in love with the lovely Larisa Feodorovna Antipov, who is also already married to a famous war general. It is these chance encounters that allow the plot to progress and lead to their eventual love affair.Even with such a complex plot, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; remains a primarily character-based novel, as can be seen from the vast number of names and people we become familiar with throughout the story. Even the minor characters become dear to us, once we have figured out who they actually are and how they are connected to the main story. It is a challenging process to sort through the long list of characters, who may have any number of pseudonyms or nicknames along with their original Russian forenames. It is rewarding to recognize that Pavel Pavlovich, Pasha, Antipov, and Strelnikov are, in fact, the same person. We are also given several glimpses into the views and opinions of minor characters. Each person we meet along the way has a detailed history and a certain point of view to establish. Even if a character is only remotely connected to the main plot, Pasternak educates us on his family history and his role in the revolution.The detail the author includes in the story extends to the scenery and land of Russia itself. With lengthy and occasionally tedious descriptions, Pasternak implores us to imagine the rough and beautiful wilderness of his home land and notes the striking contrast of the destruction caused by the war. He adds to his descriptions by making religious and philosophical allusions. These views alone are interesting but in the context of a greater story that should be told without interruption, they often slow down the more stirring moments in the plot. Some of these images, however, do create a startling picture of the devastation that swept Russia, such as the scenery at the warfront and during the uprising. Others, though educational, disrupt the plot to a greater extent.With the combination of all these elements, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; tells a compelling story while simultaneously describing the events of the early 1900's that shaped history. But unfortunately, I did not gain as much from reading this novel as many reviewers have expressed. I enjoyed the moments when the plot neatly coincided with Pasternak's poetic descriptions of the countryside or his unnerving depictions of the revolution, but these were too sparse throughout the novel for it to be engaging. The main plot was interrupted too often by philosophic commentary from either the author or one of the characters. It often took a great effort to get through monotonous passages and descriptions that did not contribute effectively to the plot or scenery of the novel. Many have expressed their frustration at the number of long, complex names Pasternak uses to refer to each of his characters, and I would agree that this they are difficult to keep straight. But once I finally understood the names, it was rewarding to get to know the minor characters and learn of their experiences during the revolution. But despite these disappointments in the writing and the excessive commentary on the story, I enjoyed reading the novel's depiction of life during such decisive times in Russia's history. The setting and the characters were equally important in telling the story of Yurii and Lara. Though not a masterpiece in my opinion, it was certainly an interesting novel that was worth the slow read in the end. I must recommend this novel to all those who are interested in a deeply illustrated account of Russian history and an exploration of the themes inherent in that era."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Doctor Zhivago has, in the years since its secret publication in Italy, been called a timeless love story. However, even though this may be true, it does not follow the usual type of a love story which begins with the meeting of two lovers and then ends happily with their marriage or a comparable event. Instead the author, Russian poet Boris Pasternak, writes the love story between Yury Zhivago and Lara Antipova, two characters who were already married to others. In this, Doctor Zhivago is a palpable commentary on marital infidelity. This has, in the past, lead this beautifully worked novel to be shunned as controversial or immoral. However, despite the fact that Pasternak chooses such a difficult theme to work with in his novel, he validates and creates sympathy for Yury, Lara, and their affair with his usage of characterization, symbolism, and appeals to pathos.Pasternak's characterizations of the two principle female characters play a huge role in winning the audience's sympathy for Lara and her plight. Yury's wife Tonya is, essentially, a flat character; throughout the book she remains devoted to Yury and her children; she conforms to the social norms both before and after the revolution takes place where Pasternak's more dynamic characters all experience a change because of it. Additionally, Pasternak makes it difficult to connect to Tonya by keeping her essentially out of sight throughout the novel; the only time the audience reads of her feelings is in a letter, and consequently, is indirect. In fact, all of the audience's experience of Tonya is indirect; we see her through Zhivago's descriptions or conversations about her, but never as just herself. This distance from Tonya is furthered by Yury's lack of identification with Tonya; he always feels spiritually apart from his wife. A sharp contrast is Lara, whose poignant thoughts and feelings can be read from nearly the beginning of the story, and who, despite having extremely nonconformist tendencies like political activeness, maintenance of a job even into her married years, and an insistence to assist in the WWI war effort, is portrayed more warmly than any of the other characters in the novel. She is given the endearing Tonya-like qualities of devotion to family (it is the emergence of her husband Pasha as the merciless revolutionary Strelnikov that leads to their separation) and the nonconformist attributes which make her such a fascinating character. The audience is also made to see Lara as a character worthy of the kind of love she has with Yury because of the tragic nature of her previous intimate relationship as a teenager with the aging lawyer Komarovsky, which can be described as nothing less than parasitic. As Lara later says to Yury, \\"There is something broken in my whole life. I discovered life much too early, I was made to discover it, and I was made to see it from the very worse side--a cheap, distorted version of it--through the eyes of a self-assured, elderly parasite, who took advantage of everything and allowed himself whatever he fancied\\" (13:398). This clearly exhibits the disillusionment she felt as a result of her affair, and is not only presented here but also throughout the text. Pasternak uses Lara's disillusionment to create sympathy and hope for something better for this extremely likable character; as she loves Yury Zhivago, their love affair is the culmination of our hopes.Another way in which Pasternak validates Yury and Lara's affair is his use of religious symbolism, particularly in reference to who would have been the \\"fallen woman\\" of the affair, Lara. In Pasternak's time, it was the woman who suffered more from an affair; however, in one particular scene, Lara appears as an iconic image of the Virgin Mary. \\"Like a huge banner stretching across a city street, there hung before him in the air, from one side of the forest glade to the other, a blurred, greatly magnified image of a single, astonishing, idolized head. The apparition wept, and the rain, now more intense, kissed and watered it\\" (12: 367-386). By symbolizing the Virgin Mary as Lara, Pasternak is creating an association between Lara and the Virgin, and a good one at that. The reader is less disposed to think of Lara as a \\"fallen woman\\" after this association, and the image is repeated throughout the text, including Zhivago's funeral scene (15: 502). In this, Pasternak's use of symbolism is highly effective in creating the reader's sympathy for the affair in Doctor Zhivago.Finally, Pasternak masterfully appeals to the reader's sense of pathos, especially when dealing with the fate of the two lovers; neither end up with the other or with their spouses. After running away to Yuryatin together, Komarovsky comes to collect Lara using black mail; Tonya and her children have already been deported, and he returns to work in his Moscow hospital. The novel ends with Yury's death; Lara, who has been searching for him for years, finds him only at his funeral, and it is this, one of the closing scenes, which is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking: Lara holds Yury's body in her arms and cries over him. The fact that these lovers, so obviously suited to each other in every way, have such a short relationship and do not end up together creates in the reader such regret and sympathy for Yury and Lara. Even though their relationship was illegitimate and possibly aberrant, we feel more sympathy at their parting, because of Pasternak's more poetic style at this part, than when Tonya is deported. It is much more personal, infinitely more heartbreaking. Boris Pasternak's appeal to pathos in Doctor Zhivago logically creates in the reader the most sympathy for Yury, Lara, and their romantic plight.There is no reason that the theme of marital infidelity in Doctor Zhivago should keep any reader from enjoying and appreciating the exquisite loveliness of Pasternak's prose and story. Pasternak made sure of this with his dexterous handling of characterization, symbolism, and appeals to pathos. Doctor Zhivago remains as a monument of 20th century literature, and one that can be recommended to anyone from the age of about 14 up. Beautifully told, masterfully written, Doctor Zhivago is undoubtedly one of the must-read-classics of the last century."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This is the epic of Zhivago (and later, Pasternak himself)over the background of Russia's transition from Czarist rule to Bolshevism, passing through the First World War and the Civil War. The novel tells the intercrossing stories of Dr. Yuri Zhivago and Lara, whose lives meet several times during their childhood and adolescence, without getting to know each other. Zhivago grows up in Moscow, with the Gromeko family, whose child Tonya becomes his wife. Lara gets married to Pavel Antipov, who goes to war. When he is missing in action, Lara becomes a military nurse, in order to look for him. Zhivago also has to go to war, and there he meets Lara. After the war, he and his family move to a rural estate near the city of Yuriatin. There he meets Lara again. She lives alone with her daughter, since her husband has become the terrible revolutionary known as Strelnikov. They fall in love immediately and absolutely, and they start an affair which torments Zhivago, since he feels bad about being unfaithful to his wife. One day, he is kidnapped by the Partisans (revolutionaries), who keep him in prison during the Civil War. Eventually he escapes, to proceed his life. Many things more happen, but let's not spoil the plot.This book is a vast landscape of Russia, but it's not a political or social novel. It is basically a story of love and Fate, but it is also possible to interpret it as a symbol of what war, politics and especially totalitarianism can do to the individual. But I don't agree with the reviewer who says that every character is a specific symbol or prototype, since I found them to be full personalities, tragic figures with a whole life depicted in the book. This book is to be suffered, for it is very emotional and sad. &quot;Rich&quot; is perhaps the best word to describe it."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Dr. Zhivago's ideal life \`escape into freedom out of all sorrows' contrasts sharply with the horrors of war and revolution around him: \`the ruthless logic of mutual extermination.' As a doctor he is daily confronted with \`survivors whom the technique of modern fighting had turned into lumps of mutilated flesh.' Red and White atrocities rivaled each other in savagery.After the Reds won the civil war, \`the old oppression of the tsarist state was replaced by a much harsher yoke of the revolutionary superstate led by the professionals, the Bolsheviks, and their false sympathizers, informers, intrigues and hatred.'Their Marxist policies are severely criticized: \`Marxism is not sufficiently master of itself. Ordinary people are anxious to test their theories in practice, to learn from experience, but those who wield power are so anxious to establish the myth of their own infallibility that they turn their back on truth.'Dr. Zhivago with his independent mind and love for humanity highly understands that nothing can be gained from violence: childhood friends fight each other in the name of their truth, \`man is a wolf to man'; \`stranger meeting stranger killed for fear of being killed.'Under the totalitarian system, he feels bitterly \`the loss of faith in the value of personal opinion. Instead of being natural and spontaneous, something artificial, forced, crept into our conversation; falsehood had crept into our lives.'Boris Pasternak's book is a profound meditation on life and death, love and hate, personal commitment and mass ideology, freedom and slavery, war and peace.The fate of the main characters and the crossings of their lives within the upheavals provoked by war, revolution and totalitarianism are masterfully painted and heart-rending.This magically written and brilliantly built novel is an eternal masterpiece. It stands in sharp contrast with the extreme vulgarity of the anti-Pasternak campaign in the USSR after Pasternak was awarded the Nobel prize (see I.

As with any book, there are going to be those who feel that Zhivago is horrible because famous and illustrious novelists (like Mr. Nabokov) did not agree with the approach Pasternak took to writing his novel (but Nabokov also criticized Dostoevsky's books for quite the same reasons, so does this mean that Crime and Punishment and The Idiot and Karamazov are not artistic novels?). Before anyone decides to defer to Nabokov's opinion, he should realize why Nabokov said those things. Reading a Nabokovian book is so much different from Doctor Zhivago. Nabokov's novels are well planned out, with biblical, Shakespearean, and Poe-etical imagery aplenty. His language in general, in every novel, short story, and poem, is spectacular and to be worshipped. His themes dealt with extraordinary events in common life. Nabokov is an artist in the sense of a Renaissance painter.But Pasternak is not that way, almost quite the opposite. He set out to write a great novel, and I suppose he has done so in many circles of readers. And of those, I am sure that many think the book is great because of the epic events (the revolution), the epic characteristics (the journey), and the eternal themes (love and war, death and separation). But what great book by Tolstoy doesn't have those? What I see with Doctor Zhivago is the way Pasternak treats everyday, common place events. This is the best book, the only book, I have read to take normal events, ones which I see myself going through everyday, and put them into words that are poetic, flowing, and so representative of the truth. The characters may not rival those of Dickens, or the plot may have loopholes and deadends which scream at you HORRIBLE, but those are not the only, or even the most important, characteristics of a novel which defines its greatness.For this book to be considered art, it shouldn't be looked at with a mathematician's eye, quantifying how many cardboard characters there are, how often Pasternak expounds his own philosophy in similar ways with different characters, or how many times a chapter pops up which is totally different in style and format to the rest of the book and detracts from the novel's flow. Art is not an additive process, but something that occurs inside of the reader, viewer, or listener. And for a book in the last half of the 20th century to create that makes it special, and something to be respected. At least for me. This book has done more inside of me than any other. Not because of its flimsy characters or loose plot arrangement, but because of how it describes life with the poet's simplicity, and creates art from such a simple life."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Doctor Zhivago is a work of greatness. It paints a picture so vivid, so real, that you can't help but see it. Boris Pasternak's greatest work, Zhivago won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958. That he was forced by the Soviet Government to not accept that prize is just another testament to his writing. His life was filled with censure from the government, and he was looked down upon by his people. Doctor Zhivago was rejected by Soviet publishers as counter-revolutionary, and was subsequently smuggled out to Italy where it was originally published in the Russian language. It was not published in Russia until 1988.All this controversy could not have been generated by a lesser book. Pasternak's style of writing is one to provoke thought: rather than social issues running his characters, it was rather love, faith and destiny that did so. Social issues were considered by Pasternak to be important only in so far as they influence individual human destiny. This style can only be successful with the inclusion of powerful metaphors and intellectual conversations and thoughts; the author does all this and more.Doctor Zhivago takes place in Russia during the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the civil war that followed. This is a time of extreme poverty, and Dr. Yury Andreyevich Zhivago decides to move him and his family out of Moscow and into the country. It also follows the life of Larissa Fyodorovna Guishar (subsequently Antipova), another Moscow native who also finds herself in the country, away from the disease and destitution. The book covers the many chance (or destined) encounters these two characters have had over the years: a party in Moscow, serving together at the front (he as a doctor and she as a nurse) as well as meeting again in the small town of Yuryatin. Yury was an intelligent man. He was of course a doctor, and he was a writer as well (over 30 pages of poems written by him are included in this novel). He is a man of intense feeling, he sees things like we all would like to be able to see. He is highly philosophical, constantly pursuing the meaning of life (much, I suspect, like Pasternak himself). Lara, who becomes his mistress, does not see everything like he does. He loves her for that, and jumps at the chance to be able to recite poetry to her, to educate her in his version of life. But Lara is not stupid. She understands what the revolution means: &quot;Everything established, settled, everything to do with home and order and the common round, has crumbled into dust and been swept away in the general upheaval and reorganization of the whole of society. The whole human way of life has been destroyed and ruined.&quot; Yury and Lara try to shelter themselves from the turmoil going on around them in the civil war that followed the revolution. Yet through all this Yury still sees the beauty of life, the reasons for trying to hold on to a single moment, and to try and make this last. Doctor Zhivago is a great story. I love the feelings it portrays, the pictures it paints. Even being translated from Russian seems not to have hurt the artistry. The only weakness in the translation is that the poems at the end of the book are very choppy, and do not resemble poetry that much at all. Yet after reading the novel, I could feel nothing but gratitude to the translators, for making this masterpiece available to the English-speaking world. The novel leaves you with a feeling of sadness. Sadness not just for the characters, but also because Pasternak's life was much like Zhivago's. Forced to live in a place where his views were no longer accepted, Zhivago tries to remain pure, a symbol of artistic incorruptibility. Pasternak did the same, living out his days in an artist colony in disgrace. Pasternak summed up his life with a poem he wrote in 1959 entitled &quot;Nobel Prize&quot;, wherein he said: &quot;Am I a gangster or a murderer? Of what crime do I stand Condemned? I made the whole world weep At the beauty of my land.&quot; If you are trying to understand Soviet mentality, you should read this book. If you are trying to discover meaning for your life, read this book. If you are looking to read one of the greatest novels of this century, one that will leave you awestruck with it's imagery and enlightened by it's philosophy, then by all means read Doctor Zhivago."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Is it really a love story? Or is it political commentary about Russia in the time of the Revolution? People have argued about this for a long time.Well, actually its both.Its a love story set in Russia during the time of the Revolution.Breaking news! Pasternak is a good enough novelist to write poetically about both topics and he has intertwined them masterfully into a seamless whole.I don't think Pasternak wants us to separate the love story from the political commentary: the book is deliberately ambiguous.After all, isn't that life? Our personal affairs are hopelessly mixed up with the realities of world and community events. They cannot be separated. Our lives are shaped to a large extent, although not completely, by what happens in the wider world around us.But Dr Zhivago is much more than a period romance. Pasternak has also effectively written a sweeping and poetic travelog of his native country.So, its love story, political commentary, and travelog all rolled into one. Can you handle it?Sure you can. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I've been a fan of Pasternak the poet and human being for a long time. His poetry is beautiful, reflecting his deep love of nature and his native land, and I've always found it moving how in 1947 he befriended the then-fourteen-year-old poet Andrey Voznesenskiy after he sent him some of his poetry, mentoring him and treating him like his equal instead of a stupid kid who worshipped the ground he walked on. It's a shame I can't be as big an admirer of Pasternak as a novelist, though this book is a very commendable and admirable effort, and certainly isn't badly-written. The descriptions of nature, for example, are quite beautiful, and it's clear that he loved his native land and was devastated by what befell it following the Revolution.Pasternak was, first and foremost, a very talented and gifted poet, but it's painfully obvious that he didn't have an equal talent for prose. Maybe if he had written other novels his ability in that genre might have improved, but it remains quite obviously a first and only novel. Some of the metaphors, similes, and descriptions he uses are lovely, reflecting his talent as a poet, but some just sound and look laughable and embarrassing when in the form of prose. Some other mistakes are the ones other reviewers have also pointed out-way too much background information on minor characters, no real development of the supposed love story between Yuriy and Lara, let alone on why they got together, no closure of anything at the end, a mostly dead-end and pointless Epilogue and Conclusion (where interesting events begin to be developed but then peter off into nothingness since it's so close to the end there's no time to see them through to their conclusions), characters who disappear for hundreds of pages, too much telling and not enough showing, and way too many coincidences. It's embarrassing how many times Yuriy or someone else bumps back into someone whom we last saw hundreds of pages ago, a truly minor character in most cases, and that chance meeting years later contributes nothing to the plotline.When they finally get together properly, Yuriy spends more time writing poetry after Lara has fallen asleep than in bed with her, this woman he keeps running into for longer and more significant periods of time, whom he realised he was in love with right before he was kidnapped by the partisans who needed a doctor. I get absolutely no sense whatsoever of why these two fall in love, no sense of why they get together, no sense of them being in love period when they're finally a couple. Why do so many writers insist on having the characters fall into one another's arms with barely a word of explaining their feeling or motivations? There are no love scenes, sex scenes, sweet nothings, nothing that would clearly show them as being a couple madly in love and fated to have gotten together years after having first met.The book should have properly ended at the end of Chapter 15, sparing us the pointless Epilogue and Conclusion. Then I wouldn't have felt like \\"That's it?\\" at the real end of the book. We don't even find out what happens to Lara's daughter Katya, and for a man who was heartbroken while watching Lara and Katya's sleigh pass his field of vision twice in the night, knowing he'd never see them again, he sure doesn't act like it once he goes home. He doesn't go after his family in Paris, he doesn't try to find Lara, he enters a relationship with his childhood friend Marina! What is that all about?The best part of the book is when Yuriy, Lara, and their friends are all growing up, showing the two different worlds they came from, how Russia was before the Revolution. I still admire Pasternak both as a writer and a human being, but this book remains a nice story that could have been so much more realistic and convincing had it been written by someone with more experience at writing prose."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"After seeing &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; I had to read the book. Knowing the reputation of Pasternak and this novel I was expecting to be more entertained than when I saw the film. It was not so. Pasternak had a wonderful story to tell, but whole pages included descriptions of terrain and weather and such. The film was able to do this much better as these descriptions were important. It is a story which lends itself to the visual--hence the wonderful movie."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I had always wanted to read this book, when I did I was very disappointed.

I felt sorry for the entire Zhivago family. There were a few parts in the book that were good, but not many. If you want to have a good nap in the middle of the day read this book."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I've always considered myself a good reader. I mean, my favorite novel is by Victor Hugo, so it's not like I'm incapable of following wordy descriptions of city landmarks or numerous characters who are loosely connected. But Dr. Zhivago is the first novel where I've ever had to consult Spark Notes just to get a clue of what was going on.That said, I plodded through it and finally finished it, only for a terrible, anti-climactic ending. The problem, I believe, is with Lara. The author clearly wants us to root for Zhivago and Lara, but he does nothing to make the reader want to root for them. I hated Lara, I found Zhivago's love of her unbelievable; it was obvious as a plot device. They were made for each other because the author says so. Meanwhile, I loved Tonia, and didn't know why Zhivago just completely forgot about her after she went to Paris. I also don't know exactly why we're supposed to swoon over a pairing that basically hurts the lives of everyone involved and makes Zhivago abandon all of his responsibilities as a husband and father. If I liked the character until then, I assure you that my liking ceased when he was more concerned with pining over Lara than the welfare of his wife and children.As for its historical significance, it was good in that regard, but I think that We The Living by Ayn Rand (though obviously not regarded as a classic) presents a better picture of Soviet life. It has a better love story, too."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Great book, but if you really want to understand the plot, watch one of the (2 video) movies!!!"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This book was by far the hardest book I've ever had to read.

However, I could not get past 150 pages in the book before I threw it aside as not worth the immense effort. There were so many irrelevant characters being introduced, and then disappearing, never to be heard of again. And then there were so many incidents described that were just irrelevant to the story --silly narratives that I found inconsequential to the main action, which I knew quite well from the film. Lastly, the same characters were named in so many different ways, I found myself constantly confused. My favorite author is Trollope. He writes long novels, but all characters and all incidents are relevant and have meaning to the plot as a whole. Anyway ... I have given up on Dr. Zhivago and will have to be content with the 2 films!!"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I didn't like this book at all. The characters were all one-dimensional, more representations of ideals (Mother Russia in Lara; the old intelligentsia in Yuri; the Revolutionary Spirit in Lara's husband) than actual characters--and weakly written, at that.

How else can I explain that I found this NOBLE PRIZE WINNING VERY FAMOUS novel , absolutely boring. I think the main problem is that its often promoted as \\"one of the greatest love stories of all times\\". If you approach it with this in mind , you are going to be terribly disappointed. Zhivago and Lara, sorry to say, do not know even the basics of love. They get together somewhere in the middle of the book (without really falling in love), get seperated , meet again after another 100 pages, get seperated, meet again and finally get seperated one last time, never to see each other again. One never feels their joy or pain, mainly because they don't seem to feel it either. I always felt that if you loved someone, you'd do your best to be near that person. No such feelings here. They never seem to miss each other and don't seem vey thrilled when they're together.All he does is wait for her to fall asleep so he can get back to writing poetry ( and that too NOT about her)!!! Is this love ??? All that you expect from the agony and ecstasy of this beautiful emotion is missing here. Frankly this book would be have been as good or as bad without making them lovers or even friends. In between all this we have to put up with page after page of discourses on the Russian thoughts and their way of life during the revolution. That was what the author wanted to convey anyway. There is hardly any movement in the book and I died of boredom. Surprisingly, the movie was very good(it stuck to being a love story). The Russians did their countrymen a great favour by banning this book. My advise- avoid the book. See the movie.

Finally those who say that Lara and Yuri did not have a real love affair it is because the times that they lived in could not allow a true one to blossom. When people do not have food to eat or there survival is not guaranteed they do not worry about the more abstract principles of love.So to those of you who want to read a love story stick to the cheep paperbacks because this book is not for you.

WhenLara's mother is about to die, she is so afraid of dyingand \\"being forgotten,\\" he helps her feel better by explainingwhat he thinks of death.

As a result, althoughphysical death comes toward, if you are still remembered bysomeone, your soul is immortal and eternal.Besides, the death of Zhibago means a lot in the story. It isan unfair and indiscriminate destruction of a pure individualunder the revolution and sudden social changes. However,Zhibago is a doctor and poet at the same time.

Of course, some mayargue that Zhibago is too irresolute in choosing one love. Itis the situation and the society that make him indecisive. Heis not a warlike person like Strelnikov, but simply a neutralperson who doesn't want to go into action when somethinghappens and remains the same.

And, as ART this pretentious lecture is an utter flop. Also, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; is quintessentially monologic rather than dialogic, all important characters speaking with the same tiresome voice--Pasternak's. But don't take my word for it, consider the following, more weighty, evaluations:* &quot;Doctor Zhivago, a feeble production, though an important one.&quot; --Georgy Adamovich* &quot;The novel \`Doctor Zhivago'...is unworthy to stand beside Pasternak's own earlier work&quot; --Andrew Field* &quot;DOCTOR ZHIVAGO--which may brim with human interest but is wretched art and platitudinous thought.&quot; --Vladimir Nabokov* &quot;From this [artistic] point of view Zhivago is a sorry thing, clumsy, melodramatic, with stock situations and trite characters.&quot; --Vladimir Nabokov* &quot;[Doctor Zhivago is] flat, clumsy, labored, and embarrassingly crude.&quot; --Isaac Deutscher* &quot;Pasternak's novel [Doctor Zhivago] is evidently the work of a poet untrained in the disciplines of novel writing, impatient of all restraints, incapable of keeping his characters in exact focus, and strangely incompetent in his management of many of the episodes in the novel...&quot; --Robert PayneOne glaring shortcoming in the writing is its uniformly weak characterization, and Pasternak admitted this much himself. (Lara Guisher's ridiculous introduction as &quot;the purest being in the world,&quot; p.25, makes me cringe every time I read it.) Pasternak fancied himself a philosopher, and under the ponderous weight of Pasternak's dopey philosophy his characters become mere mouthpieces for his ideas. Forced by the pressure of his underlying doctrine, a dizzying parade of characters pop in, sputter out some philoso-babble, and then disappear. Ironically, for a writer who preached the primacy of the individual, Pasternak's characters appear as banal, paper-thin caricatures. Like all purveyors of didactic fiction, Pasternak's literary calculus is dominated by the equation &quot;character=idea,&quot; a proven artistic failure.The corncobby Zhivago is nothing more than a poorly disguised stand-in for Pasternak, whose inability to create a complex, original character, combined with his superficial attempts to dissociate himself from the bumbling doctor, left poor Zhivago without an identity--a common problem with self-indulgently autobiographical pseudo-fiction. Again, I'm not alone in my basic opinion:* &quot;[The characters] lack vitality, they are contrived.&quot; --Anna Akhmatova* &quot;The main figures aren't alive; they're made of cardboard, and the most cardboardy of the lot is Doctor Zhivago himself.&quot; --Lidiya Chukovskaya* &quot;Doctor Zhivago himself is neither a Zhivago nor a doctor: that is, he has done nothing to earn his surname (a variation of the Russian adjective \`zhivoy,' alive) because he is so lifeless...&quot; --Ronald HingleyThe narrative is another weakness. The mawkish evocations of love are so saccharine my eyes would roll like the tumblers in a slot machine. Worse still is Pasternak's propensity to tell the reader explicitly what to think of a given character (or, equivalently, idea) before he elaborates in journalistic fashion. Other passages are simply pathetic (e.g., &quot;...the man screamed, and with one great shudder he gave up the ghost,&quot; p. 118). The poetry may be excellent, but unfortunately poetry does not translate. The lines &quot;To be a woman is a great adventure; To drive men mad is a heroic thing&quot; from the poem &quot;Explanation&quot; are delightfully bad in any language, however.In &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; Pasternak's philosophy of life is not so much lived as it is ponderously pontificated in a tiresome series of &quot;impromptu lecture[s],&quot; &quot;wordy dissertation[s],&quot; and journal transcriptions. The actual ideas are mostly muddled and derivative, but who really cares? Literature (art in general) is not about advancing philosophical ideas, social or political causes, nor is it concerned with crypto-symbolic mumbo jumbo; philistines see art in this way. The artistic experience is always undermined by expositions of naked ideas and socio-political generalizations, which is why didactic fiction, in general, fails as art. (by the way, didactic novels are middlebrow rather than highbrow.)Everyone quoted above was, to my knowledge, an admirer of Pasternak's early poetry and some even found something of redeeming value in this book. Sure, there are a few--a very few--splendid passages which elevate &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; to the very top of the literary trash heap, but most of the book is so poorly executed that it serves best as a case study in bad literary technique. A novel should be judged as a whole--and here I differ with Pasternak's views on art which are inartistically reported in the book--all the constituent details and particulars orchestrated according to an original style so as to evoke a unique experience.

Truth and justice have finally prevailed. This book should be mandatary reading for young people all over the world."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I've never been to Russia, but poet Boris Pasternak made me feel as if I could see with my very own eyes the long beautiful snow covered hills of the country side and the beauty of Moscow before and still during the hardships of the Russian Revolution. The novel begins with Pasternak depriving the Zhivago family of their wealth and sets the reader up for the coming Revolution. The story of Doctor Zhivago to some is an unforgettable love story while to others the account of the consequences of the revolution with its crimes, starvation, epidemics and war.The poet/physician Doctor Zhivago, Yuri Andreievich, is the main character who the reader follows before and through the Revolution up to the end of the book. The reader also learns of Tonia, Lara and some other friends during the first chapters as Pasternak shows the different worlds they come from, explaining the different classes and hardships associated with them.Yuri who grows up in Moscow, with the Gromeko family, later marries their child Tonia. Lara marries Pavel Antipov, Pasha, who goes to war. Incidentally, Lara and Zhivago meet while in serving at the military sites with the wounded. After the war, Zhivago and his family move to the country side near the city of Yuriatin. The story continues as Zhivago, who is evidently madly in love with Lara meets with her in Yuriatin and they begin their affair. One day as he is returning back to Tonia, supposedly with the intentions of never seeing Lara again, he is kidnapped by the Partisans who keep him as their doctor during the Civil War.These are some of the events that occur during the course of the book, ones that are memorable but also ones that are hard to understand and get into. Boris Pasternak included many minor characters within his book, ones that seem almost insignificant to the actual plot and make the reader question their presence. Because of the little development and poor prose it is hard to become truly attached to any of the characters. He also has a tendency to include overly descriptive details at times.Many question the greatness of the love Zhivago really deemed to have had. If he really had that love for not only Tonia but Lara as well why did he approach the different situations in his life the way he did? This was one of the reasons you want to keep turning the pages to find out what happens to Zhivago, what he will do and how he will do it.That's not to say that the ending of the book does not bring some disappointment to the reader. It rather unfinished with the character development with the reader hoping Zhivago had approached his life differently so that the book could really end as a love story. However, the underlying theme next to the love are the individuals responses to the circumstances that are beyond the familiar experiences. Although Boris Pasternak used some philosophy that was a bit convoluted the book was fairly easy to understand. The hardships and crimes of the Russian Revolution, and the Civil War leave are distressing and moving.Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a classic, perhaps its being so broken apart and with so many different details, situations and characters makes it relatable to life. The fact that it is written by a poet can be seen with the beautiful poems and descriptions that leave one with a clear picture in their mind"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Boris Pasternak's, Doctor Zhivago, is not supposed to be a political or philosophical novel though it has both those components in it. It is not just a romance or a historical look at the Russian Revolution- though it has those things as well. Above all else, Doctor Zhivago is a statement on life. It outlines the journeys of intertwining lives through an amazing time period. In an entry from Zhivago's diary he explains that this telling of a human story is the essence of all art. Pasternak hints to readers that this is, in fact the inspiration of his work, \\"You can call it an idea, a statement about life, so all-embracing that it cant be split up into separate worlds; and if there is so much as a particle of it in any work that includes other things as well, it outweighs all the other ingredients in significance and turns out to be the essence, the heart and soul of the work.\\" (282). Pasternak shows readers through characters, themes, plot, and setting the intimate details of people's lives. He follows them from early life to death and from maturing philosophical ideals to basic getting by. This is the spirit of his work, his masterpiece, a beautifully written account of the fictional Yuri Zhivago's time on earth.Work CitedPasternak, Boris. Doctor Zhivago.

The art of tragedy that was so important to our understanding of our selves has been lost in contemporary literature. It is extremely healthy for humanity to be reminded of and critically reflect on tragedy, for it is in catastrophe that humanity reveals its primordial characteristics. Pasternak wonderfully explores this human tragedy by following the life of Yurii Zhivago through the calamity of the Russian revolution. It is a story of a man desperate to hold on to his loves as the world brutally tears them from his grasp. Through relentless misfortune Zhivago loses comfort, home, and love, left bare to confront his changing life but fervently clinging to his past, ripping his soul and dying of a broken heart.The disaster of Doctor Zhivago makes this novel a tragedy but it is tragedy's tendency not to suffocate humanity but to encourage its' best. Zhivago is survived by his three daughters; the promise of survival, they are the life that springs from tragedy; destined for futility but forever hopeful. Humanity harbors an incredible ability to endure tragedy, and in its grimmest state, not only to survive, but survive with hope. This hope, however foolish, preserves humanity and lets it continue stumbling not forwards, nor backwards, but simply stumbling on. Doctor Zhivago rekindles peoples' love of tragedy so civilization can retain a beautifully romantic faith in fortune's wheel."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Dr. Zhivago. What a book.Dr. Zhivago is, as has been said, truly a poet's novel. It's laced with similies, metaphors, and intense imagery, and it is more about how things come about than what comes about. It's a descriptive book, but surprisingly it's not as hard to get through as I expected (Russian literature being some of the dryest stuff around).I picked up the book after seeing both of the movies to get more of the story of Lara, Tonia, Yuri, Pasha, and Komarovsky. I wasn't disappointed -- Dr. Zhivago is a beautiful, moving book that is also disturbing. It is difficult to get through in a couple of places, but overall the chapters are short enough to keep the reader's interest.The book is about how the Russian Revolution changed the lives of the four characters Yurii, Lara, Pasha, and Tonia. It talks about what serving in the war was like and how it turned families upside-down and inside-out. Most importantly, it is about the wartime romance of Yurii and Lara, both of whom are married but are irresistably drawn to each other.My only quarrel with the book was in the last chapter and epilogue, neither of which, I felt, added anything to the novel. Honestly (sacreligious though it sounds) I would advise readers to stop before the conclusion chapter. Thinking back on the book I think more of the frustrations of the last chapter than of the preceding chapters, all of which I loved. The ending introduces random plot threads that it fails to effectively wrap up, introduces questions rather than resolving them, and is basically the story of how one character ends his life in relative misery. Also -- why Marina? Why?Overall, however, Dr. Zhivago is a beautiful book that should (and, as importantly, can) be read by anyone with a love for poetry and good literature."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This is a great book that illustrates the Russian Revolution, the war between the Reds and Whites across the countryside, partisans, social situation before, shortly after, and decades after the revolution, and even World War II, with short descriptions on gulags. This book evokes a lot of grief from the reader. I am typically a fan of Steinbeck, so I generally like this style and was not disappointed by this book. A fairly good sized portion of the book focuses on Yurii Zhivago's romance life, which was not as interesting as the other sections, but this did not take away from my enjoyment of the novel. The Pantheon Books edition is excellent, with footnotes that clarify details. In summary, this is a great book that, although difficult with its large cast of characters, is an excellent work that should be included in every school reading list."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"One of the biggest difficulties a western reader have to overcome when he/she starts reading Boris Pasternak's \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is to stop trying to figure out how to pronounce those giant strange Russian names and focus on the narrative. Once that is done, the reader has reached half way to succed in reading this book.Sure the big and unusual names are not the most difficult part of this novel of epic proportions, but when one stops worrying about them, things smooth over. Those Russian names are beautiful, but very difficult to imagine how to pronounce them, and we have a tendency of wanting to pronounce everything --even if it is inside our minds. Forget the names.Names issue aside, \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is a great book --in more than one sense-- telling the story of love, war and revolution. It is possible to argue that Zhivago and Lara's love story is the central spine of the narrative, while the war and revolution work as background. This concept is too reductive, once both war and revolution have main role in bringing the couple together and them apart.The three issues are what conduce the narrative. Of course the reader has the expectation of seeing the two lovers interacting together, but they spend so much apart from each other that it is impossible not to start to follow attentively the war and then the revolution. These three aspects take turn in the major focus of the action. And this is one of the aspects that make this novel so multi layered. One can find love, adventure, political ideas and a portrait of life in Russia in the period before and right after the revolution, not to mention, the portrait of the human existence that is in the whole book.The characters are very well developed and human. The unfolding of the action takes time, and this why the novel may seem to be slow going at times. It is not a fault, but actually Pasternak's style. Contemporary readers may be annoyed, but not the ones who care beautiful and deep narratives. This aspect reminded me of Charles Frazier's \\"Cold Mountain\\".To sum up, \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" is a very beautiful book, highly recommended. Its story may please those who like adventures, those who prefer love, and those who enjoy political dramas alike."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Actually, making that comment insults Pasternak beyond belief. While DZ is sometimes fantastically rich in its imagery, it rarely evokes much emotion for the contrived characters; (...) I have never read a more beautiful nature description than the &quot;spring passage&quot; in all of Russian literature this century. Pasternak is obviously a talented writer, but the long treatises on the place of Jews, the messages of Jesus (and so on and so forth), are just forced and too abstractly intellectual to take a natural place in any prose, much less a text which is already sorely lacking in 'real' people in the first place. A great book, but falling far short on certain fronts."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"The banning of &quot;Dr Zhivago&quot; in the USSR because of the main character's ambiguity towards the Russian Revolution - the Doctor was not actually against it - made this book a useful example of the absurd lengths the Kremlin was willing to go to impose censorship. Its reception made it a useful teaching tool in the West to help people understand this aspect of the Soviet Union. Unfortunately it got so overpraised during the Cold War that the weaknesses of the plot and the often pedestrian writing tend to shock those readers expecting another Tolstoy or Dostoevsky. Writers like Nabokov and Graham Greene tried to offer some sensible criticism at the time, about this novel, as literature, and their comments are worth looking up. Even today in Russia Pasternak is still revered for his poetry rather than this novel.I remember as a Soviet Studies student in college (1980's), &quot;Dr Zhivago&quot; was always assigned in the History of Russia classes, not the Russian Literature courses. For literature we read (and thoroughly enjoyed) &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; by Bulgakov. This darkly ironic satire of Stalin's pre-war Russia also works as a universal novel, a commentary on life that any sensitive reader can enjoy (I recommend Mira Ginsburg's funny, lyrical translation published by Grove Press - I've read it six or seven times). Bulgakov finished the book in 1940, when he died, and it sat in a draw until published in the 60's. Readers may also wish to try the short stories of Zoshchenko and the poetry of Anna Akhmatova, for some real 20th century Russian literature that can stand the test of time, not just the duration of the cold war.There ARE enjoyable passages in the book, but after a while the poor conception and execution of the novel as a structure become apparent. I agree with the other reviewers who have noticed this. Keep an eye out for the reference to Stalin as a &quot;pock-marked Caligula,&quot; and the single reference to Leon Trostky as &quot;Lyobochka,&quot; both very daring at the time (they show how far we have come, too, since 1991)."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"\\"It's only in bad novels that people are divided into two camps and have nothing to do with each other. In real life everything gets mixed up! Don't you think you'd have to be a hopeless nonentity to play only one role all your life, to have only one place in society, always to stand for the same thing?--Ah, there you are!\\"- Larissa Fyodorovna in Doctor Zhivago.Every single character has a unique story in this book. Just like real life. And there are many characters here of course. But it never gets confusing. Because their lives are intertwined - just like ours with the people who come in and out of our life events. This is a novel of epic proportions. It discusses not just love or war or pain or joy but everything else - including - philosophy, poetry, religion, man's motivations, governance, sheep mentality of the masses, leadership, virtue, etc.It starts with a funeral and ends with a funeral. All the tales in between bring these lives together in a cohesion of passion and longing. Is there something called destiny? Is there fate or chance or luck? The way the lives of these characters get connected and meet at strange occasions to add or subtract from their emotions - it is spellbinding and at the same time makes us question our own past and present. Because these are normal everyday people like us - in a different time and place - yet so much similar to our choices and ambitions and motives. Set in Russia, yet so close to humanity's basic nature that any reader anywhere in the world can relate to these characters and their troubled lives.Lara is clearly the most intriguing and fascinating character in the book. Steals the show from the title character Doctor Zhivago. The good doctor's wife Tonya is also well constructed and so are the friends and relatives who help them and carry them from one fateful event to the next.The climax is heartbreaking. This is a tragedy story rather than a romance story. As should be guessed by the title of the book. More a Hamlet than a Romeo-Juliet. But you will walk away with satisfaction and having witnessed not one or two or three but several significant lives unfold and change and evolve as the novel progresses.An enjoyable read. They say the original Russian prose is the most wonderful to read and no translation can match it. Well, I read the English translation by Max Hayward and Manya Harari and was very much impressed by their attention to detail and slang and colloquial words. Some of the translated poems are also done with much effort and perfect in English even though they are actually translations.Do take time to sit with this and ponder. It should make you think as all good epic literature does. Its not a paperback thriller. It is an era and life spoken of in great detail and passion."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Yuri Zhivago is a budding poet and physician married to his wife Tonya who he had a child named Sasha with. Larisa Feodorovna is a nurse and Yuri's lover who he meets at various points of his life. She is married to her husband Pasha, later Strelnikov, who becomes a Communist officer. The main conflict is the societal pressures from the newly risen government that make Yuri and his family and Lara and her family flee to survive. Yuri must also choose between his wife Tonya and Lara. The novel starts with a young Yuri Zhivago at his mother's funeral, greeted by his heavily despised arch nemesis Komarovsky, who caused his father to commit suicide. His life is then explored from his personal accolades like his marriage, his children, and his affair with Lara to events he was present at like the October Revolution, World War I, and the fighting between the government and the partisans. One such event is when Lara and Yuri meet at the Sventitiskys' Christmas party. They did not meet on the most amicable terms since Lara tried to shoot Komarovsky with a revolver for causing her mother to try and commit suicide. Though the circumstances were grim, they were able to remember each other amidst the confusion. Another event takes place years later in Varykino where Komarovsky takes Lara and her daughter away from Yuri. Komarovsky does this by blackmailing Yuri by stating that the police are looking for him and he will only keep Lara safe.There were some aspects of the book I loved and abhorred. One negative aspect would be that the novel was translated from Russian and it was written long ago because the vocabulary is often dated and challenging as well as the syntax is not as fluid as a book written in English. A positive aspect would be the level of Boris Pasternak's storytelling is far superior to many other. He can easily convey the feelings of the two star-crossed lovers during a difficult time in their lives. His ability to show the hardship that everyone in the story faced shows the political undertone that he was trying to convey and the oppression that many people felt. Lastly, the novel was an enjoyable read because of Pasternak's vivid descriptions of the setting. As the story took place it was very easy to picture all the events in the story and how the protagonist and his companions felt about it."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This is an excellent story!!

While not legally available in Russia until 1988, Pasternak won the Nobel Prize (which he declined to receive) very soon after its publication in Italy, in 1957. Its high-critical appeal rests primarily in its myriad stylistic developments and lyrical descriptions. On the surface, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; may seem like a realist story in the Dostoyevsky-Tolstoy tradition, the story of Zhivago, a poet and physician, beautiful Lara Guishar, and their love for each other, in the tumultuous times of World War I and the Russian Revolution. However, the novel is much more than that. Pasternak, we must remember, was primarly a poet, and, indeed, &quot;Docotor Zhivago&quot; is a poet's novel, for it is lyrical, musical, and enchanting as beautiful poetry. The novel seeks to redefine man's place in the cosmos, and boldly says that man is not above nature, rather part of nature. That a young boy may feel the same longing a wolf cub does when its mother has died serves to illustrate this point. Unlike many modern novels that thrash away at religion and folklore, this novel seeks to encompass them, redefining convincingly what is lasting and important in life. At one point Zhivago says, 'Man was born to live, not to prepare for life' and Zhivago (like Pasternak in real life) finds a way to lead a rich and full life in the repressive Soviet society. We can compare &quot;Docotor Zhivago&quot; to the style of D. H. Lawrence, while its rich use of simile is reminiscent of Bruno Schulz's &quot;Streets of Crocodiles.&quot; &quot;Docotor Zhivago&quot; is sad, somber, and beautiful, but above all it is an epic. While the innumerable coincidences and long nature descriptions may give trouble to some, most seriour readers will find their hearts throb and ask themselves again and again through its pages, &quot;Is it as good as I think it is?&quot;"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"The greatest Russian novels capture life, and Pasternak does so quite eloquently with Doctor Zhivago. The novel entices and lures with its imagery, which operates on realistic and emotional levels. The details offer verisimilitude and the poetic creates visions and subconscious associations. The revolution provides the framework for life and art. The life force and principle of individuality is manifest in Zhivago. The vagaries of time are like a fairy tale, but this unrealistic quality is actually the ingredient that begets believability. The unpredictability of life, the surprise, chance and our subsequent reaction is what defines the human experience and journey of the soul. The love between Lara and Zhivago is primordial, fundamental, natural and is suppressed in the amoral, duplicitous revolutionary era. Yet, there is hope for Russia and the individual due to the act of creation, both in progeny and art ~ the gifts and celebration of life."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"It probably didn't help that I had a lousy translation of an otherwise good novel. Brothers Karamazov was undoubtedly a denser book, but I had a great translation, which made for a more pleasant experience.This may be a difficult story for 21st-century Americans, who expect highly character-driven stories. Which is ironic, considering the book was banned in Russia because Zhivago was too MUCH of an individual rather than a supportive symbol of Soviet ideology.Though certainly much of current popular fiction uses the characters as nothing more than ideological pawns. Jodi Picoult, for example, despite her juvenile and atrocious writing, rarely gets criticized for doing much the same thing as Pasternak or Upton Sinclair.I think it could be hard to really understand Zhivago because his journey is so much the opposite of ours. The American story is one of self-reinvention, which Yuri spends the entire novel resisting. I can appreciate it, but realize I'm never going resonate with it the way I can with, say, Mark Twain.So, at least compared to someone like Picoult on the one hand or Sinclair on the other, I didn't see the characters as too much of a vehicle for Pasternak's politics, even though it couldn't be the same story without the revolution happening around them.Maybe that's the difference. While I wish Picoult would just shut up and write an editorial rather than badly-written, thinly-veiled allegories, Zhivago balanced telling the story first, but in a way that's inextricable from the larger events the characters are placed in.He was certainly critical of the Soviets and it shows, but the love story overshadows it. But, then, did we really need Pasternak to tell us the Russian Revolution was a Bad Thing? I was probably able to get into the love story, in no small part, because the politics weren't telling me anything I didn't already know.It's saying something much different now than it was at the height of the Cold War...and yet the story continues to resonate. I gotta chalk that up to the Yuri and Lara love story.And maybe the poetry, which my translation didn't slaughter as badly as the prose. I've heard the pastoral scenes are supposed to be some of the best parts of the novel, but I found them torturous and, admittedly, started to skim.And what about Lara? Dr. Zhivago is usually discussed as a story about Yuri - right down to the title, of course. But I felt Lara was the more complex of the two. In part because she actually loves both Yuri and Pasha while Yuri stays with Tonya more out of duty or friendship."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"A complex, stirring book that hits the reader on a multitude of levels, -Doctor Zhivago- achieves for Boris Pasternak the true desire of an author--to give an insight on the world we live in and the people that populate it, to express lessons and morals discovered by the author (in his perspective) and painstakingly exact them from the gray matter to paper. * Russian life and russian struggle is the theme of Pasternak's masterpiece; he tells the story of the russian revolution through not only his central protagonists but also through a myriad of random charicters that flitter in and out of his vivid, sometimes hallucinary prose. At times this is distracting, espicially with the long and difficult to pronounce names, but as a whole it creates a vision of a time and society that no longer exists except in tomes such as this. * In fact, the names are the only reason I do not award this book a full rating of five: in the version I read the charicters were named at times by their first, later by their last, in seemingly random order, which grew confusing. * Other than that, Doctor Zhivago is a rich and rewarding text worth reading."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Doctor Zhivago is an important and courageous chronical of the events, opinions, and atmosphere during the Russian Revolution. The settings are vividly depicted, a broad spectrum of attitudes are recorded, and the basic story is good. Unfortunately, judged as a literary work -- as art -- Doctor Zhivago is really quite bad.Doctor Zhivago is painfully uninvolving: it evokes almost no emotion and stimulates little interest in the characters. The choice of Zhivago as protagonist is unfortunate as he is the dullest and weakest character of the story. Larisa attaches to Zhivago an elevated &quot;air of...freedom and unconcern&quot; but he is more accurately characterized as submissive and uninspired. Zhivago meanders zombie-like through the extraordinary events that unfold in his life without serious contemplation or introspection. The only time I found Zhivago compelling was when he wrote poetry.Zhivago is sometimes refered to by critics as &quot;spiritual&quot; but this is a gross misreading of the character. While Zhivago is not pedantically intellectual, he is aesthetic and light rather than spiritual. Zhivago lacks the requisite moral development, conviction, and seriousness to be considered spiritual. Zhivago is spiritual like a hippie is spiritual -- that is to say, he is precisely the opposite.This book is NOT a love story. While the women in Zhivago's life may have loved him, Zhivago skulks around unencumbered by anything so sublime and powerful as love. His relations are as maudlin and shallow as a prepubescent crush. When a relationship becomes inconvenient he abandons the object of his affection and his efforts to reunite are &quot;lukewarm and half-hearted.&quot; Larisa and Strelnikov (Pasha) love each other but their love is never consummated. Tonia loves Zhivago; Marina loves Zhivago; Zhivago is too busy waxing poetic while gawking at puddles, frost, and clouds to be involved.While Tonia and Strelnikov are more interesting characters, a different choice of protagonist would not help. The fact is that Pasternak is not a gifted writer of prose. He is unable to get inside a character; instead he hovers around at a distance and, with inhuman detachment, simply recounts events. (A great deal of the meaningful dialog is unnatural speeching.) Pasternak violates a simple rule of good fiction -- show, don't tell -- with disastrous results.Some of the passages in this book are ineffectual or just plain silly. Consider these analogies: &quot;the leafless branches of a wood are thin and poor, like the hairs on an old man's wart&quot; (ugh!) and &quot;Something like the theory of relativity governing the hippodrome of life occured to him, but he became confused....&quot; He was not alone. The more vivid and sometimes poetic descriptions seem overwrought and ponderous when they cannot overcome such glaring and sometimes unintentionally comical weaknesses in the writing.I shudder to think of the thousands of readers for whom this over-hyped scribbling was an introduction to Russian literature. It is a poor example."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I was looking for the ORIGINAL western version.

Its presence and its absence, whether subtle or manifest, are interwoven throughout both the prose text and the poems. Without discerning and appreciating the candle symbolism, we remain light-years removed from any worthy comprehension of Doctor Zhivago. Indeed, this likewise applies to the other primary symbol, the TRAIN.Though it would seem inviting to make comparisons and contrasts with various great Russian novels of the past (or more recent acclaimed 20th century novels), such approaches are abysmally misguided and ultimately futile. Declining imitation of the timeworn novelistic genre, Pasternak is intent upon introducing a radically new, quintessentially dialogical genre, if you will!As for the movie, admittedly the David Lean/Robert Bolt romantic portrayal of Yurii's and Lara's epochal ordeal is captivating and occasionally provocative. Be that as it may, the cinematic rendering of Pasternak's original text insufficiently conveys any true sense for the relevant symbolism and, consequently, fails to penetrate the meaning-filled essence of this incomparable masterpiece.So, by entering a wondrous realm of sweeping philosophical dimension (pointedly purged of psychologizing), a vast, meditative realm regarding elemental human relations in light of history, art, religion, politics -- yes, life in general and particular! -- Doctor Zhivago, in all its symbol-filled, non-imitative radiance, affords boundless, abiding inspiration in our times of change and plenty"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This novel portraying the young Doctor Zhivago covers with beautiful accuracy and simplicity the many events of the Russian Revolution and its consequences in the eyes of a cast of different characters, whose intertwined lives are all affected by the political changes, some more than others.

This deeply philosophical quotation is from, of all things, a love story: Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak. This book was written in the late 1950s in the USSR when the Cold War was beginning and was outlawed by the Soviets because the government thought that the book supported anti-Communist views. It is a story with an intricate plot, being not only a love story, but a history book and a philosophy tome also.Though Doctor Zhivago has many subplots, it is not necessarily for everyone. One reviewer says that it is a tad too episodic, and is more of a respected historical fiction book than as a compelling novel (brothersjudd). It is also mentioned as being a political book, but reviews disagree about Pasternak's political views. One reviewer believes that the story is first anti-Communist, as it discusses the destruction of art, then becomes Communist towards the end, when Yurii is optimistic that the change brought by the Soviets will still do good for everyone (brothersjudd). Another reviewer thinks that labeling the story as either party is silly; the book's message is that there is a part of man that politics cannot affect, keeping out politics entirely (The Reporter). This same reviewer wrote that Boris Pasternak is merely writing down an account of the important phase in Russian history that he went through (The Reporter). Obviously, there is more than one level to judge this book on.Everyone can decide what he or she thinks, but I believe that Doctor Zhivago is not a great novel, but has good attributes. One of these parts is definitely politics. While I can agree with the message as interpreted by one reviewer, I think the book is still political because of the many discussions throughout the book and the horrors experienced or witnessed in the book due to the heartless Soviets. I see it as being mostly anti-Communist, as it describes Soviet exploits in a negative light. Yurii gets parts of his life and his family taken away because of the Soviets, which is horrible. Also, the book has many statements that I could not understand because their meanings were obscure or the people referred to had unrecognizable, not to mention unpronounceable, names. A college philosophy or religion class would be capable of discerning the philosophies, but others cannot. As a whole, I have to agree with the comment that the book is to be respected and that it is important historically, but not that it is casual reading material.Doctor Zhivago is very complex and works on many levels, just as a great novel should. In its heyday, it was a compelling novel; now, just a classic epic and the best history book I have ever read. However, I have no inclination to read it again until college at the very least. Complex novels are usually the most interesting, but not when they are confusing and too descriptive of unnecessary details, thoughts, and people.Kate SandersExcerpts of book review selected by classmates as the \\"Best in the Class\\"in 9th hour Pre IB World History, Valparaiso High School, Indiana"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"My rating of Doctor Zhivago is average (2.5 stars is more accurate) because that is what its extreme highs and very low lows average out to. This book is strange in that there was a great deal to like about it and just as much (if not a bit more) to dislike.Doctor Zhivago is the sweeping story of a network of people living through revolutionary-era Russia. The main characters, Yurii Andreievich Zhivago and Lara Fedoronova, go in and out of each other's lives throughout the tale. Actually, all the characters go in and out of all the other characters' lives throughout the novel; that everyone is connected and meaningful to each other is a chief theme of the book. We follow Yurii and Lara through the turn of the 20th century and the Revolution of 1905, World War One, through both Revolutions of 1917 (February and October), and The Russian Civil War. They suffer horrible misfortunes like so many in the hectic period and search for some remnant of the beauty and simplicity they expected from life.The best thing Doctor Zhivago has going for it is its epic plot. Pasternak expertly weaves together the lives of about a dozen important characters and many more less important ones. Their interactions and the situations in which they run into each other during the turmoil of early 20th century Russia can be very moving at times. The array of lifelike characters Pasternak populates his novel with are also expertly created and fleshed out. Lastly, the theme of inter-connectivity is a thoughtful one, and is perhaps a clever comment on collectivism itself.Now the bad news: almost as tragic as the story itself is the wretched translation to English by Hayward and Harari that makes several parts of the book almost unreadable. It's shocking to me that a novel that is so loved the world over a.) has any English-speaking fans at all, and b.) has never been translated into English by anyone else. The dialogue in particular is cringe-worthy at times; many of the conversations between Zhivago and Lara (the great lovers of the story) manage to be melodramatic and robotically stiff at the same time. Since I can't read Russian and therefore can't compare the English version to the original, I supposed it's entirely possible that Pasternak is just THAT bad of a writer and the translation is not at fault, but I find it hard to believe it would have won a Nobel Peace Prize if that were the case. As good of a tragic love story as Pasternak has to tell, it is almost completely obscured by the writing.Just as its very good and very bad qualities pull the unsuspecting reader of Pasternak's opus in two directions, I'm equally torn as to whether I can say that I recommend this novel. If you can totally overlook the writing in general and come up with better words to put into Yurii and Lara's mouths as you read, go for it. If you're not looking for that much work in a novel, skip it. Better yet, find someone who speaks Russian and English who can actually write and pay him or her handsomely to come up with a better translation for you."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Many great things can and have been said about Doctor Zhivago, but the greatest, simplest, and truest is that it is the twentieth century War and Peace. Like that mammoth, it is an epic tale of diverse, interrelated characters and conflicted loves against the backdrop of a crucial Russian history period -- just before the Revolution until just after World War II. It is perhaps the masterpiece of twentieth century Russian literature and one of the century's best novels.Few works have greater historical value. Doctor covers about thirty years, much of it in great detail. We get an astonishingly intimate glimpse of Russian life on the Revolution's eve, vividly showing why reform was necessary. The depiction of its enactment and aftermath is just as unforgettable - virtually an inside look at one of the twentieth century's most transformative events, including many ugly sides that the Soviets did not want known. This gave Doctor much notoriety, including being banned in its own country, and Pasternak may have had reform at least partly in mind, but his main intent was surely realism. The same determination to say the truth underlies the whole, giving a profound glimpse of what it was like to live in this important time and place. Anyone at all curious about it can easily learn as much here as in any history book.Doctor would be valuable for this alone but of course has far more. The book certainly would not have achieved mass appeal without its many fascinating characters. It has a large cast, and those unfamiliar with Russian name conventions will almost certainly need a list. Even so, the book is never even remotely boring because the cast is so varied and intriguing. The title hero is one of the century's most representative characters, epitomizing his time while pointing forward. Though far from perfect, he is in many ways admirable and thoroughly interesting and, above all, fully human. This last, so important in realism, is true of all the characters; fully believable, they seem truly alive in a way few characters do. We identify with them, whether they are sympathetic or not, because they think and act like real people, i.e., they are often complex, convoluted, or even contradictory. Their great diversity seemingly encompasses nearly all of humanity, showing Pasternak's great range.The novel certainly would not be what it is without this essential human element, which lends universality, while the setting makes it distinctly twentieth century. However, many factors gloriously recall the great nineteenth century Russian novels, specifically lengthy dialogue that philosophically probes theological, political, and artistic issues. This is a fundamental part of the book -- and Russian literature generally -- and unfortunately the kind of thing that adaptations nearly always drop. Many who love the general story may not know just how much they are missing. Classic Russian literature fans must have been overjoyed by Doctor's 1954 publication, likely having concluded long before that such works were forever gone. Current readers are less prone to appreciate such things because they are now anathema, but they are in many ways the book's heart. They explore, more overtly and in some ways more profoundly, issues examined dramatically in the action. Perhaps most important is Pasternak's apparent agreement with War's central rejection of the Great Man Theory of history. Like Tolstoy, he seems to believe great changes are the sum of the masses acting independently. Here is where his extensive use of coincidence becomes important. Doctor abounds in unlikely coincidences but not the kind that unskilled writers rely on for plots. His point is that ostensibly unconnected lives are intimately intertwined, and that small interactions, even seemingly random ones, snowball to create great change. It is an ambitious point, but he pulls it off masterfully, as with the rest of the book.All told, Doctor is essential for anyone even remotely interested in Russian literature and highly recommended for those at all intrigued by twentieth century literature or history generally."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"My favorite book of all time!!!

In medical school, one of his professors reminds him that bacteria may be beautiful under the microscope, but do ugly things to people.

A large theme of the book is how the mysticism of things and idealism is destroyed by both the Bolsheviks and the white army."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"...a stellar translation and the only one to buy. Most cross-linguistic clumsiness is eliminated, leaving only the text's raw grace."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This book truly does take on multiple genres. It is an adventure story about a man's quest through the trials and tribulations of the Russian revolution. It is also a political novel in that it comments on those very events going on around that individual, Yuri Zhivago. It is also and primarily a romantic novel about the loves and lives of various individuals caught up in an extremely tumultuous time and waht effects those events and preceedings have on their very souls.This novel is as well written as many classic Russian novels are, and is even more of an interesting read to someone who is familiar with those works. There are references constantly to Dostoevsky, Pushkin and the like. The novel builds on all of those authors and shows how those authors have truly influenced the lives of the characters.Another interesting aspect of this novel is that Boris Pasternak seems to have truly taken on his alternate persona of Yuri Zhivago when writing this novel. Though written in third person you often get the idea that this novel is actually being written by Yuri about the world around him. This idea is further entrenched by the collection of poems at the rear supposedly written by the good doctor himself.The style of this novel is that of an excellent piece of poetry. It does what so much great russian literature does, which is to combine philosophy and deep thinking about the world with a lovely poetic description. This novel can speak to you on many levels, it can make you think deep thoughts, or you can simply let it carry you away on a tide of emotions. The choice is up to you but either way do not pass this novel up."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Without intending to stereotype an entire nation, I don't think I'd be wrong to say that the Russian people seem to have a profound gift for literature. Many of the world's great writers were Russian: Tolstoy, Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Pushkin, Gogol, and countless others. These masters have created timeless works addressing universal issues. In Doctor Zhivago, Pasternak has created the definitive Russian epic of the 20th Century, and in doing so joins this impressive list of literary lions.Without going into too much detail, the story traces the lives of Yuri Zhivago and Lara Guishar during the time of the Russian Revolution. The paths of these two exceptionally believable and distinctive characters cross from time to time, and their attraction towards one another is palpable. While this book is many things, it is also a love story, and so it comes as no surprise when the two stories become one.The various qualities that make this novel so impressive are too many to list, but I will list some of the more notable points: the story helps to shed light on one of the most momentous political and social events in history (the ousting of the Tzar by the Bolsheviks through a series of revolutions), and goes a long way in explaining the effects of this political upheaval on the Russian people; while the story is a sprawling epic in the tradition of Charles Dickens, the characters are much more well-rounded and believable than those in most of Dickens's novels; Pasternak graces this book with some of the most beautiful passages in the history of literature (many of which describe the Russian landscape). This novel is at times mysterious, harrowing, uplifting, eye-opening, and introspective, and it goes farther in emotionally overwhelming the reader than most great works of literature.The difficulties I had with Doctor Zhivago were small, but difficulties nonetheless. I found it irksome that Pasternak took the time to introduce us to so many relatively insignificant characters, giving us not only their names and descriptions, but their histories and ancestry. I was also bothered by the abundance of coincidences in the story. Everytime Zhivago ran into someone (even if he was thousands of miles into Siberia), it was a character he (and we) had previously encountered. One or two such incidents would be mildly ironic... forty or fifty start to stretch the limits of plausibility.Despite these minor flaws, this book is breathtaking. It is the story of a butterfly-like individual who attempts to survive a thunderous storm of a revolution. You do not need any knowledge of Russian history to appreciate this epic story. All you need is a little imagination, and a lot of time (the book is about 550 pages)."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Man is born to live, not to prepare for life. Life itself, the phenomenon of life, the gift of life, is so breathtakingly serious! -Boris PasternakMost of us are only familiar with Doctor Zhivago from the epic David Lean film version (indeed this is one of the books I come across most frequently at book sales, almost always unread). The movie is beautiful but strangely inert, has a somewhat disjointed narrative and conveys no clear philosophical message--flaws which I always assumed were a function of the difficulty of converting a Russian novel to film and the inexplicable casting of two really awful actors (Omar Sharif &amp; Julie Christie) in the lead roles. But now, having reread the novel, it seems to me that these weaknesses are inherent in the novel. Just as Lean seemed most interested in the story as a vehicle for presenting cinematic images, the real life in Pasternak comes less from the narrative itself than from the poetry that Zhivago produces. And the message of the novel, assuming that there is one, is presented awfully subtly.Zhivago himself, the name means &quot;life&quot; in Russian, is a pretty docile leading man. The story follows him as he is buffeted by the winds of change in Russia from 1903 to his death sometime after WWII. We can take at least a twofold message from the novel. Pasternak seems first of all to be speaking out, however obliquely, against a system which denies life and destroys artists, as the Soviet regime had. However, he also seems to be saying that the artist is relatively helpless against the tides of history. It is ironic in light of this that Pasternak became such a cause celebre. A good deal of this novel's reputation surely rests on the Western reaction to Soviet efforts to quash it. Perhaps I've simply lost the ability to read between the lines of samizdat, but I thought the condemnation of Communist Russia in the book was exceedingly mild, almost too much so. And there is one section in particular, right at the end of the book, where Pasternak waxes optimistically over how the nation may be entering a period of renewed freedom now that the war has been won. This kind of wishful thinking comes across as incredibly naive. I guess I too will have to fall back on the reaction that the novel provoked and assumed that even such feathery criticism as the book contains was important in crystallizing opposition to the regime.But Doctor Zhivago is understood to be semi autobiographical and to the extent that Zhivago is acted upon rather than acting himself, perhaps he is intended to convey Pasternak's own ambivalence about the role he had played by remaining in Soviet Union and continuing to work. Indeed, there is a really poignant moment in Isaiah Berlin's piece on the author, where Pasternak, near desperation, seeks to solicit Berlin's opinion on whether people believe that he has collaborated with the government because he remained in the USSR or whether they instead accept that he felt compelled to stay. In fairness to Pasternak, it should not be necessary to leave a country (as did Solzhenitsyn) or be disappeared (as was Isaac Babel) or be imprisoned (as were countless others) in order to demonstrate the legitimacy of your opposition to an evil government.To be honest, the subtlety of Pasternak's message and our increasing distance from the time when even such subtleties could prove incendiary, served to deaden the effect of a novel which already suffers from being a tad too episodic. In the final analysis, I guess I respected the book more than enjoyed it and found it more interesting as a key artifact of an age that is quickly receding from memory than compelling as a novel.GRADE: B-"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This book may be confusing, but the author never intended this to be a straightforward novel about life...he was indeed trying to capure life in all it's spontaneity with imperfect characters amid the turmoil of the Russian Revolution...Pasternak is not attempting to paint a full canvas here but providing us with sketches that try to capture scenes from life much the way poetry does...there is something almost mystical about the book...certian details about the passing world described around the endearing yet weak characters...I also recommend &quot;My Sister Life&quot; which is a collection of Pasternak's poems...which will show you that perhaps Pasternak is at heart a poet...who wrote this remarkable book"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Certain books give rise to the speculation that they are more famous than read. Everybody knows that they changed literature for good, or took part in some great historical movement as if they were human beings, or simply inspired a classic movie, but no one bothers to read them. It's as if they have become such a part of life that we think we already know them well. \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" is like that.Someone must be reading it, because it's still in print after all this time, but I find myself wondering if most people know the story other than that it's about a Russian doctor and his mistress fleeing from the Russian revolution, that David Lean's movie version starred Omar Sharif and Julie Christie, and that you still hear \\"Lara's Theme\\" on the department store piped-in music occasionally. There's a lot more to it than that, of course.Let's get the historic material out of the way first - this novel did not see publication in Russia until the 1980s, which ought to tell you something about its attitude toward the Soviet system (or maybe the Soviet system's attitude toward the novel, which we'll get to in a moment). Within Russia, Boris Pasternak's reputation rested primarily on his poetry. Don't be misled, however; neither Pasternak nor his character Yuri Zhivago were anti-Communist. Anti-Soviet, maybe, but that's a very different matter.Today's readers may be surprised to learn that Zhivago starts the book decidedly in favor of the Marxist takeover of his country. Like a lot of his friends, including his wife, he is prepared to face suffering and hardship because he believes in the movement of history in Russia, and that it will shortly lead to justice and peace for all. It doesn't take him long to become disillusioned, not so much on political or even humanistic grounds, but on aesthetic ones. He's a poet, as well as a medical doctor, and objects to the discarding of human life in favor of a bunch of slogans. Even his own conscription by the Red Army doesn't seem to bother him so much for his own sake as because it rejects the beauty of life, not to mention the suffering it brings to his family. So he's a humanist, but of a special kind.Like his protagonist, Pasternak was primarily a poet, and even in translation there's a good bit of poetry to his style. (That's not even counting the collection of \\"Zhivago's\\" poems at the end.) I should warn those who don't care for descriptions of nature that this novel will drive you up the wall, but like most good stylists, Pasternak doesn't go on and on about the beauties of the natural world just to be sweet. Here's where we start getting into his great theme, and Zhivago's great objection to the Soviet system - by showing us Russia in its natural state, its beauty and its cruelty, the narrative demonstrates that all the Soviet slogans have about as much power in the real world as puff of halitosis. That is, you can talk all you want about the glorious worker's paradise, but in the meantime families are being ripped apart for years at a time, men and women of great gifts are burning whole villages to the ground, and the fields lie fallow while people starve. Meanwhile the clouds roll by and the trees reach up through the snow to the setting sun.This may be why \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" takes place in the country for so much of its length. You would think that a book about the Russian revolution would take place in Moscow or Petersburg, and some early sections of this novel occur in those cities, but the characters really come to know themselves and each other way out in the sticks, in the woods or small deserted towns. And here's an interesting detail - Pasternak makes frequent use of a certain image at the beginning of the book and then abandons it until almost the end. \\"Dr. Zhivago\\" starts with a pre-revolutionary funeral procession for Zhivago's mother - it describes the singing marchers who stop and rest from time to time, and how the birds and sky and almost the air seem to continue the song during the silences. Right up until the civil war begins, you read about similar echoes, where the land's voice is heard, and then it stops. For a doctor/poet like Zhivago, that's clearly as devastating as the endless blood and death.As for Lara, she's just as important to Zhivago as his poetry, and in a similar fashion. She's a fighter for justice in her own way, and builds a relationship with Zhivago that allows them to value each other as people rather than examples of some political slogan. It's worth pointing out that Pasternak was not so foolish as to believe that the pre-revolutionary world was a paradise just because the post-revolutionary world was a purgatory - it's Lara's experiences being treated as a commodity that makes her a sort of revolutionary hero. And lest that whole description makes \\"Zhivago\\" sound like a political pamphlet, the poetry and respect for the individual characters turns the story into a sort of fairy tale, in the best sense of the word. Fairy tales, before they turned into stories about pink-winged Kewpie dolls, used to show the magic in everyday life. \\"Zhivago\\" does something like that. To the Soviets, who insisted that everything, including love, obey orthodox Communist doctrine, \\"Zhivago\\" must have seemed as much of an opiate as the church, not to speak of its details about Soviet atrocities. No wonder they hated it.Well, they lost and Pasternak won, even though it took thirty years or so. Zhivago and Lara, equally confident of their eventual victory, would have been proud.Benshlomo says, Shut up and listen to the world."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Rather than re-writing what many have already stated, I need to contest some reviews. Someone mentioned the conclusion was pointless and could have been done without. Some of the most beautiful lines of the book are contained in the last three chapters (14, 15, 16).Just a light sampling of their beauty (all from the conclusion):\\"You must never, never despair, whatever the circumstances. To hope and to act are our duties in misfortune. To do nothing and to despair is to neglect our duty.\\"\\"Never, never, not even in their moments of richest and wildest happiness, had they lost the sense of what is highest and most ravishing - joy in the whole universe, its form, its beauty, the feeling of their own belonging to it, being part of it.\\"\\"The riddle of life, the riddle of death, the beauty of genius, the beauty of loving - that, yes, that we understood. As for such petty trifles as re-shaping the world - these things, no thank you, they are not for us.\\"The character development may not be sewn up neatly, but the philosophical and theological ideas Pasternak expresses come to a climax in these final chapters. The fact that some similes, metaphors, etc. were not really working, as one reviewer stated, could easily be due to the translation. In the translator's note they recognize this is not the translation of a poet. The beauty of language is often lost in translation, and thus this is not really a fair criticism of the work.I will agree that there are too many minor characters that are overly developed, and overly detailed descriptions at times. Part of me took that as influence from Tolstoy, and part of me expected it a bit given this is Russian literature and that tends to come with the territory. However, I agree that these were weak points of the novel.Overall, however, the novel was well worth the read. While reading a novel written by a poet can be difficult at times, you can generally count on some truly beautiful descriptions and insights. Pasternak does not dissappoint in my opinion.

It made me wonder why, why leave out the enchanting figure of Marina, the only one in Zhivago's world who was as faithful to him as a dog is to his master, one who was there at the beginningMaybe they thought that audiences were already being asked to swallow too much. Yurii Andreievich had married Tonia already, and had Sasha with her, and then the good doctor had found himself madly in love with Lara. That tragic romance ended badly and then Yuri finds himself completely without friends or family and he stumbles, like a bum, back into the life of Marina. I guess the filmmakers thought that they were painting Lara and Uri to have the greatest love of all time, so where did Marina fit in? Anyone who's read the book knows that Marina's love for Yuri was stronger by far than the crazy, tender, adulterous love of Lara. Zhivago is such a good poet that Tonia, Lara and Marina are all aquiver when he draws near them.Marina is more mature (when she re-encounters Yuri) and it's hard to imaghine what actress of the mid-60s would have best been able to essay her character--had Lean and Bolt been more faithful to the novel and included the Marina-Yuri story in it. She is a woman whom time has touched, but lightly, and she has seen the ravages of the Revolution first-hand, while still remaining touched and open to the possibilities of new love. If they could have gotten her, Audrey Hepburn would have been a good choice, sort of the Audrey Hepburn of ROBIN AND MARIAN and TWO FOR THE ROAD. Another performance that comes to mind is Claudia Cardinale in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST--women who have lived and suffered and whose spirit still flames and seeks the higher ground. But perhaps Hepburn and Cardinale were too beautiful (or glamorous) and Pasternak wanted us to find the beauty in a plainer woman.The book is a very different experience than the movie; structured as a poem, the novel moves laterally from time period to time period, while individual associations link disparate stories. We remember that Pasternak was writing about characters of another generation than his own, and that he had already seen the death of Stalin and the public demolition of the dictator's relationship, when he published his novel at last. As a boy he had dreamed of becoming a musician, and it is said that he aped Scriabin in his earliest works. Certainly some of Scriabin's theories of synaesthesia carry over into the marvelously sensual passages of ZHIVAGO, where everything--smells, tastes, the pressures of flesh and flesh--all blend into image."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"The movie is my favorite of all times, so I decided to read the book. The movie concentrates mainly on the love story of Lara and Yuri, but the book describes the whole political situation and life in Russia from the revolution of 1905 till the end of WW2.Despite the tragedies and the sufferings, Pasternak is extremely romantic and sensitive to nature and to the surroundings...depicting all that is beautiful even amid the most horrifying pictures of war. I think just to show us the hope and the endurance of the human soul. Even when I felt a little disappointed when there is no more Lara and Yuri for a while, Pasternak's description of the atrocities of war and the extremes that humans reach when fighting for their survival is gloomy and sad. It gives a taste of the bitterness of war and a smell of the cheap human blood everywhere..I loved it! I even felt so heart broken just like Yuri when he reads Tonia's letter ... great story, tragic love, unaccomplished life!"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Many passages are crafted with such care that they reach the level of poetry, which should be no surprise given that Pasternak seems to have had aspirations as a poet. (Is it just coincidence that the good doctor does so much of that kind of writing in the novel?) The short passages and lightly threaded vignettes characteristic of the novel are captivating. You get the initial sense that the novel is an underrated Russian classic. Ultimately, however, Pasternak doesn't quite reach the level of mastery of a Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Turgenev, even though it aims for their kind of sweep and scope.Doctor Zhivago is generally less coherent and cogent than any of the true classics of Russian literature. Many of the vignettes embedded in the book are beautiful, and as passages of near poetry, almost can standalone. Yet, as moving as much of the book is, its heft is insufficient at helping Pasternak push towards any master theme, focus or even plot, so the force is dissipated at the end. It is no accident that the book's conclusion and epilogue seem aimless.What redeems the novel is the wonderful characters: Zhivago himself, of course, the brilliant doctor, with the dreamy poetic sensibility; the beautiful and bright Lara (who unfortunately ultimately fails as a character, though, because it's unclear what she is meant to be at the end; the contrast with Tonia could have been made better if Tonia had not been left so two-dimensional); the tactician Strelnikov, whose combination of military brilliance and ruthlessness enthralls us; the way he exits the novel at the end is unfortunately also a disappointment)."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I bought this classic novel after watching the stunning new British TV mini-series starring Keira Knightley, Hans Matheson and Sam Neill.

Just like real life. And there are many characters here of course. But it never gets confusing. Because their lives are intertwined - just like ours with the people who come in and out of our life events. This is a novel of epic proportions. It discusses not just love or war or pain or joy but everything else - including - philosophy, poetry, religion, man's motivations, governance, sheep mentality of the masses, leadership, virtue, etc.It starts with a funeral and ends with a funeral. All the tales in between bring these lives together in a cohesion of passion and longing. Is there something called destiny? Is there fate or chance or luck? The way the lives of these characters get connected and meet at strange occasions to add or subtract from their emotions - it is spellbinding and at the same time makes us question our own past and present. Because these are normal everyday people like us - in a different time and place - yet so much similar to our choices and ambitions and motives. Set in Russia, yet so close to humanity's basic nature that any reader anywhere in the world can relate to these characters and their troubled lives.Lara is clearly the most intriguing and fascinating character in the book.

The good doctor's wife Tonya is also well constructed and so are the friends and relatives who help them and carry them from one fateful event to the next.The climax is heartbreaking. This is a tragedy story rather than a romance story. As should be guessed by the title of the book. More a Hamlet than a Romeo-Juliet. But you will walk away with satisfaction and having witnessed not one or two or three but several significant lives unfold and change and evolve as the novel progresses.An enjoyable read. They say the original Russian prose is the most wonderful to read and no translation can match it. Well, I read the English translation by Max Hayward and Manya Harari and was very much impressed by their attention to detail and slang and colloquial words. Some of the translated poems are also done with much effort and perfect in English even though they are actually translations.Do take time to sit with this and ponder. It should make you think as all good epic literature does. Its not a paperback thriller. It is an era and life spoken of in great detail and passion."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I first read this in my teenage years and loved it. I have since reread it numerous times and find something new each time. Rather like poetry, it grows as you grow!This is not the film. You may have loved the film and be disappointed with the novel. The novel should be treated as a stand alone - and a translation at that. However the characters are well crafted, the story breathtaking and a work of major significance.If you read historical fiction, this is a stunning book. You get subtleties that authors who merely research their country and period, don't give.

However, the novel goes deeper, describing Russia as it was during the first half of the last century especially before the Second World War. Actually, the novel revolves around Yuri Andreivich Zhivago a doctor and poet whose life is a series of trials beginning with the funeral for his mother' until he too made the honorable exit to the world beyond. Dr Zhivago trials take him across the length and breadth of Russia through war as a soldier in the Red Army and as a man with a strong desire to lead a normal life with his wife and son, but who cannot avoid the love of a woman destiny always put on his way.The remarkable thing about Dr ZHIVAGO is the fact that Pasternak successfully made it possible for the reader to look beyond the tragedies and sufferings in the story to the worthiness of life that comes with love and loving. Romance is born and even thrives in tragedies and misery showing that life can be beautiful at all times because the human soul that harbors hope can endure the worst atrocities of war and still stay beautiful.Rich and poetic, DR ZHIVAGO is a breathtaking story. It has a few flaws, but the underlying strength of the story is overwhelming. Reminds me of The Union Moujik, War and Peace, and Taras Bulba. I enjoyed DR ZHIVAGO and would recommend it to any book enthusiast, especially someone with an interest in Russian literature."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"This book is truly one of the great novels of our time, in my opinion. The greatness of the novel is not only in the quality of the writing, but also in the surroundings in which it was written, given the subject matter. Incidentally, what would likely be a very interesting read would likely be a book about the writing of this novel, its publishing, and its impact.The interaction of Pasternak's characters is masterful. His ability to weave the lives of generations of characters reminds me of Michener's. None of what happens in the novel, none of the interaction of the characters, appears to be superfluous-all has meaning. In my opinion, the notion that everything has a purpose is one of the strongest themes of the novel, and is part of what makes the novel so interesting, given that it was written under the iron curtain.Though this is a work of fiction, it provided me with several important insights into the history of Russia. For instance, Pasternak does an excellent job telling about how the revolution came about, what the means and methods of the revolution were, simply by telling the story of the novel. In the sense that it is historically accurate and representative of the times, the book certainly was educational for me. I certainly recommend it to those who love to read history and look for insights about humanity. I only wish that I could read it in Russian."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"My first reading of Dr. Zhivago was in high school. At 15, the book was a chore. Impenetrable and numerous Russian names (often for the same character) and endless description of the Russian landscape left me exhausted and unimpressed. After rereading and enjoying a few other high school assignments, I came across Dr. Zhivago on my bookshelf and wondered if I would find more appreciation for Mr. Pasternak's novel ten years later.Yes, I did. And no, I didn't.I found that this time around I had something more of a connection with the characters. I better understood the way that life can pull a person in strange directions and drop them into unexpected and unwanted situations. I understood that sometimes people are swept into and out of the place they want to be - and why they stay where things are bad and leave where things are good. I certainly had a far greater appreciation for Pasternak's obviously loving descriptions of his homeland.That said, the things that drove my dislike of Dr. Zhivago the first time were still still there. The sprawling story and unending task of keeping all the characters straight were still a detraction. I don't know if the problem with character names springs from the fact that, being Russian names, they are unfamiliar to my mind or if Pasternak simply failed to rein in his cast of thousands. Unresolved plot lines rarely bother me but, when combined with extensive background on what ending up being minor characters, Dr. Zhivago felt a bit as if Pasternak let the narrative get away from him. Maybe that was the point. Sometimes life just gets away from you. After all, he's the one with a Nobel Prize. Who am I to criticize?While I actually &lt;u>liked the novel this time, I feel as if I should have liked Dr. Zhivago more than I did. Maybe it's that I can't escape my first impression."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"After reading famous books you often feel that whilst it was good, you can't quite understand why it has become so renowned. Perhaps it is because the idea is powerful but badly executed or perhaps has an incredible mood but the concept and importance are somewhat lacking. None of these feelings occur when reading Dr Zhivago, its artistry is superb, the dialogues and turns of phrase are often breathtaking in their subtle importance, beauty or both. This is a book that fully warrants its reputation, it is stripped of the idealism and runs almost like a political philosophy discourse at times in the development of ideas of equality, the human spirit and the paths to progress in society.It is for this reason that I don't think the book deserves its reputation as a 'love story': it is certainly a human story with love becoming more important as a theme as the book continues, but the power of the context is such that one could say that it is a political book first and a romance second. However, such hierarchies are not applicable in a work such as Dr Zhivago, such is Pasternak's skill as a writer that the themes of the novel perfectly complement each other, he balances the issues of the history of the era, Yury's development as a person and the underlying current of the women in his life with almost orchestral skill. If Pasternak's aim was to create an illustration of the power, subtlety and synphonic nature of life, uncontrollable by 'men of action' then this is reflected in the structure and style of his prose.The book had a great effect on me, its integrity was great and the whole book wonderfully honest. Each comment was razor blade sharp so I was often completely surprised that he was brave enough to write such things in Soviet Russia. He seems to have paid for his integrity with his life, echoing the life of his main character in this way and in many others. I would be unsurprised if Pasternak only wrote one novel on this scale; he seems to have put everything of himself into it.The prose is not always pleasurable to read, it's even dull in places such as the chapter-long train journey. I also would have preferred a greater mix with descriptions and dialogues, there were few sections when the two were sufficiently mixed so that the reader has to often read very lengthy dialogues and intermitable (though often startlingly beautiful) descriptions. I experienced East of Eden by Steinbeck in a similar way: it was often not pleasurable so much as enlightening and a book that one should try to read at least one time in your life."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Out of Zhivago's loves I always liked Marina the best and, when the movie came out, I was puzzled to see that David Lean and Robert Bolt had left her out, excised her completely. It made me wonder why, why leave out the enchanting figure of Marina, the only one in Zhivago's world who was as faithful to him as a dog is to his master, one who was there at the beginningMaybe they thought that audiences were already being asked to swallow too much. Yurii Andreievich had married Tonia already, and had Sasha with her, and then the good doctor had found himself madly in love with Lara. That tragic romance ended badly and then Yuri finds himself completely without friends or family and he stumbles, like a bum, back into the life of Marina. I guess the filmmakers thought that they were painting Lara and Uri to have the greatest love of all time, so where did Marina fit in? Anyone who's read the book knows that Marina's love for Yuri was stronger by far than the crazy, tender, adulterous love of Lara. Zhivago is such a good poet that Tonia, Lara and Marina are all aquiver when he draws near them.Marina is more mature (when she re-encounters Yuri) and it's hard to imaghine what actress of the mid-60s would have best been able to essay her character--had Lean and Bolt been more faithful to the novel and included the Marina-Yuri story in it. She is a woman whom time has touched, but lightly, and she has seen the ravages of the Revolution first-hand, while still remaining touched and open to the possibilities of new love. If they could have gotten her, Audrey Hepburn would have been a good choice, sort of the Audrey Hepburn of ROBIN AND MARIAN and TWO FOR THE ROAD. Another performance that comes to mind is Claudia Cardinale in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST--women who have lived and suffered and whose spirit still flames and seeks the higher ground. But perhaps Hepburn and Cardinale were too beautiful (or glamorous) and Pasternak wanted us to find the beauty in a plainer woman.The book is a very different experience than the movie; structured as a poem, the novel moves laterally from time period to time period, while individual associations link disparate stories. We remember that Pasternak was writing about characters of another generation than his own, and that he had already seen the death of Stalin and the public demolition of the dictator's relationship, when he published his novel at last. As a boy he had dreamed of becoming a musician, and it is said that he aped Scriabin in his earliest works. Certainly some of Scriabin's theories of synaesthesia carry over into the marvelously sensual passages of ZHIVAGO, where everything--smells, tastes, the pressures of flesh and flesh--all blend into image."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"The movie is my favorite of all times, so I decided to read the book. The movie concentrates mainly on the love story of Lara and Yuri, but the book describes the whole political situation and life in Russia from the revolution of 1905 till the end of WW2.Despite the tragedies and the sufferings, Pasternak is extremely romantic and sensitive to nature and to the surroundings...depicting all that is beautiful even amid the most horrifying pictures of war. I think just to show us the hope and the endurance of the human soul. Even when I felt a little disappointed when there is no more Lara and Yuri for a while, Pasternak's description of the atrocities of war and the extremes that humans reach when fighting for their survival is gloomy and sad. It gives a taste of the bitterness of war and a smell of the cheap human blood everywhere..I loved it! I even felt so heart broken just like Yuri when he reads Tonia's letter ... great story, tragic love, unaccomplished life!"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I read and re-read this book during my course and I didn't like at first but later I fell in love with poetry of Zhivago(Pasternak) which is the centre of the book.Seems so hermetic and far from the plot and yet it explains it perfectly.Every rhyme is an echo of lines in the novel and it has so many levels of reading and interpretation that you just can't but explore them from day to day.His poetry is incredibly rich both in human and evangelic direction.To be read in Russian otherwise translation takes everything away.I really do recommend it."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"Doctor Zhivago is so much more than what words can express. A love so strong, a war so wrong and a poet of deep passion. Discriptive words from Pasternak opens your mind to a world of greatness and sadness."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"For starters I am working on an essay concerning Pasternaks view on art and his life-philosophy. I've read some of the reviews on this masterpiece and must say they are quite ignorant. While it is true that the many names can be confusing, I had a summary of the different names when I read the book (I allways do this when reading russian writers). When looking at it right now, I understand that you get into trouble when reading this book for the first time. For instance, Laras husband is referred to as either Antipov, Pavel, Pasja, P&aacute;vlovitj or Strelnikov ... :-) Some of the critics say that the dialogue is unnatural and staggering, but that is not so. It might be abit odd at times, but since I dont speak russian I cannot verify that. However I do say it is not as masterful as Dostojevskij - but then what is? =) The book has many qualities that go beyond the actual events and the dialogue though. And if you take it for the action that takes place this is not a book for you. Pasternak got the nobelprize partly because of this book, and partly for the poems he wrote in the 20s. Czeslav Milosz (Nobelprizewinner 1980) published 1963 a large essay on Pasternak where he in one place compares Pasternak to Mandelstam - not very strange to any reader of russian poetry. Milosz writes &quot;..But he (Mandelstam) had to few weaknesses. He was hard like crystal - and therefore fragile. Pasternak, more spiritual, rough and less demanding, was the one who was to write a novel, that in spite, and thanks to its inherent incongruities is a great book.&quot; (Translated from a swedish translation of the polish original text) In the beginning (p.29 in my swedish translation) Pasternak writes &quot;..Jura, his classcomrade the highschoolstudent Gordon and the hostes duaghter Tonja Gromeko. This trippelentity had read &quot;The Meaning of Love&quot; and &quot;The Kreuzer Sonata&quot; too much and was obsessed with the preaching of purity. This quote is essential for the development of the novel. &quot;The Meaning of Love&quot; is a collection of articles by the philosopher Vladimir Soloviev where love is divided into three kinds of love: Social, Spiritual and Physical. Both Lara and Juri has three loves in the book, and I write about this only to let you people in on how deep this actually goes. Pasternaks strength (IMHO) lies in handling a multitude of events, characters and thoughts with the contrapuntal skill of a classic composer handling a symphony. (And he studied music before he took up poetry.) -Vincent Saldell ps Excuse my english - I am a swede =)"},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I remember when this book was first published in the West, the great sensation it caused. It became 'required reading' for anyone who wished to learn about the then so- secretive enemy behind the Iron Curtain. Pasternak was condemned by the Kremlin , but nonetheless refused to leave his beloved Russia to accept the Nobel Prize he was given in 1958.I also found the book a difficult one to read, and could never in my own mind understand exactly what was going on. The main character Zhivago goes through it seems an epic series of adventures, and in the course of this views a vast panorama not only of the Russian landscape but of its character and people. His great love-story with Lara is complicated by both of them having had previous spouses and committments.When I read this book as an American high- school student it was just all too complicated for me to really grasp.I have learned since that a major theme of the work is Zhivago's turning away from the Revolution in the realization that instead of bringing equality it is suppressing the spiritual character of the people. His dedication to poetry and to some mystical sense of a spiritual reality are central themes of the work.And it is no doubt this resistance to the Soviet system which helped make the book so popular in the West.Others have been attracted by the book's poetic language, by its dramatic images of a world and way of life, unique in its cruelty, and suffering- and its powerful depictions of impossible love and terrible beauty."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"As far as Russian literature in this last century goes, this is the best work I have seen. Doctor Zhivago does for the Communist Revolution what War and Peace did for Napoleon's invasion. There can be many comparisons made between the two books. Zhivago's story starts with the suicide of his father, who squandered the family fortune, and moves on from there to the revolution. No punches are pulled here: we see many shockinge effects of that event. Zhivago and his family leave Moscow to avoid the bloodshed and needless deaths, but he heads to more of the same, eventually becoming conscripted into the Red Army against his will to help with medicine. There is also Lara, Zhivago's love, who brings Zhivago to carry on. The decision to release this book was a gutsy one by Pasternak, but it paid off. This is the definitive epic of Soviet literature, and it comes highly recommended by me."},{"Title":"Doctor Zhivago (Penguin Longman Reader Bk/Tape)","review":"I read this book many years ago when I was 13 or 14 so my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, but I remember it made a huge impression on me at the time. I saw the movie and that is what originally inspired me to read the book, but there is a lot more to the book than just the love story that was portrayed in the movie. There is a lot of political and social history presented in the novel, but not so much that it overwhelms the reader. The story and the history are balanced very well. The main character strives to do well and survive against the odds, which was inspirational despite the fact that so many unfortunate incidents happened to him."},{"Title":"Redgauntlet (The Waverley novels)","review":"I find &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; one of the less satisfactory novels in the Waverley series. Certainly, it has the local flavor, the dialect, the imaginative description of evocative landscapes all his novels have, but it is not a blast as some of the others are. The plot involves a fictitious third Jacobite rebellion, and it is interesting to see how Scott (especially in the notes from the Magnum edition, included in this edition) argues this time not for the historicity but for the historical probability of the events described. While Scott is often hailed as the inventor of the historical novel, &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; also shows him to be a forerunner in the historically probable novel--a genre practiced to great effect by our present-day history buff, Umberto Eco.But probability alone does not a great novel make. Darsie Latimer's character is even less probable than his semi-historical counterparts, such as Edmund Waverley and Henry Morton. And this is strange, since moving further into fictionality, one could argue, a writer might allow themselves more latitude to make a character interesting, even if certain circumstances remain historical. Is this a conscious effort on Scott's part to show, after the fictionality of history, the fictionality of fiction?Scott disturbs narrative conventions even further when the conspiracy against the Hanoverian King George III completely fails to materialize--ironically, for what seems to be the silliest of reasons: the Pretender (or the Chevalier if you're a Jacobite), Charles Stuart, refuses to give up his mistress. Thus, the main plot of the novel sizzles out and really not much happens in these 400 pages. Mind you, I personally don't need much to happen, but the 19th century novel did. Scott as a postmodern writer? That is pushing it too far, but this novel awaits a postmodern critique enlightened by a reading of Eco and Bakhtin.That said, there are some really interesting things going on. Apart from the &quot;regular&quot; set of characters of Scott's Scottish novels, this one features an orthodox Quaker who is the epitome of anti-militant mercantilism. The form is also quite new for Scott--the novel is an epistolary, a set of letters between Darsie Latimer and his friend Alan Fairford. Thus, the novel's first-person point of view is split, and this provides for interesting contrasts.For me, Scott sort of shot himself in the foot with this novel. His earlier novels (&quot;Redgauntlet&quot; is the last of the Scottish novels, written eight years before his death) lead one to expect a major action to happen before the denouement, and this one avoids that a bit too artificially. It seems that Scott was at pains to stick to history, and his own political convictions, a bit too much: a fictitious Jacobite rebellion is OK as a narrative vehicle, but it shouldn't interfere with the peaceful Great Britain (in which Scotland was in many respects subsidiary to England) that Scott himself inhabited and advocated. And so narrative excitement has to give way to Scott's pacifist politics--an honest choice, which Scott consistently maintains in all the Waverley novels--and character development and politics take precedent.A final note: Scott has always proven himself a masterful and honest critic of royalty and nobility, especially of those characters he seems to love. &quot;Waverley&quot;'s Mac-Ivor is chastised for his political obstinacy, in &quot;The Fortunes of Nigel&quot; King James I (a Scot) is rebuked for his fickleness and corruption, and in &quot;Redgauntlet&quot; the formerly charismatic Stuart proves effeminate and tragic (dying an impoverished alcoholic, in the footnotes). And often enough, these tragic characters are of more interest than the somewhat ineffectual and sometimes foolish main characters: something for readers of literature to sink their teeth into."},{"Title":"Redgauntlet (The Waverley novels)","review":"Redgauntlet is generally considered to be one of Scott's best novels. It is set in 1765 and returns to the theme of his first novel Waverley, describing an attempt to overthrow the Hanoverian monarchy and return Britain to the rule of the exiled Stuarts. Of course there was no Jacobite rising in 1765, so Redgauntlet is not, strictly speaking, an historical novel. The story however is consistent with the history of the period and plausibly shows what might have happened. The novel is all the more powerful and poignant because he does not attempt to create an imaginary rebellion on the scale of 1745, but rather describes a revolt which history might have been unaware of, a last small scale, almost pathetic, attempt to resurrect a cause which had already, long since, been lost.The story is initially told by means of a series of letters between Darsie Latimer and Alan Fairford, two young friends who have grown up together. There is a mystery regarding Darsie's family origins. He knows almost nothing about his background except that he must not set foot in England until he is 21. Gradually, as Darsie discovers more about the secrets surrounding his life, he is brought deeper into a conspiracy. Alan is warned by the beautiful \\"Green Mantle\\" that Darsie is in danger. But Darsie fails to heed the warning and soon faces a man who knows all about his past, the fearsome Redgauntlet.Scott tells the story well. The epistolary form works well enough, given the at times inherent implausibility of this way of writing, where letters go on for an unreasonably large number of pages. The story is exciting with lots of incident and action and a good number of surprises. The romantic element of the plot is unusual involving both Alan and Darsie with \\"Green Mantle\\". Perhaps best of all is the genuinely creepy short story \\"Wandering Willie's Tale\\" which lives up to its reputation as the best short story in Scots. This story is often anthologised, but it is even better when read in its proper context.The edition of Redgauntlet edited by G.A.M. Wood and David Hewitt is undoubtedly the best possible version of Scott's text. This edition takes as its base text the first edition. The editors have also consulted Scott's manuscript and, unusually in the case of Redgauntlet, the proofs, which show Scott's corrections to the first draft of the printed text. By doing this the editors have been able to restore many lost readings and correct numerous mistakes. In addition this edition has a full glossary and extensive notes. A little effort is required to read Redgauntlet, as Scott's language can at times be quite difficult, but this effort is amply rewarded, for his story of the last rising of the Jacobites is one of his greatest creations."},{"Title":"Redgauntlet (The Waverley novels)","review":"In his 1824 novel REDGAUNTLET, Sir Walter Scott says farewell to the dethroned Stuart Dynasty with its colorful, haughty claims to the Crowns of Scotland and England. Law and a commercial order comfortable to property owners have taken root by the time of the third Hanoverian King and displaced the older claims of personal and clan loyalty to a God-anointed sovereign. England, and increasingly Scotland, now make up a nation of shopkeepers and overseas traders and their souls are content. Even those of smugglers.The two principal characters, men in their early 20s, can be objects of gentle fun, as they hastily and clumsily grow up. Yet these youngsters (and two young women they meet and admire) represent the future of the United Kingdom. Initially, in the summer of 1765, the two, newly minted lawyer Alan Fairford and his dreamy laid-back alter-ego Darsie Latimer, are at least a little bit open to the romance of the \\"auld days.\\" Like many Romantic Movement heroes, Darsie is not sure who he is. In addition to the usual reluctance to allow himself to be defined by profession, church, state, older adults, etc., Darsie does not know who were his parents. Strong hints are that he will know as soon as he turns 21. Meanwhile he is to avoid leaving Scotland at any cost. Alan has delicate health and is the dutiful son of an overbearing lawyer of Edinburgh. He uncharacteristically rebels and strikes out on his own when Darsie is violently carried away across the firth of Solway into northwestern England. That deed was done by persons unknown but increasingly suspected to be using Darsie as a pawn. Slowly, it becomes clear that Darsie's rebel uncle, Hugh Redgauntlet, is using the young hero to mobilize support for a fresh rising in England and Scotland to put the Old Pretender back on a throne that he had rolled the dice for 20 years earlier in the crushed rising of 1745.There are many ways and levels for reading Scott's historical novels. One, followed by thousands since Scott's death in 1832, is to find lessons for today's world in the pasts of England and Scotland. Many Americans grew up in a world echoing the skepticism of Nanty Ewart (Vol. II, Ch. 13, p. 250), \\"Tell that to the marines -- the sailors won't believe it.\\" And might not the US in Iraq in 2006 spring to mind when Darsie Latimer is said to fall easily in and out of puppy loves like a \\"Mahratta conqueror, who overruns a province with the rapidity of lightning, but finds it impossible to retain it beyond a very brief space\\" ( Vol. III. Ch. 4, p. 290).Or we can enjoy REDGAUNTLET for its striking comparisons. Darsie, for example, has learned enough of the uncle who kidnapped him to know that his laying on violent hands had been for no personal gain. \\"... he could as soon have imagined Cassius picking Caesar's pocket, instead of drawing his poniard upon the Dictator\\" (p. 293). And \\"Freedom of religious opinion brings on, I suppose, freedom of political creed\\" ... (p. 303).REDGAUNTLET is a wise, complex tale by one of the world's greatest story tellers.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Road to Miklagard","review":"This is the second part of Treece's trilogy about the Norwegian Viking, Harald Sigurdson. It's set in about the year 800 and tells a fairly typical adventure for a Norwegian Viking of the period, sailing to Ireland in search of treasure. Later, however, the tale gets a bit more fantastic, when Harald is shipwrecked and ends up in Miklagard (Constantinople), the capital of the Byzantine Empire. He serves there are a guardsman. He could be seen as a forerunner of the famed Byzantine Guard.Treece's language is very simple in these books; its probably intended more for children or adolescents then for adults. However, it provides a good character study for the grim, brave Vikings,and it provides a fair smattering of Viking myths, stories, and jokes. All in all I found this enjoyable (though not as good as Viking's Dawn), but I'm a Viking fanatic. Not everyone's idea of a good read."},{"Title":"The Massacre at Fall Creek","review":"For this Hoosier reviewer, \\"The Massacre at Fall Creek\\" is most interesting since the places involved are no more than a 45 minute drive from my house.Jessamyn West does a great job of getting the \\"feel\\" of an 1824 frontier community - how small it was, how truly far away it was from \\"civilization\\" and how that isolation created a unique culture.The storyline is based on a real incident in which several white men from a community to the north of Pendleton, Indiana killed two families of Indians, including their children and stole their furs. Records from those days are \\"iffy\\" at best so West has to fill in a lot of blanks as she goes along. In fact, she even uses fake names for the white men involved, although it may be that in the 33 years since her book was written additional research has revealed the names of the men.Of course, the Indians were outraged at this treaty violation and the U.S. government decided that there was going to be a real trial and it paid for a team of prosectution and defense lawyers to conduct a real trial. A jail was built (ironically, Pendleton is the site of one of Indiana's prison facilities nowadays as well) and a trial was held for four of the five white men. The fifth white man was never captured by white authorities.The book focuses on the love life of one of the young ladies of the settlement (her love interests intertwine in all aspects of the case), the trial and the aftermath. At times this book reads more like a romance novel, at othertimes like a legal thriller but it is a solid, enjoyable read about a sad, tragic moment on the Hoosier frontier."},{"Title":"Bubble Gum, Bubble Gum","review":"We checked this one out from the library on a whim just because we thought the name looked fun.

The people interviewed tell, in a matter-of-fact way, of their experiences as hidden children and how they have fared since. They often pay tribute to the courage and care of their 'hiding families' with whom many have remained in contact. One survivor, Henry Birnbaum, says that what stays with him is the \\"funny mixture\\" of stretches of boredom interspersed with extreme terror.Dr Bluglass concludes with a sensitive appraisal of the after-effects on the survivors. She suggests that the reason they have all thrived could be that they either came from secure and loving families, or were nurtured by their 'hiding families'. Later they also came to understand more fully why their birth families had had to give them up.A rewarding and highly recommended read which, perhaps surprisingly in view of the subject, leaves one with a sense of hope."},{"Title":"Hidden from the Holocaust: Stories of Resilient Children Who Survived and Thrived","review":"I've read many books by and about Holocaust survivors, and have found that those told \\"in their own words\\" to be the most immediate and telling.

The center isn't called that, but those two untiring Christians have done so much that it should be named after them!Now this book doesn't solve any problems per se, but it does put them into context and it avoids the unhelpful, silly, and unscholarly straw man arguments that the cheaper scholarship throws out as to why we should be Catholic or Protestant or Orthodox or \\"Protholidox\\"! WHile it is a great book for those interested in reunion, it is certainly a must-read for those who have read Ut Unum Sint, \\"that all may be one\\".See my review of Brian Tierney's \\"Origins of Papal Infallibility\\" for a great selection of books that deal indepth with the subject of reunion between east and west as it relates to the papacy. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Church Unity and the Papal Office: An Ecumenical Dialogue on John Paul II's Encyclical Ut Unum Sint","review":"Rank: 3.25 STARSIntroduction:Let me start off by saying that I wish I could have given this book a 5 stars. That's why I bought this book, because I thought I was going to learn a lot from it. Sadly, while there was plenty of material for me to underling and notes to make, I found some of the chapters (which are separate essays and speaches) very soporific. Going to sleep is not what I had in mind, when I wanted to read some practical advice and response from a variety of Christians to former pope John Paul II's encyclical letter of \\"Ut Unum Sint\\" (\\"May They Be One\\" - first roman-catholic encyclical on Christian Unity).Authors:During June 6-8 1999, Carl E. Braaten and Robert W. Jenson, the founders of the \\"Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology\\" (a great ecumenical site and small publisher), hosted a theological conference as a response to then pope John Paul II's 1995 Encyclical Letter - Ut Unum Sint. This conference was held at University of St. Thomas in St. Paul Minnesota. This book is a collection of the speaches at that conference and the majority of the speakers represent the Roman-Catholic branch, while there is only one Lutheran and one neoProtestant response, and none from the Orthodox division of Christianity.Content:I will provide a summary of each speach, so please bear with me. You might find some golden nuggets. (numbers in parenthesis refer to the encyclical)- Introduction:* \\"...despite existing separations, 'we [Christians' belong to Christ' (42).\\"* \\"The pope's ecumenical devotion to unity is based on Jesus' highpriestly prayer in Chapter 17 of St. John's Gospel.\\"* \\"...if we take Christ's call to unity to heart, 'that all may be one,' 'every factor of division can be transcended and overcome in the total gift of self for the sake of the Gospel (1).\\"* \\"...Christ ardently desires the full and visible communion of all those Communities in which, by virtue of God's faithfulness, his Spirit dwells.(95)\\"* \\"The first part of the Acts of the Apostles presents Peter as the one who speaks in the name of the apostolic group and who serves the unity of the community - all the while respecting the authority of James, the head of the Church in Jerusalem.\\"- Cardinal Edward Cassidy's speech \\"Ut Unum Sint in Ecumenical Perspective\\"* \\"multiple efforts being made in many parts of the world, under the inspiring grace of the Holy Spirit, through prayer, word and action to attain the fullnes of unity which Jesus Christ desires.\\"* \\"Ecumenism an organic part of her [Church's] life and work.\\"* \\"The Church cannot be true to itself unless it is ecumenical.\\"* \\"...this commitment is to the full, visible unity of the Christian family.\\"* \\"All those justified by faith through baptism are incorporated into Christ.\\"* \\"...the encyclical Ut Unum Sint asserts once again that 'the one Church of Christ subsists in the Catholic Church.'\\"* \\"'cumenism is an unavoidable task as an expression of the love of God in Christ.'\\"* \\"as disciples of Christ, we are called to unity, ... 'so that the world may believe (John 17:21).'\\"* \\"... :to what degree are we ready to listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches today?\\"- Brian E. Daley, S.J.'s speech \\"The Ministry of Primacy and the Communion of Churches\\"* \\"...the encyclical acknowledges that there is a risk that power may be separated from ministry.\\"* \\"The essential pont remain, however, that jurisdiction is only possible by virtue of jurisdictional powers.\\"* \\"...those attempting to defend and advance their own power often emphasize its service component.\\"* \\"Scholars have long realized tha the 'koinonia' model is christologically and pneumatologically oriented.\\"* \\"The root of all true authority is thus the activity of the triune God, who authors life in all its fullness.\\"- Geoffrey Wainwright (Methodist) speech \\"'Ut Unum Sint' in Light of 'Faith and Order' - or 'Faith and Order' in Light of 'Ut Unum Sint'\\"*** \\"Diversity in expression of the Gospel, in words and in actions, enrich the common life. Particular emphases today are carried in the life and witness of the different churches: for example, the holiness tradition by the Methodists, the doctrine of justification by faith alone through grace by the Lutherans, the life in the Holy Spirit by the Pentecostals, the ministry of primacy in the service of unity by the Anglican Communion, the doctrine of primacy in the service of unity by the Roman Catholic Church, the value of comprehensiveness by the Anglican Communion, the doctrine of deification coupled with that of 'synergy' by the Orthodox, etc. How far are the different emphases conflicting positions or an expression of legitimate diversity? Does the weight placed upon the different emphases obscure the fullness of the Gospel message?\\"- David S. Yeago's speech \\"The Papal Office and the Burden of History: a Lutheran View\\"* \\"In the present situation, I think it needs to be said that we cannot assume that widespread Protestant admiration for the pope as man and Christian witness translates into a positive attitude toward the papacy as an institution and an order of church governance.\\"* \\"...papal infallibility has turned out to be something of a red herring in the ecumenical discussion.\\"* \\"The crucial ecumenical issue is not the philosophical hermeneutics of infallibility but the essentially ecclesial-political problem of authority.\\"* \\"...the Reformers were critical of accounts of magisterium that seemed to suggest a one-sided dependence of the faithful on the teaching office, a clerical monopoly on the true knowledge of Christ. The apostles have delivered the holy gospel to the whole church, and 'all' the faithful take part in various ways in the transmission of the apostolic tradition from age to age.\\"* \\"...the Reformers believed, because the devil never ceases to attach the apostolic gospel, attempting by open or covert means to deprive the church of the true knowledge of Christ.\\"*** \\"...: the reconciliation of the churches will require not only advances in theological insight but also profound changes in their lived and practiced sense of mission.\\"** \\"How better for Lutherans to affirm concretely that we no longer regard the pope as an outright enemy of the 'evangelica veritas'? Luther was willing to kiss the pope's feet if he would allow the pure teaching of the gospel. Now that we agree that he does allow it, why should we not be willing on significant occasions to ask his [the pope] advice and listen to his counsel?\\"- Richard J. Mouw's (Pres. of Fuller Theological Seminary) speech \\"The Problem of Authority in Evangelical Christianity\\"* \\"We evangelicals are often accused of having a weak ecclesiology.\\"*** \\"It is currently fashionable to speak of evangelicals as having an 'under-developed eclesiology': perhaps it might be suggested that it is others who have over-developed ecclesiologies?\\" (quoting an Anglican evangelical)** \\"A central concern on the evangelical agenda,..., is the link between ecclesiology and soteriology.\\"** \\"...the 'evangelical' label functions best as a theological modifier rather than as a noun.\\"*** \\"We evangelicals at our generic worst suffer from theological amnesi. Our narratives about \\"the old time religion\\" tend to leave whole centuries - even whole millennia - out of the story of how God has led his church into new understandings of the truth of the gospel.\\"- George Weigel \\"The Church's Teaching Authority and the Call for Democracy in North Atlantic Catholicism\\"* \\"While a denomination is something we create by joining it, the church ..., is a divinely ordered and Spirit-sustained reality...\\"* \\"...the episcopate was a uniquely 'ecclesial' office and the charisms necessary to fulfill its obligations were evangelical and theological...\\"* \\"...the college of bishops and the Petrine primacy within the college are both divinely ordered and constitutive elements of the church.\\"* \\"...the pastors of the church and its theologians are servants, not masters.\\"- Joseph Augustine Dinoia, O.P.'s speech \\"Ecumenism and the New Evangelization in 'Ut Unum Sint'\\"* \\"...an essential element in the exercise of Petrine ministry to foster unity as an instrument of evangelization.\\"* \\"'The destiny of egangelization is certainly bound up with the witness of unity given by the Church. ... division ...

As a result of former pope John Paul II's encyclical \\"Ut Unum Sint\\" (the first Catholic encyclical on unity and Christian ecumenism; available for free from the vatican's website) in the mid 1990s there has been a lot of discussion about its ideas and implications. This book offers mostly Catholic views and some are very specific to a particular aspect (American-Catholicism, view of ecclessial power, interpretation of Petrine office) and not necessarily a general approach. I wish I could give it more stars but the material was in some cases too academic and less pragmatic than I had wished. Also, I had to struggle and finish some speaches because they were too soporific for me."},{"Title":"Leaving the Bench: Supreme Court Justices at the End","review":"I am a Supreme Court junkie but I confess this is one of the most curious books about the court that I have ever read. If you thought that there was no aspect of the lives of US Supreme Court justices too obscure for CQ's The Supreme Court Compendium to answer, think again.David Atkinson's book looks at only one thing - the circumstances in which US Supreme Court justices come to leave the bench and the details of their deaths. I suspect that some might consider this book the epitome of the scholarship of trivia but I would disagree. It has a very narrow focus but a larger and more important picture emerges from it - the reluctance of justices to leave the bench and the near impossibility of removing them against their will. By the time you have read it you may be surprised how many justices remained on the bench long past their &quot;sell by&quot; dates. It is also interesting to see the strange devices adopted by the court to work around the problems of coping with brain damaged, mentally unstable, or senile tenured colleagues.Atkinson's scholarship is impeccable - no justice is too obscure or their tenure too distant or too short for him to have unearthed nothing about them. The book details what is known about the circumstances in which each justice left the bench whether through death, resignation or retirement. For completeness Atkinson always gives details of the circumstances (both physical and medical) in which each justice died. The level of detail is extraodinary - it even includes details of members of the court attending their funerals or of justices who refused to sign their testimonials.My biggest headache was giving this book its star rating. I first considered a three star rating because in the ranks of Supreme Court studies this must bring up the rear. However, the book deserves to be judged in terms of what it set out to achieve: to catalog the circumsrtances in which justices leave the Supreme Court bench. Its achievement cannot be faulted in those terms and thus it earns its five stars.However, in quite different terms it also merits five stars. I bought this book mainly as a reference source but found myself reading it straight through. Because coverage is comprehensive and the section on each justice is short, the whole book is curiously addictive. 'Leaving the Bench' had to compete with my pleasure reading of John Grisham's novel The Brethren - and Mr Atkinson won. I'm not suggesting that University Press of Kansas has a dark horse best seller on its hands but this book really can be read with interest."},{"Title":"Leaving the Bench: Supreme Court Justices at the End","review":"This book gives the details on the death and/or retirement of every Supreme Court justice, and gathers information not easily found any place else. The book is meticulously researched, and presents, after the examination of the problems sometimes encountered with Supreme Court justices who would not resign, a simple and I think probably effective solution which would not require a Constituional amendment. The book also includes an appendix which lists the burial site of each Justice. Ten are buried in Arlington Cemetery and none are buried west of Boulder, Colorado. Anyone interested in Supreme Court history will find this book hard to lay down. I did."},{"Title":"Leaving the Bench: Supreme Court Justices at the End","review":"This was an approach studying indivdual justices rather than cases in describing the Supreme Court.

In most cases the info was Texas specific but at times it was not (e.g. \\"Many states have repealed their bulk sales law ... consult your secretary of state or attorney.\\") The chapter on business structures was 18 pages. It was pretty light on tax information and did not include any sample forms for incorporating, nor did it include a sample operating agreement for an LLC. I also thought the tax information for an LLC was confusing. The summary states that the profits and losses pass through the LLC to the owners for tax purposes. Later the author states, (paraphrasing) Even though the IRS has ruled the LLC will qualify as a partnership for tax purposes, Congress has yet to pass any legislation to that effect. A 1997 IRS decision allows sole proprietorships to convert to LLC status. \\"This \\"check-the-box\\" legislation allows LLC's to be treated as corporations or partnerships for tax purposes.\\" The chapter on setting up your office failed to provide any information on tax deductions. The marketing chapter has one paragraph on using the internet to market your business, so don't expect anything useful on setting up a web site. The chapter on insurance doesn't discuss errors and omissions insurance and basically states that a discussion of liability insurance is either beyond the scope of this book or you should consult your insurance agent. The chapter on accounting and finance is very lightweight."},{"Title":"How to Start a Business in Texas (Smartstart Series (Entrepreneur Press).)","review":"This is a valuable book (resource) for budding entrepreneurs. It seems to try to cover all the bases for starting a small business, but it can't do them all well in the space available between its covers. The book is only 288 pages long. If you are in the planning stages of starting a small business, then I highly recommend you get a copy of this book. Read it, study it, and outline it. There are helpful checklists to help you grasp the subjects. You will come up with a plethora of keywords and terms that you will want to google to find Web pages giving more detailed (and maybe more current) information.I am a SCORE counselor (Senior Corps of Retired Executives) who typically does face-to-face counseling sessions three nights a month. It would really be neat if my clients would read this book BEFORE they came to their session with me because they would pretty much be \\"educated customers\\" ready to ask educated questions. Our sessions would be so much more beneficial.My favorite chapters were:1. Initial business concerns2. Your business' structure3. Business start-up details5. Sources of business assistance (SCORE is mentioned here)7. Your smart business plan (and a good sample plan is included)8. Obtaining the financing you needThe book is weak when it comes to how the Internet can be used in corresponding, hiring, and marketing. But this is just one example of how googling keywords and concepts found in the book will make the book more complete. Don't treat the book as authoritative on the law. It isn't. Nor was it ever intended to be. It is light on tax information as it relates to small business.I was particularly impressed with the material presented in Chapter 2: Choice of Legal Entity. That subject is sorely ignored in most small business books, and it is critically important. It is a subject I regularly must spend a great deal of time discussing at my SCORE sessions. This book does a pretty good job on the topic.Chapters 4 and 9 through 12 are easy to find fault with. The topic of each could fill a book. But having these topics covered definitely will help a budding entrepreneur know some of the issues they raise.I would have liked the book more if Chapter 6 (marketing) had been less superficial. When I read it I got the impression that the author was more a public relations expert than a marketing expert. I generally categorize public relations as a subset of marketing. Marketing includes advertising, public relations, and a whole host of other promotion techniques. I did not get this message when I read the book. I also would have liked the book better if the Internet, email, and Web sites had been discussed more. But there are many books on those subjects. Therefore, I can't complain too much about the limited discussion of computers.When you read this book it may feel a little like it was produced on an assembly line. Maybe it was? There are 50 versions of this book sold; the only state I haven't found a copy for is Montana. Content is king, and this book has it. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors","review":"Definitely not an average beta=Ic/Ib book; it tells you the various factors that go into this equation (and more, of course). The discussion on noise and linearity is in-depth, and more importantly, touches upon circuit-level topics. There is plenty of actual measured data, as well as illustration of practical measurement techniques and sets.This book is suitable for senior-level undergraduate and graduate students, as well process, device and circuit engineers."},{"Title":"Silicon-Germanium Heterojunction Bipolar Transistors","review":"I think this book is very good for Semiconductor physics student but it is not good enough for circuit designer because I don't like Volterra series concept for analyzing nonlinearity of amplifiers and mixer. I know that there are different high frequency small and large signal equivalent circuit such as Mextram models from Philips and Hicum models from Germany.These models can be use to analyze and design frequency response and harmonic generation of any amplifiers and mixer schematics."},{"Title":"Vitamin C: The Master Nutrient","review":"this grate book is showing with great success the use, the effects, and the metabolism of this great vitamin,vitamin-c. the author is showing wonderful proofable works of this vitamin of many of the leading therapists, and researchers of this vitamin,including herself (she is a vitamin c researcher.she also explain the need and use of mega-doses in the cases of a few very sick diseases such as aids and others as well as cancer and arthritis,and also heart disease.the immune system is also get an explanation on the need and cooporation with vitamin c ,and in general-this is a very important book that i recommand to every health seeker."},{"Title":"The Red House","review":"as gothic and alluring as Lya's Island of the Dead, this book shows a different outlook on a life of a woman; on societal view of a woman as a caretaker and mother first, and only then as a person. Terrific, and, as any work of Luft's, a must read."},{"Title":"Gothic woman's fashion","review":"This book has copious illustrations, many in color, and many closeups of interesting details. It covers Bohemian dress from about 1325-1450. It works from paintings, illuminations, and sculptures, with just a few pictures of extant articles. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Gift of Imagination: the Story of Inner City Arts","review":"This is an important work. While politicians debate vouchers, schools defend programs, and psychologists analyze standardized tests, the inner-city youth are reduced to numbers, incentives, and statistical variables. This book approaches youth as people. Written and photographed by artists, the book offers fresh insight into the minds of children; what they think and feel. Whether a liberal or conservative, people should care about the thoughts of others, particularly society's offspring. The Gift of Imagination celebrates our greatest gift-- our ability to think as individuals."},{"Title":"The Supreme Court (Your Government: How It Works)","review":"It amazed me, as a casual student of American History, to find so many factual errors in this short children's book dealing with the US Supreme Court. It refers to Justices Wendell and Blackmun as Chief Justices of the Supreme Court when in fact they were Associate Justices. Although the book was published in 2000, it says that the Constitution has had only had 26 amendments, even though the 27th amendment was ratified in 1992.What's more, the book tells you very little about the actual workings of the court. It deals broadly with the court's historical importance which I personally found misleading since the title is &quot;Your Government: How it Works: The US Supreme Court&quot;.Arthur M. Schlesinger's name is shown on the cover as &quot;Consulting Editor&quot;. My best guess is that any consulting Mr. Schlesinger did on this one was strictly from a distance."},{"Title":"Engineering mechanics","review":"Timoshenko is considered as the 'father' of modern engineering mechanics. I think this book can be considered as the first introduction to mechanics in his series of 12 books ranging from elasticity to structural stability & vibrations. If you want to follow his line of thought and is preparing yourself to read his advanced books on elasticity or stability theory or plates and shells then this book should be considered as a starting point during your freshman year. This is the first book i was exposed to and had an opportunity to solve most of the book when i started my undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. In someways this is the book which provided me an introduction to problems in engineering (from mechanics perspective). The edition I used was in fps units. Later editions were in SI."},{"Title":"Engineering mechanics","review":"This hard- coved book is durable for long-time use.it gives a sound understanding of fundamental of engineering.I will recomend this book to young enginers."},{"Title":"Unlikely Duet (Caledonia Chronicles, Pt. 1.)","review":"I am from Caledonia, Michigan where this book tells its tale.

Currently this book is the most acurate and informative book out about this breed. Dave Putnam's dedication and work shows well as he tries and successfully covers most all aspects of the breed right down to known breeders."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"Dave's book was a nice fun read that truely depicts the versatile American Bulldog. What I enjoyed most was reading the stories about his experiences with his own dogs. Dave is willing to honestly share mistakes made and lessons learned, which is hard to find these days.Such honesty is invaluable to those of us getting into the breed for the first time, regardless of whether you want a working AB or not."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"As an amateur historian, I was impressed with the level of scholarship Mr. Putnam has brought to the subject. He cites numerous documents that indicate that this breed was common throughout the country before the introduction of the Pit Bull Terrier. From 19th century diary accounts to old southern ballads, he gives us written records that prove our breed is descended from the original bulldogs of England. It's nice to be able to have some proof against those who say the AB is nothing more than a glorified Pit Bull."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"It would be impossible to write the perfect book on American Bulldogs. Our breed certainly has its share of unknowns, but Dave Putnam did a great job in writing this book. His research and investigation allowed him to discuss aspects of the American Bulldog that are not widely known. Dave addressed American Bulldogs of all types with fairness and equality. He spoke of specific breeders and trainers yet he kept the American Bulldog in full focus. I highly recommend this book for the new comers to the breed as well as the old timers. It is a very interesting and educational reference source for the American Bulldog."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"This book is a very fun read with more information than I could have imagined. Putnam has very forceful opinions but grounds them in a hard foundation of common sense. My wife and I bought this book to better prepare ourselves for our first AB. The knowledge we gained will be invaluable to us as we grow with our puppy. I want to provide the best enviroment I can for my dog, and this book helps explain all those personality traits and breed traits that I need to understand. Thanks Dave."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"This book is wonderful for first time AB owners to seasoned veterans that want to know some background abou the dogs.

Tons of high quality pictures..with GREAT stories and history about the American Bulldog (the BEST breed in the world). I have read many other breed books and this by far is the best...

No help whatsoever on training a pet. In fact I wonder if these aren't just furry crocodiles after having read the book. Excellent book, great amount of work put into it, and the author must be knowledgable and experienced in raising and keeping a true working dog. He just makes amply clear this is no dog for an average home."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"This was a gift to my husband. He loves it!!! It has lots of pictures and great info on this dog. Would recommend! A+++A.W."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"If you are interested in the history of the American Bulldog, what they are capable of, and what drives them, this is a must-have book. Dave Putnam has done us all a major favor by putting this much information about the breed in one large, picture and fact-packed book. While others' may see him advocating pig-hunting and other \\"aggressive\\" work as being excessive and opinionate, I think it's for the best that potential owners of this intelligent, powerful breed know exactly what these dogs are capable of and how drivey they can be. Another review noted that Putnam clearly favors the Scott over the Johnson type, as if this were a detriment to the book. While I personally like a balance between the two types, Putnam's preference does not detract at all from the great information packed into this book. This is not a breed for everyone, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to give this dog the best life possible. You don't have to be a pig hunter or schutzen enthusiast to enjoy the dog as simply a household pet, plus it's very interesting to read about the work that modern A.B.'s are used for. I think Dave does an incredible job of educating anyone smart enough to want to know about the breed they have selected. Throw out all those other A.B. books which are nothing but cookie-cutter books with very little useful information about this breed. This is the one book you need to read and keep on hand if the A.B. is the breed you've decided to commit to."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"if you want a great look at all sides of these dogs, this is the book to buy. It is admittedly stacked towards working dogs, but, hey, it's a working breed. You'll learn about the dogs, the community, individual kennels, history - everything. If you're a bulldog person, I'm sure you already have it. If you don't have it, buy it and you'll become a bulldog person.Buy it. It's a great book."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"I really enjoyed this book for many reasons: 1)This is a good book for the history of the American Bulldog...there are not a lot of books out there on American Bulldogs 2)The pictures are awsome 3)Written very well.

No one could tell me what breed of dog this was. All I ever heard was, &quot;it is just a mutt&quot;. As the new movies have made this breed &quot;famous&quot;, I have heard a lot of skeptics on the breed(my husband and I have a 5 year old daughter), so I started researching; went to The Bulldog Bonanza in 2000 and met Dave. He is very knowledgable on the breed and his book is a must for anyone interested in this breed. We are expecting our first puppy to arrive in February 2001 and I feel like I am adopting a new baby. Dave's book has helped me get prepared for what to expect and I am very greatful for this publication!"},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"After researching all other publications on the american bulldog I must say Mr Putnams book is the best.Covering all aspects of the working bulldog past&amp; present providing objective informtion before not available to the american bulldog enthusiast .

Thanks Dave"},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"2 years ago I bought 4 month old American Bulldog puppy, the breeder informed that he will get confused with the pit bull and some places ban pit bulls such as parks and camp grounds so keep your registered pedigree papers handy. I didn't know too much about the AB at that time. I was at the pet store one day with my AB and a clerk said nice pit bull,I said no he is a American Bulldog clerk replied no it's pit bull breeders just changed their name. I started to think well is it; they do look a lot alike. I started research online about the breed and read AB's are a made up breed from St. Bernard's, mastiffs crosses with pit bulls, A large white Colby Pit bull bred to another large white pit bull. AB's are English bulldog from 200 years ago kept in tacked in the south. I didn't know what he was anymore until got this book. Dave Putnam breaks down all these theories every one of them, explains in great detail he helps YOU to make the judgment on what your AB is not someone else. Even Dave believes his own AB may have a drop or two of pit bull blood running through its veins. I recommend this book to anyone who owns or wants an American Bulldog... Great Book!!!"},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"The book by Putnam is now outdated, by a mile. It was a good book when it was published. The breed has developed into two or three breeds. Performance, standard (show), and Bully (totally show). The only ones that work anymore are the perfomance ones. In terms of info in the book, again, it is totally outdated and has no relavance anymore.This book is a classic. I would buy this book as a history lesson of this young breed. Bully dog fans may not be a big fan of this book, although it does mention some MGK stuff that Putnam had. Buy it."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"This is a terrific work, even better that the author autographed my copy! We have a female bulldog and this serves as an owner's manual as well as comprehensive history. Whether Mr. Putnam's accounting of the history of the American dog is accurate or not - and he admits that his are only theories - I find myself criticizing the UG football mascott for not being an original Georgia Bulldog.The sections on dog competitions were of little value to my dog, but they are interesting reading after browsing the other info. I do appreciate Putnam's candor in discussing dog fighting, a very difficult subject to present objectively in the 21st century. He neither condones nor condemns the practice, but explains the relevance to the temperament of the Bulldog as well as talking points to explain to neighbors and the uninformed that these are NOT the dreaded pitbull.Thanks Dave for the great book, I apologize for taking 11 months to review it!"},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"Exellent book on American Bulldogs.

I especially enjoyed the chapter on AB history as Mr. Putnam even-handedly presents several possible theories on the controversial origins of this breed, many of which I have not heard anywhere else. I also enjoyed reading about the author's first up close exposure to the sport of hog hunting.

The &quot;history&quot; part appears to be just another undocumented bedtime story. There isn't a bibliography so one can't review the &quot;research&quot;. Also, I actually became angry when I was trying to find out what &quot;philo-kuon&quot; meant. The book uses the term over and over. I guess it's assumed the reader already knows? No need to say that ther is neither a glossary nor an index. A large section of the book appears to be an advertisement for several breeders. Is this product placement advertising or just filler? The nutrition and exercise sections are small and don't quantify the methods. The book mearly offers simplistic descriptions. It is also unfortunate that the author doesnt leave his fondness for pit bulls for another book. He likens them to ABs over and over and over. If you think that the price of the book gets you THE authoritative book on ABs, you will be dissapointed. You can get the same info surfing the web. His editor should have done a better job of putting the book together. Dont buy this."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"This book is not at all what I expected!! This entire book seems to be about training your AB to win trophies and hunt....also to win trophies from that!!! It was a complete waste of my money and now I have to take the time to return it and wait patiently for my money and try to find something out there worth my time! I was very disappointed mostly because he speaks of AB's as practically the same Pit Bull's...which they definitely are not!! He makes then out to be vicious attack dogs and if you even try to suppress that in any way then you are a bad owner....BS!!NEWS FLASH!!!!

On top of that pictures of trainers beating the dogs with canes and clubs is hideous. Absolutely awful. What about owning this dog as a pet?? Where does that come in? This isn't the 16th century.."},{"Title":"The Working American Bulldog","review":"While this book has some fairly decent photos, it is not well written and is VERY opinionated!!

I've searched Websites, major book stores, libraries, and magizines, and no source, I repeat, no source, even comes close to giving you the depth and breadth of incisive information on American Bulldogs that Putnam's does. And not only is this the most accurate, comprehensive book available on this fine breed, it appears, to the best of my extensive research, to be the ONLY accurate, comprehensive book available on American Bulldogs. All of the other books I found offered nothing but trite, superficial information that you can easily find on a dozen Websites. In contrast, Putnam's in-depth examination of American Bulldogs and their breeders across our nation is thoughtful, well organized, well written, informative -- a true education on the breed. And even if I never hunt a wild boar in my life, I'm was glad to learn that my American Bulldog damn well could! Well done, Mr. Putnam.

The book is refreshingly free of the not-so-well disguised advertising for the Nylabone and other dog products.Dave does a good job of discussing the origin of the breed as well as the status of the breed today. There is a wealth of accurate information here with an unflinching analysis of the breed's temperament and tendencies for canine combat/aggression.Dave is clearly not a professional writer and his writing style is somewhat awkward in places. Also, Dave is not afraid to express his own personal opinions. While most of the book is based on solid factual information, some sections are based more on Dave's opinion and some of his explanations should be understood to have been &quot;filtered&quot; through his personal beliefs.

As one of the breeders mentioned within it's pages I assure you that our names are not found there as mere filler and we all sought no advertisement whatsoever. It is my honest belief that Mr. Putnam truely desired to gain perspective from those among us who have been involved with this breed for a number of years. This was proven by the amount of effort that he had personally put into both time and travel.

I own three AB books including this one and find this one by far the most comprehensive. Dave put's a lot of his own personal opinions in the book which would be expected since little history seems to be available on the AB, and that Dave probably has a lot more personal experience with his ABs than most of the audience for the book.

With that aside I still consider it \\"a most have\\" for any AB owner, except I think he should have change the name of the book from \\"The Working AB\\" to \\"My Working AB\\" seeing as how most of the text is about personal experiences of his dog, & not the breed in general."},{"Title":"Personal Identity (Topics in Philosophy)","review":"This is a first-rate anthology on personal identity that includes important historical work and recent (up to the 70s) discussions of the relevant issues. It begins with an informative introduction by Perry. The introduction presents the basic problem and the way philosophers traditionally have thought about it. Then Perry gives a summary of most important points made in the historical material included in the anthology.What is the question of personal identity? Basically, it's the question of what makes a person one and the same person through time. I assume I'm very same person I was two days ago, two months ago, two years ago, two decades ago, etc. Given that I've changed a great deal over that period of time, how could this be? It seems like I, the very person sitting here and typing this now, was once an undergraduate planning to go to grad school, once a high school student getting ready for college, once a elementary school kid, and once a newborn baby. But it's clear that I don't look or think a lot like those previous people who appear to be one and the same as I am. There's been a lot of physical and psychological change over time, and yet I think I'm the very same person I was at those various times. How could that be?And this is a philosophical issue that seems to have practical ramifications. It appears to have consequences for how we understand ourselves and other people: Does a person survive radical amnesia? How about brain death? Could a person survive after bodily death? Could there be multiple people in the same body at the same time? If a person's memories, beliefs, desires, etc. change so that there's little or no connection to her previous self, is she really the same person at all anymore? Consequences for how we relate to people: If my friend suffers from amnesia and never recovers his prior memories, is he really still my friend (is he still the same person I knew before)? If my mother is dying from a disease that has left her little more than a body rotting away in a hospital bed, is she still really my mother (i.e. the same person who raised me)? And moral consequences: Is a fetus a person? If a person's psychology has radically changed over time, is it still fair to hold her responsible for things she did long ago (maybe she's no longer the person who did whatever we want to hold her responsible for)?Now, clearly, it's pointless to try to summarize even the most important ideas that you'll find in the readings collected here. There are too many positions, too many important arguments, and too many interesting issues to say much of importance about the anthology as a whole. But I will try to give you some sense of the contents here.The first reading is from the seminal work on this topic, namely Locke's discussion in his Essay concerning Human Understanding. In a few justly famous thought experiments, Locke argues against the view that personal identity consists in identity of immaterial soul over time and the view that it consists in identity of body over time. He then proposes a version of the view that personal identity consists in the stages of a person sharing memories of previous stages. This is followed by more recent essays by Paul Grice and Anthony Quinton in which they defend views similar to Locke's. These two essays are responses to problems raised in the next two essays, both of which include classic objections to Locke's memory theory of personal identity. Joseph Butler argues that Locke's view begs the question since any accurate account of memories presupposes an account of personal identity. Thomas Reid argues that Locke's view fails to respect the transitivity of identity in some cases. And then there are two more readings querying the plausibility of the memory view, one by Sydney Shoemaker and one by Perry himself.Then the anthology moves on from discussions of the memory view to other views about personal identity. The first alternate view is Hume's. In some famous material from his Treatise of Human Nature, he argues that there is no personal identity over time. Two of the remaining three papers argue for similar conclusions. Derek Parfit argues both that there may be no personal identity over time, and that identity isn't what matters through time. It is perfectly rational, he thinks, to care about the future of beings with psychologies similar to ours even if we aren't identical to them; and this is supposed to have important practical consequences. Thomas Nagel argues that our concept of a person main not apply in certain real-world cases of brain bisection, and he thinks that such cases may show that our concept of a person doesn't even apply to us in our normal condition. The final paper in the collection is by Bernard Williams. He argues that there seem to be cases in which bodily continuity is more important than psychological continuity.While the reader should look elsewhere for the state of the art on the issues, I'd recommend this anthology to anyone interested in personal identity. Nearly all of these papers are classics that you ought to know if you're going to more recent work on this issue, and so it's still well worth buying even if you're more interested in contemporary thought about the topic."},{"Title":"Personal Identity (Topics in Philosophy)","review":"Perry's anthology on the philosophy of personal identity has a good selection of analytic articles and essays, but little information that actually introduces and explores the field, which is especially necessary for those approaching the field for the first time. Neither does the text include certain study tools which would be extremely useful and would assist in a better treatment and understanding of the topic (such as a glossary of terms important to personal identity, etc.). All in all, I think the text could be greatly improved if it were more user-friendly and updated."},{"Title":"Personal Identity (Topics in Philosophy)","review":"There are several other excellent collections of essays on the philosophical problem of personal identity over time;this is the only indispensable one. It contains Locke's seminal treatment of the problem, and the famous criticisms by Butler and by Read. Selections from Hume's Treatise includes the often omitted, enigmatic appendix (second thoughts). Bernard Williams' \\"The Self and the Future\\" and Derek Parfit's \\"Personal Identity\\" are probably the two most influential papers on personal identity in the last hundred years."},{"Title":"Personal Identity (Topics in Philosophy)","review":"This is a terrific collection of works on problems concerning personal identity (what are the criteria for personal identity? is personal identity presupposed by the criterion of memory? does personal identity matter?) including both historical pieces (Locke, Hume, Butler, Reid) and contemporary ones (Grice, Williams, Perry, Parfit.) It's a great introduction to the issues, but an introduction you'll not want to leave behind."},{"Title":"Personal Identity (Topics in Philosophy)","review":"Personal identity has a long history, and so it's worth going back to John Locke, as Perry does. My hope for the second edition was that it would add enough contemporary philosophy to bring the anthology up to the present. After all, I would trust Perry to choose contemporary articles wisely. I'm disappointed that he opted to do very little of that. The new material in the second edition is:(1) a new preface, explaining the significance of the additional articles;(2) Sydney Shoemaker's \\"Persons and Their Pasts;\\" (1970)(3) \\"Selections from the Clarke-Collins Correspondence\\" (a series of letters exchanged between 1706-8), excerpted by William Uzgalis;(4) an article about that correspondence, written by Uzgalis, \\"Locke and Collins, Clarke and Butler, on Successive Persons;\\"(5) \\"Williams on the Self and the Future,\\" by John Perry (based on a 1976 review)(6) The \\"Suggestions for Further Reading\\" on the last two pages of the book have been substantially updated. Many of those recommendations point us toward other anthologies, though. If you're looking for specific guidance, like, What are some excellent contemporary articles that advance this historical debate?, it isn't there.The second edition preserves all of the material from the first edition."},{"Title":"None But a Blockhead","review":"Larry King gives a wry, funny insight into the writer's life and his own experience. Some of it is hilarious, as in the Hollywood producer who tries to get him to write a story for free."},{"Title":"None But a Blockhead","review":"A history of the way writing was before the Internet. Now anyone can put digital books online and sell a reasonable quantity by blogging, YouTube commercials, and never have ink put on paper. For printed books, with Print On Demand, they can be sold through Amazon and other outlets without the need to &#34;wine and dine&#34; publishers or agents.Marginal copy gets &#34;published&#34; but I believe that readers are better off without New York Publishers standing between them and the authors. As is otherwise true when buying on the Internet, &#34;Buyer Beware&#34; may be more critical than ever."},{"Title":"None But a Blockhead","review":"King wrote None But a Blockhead as the inside story of what it's really like to slave over a book, work with literary agents, publishing houses, and other writers. For anyone who has designs on getting published (or not), it's a revealing and highly entertaining work. Bonus: King developed a style that I can only call Twainesque. He is humorous in the same manner as his idol, but with the stamp of his own originality. Whether you like to write, or just read about writers, you'll enjoy."},{"Title":"None But a Blockhead","review":"This is a wonderful book about the trials and successes of being a work-a-day freelance wordsmith. Anyone interested in making a go in the freelance magazine trade should read this."},{"Title":"OLLIE: The Ollie Butler Story","review":"David Kniss, the author and former Butler player, readily admits that this book was somewhat rushed - 16 months in the making - considering Coach Butler's 32 year career. And while this is true, Kniss still delivers a cohesive timeline of Butler's life.To anyone associated with the High Desert, Butler is an icon - a man who won more than 600 games throughout his career. Having played for Butler in the late '80s, I can truly say that he is one of the few men I admired growing up and I admire even more in posterity. Not only for the example that he set as an individual, but for his tireless effort in building a program that the entire community could rally behind.And while it's admittedly a \\"regional\\" book, I feel its appeal would have been far greater if Mr. Kniss had asked tougher questions - particularly about Butler's feud with former principal Julian Weaver. Another component this book lacks is an assessment of the impact Butler has had on his players lives. Many of his former players, myself included, still communicate with him.Despite its shortcomings, however, Kniss delivers a solid book on a legendary man. Now, hopefully Kniss will try his hand at documentary filmmaking."},{"Title":"OLLIE: The Ollie Butler Story","review":"This book is a great read.It reads like a research paper, but as family, I really enjoyed reading it.The first couple of chapters really kept me interested, since it had family history. I'm not much of a sports fan, but I felt Kniss' passion for the game and his respect and admiration for my uncle. I can tell that it took a lot of research and hours of work to put it together. I especially enjoyed getting in-depth accounts of stories that I have only heard in passing over the years. I never fully realized how much my Uncle O.J. went through to get to where he is today. And I probably wouldn't if it weren't for Mr. Kniss."},{"Title":"Northern Frights 2 (v. 2)","review":"The Northern Fright Series is a series that showcases some of the best dark fanstasy stories written by Canadian writers. Though labeled \\"Dark Fantasy,\\" many of the stories included in this book traverse both the horror and dark fantasy genres. The stories are well diversed and they touch on different elements of fear. The stories are all entertaining and the writers are the the top of the genres. One of the few negatives of the book, and the series, is the poor work of editing done by Mr. Don Hutchison. Every once in a while, you will come across the wrong pronoun used, insufficient spacing between commas and words, to name a few errors in this book.All in all, this is a great horror anthology, and it's a must read for the true horror fan."},{"Title":"Compass American Guides : Hawai'i","review":"This book makes an interesting read, even if you don't plan on going to Hawaii - I give it four stars because of two things: the irrelevant underwater photos, and the lack of detail. This guidebook has murky underwater b&amp;w photos of dolphins or whales or something for chapter headings - pretty much useless. The photos of natural Hawaii places (for instance the two page spread of Wainamamahea (sp.?) Beach in Maui) are beautiful, and more should have been included. It's best to buy a Let's Go Hawaii or Rough Guide to go along with this book...it glosses over a lot of the details of actually having a decent trip.The stories of the people of Hawaii, and the vignettes about each town make this book a worthwhile purchase. This Compass series of guidebooks is great."},{"Title":"The Mother of All Windows 98 Books","review":"I bought and read &quot;The Mother of All Windows&quot; when I bought my first PC with Windows 3.1. I bought and read &quot;The Mother of All Windows 95&quot; the day it came out. I was bugging our local book store weekly for a copy of &quot;The Mother of All Windows 98&quot;, because there are no other Windows books like them and I knew MOM 98 would not disappoint. And it didn't! The MOM books are the only computer books I've read cover to cover. They are packed with information available no where else because they are all based on the real shipping version of the Windows product and are written based on real-time testing and experience. MOM98 is not only packed with information Microsoft does not even publish or publishes inaccurately, but it communicates that information in a manner that is simple, straight forward, honest, and wrapped with humor. The portion of MOM98 I find most valuable is the in depth look at everything you ever wanted to know about the Windows 98 registry. The &quot;Fast Track&quot; section is also an important and quick way for the experienced Windows 95 user to get a handle on the differences between Win95 and Win98 and decide if the new features are worth the upgrade. I must point out though that past readers of MOM95 will notice a significant amount of duplication of data between MOM95 and MOM98. But despite the duplication, there is still a ton of new data unique to Win98 to be gleaned from the pages of MOM98. MOM had to duplicate the data to make the book a complete reference for those new to the Windows world. One thing I missed with MOM98 was the CDROM. MOM98 has no CDROM, but does now have its own dedicated web site with an electronic newletter which MOM98 readers can subscribe too. I've already received two copies of the newsletter and found them to be significant supplements to the data in the book. They will provide new and late-breaking information on Window's 98 to help you keep up with the inevitable changes. All in all, MOM98 is a must have in my opinion. I've recommended it as the primary Windows resource to any and all of my co-workers. They all agree it is great!"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],C={key:0},P={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",P,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",C,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const D=u(M,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-7f3f21e7"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/22.md","filePath":"guide/22.md"}'),j={name:"guide/22.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{q as __pageData,L as default};
