The message here is certainly Dr. Maltz's but the presentation and writing are too dry, too wordy, too nineties, and too gimmicky for me. The original Psycho-Cybernetics published in the sixties virtually changed my life and how I look at myself and the world. I was happy to find that the original is still in print and decided to give that one to my daughter instead. My yellowing tattered old copy is still in my personal library having travelled all over the country with me from house to house to house and surviving several major bookshelf lightenings over the past thirty-five years. The late Dr. Maltz should be canonized for his insightful and timeless therapeutic messages, and his excellent presentation of his various theses. While Dr. Sommer's Psycho-Cybernetics 2000 brings his message a little more up to date, the original book is by no means dated except for an innocently pre-feminist, mostly male, fifties/sixties orientation. But Psycho-Cybernetics 2000 just doesn't flow as smoothly as the original, nor is it as compellingly written. Though it might, however, be better received by those not familiar with the original, I was probably spoiled by what I think is a more inspirational presentation. Either way, the psycho-biological message is unassailable in my professional biologist eyes. Maybe both books should be on one's library shelves since Psycho-Cybernetics 2000 is written from a somewhat different utilitarian perspective than the original Psycho-Cybernetics."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"Although I like the book, nothing can compare to the original. Read Psycho-Cybernetics by Maltz or the revised version by Kennedy first. I read both versions and you can't go wrong with either one. Then if you're serious about implementing the ideas/methods of Psycho-Cybernetics in your life, read Psycho-Cybernetics 2000. This book has numerous examples of how people use the ideas and methods of Psycho-Cybernetics to overcome hardships/trials and tribulations in their lives. There are also helpful techniques in this book that are not mentioned in the other versions. Great book!"},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"Instead of just saying have a good outlook, this book tellshow to control your thoughts towards the happiness andsuccess we all want.

I found out quickly that you can't improve on something that is so wonderful and that if you are going to write a book, at least try to do something original. Ms. Sommer's book leaves one flat and uninspired much like the text. Buy the original, it's still the best!!"},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I give this book 2 stars because the author tried so hard. And I really believe she wishes to help others with this dubious &quot;re-make&quot; of the original &quot;Psycho-Cybernetics.&quot; To even begin to attempt to improve on Maxwell Maltz's ingenious and bestselling work, the author should have been extremely sure that she had some extra information of benefit to people. Instead, she offers trite interpretations on the original work, and seems to be mostly concerned that we remain politically correct in remembering that both male and female can benefit from this book. The author then gets preachy and pedantic (referring to the agoraphobic client of hers) and tries very hard to write something helpful, but instead ends up with a cumbersome tome' that says a whole lot about nothing. You would be far better off buying the classic, &quot;Psycho-Cybernetics&quot; by Dr. Maltz published in the early 1960's. Bottom line: If you attempt to improve on perfection, you had better be sure you have an honest shot at it. The author failed and it is strikingly obvious.

The writing is clear and the concepts are easily understood. I would have liked more updated information about the biology and study of the concepts but maybe that's for another book. If you're familiar with modern self-help there won't be anything shocking here but it's interesting to read about it in the original language so to speak. I was happily surprised by the comprehensiveness of the book: there are chapters on the basics, goal setting, changing your beliefs, and putting all the concepts together. Something you won't see in many other self-help books is a chapter on what to do when nothing is working. I liked the book and would recommend it as a good starting place."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"A beautiful book dedicated to the true essence of the teachings of Dr Maxwell Maltz.

It is hard to change your life if you can't even get through the book. Save your money and buy the original version."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"This book contains sound advice and concrete steps that, if followed properly, will help enhance and improve your self-image. According to the founder of Psycho-Cybernetics, Maltz Maxwell, the concept of self-image is irrefutably the most important aspect of our lives; once we have gained a positive self-image we will feel much better both mentally and physically. Thus, self-image is crucial to maintaining mental and physical health. Maxwell goes even farther holding that whether or not we succeed in our professional life depends to a great extent on how we view ourselves. Having a positive self-image makes it much easier to achieve our goals. One way to improve our self-image is to revise our thinking and to stop focusing on negative events. Also, the way we think about the aversive events in our life must change, it is imperative that we do not dwell on them. Instead of allowing these events to impair our self-image, we should act on them by actively finding adequate solutions. More importantly, the events to which we have no immediate solutions or over which we have no control should be completely ignored. Another important point made in this book is that we can control our emotional responses and this is an extremely powerful tool. Subsequently, we can decide how we want to feel or what we wish to think, according to Maltz.The basic principle of Psycho-Cybernetics is actually quite simple: what you think in your conscious mind eventually becomes automatized in your subconscious mind. This means that if you decide that you believe in yourself and that you control your own life, these beliefs will soon be stored in your subconscious mind. An analogy is appropriate here: when learning to drive a car, initially you have to coordinate a number of different steps. As practice makes perfect, gradually these steps become automatized and you will no longer need to consciously monitor every step in order to drive. This is a crucial process because once your positive self-image becomes an inherent part of your subconscious mind then the process will be complete.While this book is interesting and many techniques found in it are useful, there are shortcomings. First, it is common sense that positive self-esteem and self-image play a pivotal role in every individual's life. We all know that optimistic thinking promotes not only mental but also physical health. Moreover, techniques outlined in this book do not constitute anything new or revolutionary; people already know that they must challange their false beliefs and replace them with new ones. Like all other self-help books, even this one tends to be simplistic, repetitive and occasionally tedious.Psychologists have long known that human behavior is dynamic, unpredictable and extremely complex. To explain why we think the way we do in one book is impossible. Most authors of self-help books tend to downplay the significance of highly important factors such as childhood in shaping an individual's personality. Even those vaguely familiar with psychology know that a cognitive theory (the one on which all self-help books are based) has serious drawbacks. Thus, in order to fully understand how self-esteem works we must take an integrated approach, the one involving the findings of cognitive, behaviorist, psycho-analytical and biological theories. Failure to interweave these theories will inevitably result in simplistic and flawed analyses. Simply telling someone to be optimistic will prove insufficient in the long run.Popular psychology, I like to call it sensationalist, frequently promises fast results with no or little effort but almost always offers seriously flawed and superficial analyses. One final comment: whenever you come across a title of the book that sounds too good to be true, then skip it. Despite its oversimplified analysis, Psycho-Cybernetics does however provide an insight into the immense importance of self-esteem/self-image in every person's life. Please note that it is not my intent to discourage you from purchasing this book. On the contrary, it is always best to read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I enjoyed the original Psych-Cybernetics when it came out. This version is moreup to date in connecting psych-cybernetics to moderndiscoveries about how the brain works. The political correctness is a little overdone, emphasizing thatthe technique can be used by women who have careers, minorities, etc., but I guess one expects that sort of thing in the ninetees. I study the book a little every day, although I have already read it once through. Excellentfor people interested in the brain."},{"Title":"Psycho Cybernetics 2000","review":"I personally beleive with different pesonalities, characteristics,and backgrounds theres not one formula for everybody.I found this book to be a boring read,I had trouble with it keeping my attention. What's the use writing a book if it doesn't captures its audience? Another negative is gender,although I could care less someone else might not feel the same. I also found out from my personal experience, is when someone puchases a self improvement book they are looking for some kind of peace much like one that goes to a religous organization, so I take it serious when a book with such good principles in it has forgotten to basically motivate its reader into not wanting to put the book down until you know the book like you breathe.To sum it up, if you read regurly then get ready to soak up the knowledge,dissect it and study it as if you is takeing a class course the principles wiil work.

The book is nonsensical, immature and does not in any sense of the word deliver anything to the Reader in the way of entertainment.

I'll walk down Bull St. with a newer appreciation now. This brings historic reality to the district whereas \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\\" is modernized. There's more to the 13th colony than it's dramatic opulence.The story line was fun, quick to read and full of Christmas spirit ... which tended to be the reason that interlinked the Union troops and the Reb families during Savannah's 'momentary capture'. Once you realize the wit and wisdom of the hospitableMayor Arnold \\"giving\\" Savannah to the Union and President Lincoln, you realize why the district was not torchedand destroyed. An ingenius ploy that allows us today to relishthe original beauty and history of the \\"true\\" area and it's squares of Spanish Moss & Magnolia magnificence.

I also appreciated Gen'l Sherman being humanized by his fatherly intrigue with little spitfire Hattie."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"Having thoroughly enjoyed \\"Charleston\\", I was excited to find that John Jakes new novel was in a similar vein. The new book, set in December of 1864, examines the city of Savannah during Sherman's occupation during the holidays. The book attempts to show that though the country was divided, they were still Americans, this illustrated by the generosity of either side at times during this time. This was a feel good novel, but not very deep."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"Initially, I was very disappointed with John Jakes' follow-up to &lt;strong>Charleston&lt;/strong> -- &lt;strong>Savannah: or a Gift from Mr. Lincoln&lt;/strong>. The former's intense look at the history of one of the South's bastion's during the Civil War was not only entertaining, but educational. I found &lt;strong>Savannah&lt;/strong> quite the opposite. The wonderful history of the city and the intricacies of Union occupation is ignored (for Savannah history, read &lt;strong>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&lt;/strong>), in favor of simple if but comically melodramatic (and predictable) plot lines.With this novel, Jakes' writing style is turned end-over-end - the intricate military maneuvers blended with history that has become his trademark is replaced with snappy, sometimes snide, character observations made amongst truly sentimental dialogue. At times, I thought I was reading one of the serials common to an 18th century Harper's Bazaar or other periodical.Although this novel would not appeal to those expecting the typical Jakes immersion into history, it is a good introduction to historical fiction for youth - readers aged 12 to 18. It has the right amount of history, but the sentimentality and comic timing appealing for those teens who usually avoid an educational plot."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"I envy those who enjoyed this book for there can't be much that displeases them. The overrated author is way off course in his work. It's another rambling, incoherent work with a massive amount of unimpressive, unsympathetic characters. A novel is supposed to evoke emotion. This book evokes as much emotion as reading a telephone book.Savannah lost me as I tried to figure out the shape of this thing. I have to say that I started to read it a second time supposing that I surely must have missed something along the way. But after a third, I simply could not go on with the same excruciatingly boring read.After reading some of the early \\"Kents\\" and North and South Trilogy, I have to conclude that the author is one of the most overrated authors of historical fiction of our time.The author's only works of note in the his entire body of work are North and South Books I & II where the Hollywood miniseries adaptor was able to extract a good story for TV by changing and deleting from these verbose works filled with amateurish prose.Not only are the stories of these books like Savannah flat, but the structure, like North and South, is \\"telling\\" not \\"showing\\" and the prose quality is that of a beginning creative writing student, which is why a reader can't \\"get into\\" the characters.It must be that there are people around the author praising him for this stuff, when he should be questioning his failures while seeking to improve."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"Iv'e liked his ability to weave history in with characters and their stories, so I say \\"It's a great read for all of his works\\".

The main character is a young girl, which makes the book feel like it is geared toward the teenage crowd.

I was expecting something similar to Charleston with its complex families and detailed descriptions of places and events. My main purpose for reading this book was the hope that I would learn a little more about a city I enjoy visiting. Obviously, I was unable to get a better view of the city of Savannah and I got little worth out of the book in general."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"John Jakes has again written a historical novel that holds the reader's attention. The book begins with an introduction by the author giving a synopsis of the historical period the novel is about. There is even period music with Dulcimers and Banjos.Any student of history knows of Sherman's march to the sea. Savannah is about that march and of the hardships of a city caught in the path of war. It is set at Christmas time 1864. The main characters are a Yankie reporter named Stephen Hopewell, a Southern plantation owner Sara Lester and her daughter, Sara's friend, Miss V and a Yankie Sargent named Winks. These characters come together to prove that even in war and on opposite sides love conquers all. Winks doesn't like Negros and yet saves one from drowning. Sara, a widow, believes she should hate Yankies. Daughter, Hattie, finds growing up doesn't stop just because a war is going on. She even finds herself making demands of General Sherman himself.There were so many characters, that at times, it was hard to keep them all straight but as the novel went on, it became easier and was well worth listening to the novel.

I live just outside of Savannah, and I am a student of history. This is the first John Jakes novel I have read, but I know much about the history of the area.I found the book extremely accurate in the historical details of Christmas 1864 in Savannah. I would agree with the other reviewers that the plot was not too complex, although in fairness to Mr. Jakes, the plot does have some twists and surprises, especially in what happens to Tybee Jo and an ex-slave named Zip. The book may have been written for a young audience, particularly with the young boy and girl featured so prominently in the story, and the lack of profanity in the book, but I'm 47 years old, and I found the story very enjoyable. There is a lot of humor, such as the feisty little girl, Hattie, who dares to kick the shins of General Sherman.

LINCOLN by John JakesOctober 22, 2004I've read a number of books by John Jakes, and this one is definitely going to be remembered as my least favorite. John Jakes is known for his epic-like historical novels that have almost soap-opera-ish story lines, but they are great entertainment and always are known for name-dropping. And while SAVANNAH does include a few famous historical characters, for the most part it is does not compare to the likes of THE KENT FAMILY CHRONICLES or the NORTH AND SOUTH trilogy.SAVANNAH is a much simpler novel, a story focusing on several people living in the South at the height of the Civil War. It takes place in this famous town of Georgia, and reads pretty much like a Young Adult novel, which I suspect, was intentional. This story line leads to Christmas, and one can imagine that Jakes wanted this book to be read by young and old alike.One of the main characters is Harriet, a precocious twelve-year old who is outspoken and head strong. She is an endearing character, stands out and helps makes the novel interesting. In fact, the characters are what kept me reading. Jakes has a talent for creating characters that are likeable, and he uses them to tell his stories that are right out of the history books. This book would have been so much better if it were geared towards adults, but it is possible Jakes wanted to try something different. I am not sorry for having read SAVANNAH, but it is not a book I would highly recommend except for the most ardent fan."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"Georgia, November 1864.

Hattie is a tomboy and a spit-fire in her own right, and she can often be seen leading her pig Amelia around on a leash. Hattie is convinced that she'll reach out and kick any Yankee that tries to come near her. (And she eventually does!) Much of this story follows Hattie and her mother as they deal with their situation.Along the way we meet other representative characters who interact with the Lesters and with each other. Legrand Parmenter is a neighbor and friend to Hattie who leaves to join the fight. Captain Stephen Hopewell is a reporter attached to the Union army, originally from New York state. Zip is a newly-released slave who follows the army ranks. Tybee Jo Swett is a prisoner released from the capital city of Milledgeville, and he makes his way back to Savannah to finish his business. Alpheus Winks is a Union sergeant from Putnam County, Indiana, whose small band of men \\"forage liberally\\" throughout the countryside. Isaiah Flegg is a New Jersey carpetbagger who kidnaps blacks and ships them north to substitute for Union men choosing not to fight. The Drewgoods are relatives of the Lesters who deem themselves in a higher class. And then there's General William Tecumseh Sherman himself, who makes a few appearances and interactions of his own.\\"Savannah\\" is not as long or as detailed as past Jakes volumes, and it is not the best book he's ever written. It's still worthy of reading, though, especially since it highlights a portion of our history that I suspect is unfamiliar to many of us. And it will surprise those readers who believe the same stories and rumors that Hattie and her mother heard before encountering the Yankees themselves."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"If you are a fan of the 1976 bicentennial series by Jakes you will think he has become mentally feeble and lost all writing ability. If you are a history buff you will abhor this book. If you are a first time reader of the Civil War and think darkies sang zippidy doo dah through their slavery you will LOVE this book. I believe Mr. Jakes has lost his perspective on history and is just tired of writing but writes because he has a \\"name\\". Sometimes it is just best to stop until you have an epiphany or just stop because the well is dry. I would advise Civil War readers to pass this one by. I am donating my copy to the library."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"What a disappointment. Savannah reads as if it were written for ages 12-14. Charleston was superbly done. Savannah doesn't have the depth, the character development of Jakes' other works. It's almost childish....as a history scholar, I can assure you that Cump Sherman had no heartwarming \\"cute\\" encounters with children. He was a cold hard man, a professional soldier, doing a bitter job. He spared little in the way of warmth to anyone."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"Sure its not perfect but this book is a heck of a lot better then what passes for historical fiction nowadays. While the characters and the resolutions are a little convenient there is still a satisfying conclusion and I can't understand what everyone is complaining about"},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"I wait with anticipation for John Jakes to complete a new book. I enjoyed \\"Charleston\\" but \\"Savannah\\" is a disappointment. I usually can't put Jakes' books down, this one was hard to pick up. When I retired from teaching in 2001, my first \\"fun thing\\" to do was to re-read the Kent Family Chronicles. I accomplished it within a month. It took me almost a month to read \\"Savannah\\". It lacked character development and suspense. I will be waiting for his next book though, as I am a life long fan."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"Very disapointed. For an author I would follow (buy) anywhere, this book seems like a kids version of what could have been a much more developed and detailed novel along the lines of Jakes other masterpieces. Even paying a discounted ~$15.00, I feel I was ripped off. Hope it is not a portent of things to come."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"When writing reviews I usually try to put them at a length of about 500 words, give or take a few. However, upon contemplating this review of John Jakes' latest work of historical fiction, \\"Savannah, or a Gift for Mr. Lincoln,\\" I think I would find it difficult to find 250 words to say about it much less 500. I anxiously await the release of any new John Jakes novel. I was slightly disappointed by \\"Charleston\\" as not meeting previous John Jakes standards, such as \\"The Kent Family Chronicles\\" or his masterwork, the \\"North and South\\" trilogy. So imagine my surprise when my slight disappointment with \\"Charleston\\" turned into extreme disappointment with \\"Savannah.\\"I can really say nothing about the plot of \\"Savannah\\" as after having read it, I remember precious little of anything that happened between its covers. I dare any John Jakes reader to say that about any of his other books. But what I do remember of the story centers around 12 year-old Hattie Lester's attempts to save her family's plantation, \\"Silvergrass,\\" from the soldiers of Union General William T. Sherman, who have arrived just outside of Savannah from their march through Georgia in December of 1864.Only half of my disappointment in \\"Savannah\\" lies at the foot of John Jakes himself. It is too simplistically written. His characters are underdeveloped and there is next to no plot. At best \\"Savannah\\" should be called a short story. It does not by any means or stretch of the imagination live up to the John Jakes works of the past, in which the writing is good, the characters fully developed, and the plotlines, though somewhat resemble modern day soap operas, are often interconnected. Indeed, \\"Savannah\\" seems to have been written for the young reader of between 10 or 12 years old, and if that is the case then Mr. Jakes can and should be forgiven.I reserve the other half of my disappointment in \\"Savannah\\" to the publisher, Dutton. As sited above, \\"Savannah\\" is in reality a short story, and the editors of Dutton have done their best to lengthen it into a full-fledged novel, or at least something that resembles a novel.First I'll tackle the size of this book. All of my other hard cover John Jakes books measure 9.5\\" x 6.5\\" while \\"Savannah comes in at a wimpy 8.5\\" x 6\\" and when placed on a shelf next to her sister John Jakes novels, she appears to be slightly out of place.Secondly, Dutton has succeeded in lengthening \\"Savannah\\" to a novel of 288 pages, not only by the reduced size of this book as already stated, but by using a substantial font size and line spacing to give the book lots of \\"white space,\\" and they also threw in a couple of illustrations for good measure as well.Thirdly, if my theory of John Jakes writing this novel for a much younger audience is correct, I then fault the marketing department at Dutton for not marketing it as such. Even if this was marketed as a children's book many John Jakes fans, such as myself, would have purchased the book because it was a John Jakes book with the full knowledge that it was written for children and would not have been disappointed at all by it.And lastly, Dutton further aggravated my disappointment in this book by its inflated cover price of $23.95. I refused to buy it at that price, even though it was a John Jakes book, and waited until it was 50% off to buy it at my local book store, and even then I felt like I had been robbed.But the question is can I recommend this book. Well that's a tricky question to answer and my recommendation would depend on who was asking me. If you are a die-hard John Jakes fan who froths at the mouth at the mere mention of a new John Jakes book hitting the shelf, then yes, I would recommend it, with the reservation that the book is geared to a younger audience, and as such the characters and plots are much simpler than regular John Jakes fare. If you are 10 to 12 years old with an interest in the Civil War, I would recommend this book for you, as it seems to have been written with younger readers in mind. But if your are an avid reader of historical fiction where fully developed characters struggle to over come adversities of their time, and revel in the detail of such, no I would not recommend this book. And to the casual reader, I offer, \\"read it. You might like it, but don't blame me if you don't.\\"Okay so I did have more than 250 words to say about \\"Savannah.\\" This review came in at 805 words."},{"Title":"Savannah or a Gift For Mr. Lincoln","review":"I've read each and every word ever written by Mr. Jakes.Been a long time fan.And yes I do agree with most everyone else here, this book was just a little less that I expected of him.But, I'll admit I compared it to his earlier masterpieces.the North & South TrilogyCharlestonOn Secret ServiceWhich, when you think about it, isn't really fair.so, in conclusion, I did enjoy the book.

Much better than his post presidency books that are the same thing over and over again."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"Published in 1962, \\"Six Crises\\" by Richard Nixon is easily one of the best-written and most interesting books done by a US President. This book was a bestseller and even today it is regarded as a worthwhile read, largely because of its' insights into Nixon's mind and character. Fittingly, the book isn't an autobiography or a political memoir; instead it focuses upon what Nixon considered to be the six greatest moments of his political career up to 1961. The first crisis is the infamous \\"Hiss Case\\" in 1948, which elevated Nixon - then an unknown junior Congressman - into national prominence for the first time. The case started when Whittaker Chambers, a former Communist-turned-AntiCommunist magazine editor, accused Alger Hiss, a high-ranking member of the State Department, of being a Communist spy for Russia. The case made national headlines, and Nixon - a member of a congressional committee investigating Communism in the US - used the case as a springboard to the US Senate. The second crisis occurred during Nixon's first Vice-Presidential campaign in 1952, when he was accused by the press of being a crook who took bribes. Eisenhower considered forcing Nixon to resign as his running mate, but Nixon saved his career with the famous \\"Checkers\\" speech on national television (Nixon prefers to call it the \\"Fund\\" speech). The third crisis happened in 1955 when President Eisenhower had a serious heart attack, and until he recovered Vice-President Nixon had to be the \\"acting President\\" for a few weeks - a delicate task, but one Nixon performed quite well. In 1958 Vice-President Nixon and his wife Pat made a \\"goodwill\\" tour to South America, but were attacked and nearly killed by pro-Communist mobs in Venezuela - thus the fourth crisis. The fifth crisis came a year later when Nixon went to Moscow, where he engaged in a famous debate with Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev in a mock American \\"kitchen\\" that had been set up to show Russians how the ordinary American family lived. Although the debate was heated, most observers felt that Nixon had gotten the better of Krushchev. The most interesting part of the book for me was the last crisis - the legendary 1960 presidential campaign between Vice-President Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy. Nixon offers a well-written account of his view of the campaign. What really makes this book fascinating is what it reveals about Nixon the man - his emphasis on handling \\"crises\\", his obsession with maintaining his self-control during these crises, and the way in which he seems to place \\"events\\" above people - when talking about the mobs who attacked his limousine in Venezuela, he barely mentions his wife, who was also in grave danger - instead he focuses upon his own reaction to the attack and analyzes his own reaction to the mobs. In this book Nixon tries to present himself as a calm, cool, and rational man who always makes the best decisions - yet as his Presidency (and especially Watergate) would show, the \\"real\\" Nixon was often very different from the unemotional and logical figure presented in this work. Even so, this book is still a worthwhile read - it is very well-written and it examines several of the greatest events of a major politician's career from his personal perspective. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"Has there ever been anyone like Richard Nixon? For sheer resiliency,he stands alone in American history. No one won bigger than Richard Nixon. And no one lost bigger than Richard Nixon. And then won again. And then lost. And won again. He just kept punching and planning and working, to eventually become one of the dominant figures of the 20th Century.The author of 9 books, 8 of them best-sellers, this is his first,and covers six major crises of his political life to 1962. This is serious history, but so well-written that it reads like an exciting novel. In it, you can see the raw steel of the man emerging through his discipline, beginnig with his first crisis as a 35-year-old freshman congressman,the prosecution of Alger Hiss, the darling of east coast liberals and the state department, as a Soviet spy.. The other crises have been well-described by other reviewers, but all were thrilling examples of courage (backed by preparation) under fire. Highly-experienced Washington veteran David Gergen, who worked closely with four Presidents, in his excellent book \\"Eyewitness to History\\" described Richard Nixon as \\"the toughest man I ever knew\\". In this book, you can see why.Interestingly, his overwhelming love of country shines through as well. For example,the 1960 election was unbelievably close.A swing of only 11,000 votes properly distributed, and the election results would have been reversed. And there was verifiable vote fraud by the Democrats, especially in Texas and Illinois. Nixon was repeatedly urged to demand an investigation and recount. He refused. First,it would have greatly delayed the transference of responsiblity to a new administration. But secondly, as he wrote, \\"Then, too, the bitterness that would be engendered by such a maneuver on my part would,in my opinion, have done incalculable and lasting damage throughout the country.\\" There speaks a Patriot. And a Man!Also recommnended.\\"Nixon in Winter\\" by Monica Crowley."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"Despite the widespread opprobrium with which he was long (and understandably) held, Richard M. Nixon's contributions to America are far more complicated than many of his virulent detractors would have you believe. One such contribution can be found in \\"Six Crises\\", a fascinating exploration into the early career of a man whose political career would help define the course of mid-twentieth century American history. His chapter on \\"The Hiss Case\\" reads like the high-stake best detective stories (and his assertions have been verified by the Venona cables more than three decades since the book's publication); \\"The Fund\\" serves as an interesting look at how Richard Nixon the man handled what was (until Watergate) the greatest political crisis in his career; \\"The Heart Attack\\" explores how Vice President Nixon coped with temporarily holding the reins of national power while his Commander-in-Chief's suffered several brief incapacitations due to health problems (a heart attack, ileitis, a stroke); \\"Caracas\\", in what is by far the best chapter in the book, details how Vice President Nixon calmly handled a life-or-death situation when angry Communist mobs threw rocks at him, spat upon him, physically assaulted him, attacked his car, and nearly overturned his limousine in an effort to light it on fire; \\"Khruschev\\", in which Richard Nixon made a famous voyage to the Soviet Union and engaged in compelling dialogues with Premier Khruschev about the differences of life in the USSR and the USA; and finally \\"The Campaign of 1960\\", which - due to its baldly partisan approach to Nixon's first presidential campaign - transforms what was once a fascinating and relatively nonpartisan glimpse into this stage of Nixon's life into a bitter polemic about Nixon's defeat at the hands of Senator John F. Kennedy in 1960. Five out of six isn't bad, though."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"Of course, I remember, as a young man, throwing tacos at the TV during Nixon's press conference in 1973 when he placed US atomic forces on alert during the Arab-Israeli war of that year. I also recall entering the US Embassey in Paris the morning after his resignation and demanding that the Marine guard take ole Tricky Dick's picture off the wall. But who am I to judge?After all, Nixon was right, and I was wrong on many points. Once said, it becomes easier to repeat, but most of us from that era are not politically honest enough to take a reconsideration. Watergate was a dark day, of course, but I knew CREEP was behind the burglary months before the 1972 election when it was first reported. Eventually, Richard Nixon did the right thing and resigned. Great shame was brought on the office of President. Even a generation hasn't erased it.Chairman Mao recommended this book to me. \\"Not a bad book,\\" Mao comments on Six Crises during their meeting in Peking [Beijing] in February 1972. (This is according to the libretto of John Adams's opera NIXON IN CHINA.) I mean, Mao bears the legacy of the Great Leap Forward famine of 1958, and I wore black the day he died. No one died in Watergate -- if we exclude Mrs. E. Howard Hunt's death on a United 737 that crashed at Midway Airport. (Her purse was full of hush money, you may recall.)Mao and Nixon: what a pair! So, one looks at Vietnam today and must wonder: who won, and who lost that war? Did Nixon achieve Peace with Honor? Is it not true that his Secret Plan to End the War (announced during the 1968 election campaign) succeeded? After all, he did exploit differences between Russia and China and used that wedge to gain a Peace Treaty, less than a year after travelling to China. Even more, he opened the door to US-China Alliance, ushering in an era (with Mao and Chou) of peace between these two great nations, not to mention an era of unparalleled growth and prosperity for the Chinese people.Nixon wrote some awesome books. Six Crises is an awesome book. Nixon was right about Hiss. The Venona papers have proved that. Truman had a Soviet Spy in his Cabinet, a man (Harry Dexter White) who gave the printing plates to Stalin which allowed the Soviets to counterfeit the US Occupation currency in Germany. These are facts. (Read Norman Friedman's The Fifty Year War.) Of course, Truman wasn't a spy, but a patriot who fought Stalin hard. It was a tragic era.In Pop Culture (unfortunately) the only clear legacy of those days is Tricky Dick. Maybe, after another generation has passed, we can begin to get the entire Cold War in perspective, and (just maybe) Nixon can be seen for the man -- the statesman -- he truly was.My favorite crises are Hiss, Checkers, Caracas and Khruschev. But the entire book is great history. I give it six stars. Here, in these dark days of Iraq, you have to wonder: what would Nixon have done?"},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"\\"Six Crises\\" is Richard Nixon's first book. Although he believed that it would be his last, we are fortunate that he surprised himself and wrote nine more. Originally published in 1962, it covers six leading events in the author's life up to that time. Nixon chose to characterize these events as \\"crises\\" because of responses that they called out of those whom they challenged. In the introduction he shares with the reader the lessons which he draws from the role in crisis management of confidence, coolness, courage and experience.The Six Crises which Nixon highlights in his book are The Hiss Case, The Fund, The Heart Attack, Caracas, Khrushchev and the Campaign of 1960.The Hiss Case was Nixon's first big step on the national stage, in which his subcommittee of the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated Whittaker Chambers' claim that Alger Hiss had been a Communist. This section of the book reads like a mystery thriller in which Nixon gives his candid assessment of the principals involved and the reputations of each. He makes it clear that Hiss started with a much more impressive persona than his accuser, Chambers. He relates in detail the evidence and the analysis to which the subcommittee subjected it in trying to determine how far to take the investigation and what to make of its findings. The reading of the narration of this crisis leads the reader to appreciate the internal struggle with which each committee member wrestled in doing his duty of protecting the national security. Nixon concludes, probably rightly that, without the publicity of the Hiss Case he would not have been placed on a national ticket in the 1950s and, therefore, not been nominated for president in 1960, but that without the enemies he made during the case, would have been elected president that year.The second crisis, The Fund, arose during the 1952 campaign for vice-president. Press reports reported that Nixon had a fund for personal use derived from private donations. The claim was made that wealthy backers had contributed money to enable Nixon to live far beyond his legitimate means. Nixon explains the provisions of the fund, that being that the money was placed in the hands of a trustee, accounted for, and used for what would now be considered non-stop campaigning. He points out how others, including Adlai Stevenson, had similar funds, although few with as stringent controls as Nixon's. The controversy was to take a tremendous toll on Nixon as he struggled to understand the nature of the crisis and devise and execute a plan to respond to it. The response was the famous \\"Checkers\\" speech which saved his place on the ticket. In this section of the book, Nixon introduces the reader to the behind the scenes struggle within the campaign and some of the deliberate references in the speech which saved his career. For anyone with an interest in American politics, this chapter alone makes the book a worthwhile read. An amusing feature is to be reminded, in our era of instant communications, of just how limited communications were in 1952.The third crisis was Eisenhower's heart attack of 1955. In this section, Nixon lumps the heart attack in with Eisenhower's stroke of 1958 and the related question of the decision to keep Nixon on the ticket in 1956. This section is significant because it is the time when the issue of presidential disability was most clearly faced. It is true that the issue arose after Garfield's shooting and after Wilson's stroke, but, in my opinion, the faster pace of world affairs in the 1950s forced Nixon and other administration officials to respond to the situation more directly than in during prior or subsequent occasion. Acting over a period of months, with virtually no legal guidance, Nixon and the cabinet traversed constitutional terra incognita with courage and experience which enabled the government to continue to function.With the section on Caracas, the book shifts from domestic to foreign issues. The overriding foreign policy issue of the day was Communism. In this section, Nixon relates how he confronted the challenge of communists during his 1958 tour of South America. This is the trip in which he and Pat were harassed by student agitators in Peru and attacked by mobs in Caracas which placed their lives in jeopardy. Nixon shares with the reader his assessment of the political pressures which lead to the incidents related in the book and his responses to them. His comments about the South American figures with whom he dealt display a degree of candor rarely seen in political memoirs. The degree to which the vice-president of the United States was left on his own, the indignities to which he was subjected and the real risk of murder by a mob seems impossible in this era of heightened security.The fifth section deals with Nixon's 1959 trip to the Soviet Union during which the famous \\"Kitchen Debate\\" with Khrushchev took place. In this section Nixon outlines President Eisenhower's hopes for the trip and the strategy which Nixon devised and executed to attempt to realize them. The candor and detail provided make this section an essential part of a thorough understanding of the Cold War sparing of that time.The last crisis is the 1960 campaign. This section is essentially a memoir in which Nixon gives his reminiscences of the main events and issues of the campaign. Again, the candor with which he relates his own actions and impressions is rare among political memoirs.This book is, essentially, an excellent vice-presidential memoir. Nixon was a hero of mine when I came of age politically so I enjoyed every page. Even for one taking a more neutral view of Nixon, this book provides a valuable insight into some of the major events in this crucial period of American history."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"Ronald Reagan kept multiple copies of two books on his book shelves, at home, in his private office, and in the White-House. One was Witness by Whittaker Chambers, and the other was Six Crisis by Nixon. He would often give away copies of both books to people he was explaining his policies to.The first three chapters are most important."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"\\"Six Crises\\" was written by Richard Nixon after being VP for Dwight Eisenhower and after losing the Presidential election very narrowly to J. F. Kennedy. He thought he had retired from politics and this book was frank about the challenges that he had faced in Washington.In retrospect, Nixon was a statesman rather than a politician ... the only statesman in America since Theodore Roosevelt and we are waiting for the next. With Henry Kissinger nixon wrought changes in American international policy that, despite Reagan, Clinton, and George W. Bush, will hold us in good stead in the years to come. He recognized that it was useless being a policeman for the world ... that's not a single nation's role. He also recognized that China would be the emerging giant who would eventually supplant the U.S. as the most pwoerful country in the world and that dialogue being better than dogma, it was important to have China as an ally not an opponent.This book is a refreshing statement of his opinions after he had formed his international thesis but before he was able to put it into practice. It is very much wortwhile. Indeed, it should be required reading for anyone student of American history.John GrahamAuthor of 25 short books including a biography of Richard Nixon. All are available on Amazon.com.

Nixon shares with the reader his thoughts, feelings towards them in a very sincere way. Then the historical happenings themselves are told in a precise way as regards main facts and details as to let the reader immerge in the situation.And last but not least, of course, there is the worthy way of the former President to write.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"Somebody points out in a previous review that there were illegal voting activities by Democrats in 1960, and that Nixon showed his true class by refusing a recount.The real reason Nixon refused a recount was that any investigation would have shown just as much vote juggling by the GOP in the southern part of Ohio (Taft Republicans) as with the northern part in Cook County (Daley Democrats).Fair is fair, and truth is truth: let's use all the facts, not just some."},{"Title":"Six crises","review":"I always found Nixon to be a more intriguing character than Kennedy. This book explains why.The man had a very honorable career before his eventual fall from grace. In six chapters, the former Vice President gave a detailed r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the most interesting twelve years of his life. From the Hiss case, to the Election of 1960, Nixon seems to list his accomplishments in hopes of earning the respect of the reader. From all I have read about him, he believed he worked twice as hard as Kennedy, while earning only half of the accolades.I consider Six Crises to be act one of a three part tragedy. For those who know the ending of the main character's journey, put aside any aspersions, and enjoy this narrative of an interesting man living in a fascinating era of American history."},{"Title":"Sequence (Reading tutorial series)","review":"I have the sme name as the autho"},{"Title":"Home Hints And Tips","review":"This little book is now a favorite of mine.

But this one is so boring I had to push myself to finish it because I actually bought it! If I could, I would return it and get my money back. The story, one that is not very original, has Violet Leigh, a tall plain Jane compared with her gorgous Mother, sister and brother, who accepts her homliness with good cheer. She goes off to her first seaon in London and meets a gambler, our hero Travis Halliday, who is as handsome as Violet is plain. He likes her and since he has to get married fast to gain his inheritance, proposes and she declines as she knows he is not in love with her and just wants her to get his money. Travis departs the next day to make his fortune in the West Indies. Fast forward 2 years at a Christmas party and they are all thrown together and not much has changed. He still needs to get married to gain his inheritance. There is zero chemistry between them nor any fun, interesting scenes between them. Her two siblings are just silly and the bit with the pet monkey becomes lame. This story could have used an infusion of holiday cheer. During this holiday season, don't waste time with this lame, boring and very, very, very unromantic story."},{"Title":"On the Twelfth Day of Christmas (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I loved this book. The heroine was intelligent and competent; and solved her problems herself, thus earning the hero's admiration.

I was amazed at the variety of projects - sweaters, one suitable for your favorite guy (or for you!), a wrap, and my personal fave, the cabled cashmere hat.Knitting with bulky yarns is, by definition, fast... but the results are not always fabulous. Unfortunately, many of them scream &quot;THIS WAS EASY TO KNIT!&quot; However, this book is a breath of fresh air. The sleeveless turtlenecks, for example, are sleek and fashionable due to Mari Lynn Patrick's famed shaping techniques and yarn choices. These designs will work up quickly, but look lovely. They will be fun to knit for both beginners and more experienced knitters.Similarly, you'll find some fun stitchwork and colorwork in many of the other projects, including the cashmere hat, and an argyle vest. You're sure to finish these projects in a minimum of time, but everyone will think you slaved over them.I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who are looking to experiment with some of the new Chunky-weight yarns.As always, this latest edition to the On the Go series is portable, well-designed, with easy to follow charts and instructions."},{"Title":"Vogue Knitting on the Go: Chunky Knits","review":"I have the attention span of a gnat as far as knitting projects are concerned.

The sweaters are very boxy and not particularly stylish -- not very Vogue, in my opinion! Yes, they are knit with chunky yarn, but that doesn't always equal plain and boxy. There is a variety of patterns here, with a couple hats; scarf; men's, women's and children's sweaters; even a pillow pattern. Frankly, the only sweater I would consider making is a child's sweater, the only interesting, stylish one in the bunch, but I have no child to make it for! If you are looking for a collection of sweaters that is \\"Vogue\\", stylish, or even just interesting, this is not the pattern book for you.

On page 65, he runs through these 2 cases and pronounces the variable annuity man the big winner over the regular mutual fund investor....$11M to $6.829 after 24 years.The author mentions a 15% pretax rate of return and an average 12% return. From what I can tell he didn't use either number in his calculations.My analysis of his example goes like this....For the ordinary mutual fund investor to end up with $6.829M after taxes in 24 years, this gives an after tax return of 8.334% (using compound interest formula of FV = PV x (1+i)^n). This 8.334% after tax return equates to a pre-tax return of 12.5% if the investor is in the 33% marginal tax bracket. Note that my calculated return of 12.5% doesn't match the author's 12% or 15% numbers at all.The variable annuity man invests $1M at a pre-tax rate of 12.5% for 24 years which gives $16.891M. The variable annuity man nets $11.26M after being taxed at a 33% marginal tax rate.My first complaint is that the author used the wrong inputs for his model. My second complaint is that this example portrays an inaccurate picture of variable annuities. The author assumes 0% expense ratios for both the annuity investor and regular mutual fund investor. He points out correctly elsewhere in his book the average expense ratio of variable annuities is about 2.0%, yet he chose 0% expense rate for variable annuities. The average mutual fund expense ratio is about 1.38% with index funds from Vanguard at only 0.18% expense ratio. My third complaint is the author correctly applied an ordinary income tax rate of 33% to the variable annuity, but incorrectly applied the same 33% to the mutual fund investor. In 2007, the long term capital gains rate is only 15% and not 33%.If we redo the author's example using a 2% expense ratio for the variable annuity man, a 0% expense ratio for the mutual fund investor (he uses Vanguard's stock index fund with 0.18% expense ratio), and a 15% capital gains rate to the regular mutual fund investor.....then the story reverses. The regular mutual fund man wins with $11.28M after taxes compared to the variable annuity man's 7.32M!I was also very disappointed to see the author did not promote single payment immediate annuities as important tools in retirement portfolios. Many studies have been done which show that immediate annuities are advantageous to investors because they help prevent investors from outliving their money. The reason for missing this advantage of immediate annuities may be the book publication date of 1999. A lot of the key research papers on using immediate annuities in retirement portfolios did not start until around 2001 (Milevsky's papers).I did know that most states guarantee annuities in the event the insurance company declares bankruptcy. I thought the limit was $100,000 per insurance company, but the author says 80% or $100,000....whatever is less......of the annuity is paid by the state. This state insurance guarantee only applies to fixed annuities because your money is mixed with other people's money. In variable annuities, your money is kept separate and you own the underlying investments within the annuity.I found some of the author's logic a little ironic, or perverse, depending on how you look at it. Many studies (e.g. Dalbar) have found that investors only achieve a fraction of the stock markets return.......due to switching mutual funds in an attempt to chase the winners. The author contends that an investor would be better off in a variable annuity indexed to the S&P; 500 or Wilshire 5000 because they will be assured of getting at least the general stock market return. I found this an odd way to promote the use of stock index funds.One thing you realize reading this book is how complex variable annuities are. They are also laden with fees of all types. Uneducated investors have no chance of ever understanding or being capable of comparing variable annuities.The general idea of variable annuities is that their tax free compounding advantage out-weighs their disadvantages of lower returns (2.0% compared to 1.38% expense ratios) and lower after-tax returns (33% marginal rate for annuities, 15% long term capital gains) when compared to taxable mutual funds.In today's relatively low tax world, with high variable annuity expense ratios, I'm hard pressed to see where variable annuities make economic sense compared to conventional stock and bond mutual funds.Over-all an acceptable primer on annuities.I would suggest companion books to supplement this book including:The Richest Man in BabylonBogle on Mutual Funds: New Perspectives for the Intelligent InvestorThe Millionaire Next DoorThe Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning PortfolioA Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing, Ninth EditionThe Coffeehouse Investor: How to Build Wealth, Ignore Wall Street, and Get On With Your LifeThe Bogleheads' Guide to Investing."},{"Title":"Getting Started in Annuities","review":"If what the author says is true, I despair of ever really learning about annuities. He claims that, as of the writing of this book, there have been four books on annuities, and he's written three of them. Ugh.First, the positive, because there's almost always something positive. The green ink they used for the print is very easy on the eyes. And I did manage to learn a little about the very confusing world of annuities.But that's about it for the positive. The book was not very clearly written or organized. Some sections didn't seem to pertain to the chapter title. The examples were mostly un-helpful. So to make up for his lack of clarity, the author resorted to repetition, which only made matters worse.The other thing that bothered me was how gung-ho the author was about annuities. I almost felt like I was reading a sales pitch rather than an educational book.Maybe annuities really are so confusing that no one can make them clear. If that's the case, then maybe this author shouldn't have even bothered. (He probably shouldn't have bothered regardless, because he's hopeless as a writer.)

On a closer look, however, Antonio Skarmeta's brilliant 2000 creation does more than that. It shows how every human being, regardless of age, can fight injustice on an individual level. It displays sympathetic characters that are punished for thinking for themselves. And it is one of the first picture books I've ever read where the main character is a child that outsmarts a fascist regime.Pedro lives in an unnamed South American country with his mother and father. Each day after work his parents sit on the sofa to listen to foreign radio stations about their country's military dictatorship. Pedro doesn't really understand the importance of this, preferring to play soccer with his friends. One day, while playing, he sees the father of one of his friends being led away by a group of soldiers. That night Pedro finds that his own parents, like Daniel's, are against their country's form of government. When he asks if he himself is against the dictatorship his mother replies, &quot;Children aren't against anything. Children are just children&quot;. The next day a military man enters Pedro's classroom with an assignment. They are to write a composition under the soldier's watchful eye entitled, &quot;What my family does at night&quot;. Pedro thinks it through and after talking with his friend Juan proceeds to write. In the end, the reader discovers that sometimes children are far cannier than the adults around them might suspect.In many ways the real question this story raises is whether or not children have the ability to make careful informed decisions. On the outset, Pedro's mother thinks this isn't possible. She believes that kids are innocent and incapable of deep thought. When Pedro tells Juan this, his friend's response is, &quot;They all say that. They took my father away up north&quot;. So you see, when a child is affected personally by the events around him/her, that child cannot help but come to their own conclusions. What Pedro writes in the end is a clever tale of how his parents usually come home and, after dinner, play chess. The last line of the book (after Pedro has read this composition to his parents) is this:&quot;Well&quot;, said his father, &quot;we'd better buy a chess set&quot;.Fabulous writing. Would you expect anything less from the author that wrote the novel on which the film &quot;Il Postino&quot; was based? I loved the plot of this book and, in a way, I wished that the illustrations matched it. The pictures here are fine, of course. They accurately portray the ways in which kids feel the effects of life in a strictly controlled country. Illustrator Alfonso Ruano also isn't afraid to focus his attention on the seemingly innocuous elements of a tale. When the children are told the subject of their composition, the picture on the facing page is of an eraser that has had a small hole drilled into it. Two pages later you see Pedro grasping the edge of his desk as he attempts to try to figure out what to write. Behind him looms the soldier, arms clasped behind his back. Another artist might have chosen to make the tale a little more artistically rendered, but Ruano has done pretty well with this book. The result is that your attention is focused entirely on the story itself.Tackling freedom and personal choice in a picture book is very hard work. Very hard. In the case of &quot;The Composition&quot; it's pulled off brilliantly. A creative amalgamation of text, subtext, and darn good writing this book is appropriate for any and every kid. If you'd like a book that is politically charged but subtle too, I think &quot;The Composition&quot; is a brilliant choice."},{"Title":"The Composition","review":"I know, I know. Comparing this phenomenal picture book to the classic movie, \\"Jaws,\\" seems like a bit of stretch. But stay with me for a minute. This summer, I introduced my kids to \\"Jaws\\" and appreciated just how well-made the movie really was. Part of what makes the movie so effective is that you rarely see the shark. The shark appears only when it is absolutely necessary. All other times, you're left with this great building tension as you watch shark destruction and the fearful faces of victims.It's the same with this book. Aside from being elegantly written and illustrated (no small task), what makes this book so good is how well dictatorship is presented. Much like the great white, you never see the dictator, but always feel his presence. And it was really a stroke of genius to have the dictator make his presence known in their third grade class. As a classroom teacher, I am grateful that I stumbled on this wonderful little book. There are so many possible lessons to do with it. I can present it to show how powerful the written word can be. I can use it to introduce democracy. I can even start my lesson by asking the kids to write an essay that may seem to have ulterior motives and, once the conversation is generated, move right into the book. The list goes on and on. It's a great read and can definitely be used as an effective classroom tool.Chris BowenAuthor ofOur Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom"},{"Title":"The Composition","review":"Understanding the various types of government can be confusing or boring.

This book discusses the views of liberty and philosophy that Thomas Jefferson admired, and gives a better insight into the kind of person he was. The book details how Jefferson greatly admired John Locke, and worked to build the United States with the philosophy of Locke in mind. If the reviewer from Swizerland has a problem with Jefferson's ideas of philosophy, he must also have a problem with the natural rights of life, liberty and estate that Locke proposed! What many who criticize Jefferson fail to realize is that in our current day and age, minorities have been able to embrace Jefferson's views of liberty and equality. According to black scholar Annette Gordon-Reed, (who spoke about this book at a Library of Congress seminar,) \\"American minorities have taken Jeffersonian ideals of liberty and equality to heart, expanding their meaning in ways Jefferson himself never believed possible.\\" The book is written in a patriotic tone, as one would expect from the Library of Congress, however it is written in an objective voice, and does describe Jefferson's hardships and shortcomings. It addresses the controversy of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemmings and discusses the failure of Monticello to sustain itself as a plantation. The book also covers Jefferson's personal love of art and architecture. While any figure in history has their fair share of controversy, this book is an excellent look at the man and his life, and does not get bogged down in speculation and opinion, as a more subjective biography might do."},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: Genius of Liberty","review":"It's hard to argue that Jefferson was a man of great contrasts and contradictions. At the same time, it's hard to argue that his contributions to America--and to the world--are enduring. This volume contains many elements of interest, and helps the reader understand not only Jefferson the man, but also the historic context that made him the man that he was. He was a product of his times, in many ways, but was also able to transcend those times and create a vision that helped America become a land of both flaws and genius. The legacy of the U.S. rests on the shoulders of no individual person, but is a result of the efforts of countless men and women. Among those who are known to history, Jefferson is one essential to be reckoned with. This volume provides insights into the man and his times."},{"Title":"Thomas Jefferson: Genius of Liberty","review":"If the meaning of liberty is the act of enslaving innocent men, women and children, (throughout their natural lives), then I completely agree with the \\"scholars\\" that compiled this book.

It swarms with undeserved sycophantic accolades. Professor Ellis edited it shortly before he came of age. Its contents are no accident. Call it the irony of 'a civilized world'.My dear, you will like this book if you are fanatical about anything U.S.A. However, if you are a conscientious patriot, who strives to be morally reasonable (no matter what), do not bother to read it. It does not worth your time.

It features the standard ERB storyline of a powerful hero who finds a princess to love and must fight all kinds of enemies to win her. It's full of bloodthirsty action, appalling acts of villainy (combined with a more complex antagonist than ERB usually provided), and thrilling acts of heroism. As with every ERB heroine, Fou-Tan is beautiful and desirable but holds herself in waiting for Gordon King, the hero of the tale. There's nothing new here, but readers who enjoy Burroughs' work and adventure-laden pulp fiction will enjoy it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Jungle Girl","review":"REVISED 08-24-12: When this terrific story first came out in serialized form in 1931 it was called \\"The Land of Hidden Men.\\" A year later it came out as a book called \\"Jungle Girl.\\" When Ace pubished this as a paperback in the early sixties, it opted for the earlier, more macho title. Burroughs is a master storyteller and I thoroughly enjoyed this action-filled, pulp, non-series, lost-city, jungle adventure.

Most biographies and autobiographies of spiritual sekers describe either saints or only the highest experiences of prominent individuals. In Ananda Katha, on the other hand, the author has described himself as a regular person everyone can identify with, full of foibles and failings and yet a sincere seeker most beloved by his spiritual teacher. It is as much because of the author's failings and missteps as for his aspiration and dedication, that this book is such an inspiration. One of my favourite sequences: Naginada smokes in the ashram thinking that his guru's instruction to 'avoid smoke' applies only to smoke from fires. Later on he meets a sufi saint who appears to be a constant tippler, only to find that the saint is transforming the wine into blessed medicine to cure disciples' diseases as Nagina looks on-and also finds that the liquor has no smell of alcohol at all! Misunderstandings and jumping to conclusions are things we can all relate to as we stumble along the spiritual path. How refreshing that someone is honest enough to describe his own!Ananda Katha"},{"Title":"IT'S MINI SLINKY!","review":"I was looking for this product for a long time and i finally find it at Amazon.

Hill, stands on its own merits as a rollicking good love story, almost gothic in its plague of locusts, demonic possession of the young North African Juba, realistic depiction of mob violence, state torture and intolerance of the rising Christian religion whose adherents refused in the year 250 to worship the persecuting emperor Decius.It is the story of a beautiful 17-year old Greek orphan who finds work as an artisan in Roman Africa, mainly fashioning statues and other adornments of various pagan cults. The evils of third century Roman imperial life depress her. She is tempted by the beauty of Christianity as hinted to her years ago by a Christian slave. Later she is wooed by the Christian Agellius who gives her another slant into his religion--though he fails to persuade Callista to marry him. Finally, Saint Cyprian, bishop of Carthage and the Gospel of Luke which he persuades her to read in a prison where she languishes falsely accused of being a Christian, tip the scales. She is baptized, confirmed and takes the Eucharist in one ceremony in prison. Shortly thereafter she is brutally martyred. The story stands on its own feet. It is a great read independently of any external impact or uses.But CALLISTA is also, in my opinion, the most illuminating first book which any serious or prospective student of ALL the works of John Henry Newman should read (or now re-read). For CALLISTA opens the door to Newman's spiritual autobiography of conversion, APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA. It also adumbrates DEVELOPMENT OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE, RISE AND PROGRESS OF UNIVERSITIES, his sermons and Newman's many musings on the echo of God's voice definitively heard in conscience. And what CALLISTA does not lead into, Newman's earlier novel LOSS AND GAIN most certainly does lead into: ARIANS OF THE FOURTH CENTURY, THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY, A GRAMMAR OF ASSENT and literally every serious thing the great Cardinal ever penned. Fortunately, the best edition of LOSS AND GAIN is by Alan G. Hill who gives us the best CALLISTA as well.CALLISTA, perhaps the greatest of \\"Christian Romances,\\" indeed deserves to be read both internally for itself and also externally as a first step into the huge ocean of Newman's essays, poems (e.g. \\"Lead Kindly Light\\"), sermons, histories, satires, educational theory, philosophy, theology and more than 20,000 letters. CALLISTA, set in Africa, paradoxically invites readers to step into the almost as little known spiritual world of 19th Century England, one of the most creative times and places the world has yet known.-OOO-"},{"Title":"Callista,: A tale of the third century","review":"Written by John Henry Newman in 1855, Callista is a fictional tale of life in the early Christian church. One of only two novels from his pen, this tale is set in northern Africa, near Carthage, about the year 250 AD, during the reign of the Emperor Decius. The talented and lovely young greek native Callista, along with her brother Aristo ply their handicraft in the shop of Jucundus, in the small provincial town of Sicca, by finishing and decorating the pagan images of gods, idols, charms and other items of superstition. Jucundus, appreciating her many talents, attempts to play the matchmaker between her and his poor befuddled nephew Agellius. This nephew, much to his continued dismay and consternation seems to be obsessed with the notion of Christianity, and worse, considers himself to be of their number. As the story unfolds, we become aware of the strange status Christians held in the Roman World. Rather than being hated for their zeal toward God, they are thought to be atheists, anarchists and traitors. Callista, though not a Christian, feels the emptiness and insufficiency of the Roman, and even the Greek world of morality and philosophy, and never did believe in their gods. Agellius, with much internal turmoil, because Callista is not Christian, wishes to propose marriage. But these are troubled times, natural disasters, Imperial edicts, demonic possessions and the breakdown of civil order bring this story to an exciting conclusion. Obviously Newman wishes to use this story as a sort of parable, while at the same time painting a picture for us of what the early Christian church was actually like. And while he may succeed in this aim, some may think the story occasionally bogs down in pedantics. For this reason I gave the story 4, rather than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Callista,: A tale of the third century","review":"As a non-Catholic, I hesitated reading this novel, considering that it was written &#8220;from a Catholic point of view&#8221;. I had heard of Cardinal Newman and his conversion to Catholicism, but never got around to reading any of his writings. So I was curious.It took a while to get used to his style. Like most Victorian writers, he favors long compound sentences which are often encrusted with Latin phrases and obscure classical references. Even with Google searches, I sometimes had to guess what he was getting at (for example, one of his characters &#8216;smells like Idalium&#8217; must mean that he smells like roses).I did learn a few things. I didn&#8217;t realize before that the persecution of Christians under Decius was on the heels of the millennial celebration of the founding of Rome and was undertaken to strengthen loyalty to the Empire when it was under attack from the Germanic tribes on its northern border.I also didn&#8217;t know that the followers of Tertullian constituted a separate sect, apart from the Montanists to which I thought he belonged later in his life.The characters were all interesting, Callista, especially, who insisted right up until the 11th hour that she wasn&#8217;t a Christian. She then had to be baptized, confirmed and given the Eucharist all within a short period of time before she could be properly martyred.The highlight of the book was the first encounter she had with the priest Caecilius and the verbal sparring they had over the existence and nature of Hell, with Caecilius espousing a very modern interpretation.As sad and moving as the description of her martyrdom was, sadder was the thought that in less than 200 years after these events when Christianity became the state religion of the Empire, they would begin persecuting pagans and other heretic Christians with even more ferocity."},{"Title":"Callista,: A tale of the third century","review":"A potential buyer should be aware that in addition to the possibility of marginalia, etc. in this edition, the print is small and difficult to read.

I also do not have any substantial experience with traditional Visual C++ with MFC, which the author recommends, but I felt I should still be able to work through the book. I did not finish the book. I worked through the first 2 or 3 chapters and felt that the explanations were too brief and code was not explained. Also, the sample code did not compile on my machine -- that could have been my own errors -- I don't know. But I decided the book was just too skimpy in explanations and returned it.

Unfortunately, the assortment is uneven, often too narrowly focused, and includes too few essays of import to necessitate reading in its entirety. While the variety of methodological approaches is rather interesting, the utility of the majority of the essays is limited, hardly explaining the film (or films) that the author attempts to unravel, and doing little to explain science fiction/horror films or Cronenberg's oeuvre.Parveen Adams's \\"Death Drive\\", a Lacanian analysis of Crash (1996), is the most interesting, and well written, of the essays in the collection that directly engage Cronenberg's work. Adams attempts to unravel the stylistic complexity of Crash and to align Cronenberg's directorial effects with the narrative estrangement at the heart of the film. While Adams's study is limited to only Crash, she does see beyond the film, linking Cronenberg's visual manipulations in the film to Luc Besson's earlier work, and, by implication, to work outside of Cronenberg's. Engaging and interesting for its use of Lacan and Cronenberg, Adams's essay is worth considering for any film scholar.Most interesting of the essays is Andrew Klevan's \\"The Mysterious Disappearance of Style: Some Critical Notes About the Writing on Dead Ringers\\", which chides both specific film scholars, and film scholarship as a field for its lack of consideration of a variety of filmic elements other than simply narrative. While inflammatory, Klevan's analysis of contemporary scholarship is a vital critical entry, acting as repudiation of the earlier essays in the collection (Klevan is placed last, directly before the interview with Cronenberg, in which Cronenberg also chides scholars for their lack of critical scope). Grant's editorial introduction spends too much space attempting to find faults in Klevan's argument, but his defense is too much a protest, and in both the introduction and Grant's contribution to the collection it is quite clear what Klevan is attacking: Scholars who are too concerned with their own scholastic exercises to actually attempt to engage the text at all, instead building a fortification of \\"theories\\" to hide ignorance behind. As such, Klevan's contribution should be required reading for every film scholar.The interview with Cronenberg is rather interesting, more for his concerns about the uses of scholarship than for his biographical revelations. The majority of the interview is spent considering critiques of his films, as well as arguing against attempts to understand his oeuvre through broad biographical or psychoanalytic means. Thus Cronenberg appears to be endorsing the methodological approaches embodied in the collection, which, with the exception of Grant, employ more contemporary theoretical modes. Otherwise, of interest in the interview is Cronenberg's extension of his earlier discussion of the aesthetics embodied in his work and the response of the audience to the grotesque visions in his films, which he attributes more to the reception of the audience than to his directorial intent.Finally, the collection is rather myopic in its cinematic interests: A predominant number of essays concern M. Butterfly (1993) and Dead Ringers (1988). Crash and The Fly (1986) are also widely considered (and a number of the essays insist on redundantly summarizing identical scenes); eXistenZ (1999) is largely ignored, as are The Dead Zone (1983), Videodrome (1982), and Scanners (1981), with many of Cronenberg's earlier, more horrific and science fictional works mentioned only in passing. The collection also includes an extensive filmography and selected bibliography of Cronenberg criticism and reviews, which should prove useful for future studies, which will hopefully learn from the mistakes of The Modern Fantastic."},{"Title":"Becoming Nehemiah: Leading with Significance","review":"The concept of servant leadership is very popular in many management circles and business schools these days. David McKenna has helped uncover the fact that this practice and persona of leadership dates back to Old Testament models.

From a position of servitude and bondage, Nehemiah becomes a \\"man for his season\\". Unlike other treatments, McKenna bravely shows the weaknessess as well as the strengths of this leadership hero.

And he almost dies for his addiction, because \\"The road to Hell is paved with good intentions.\\"This is a fascinating mystery story, and kept me turning the pages fast, wishing, as one reviewer here put it, that I could slow down. But I couldn't. I just had to find out which one of those people Ray had to please who consitituted his personal Waterloo.The characters were rich, unique and well-formed,especially Nerese, the detective, and the children - his daughter Ruby, the kids from the projects.And also: as a writer, I saw the theme of wanting - needing - to make someone else's life your own; to get into it, understand it, possibly even heal it by writing about it. There's a lot of hubris in that need. I'm currently writing a novel based on a tragic life, and sometimes I feel so good about what I hope to do - to find the answer to \\"Why?\\" But when I read this book I identified with Ray...I mean, is my need to heal through literary revelation simply a weakness? Is another's sad problem really any of my business? If the people associated with this character - his family, his friends - read my story - they may not thank me for it. And some of them, like Ray's batterer - might be angry about it. And yet, like Ray, I feel compelled to keep doing this work. If it wasn't so hard to make myself do it at times (writing is definitely not the \\"softer, easier way\\") I'd think it might be an addiction.Price is a fantastic writer.

I couldn't wait to finish it. Good luck!!"},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I hoped this book would be interesting and enjoyable, but I soon noticed a quite annoying device: the author found it necessary to end declarative sentences with a question mark, as if there was an unsaid &quot;you know?&quot; Yes, I know people often speak that way in conversation, but I would have enjoyed the dialogue a lot more if correct punctuation had been used.Also the victim was brain-damaged due to a blow to the head and suffered a number of other injuries, his doctors kept entering the room to give various neurological tests---yet he was able to speak quite lucidly, and a great length, to the police officer, who seemed to have unlimited access to this patient in intensive care.The young teenaged daughter's portrayal, through Dad's eyes, was not in the least believable: uncommunicative, yet precocious; budding woman, yet childlike; you get the picture. And what father in his right mind would take her to a high-crime housing project at night, sit her down in a deserted playground amid mounds of snow, and start telling her stories of his youth?Maybe these observations are petty? Others might disagree with me? It may have been a better book with more editing?

The dialogue could not be any truer to life. The characters come alive so vividly, I feel as though I've known them for years. There are no heroes here: Nereese is not the hottest cop in the bunch; for all his extreme generosity, Ray is not someone you'd want to emulate. Each person is a story and has stories, which add more depth to these already utterly believable people. It also connects them in a Zen-like way. I wasn't at all surprised to learn that the author is a screenwriter: Therein lies much of the book's strength.So why not 5 stars? Two reasons. First, Mr. Price jumps back and forth between events in January and events in February. You get used to it, and even come to appreciate the effect, but it's kind of annoying at first. Also, though the story is tense and you can't wait to find out what happens next, it's slowed down by everyone telling their stories. Hmmm, above I said that was a good thing. Guess it's a two-edged sword, all the story-telling. Maybe there's a teeny bit *too* much character development (can't remember the last time I complained about that!). The suspense does suffer a bit.Still, I recommend SAMARITAN, and plan to read more of Mr. Price's books."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I usually read books within days.

Smart, urbane, honest, rich are all adjective thrown around to describe writing, but in this case, those words have weight and truth, as does every single page in Samaritan.&quot;Samaritan&quot; tells the tale of Ray, mysteriously wounded in an attack in his apartment by an assailant he's not willing to identify. Enter old childhood friend Nerese, a soon-to retire detective and old friend of Ray's, who gets roped into but quickly compelled to solve this brutal attack. Price spills out a bevy of complicated, interesting characters that seemingly haave hard lives and could have done the crime. Without Ray's help, it falls on Nerese's shoulders to turn on her detecting skills, which are finely honed if underused. In fact, it is probably Nerese's character that I found most interesting, loving her stamina, goal orientated thinking, and sheer determination.Price's writing strength is in his brevity of words saying so much. His sentences contain punches that more than once caused me to reread them to get the effect again. Price masters the art of saying much by saying it originally and saying little. It is truly inspirational writing.My only complaint about the book is in some of the characters &quot;stories&quot; that they tell. This is a novel about stories, everyone has a story to tell, from Ray's return to the projects where he grew up, to Nerese trying to give her son a real life, to Ruby, Ray's wrought teenage daughter. However some of these stories wander on for pages and pages, and at least one of them seemed unimportant to the plot. They became distracting towards the end of the story as you just wanted to wrap it up. Small complaint, but valid.Don't miss this book.

Nerese's advancement in the department has been blocked by the public knowledge of her drug-using brothers. She is scheduled to retire in six months.Ray may have been beaten for doing an extraordinarily good deed. Someone may have misinterpreted his gesture. Ray is trying to be an honorable guy, but the neediness of the persons in the projects feed his selfish desires, Nerese theorizes.This book speaks to the heart. The problem facing the main character, Ray Mitchell, is that in trying to carry out good acts, he is viewed with suspicion in the community. His motives are suspect. Price carries the reader along with adroit moves through twists and turns in the plot, using emotional leverage to secure attention. Samaritan is a good title for the book. It implies good, but it also stands for outsider."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Richard Price has written two spectacularly good novels, his debut effortThe Wanderers, about the members of a street gang trying to fight for survival amidst the efforts of merely growing up, and the modern day realistic novelClockers: A Novel, about the drug dealing culture existing at the fringes of our society. Price has also, however, written one big clunker, the meanderingFreedomland, a book in which the lack of a solid story was matched only by the author's determination to drag it out for as many pages as possible.Although FREEDOMLAND was the novel which immediately preceded this, SAMARITAN is, happily, an example of regression towards the mean. Although the book does not examine its realm with the microscopic detail of CLOCKERS, the book provides a very good story with all the grit and grime one expects of Price.Ray Mitchell, the Samaritan of the title, is a former TV writer who returns home to Dempsey, New Jersey, a tough town within view of, but a million cultural miles away from, Manhattan. Mitchell tries to patch up his life by getting back to his roots, teaching a creative writing class at his old high school, and reconnecting with the housing project where he was raised.A friendly man willing to really help others out, it comes as a big surprise when Mitchell is found half dead with his head bashed in. That he absolutely refuses to identify his attacker gives the novel an underlying feel of foreboding, as if we are waiting for the other shoe to drop.The attack is investigated by Mitchell's old friend, a woman who grew up to be a cop and who feels a personal need to find out what happened. It is often through her life, and her relationship with her son, that we get taken deeper and deeper into the cesspool of everyday life in Dempsey. Price has always been at his strongest evoking a mood rather than painting a picture. He is true to form in SAMARITAN, with prose that is the emotional equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard.Ultimately, SAMARITAN provides us with an excellent reflection on the effect we have on the lives of others, especially the impact adults have on children. Unlike many of Price's books, SAMARITAN, despite its evocation of the psychopathy around us, actually has a strong moral undertone and a glimpse of hope at the end. Maybe Price is lightening up with age. Who knows? Maybe his most recent book, LUSH LIFE, which I have not read yet but certainly will, will shed some light on that."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Richard Price may not be a household name, but you probably know him for his screenplays: Clockers, The Color of Money, Sea of Love, Mad Dog and Glory, and the recent redo of Shaft. The Bronx-born author has also written numerous novels, most of them about working-class life in hard-bitten urban locales: housing projects, subway stations, inner-city high schools.His latest novel, \\"Samaritan,\\" is about a man who has skyrocketed out of the projects to success, but can't seem keep himself from going back. Ray Mitchell, now a wealthy screenwriter, has returned from Los Angeles to New Jersey, in part to be nearer to his adolescent daughter, Judy, in part to escape his cocaine habit. But he's also come back to excavate something from his own background in the dismal, crime-infested Hopewell housing projects. And upon his return, how is he welcomed? He wakes up in a hospital bed after having his head smashed in by an unknown assailant. He insists that he remembers nothing of what happened.The novel's other half concerns Nerese Ammons, a black cop about to retire. She would like to leave her job with a bang by solving a case that's meaningful to her. And Ray Mitchell's assault turns out to be meaningful because, as she discovers through a happy coincidence, she grew up with Ray in Hopewell. \\"Samaritan's\\" plot proceeds with Nerese's work at solving the crime by patiently interviewing the people in Mitchell's life, starting with his casual acquaintances, and then narrowing down to his intimate friends and lovers, like a hawk circling on its prey.As with most mystery stories, Nerese's most likely suspects (and the reader's) shift from character to character, from disadvantaged but likeable high school kids, to a group of unusual houseguests noticed by Richard's neighbor, to the husband of Ray's illicit lover, Danielle.The story's somewhat complex plot structure is worth mentioning. Not only do the chapters alternate, switching from Ray's story to that of Nerese, but we also alternate between the present narrative and a series of flashbacks that gradually fill us in on how things managed to get where they are. Toward the end, the result is sort of like watching as a blurry digitized picture gradually comes into sharp, clean focus.But more than plot, it is the characters who gradually become precise and clear. As the novelist E.M. Forster once remarked, with rueful irony, about the public's demand for a novel to have a plot: \\"Yes--oh, yes--the novel tells a story.\\" The fact is that Samaritan, despite its plot's clever machinations, is ultimately about characters and how they evolve--or in some cases don't.Ray's surface motivation, we discover, is to prove to those people who are still stuck in the ghetto that he \\"got out\\". And he proves this through philanthropy, hence the novel's title. He lends money to people in need, or gives it to them right out, and he knows they won't pay him back.And by engaging in this process, he manages to sink back into the very same ghetto, entangling himself into the lives of the project-dwellers. Through his generosity, Ray becomes a martyr, in the negative sense of the word. A doormat. If he can't be loved by the people who he lends money to, then he can at least feel morally superior to them, which is the martyr's deeper motivation.Finally, the novel's purpose seems to be the expos&eacute; of a type, the Samaritan who hopes to gain something in return for his generosity, whether it is respect, dependency, sex or love.And if \\"Samaritan\\" is a novel about character, Richard Price delivers these characters to the reader through his strongest suit: realistic dialogue. He captures masterfully the spoken language of inner city characters no matter their age or ethnicity, whether poor black teenagers, privileged white teenagers, or world-weary cops. As the rappers would put it, he \\"makes it real.\\"On the other hand, during moments of run of the mill narrative, which any novel requires, sometimes Price's writing is downright lazy. When he's working to get a character from one place to another, or to depict a characters thoughts and feelings, the sentences are often written summarily, with no attention to rhythm, precision, variety, sound, or even intelligibility. Take this whopper, for example: \\"But, overcome by an embarrassed surliness as he found himself recalling the semi-euphoric flush of altruism that he had experienced in lessening degrees on each of the kid's previous cash-themed visits, Ray refused to bite.\\" Did you have to read it twice? There's a difference between complexity and perplexity. A good editor might have cleaned up some of these train wrecks.Whoppers aside, \\"Samaritan\\" is a compelling novel. It paints an unsentimental but humane portrait of life in the housing projects, draws us into a complex and interesting plot, and adeptly explores the theme of being addicted to performing charitable good deeds in order to win love. Perhaps most significantly, \\"Samaritan\\" introduces us to a couple of well-drawn and memorable characters. Don't be surprised if Richard Price's name shows up again in the credits when it's made into a movie.See more writings of a literary nature at www.maninquotes@blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Half detecive story, half good old fashioned storytelling, Richard Price's latest brilliance is anything but a (near) murder mystery. When Ray Mitchell, an ex-high school teacher, is found beaten nearly to death in his apartment, it is up to childhood friend and veteran cop Nerese Ammons to not only find the assailant, but also to get Ray to tell her what happened. What makes this book so appealing is not simply the complex plot and suspense that comes with a typical detective story, but the way in which Price develops every chracter with care and craftiness. Additionally, Ray's decision not to reveal his attacker or press chargers present a further problem for Ammons, who, along with the reader, must slowly piece together the puzzle bit by bit, chapter by chapter. Price jumps back and forth between the aftermath of the assault and the days leading up to it, providing two intricate stories within one.Samaritan is so embedded with numerous, important life issues that the reader may forget the main purpose of Ammons's mission. The upmost generosity Ray exhibits serves to further increase the pity felt for him when he is nearly beaten to death. Price explores what happens when Ray places himself secondary to everybody else, from his daughter Ruby to his secret lover, Danielle. Ray is so caught up in the drama of his giving and teaching that he neglects himself and understands all to little about those who surround him. The fact that he is so afraid of the truth in refusing to name his attacker, despite the potential murder, adds a special twist to this already vast and expanded novel.More surprising than the mystery about Ray's assault is the wonderful stories Ray tells while dipping in and out of consciousness in the hospital. These ramblings can take one way back to the days on a grandfather's lap listening to old war stories and how things were way back when. The fact that Ray mentions these past experiences add to the bond he and Ammons share, and provides a nice break from the continual serach to find the guilty party. Price has nearly mastered this storytelling technique, with the minor exception that, at times, the reminiscing gets a bit tedious and boring. The intriguing combination of the stories and the assualt mystery was a risky endeavour, yet Price has done a great job in interweaving the two seamlessly and calmly. Equally as descriptive are the characters, as not a single person in the novel is overlooked or under-developed. Most are designed to add an angle in Ray's ever-growing return to normalcy, although some serve little or no purpose. Price does a nice job in using language suitable to the respective character, as Ray's students talk like cocky kids and his mentor like an old man. The diction is created to suit the individual, and adds a nice realitic touch to the novel. For the most part, all the characters are intricately crafted and all help to compliment Ray in one way or another.With that in mind, it is no wonder that Samaritan is a successful novel. The language at times is a bit mature, and some of the topics tackled are definately not suited for children, including some very detailed sex scenes. Yet for those at the high school level and above, this book is a good read. The seldom dull moments and the time it takes for the story to really get moving prevent this novel from receiving its highest score. Yet, one cannot argue with what Price produces, a mixture of great proportions that serve not only to entertain but to teach valueable lessons as well. Ray is the nice guy in all of us, and his story is not simply depressing but shows what can happen when we get caught up in the pleasing of others instead of the care for ourselves."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Samaritan is a 400 page confessional of lives gone wrong, lives wrecked and semi-salvaged. To help is to expose yourself to more grief than any man can deal with. Ray, returning to the projects he grew up in with a pocketful of money, never fully materializes. We know him as a doubter (doubts almost every thought that he has) but his moves seems passive. Ray gets coerced into making his offers, manipulated, even by his young daughter. He is a watcher and a story spinner, but he doesn't have enough strength to drive the narrative. Samaritan is more of a Whydunnit than Whodunnit. Price is interested in the psychology of white/black, adult/child, rich/poor. Still, the weaknesses are hard to see since Price writes beautifully. The depiction of the bleak urban landscape is worth the cost of 'Samaritan', but this book neither approaches the plotting of 'Clockers' nor evokes the pity and despair found in 'Freedomland'."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"For my taste, Richard Price writes the best dialogue today. It's his ear, his phrasing, the way he must listen to real people talking. I ask many other writer friends too and we all just shrug our shoulders and say \\"go figure\\" because nobody else does it like he does. The dialogue resonates so well that everything else springboards from there -- and the idea of Samaritan, so well described in the other reviews posted here, is terrific. When you stop and think of the instances and times within the book where somebody tries to help somebody else, well, this would be a delicious book group discussion. I loved the ending, too. I thought the structure of the book was brilliant, switching back and forth between the Nerese and Ray. I liked the setting, the way Price works in background and context for the characters, and the interesting question the book poses, right from the get-go."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I discovered Price after seeing the movie based on &quot;The Wanderers&quot;.In the 70's I told folks that if I ever taught a Men's Lit class Price would be one of the featured authors.

With his newest book he heads back to the neighborhood, revisiting the same male landscapes he did in &quot;Bloodbrothers&quot; &quot;Ladies Man&quot; and &quot;The Breaks&quot; Price writes honestly about being a guy, having friends, and the pressure and expectations placed on males in society. I enjoy the way his characters &quot;tell stories&quot; about their lives, families and how they grew up. The oral tradition of sharing tales about that place you call home is universal(for guys anyway) and Price is a master. Hey, it's a great mystery too.

Then if it were me there'd be no story. This is why we have people like Richard Price to engage people like me in a story like this.I sincerely don't understand the thing with white-guilt. I'm black. As I'm reading this novel I'm opening myself to understand. I find myself getting involved with the characters and seeing how \\"accurate\\" the black ones are. However, I'm not surprised because I've also read CLOCKERS and I remember how impressed I was with the depiction of a young black character. Visions of LAW & ORDER are popping up in my head. I enjoy this TV drama. I'm hoping with all hope that this will be more than just an episode of this show. I'm half-hoping that Ray and Nerese will find a way to have a love relationship. I'm pleased and a little skeptical when Price approaches the subject but disappointed when he abandons the idea. I'm still hoping to understand white-guilt or understand if this is even about that.When I'm all excited and all engrossed with Ray Mitchell the crime victim, Detective Nerese Ammons, Ray's daughter Ruby, Carla the 'round-the-way girl from Ray's childhood, Danielle the girlfriend and everybody and the old neighborhood and even Ruby's collection of the old neighborhood stories and Ray's TV writing career and everything, and I'm wondering what could possibly be the conclusion of this crime. I'm a little let down when the conclusion appears to be someone's little explained need to seek approval. I just need more reason why."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"This gritty, beautifully-written novel tells the tale of Ray, a soft touch whose generosity masks an urgent need to overcome his personal demons. An ex-teacher and ex-screenwriter, tormented by guilt over having let down his own family, he is a do-gooder who lets himself be talked into spending his dwindling resources on the needs (sometimes authentic and sometimes crackpot) of various residents of the inner-city housing project where he grew up, as well as those of a former student.The book is written in two parallel narrative threads, one focusing on the events leading up to a brutal assault on Ray, and the other focusing on the post-assault investigation of the crime by an old friend who also grew up the housing project. The characters are not drawn in black and white (although interracial tensions are a constant undercurrent), but in finely evoked shades of gray.The lesson (probably never to be learned by Ray) is that building up one's own self-esteem by overhelping those in need can lead to unintended consequences far beyond the immediate situation.A wonderful, moving book, peopled with characters you will never forget."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Ex-TV writer Ray Mitchell comes home to New Jersey to re-connect with his 13-year-old daughter and spread some of his good fortune around his boyhood stomping ground - the Hopewell Houses low-income housing project. He introduces his daughter to his childhood home and reaches out to her with stories of kids with names like Dub, Butchie, Psycho and Tweetie. And he volunteers his time teaching a writer's workshop at his old high school, though it's tough getting anybody to show up at first, \\"like pushing a rope,\\" as the principal says.Price's (\\"Clockers,\\" \\"Freedomland,\\" \\"The Wanderers\\") writing is urban, fluid, snappy and visual. He reveals his characters the way life does, in increments. Ray is immediately likable. He's an animated storyteller as interested - or more perhaps - in the other actors as he is in his own role. As a volunteer teacher he's eager, but self-conscious. That first day, no one comes and alone in the room Ray fidgets, \\"to conceal how awkward and vaguely embarrassed he was beginning to feel...coming off busy as hell, yet when the school's principal, Bill or Bob Egan, knocked on the open door of the empty lounge, Ray almost shot to his feet with relief.\\" But the apologetic principal is only there to ask him to try again. \\" \`Sure,' Ray said, the day now like chalk in his mouth.\\"The story then jumps forward a month as another alumni of the school, a black policewoman, Nerese Ammons, arrives to give a presentation and is asked by the principal to look into a vicious assault on a volunteer teacher, Ray Mitchell, now lying half dead in a hospital bed. \\"For the first time in months she felt something in herself akin to joy.\\" Nerese, we quickly learn, is the Tweetie of Ray's initial story, the 10-year-old who'd been accidentally struck by a stickball bat, her wound staunched with the t-shirt of a mute, shocked Ray who had nothing to do with the accident. Nerese has not had a lot of selfless kindness from the people in her life and now, weeks from retirement, she sees a chance for payback. But Ray won't cooperate. She's sure, despite the severity of his head wound and his semi-dazed responses, that Ray knows his assailant. And Nerese determines to get justice for Ray whether he wants it or not.The narrative continues to switch between Nerese and Ray, between her investigation and Ray's life during the previous month. Cracks begin to appear in Ray's character. He's not just a former high school teacher who made good in TV land, he's an ex-cokehead who destroyed his marriage, fled fatherhood and messed up more times than he can count. He's a man who has never for one minute been comfortable in his own skin. So how did such a sad-sack get to Hollywood? A bit of luck in his life, a store of goodwill to draw on. Ray likes to say, even think, it was Ruby who got him off drugs, but the truth is less romantic. He likes to think he's a generous, giving man full of good deeds and second chances for those less fortunate, but he's never so self-conscious as when he's watching himself be a do-gooder or showing off his largesse to Ruby. On the other hand, Ray really does like people. He wants to connect, he wants everyone to like him, he takes a genuine interest. He wants to be good. He's soon surrounded by people with various motives to bash his head in.Nerese is the one for selfless acts, for all the good it's done her. Despite her tough exterior, her no-nonsense firmness and her generally low opinion of humanity, Nerese has a lot of people who depend on her and she comes through for them, while adhering to her solid moral principles. Nerese's dogged police work uncovers evidence; her experience and view of human nature interprets it. At the same time we see how she compartmentalizes her life for safety's sake, how tough love is bedrock truth for her.In one scene, after she finds a gun on one of her teenage son's friends, she takes her son to visit his cousin in prison, \\" a field trip to Christmas Future.\\" But inside the prison she realizes she's made a mistake. \\"What she had interpreted as revulsion was in fact, self-revulsion. Darren - she should have known this - so far from being the type of kid who would ever wind up in a place like this, had spent the last hour and a half surrounded by what his young music-video-molded mind imagined to be REAL men, hardcore to the bone; not constantly scolded mama's boys like himself; and it made him feel like a punk.\\" Before the visit comes off, Nerese drags Darren out, but pauses to deposit money in her nephew's prison account, \\"by way of apology.\\"Ray's flashbacks reveal the gaps between Nerese's evidence and reality. Things are not always what they seem; sometimes they're worse. The action of the plot reveals character. As the novel proceeds there are some shocks in store. Wanting to be good, wanting to connect, however briefly, can be selfish, dangerous, harmful. Ray, unlike Nerese, is not a person who weighs consequences, and consequently he runs hot and cold. Unconsciously, he toys with people's lives. Being inside his prickly, jumpy skin is painful, but you still can't help but like him, root for him, hope he lives and wises up. Wry, dark, full of heart and energy, Price's latest grabs and doesn't let go."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"A great book? No. Parts are compelling. Price writes with a great ear for dialogue and an uncanny ability to portray life in the inner-city. The story is solid and has some interesting twists. It is about men finding themselves and some women too. Ray is hard character to love as you sometimes want to shake some sense in to him. The ending is a bit pat and cliched, but still a well written look at a world most of us never see."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"The Manhattan skyline across the river from Ray's terrace is a spectacular backdrop for characters wrestling with conflicts between generations and classes in the shadow of the fallen Trade Center. Even when they strike out at each other, the people in this wonderful novel search for love and forgiveness. From an intensive care hospital room to an urban school to a park bench in the projects, the sensory details bring it all home to the reader. This is one of those books where you slow down halfway through because you don't want it to end. Thanks for this, your best book yet, Mr. Price."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Who bashed in Ray Mitchell's head, and why? That would seem to be the central question in Richard Price's Samaritan, but the author uses this event to weave an intricate thriller that is as much character-driven as plot-driven. Beginning in medias res, as we are told to do, the book begins with Ray lying in a hospital bed trying to make sense out of a world that seems hopelessly jumbled after his attack. Price skillfully provides his protagonist's backstory, a writer who has had some recent success with a screenplay, now returns to his old haunts in New Jersey to teach underprivileged kids. He befriends them, takes them into his confidence, invites them into his apartment, and one of them, presumably cracks open Ray's skull. The detective who investigates the case is an old friend from Ray's neighborhood past.As intriguing as the who-done-it aspect is, Ray's attempts to cope are even moreso. To begin with, he refuses to identify his assailant. One would expect that Ray would learn from his experience, but in the end he returns to the same behavior that got him cracked on the head in the first place. His Samaritan tendencies are an irresistable part of his personality.Throughout the work, Price's skilled use of dialogue stands out. An early review in the NYT called his dialogue \\"pitch perfect.\\" I agree.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"This is the fifth Richard Price book I've read. I enjoyed his three acclaimed novels Clockers, Freedomland and Lush Life immensely but to me this sleeper is his best. Ray Mitchell is a failed husband and father, reformed coke head and briefly an emmy winning television writer who has recently returned to his roots in Dempsey, NJ. Ray's failing is his overwhelming need for approval from any and all but most especially his daughter Ruby. Ray is assaulted and his friend from the projects, from his youth, Tweety is determined to find out what happened. By the time I finished this book I knew Ray as well as any character in a book in a long time. This novel works as a mystery but even more so as a character driven novel."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Price is a flat-out genius. Who can better make us understand character and motivation while simultaneously talking the talk and amusing us and keeping a tight grip on the story? Funny, but I always HEAR Al Pacino talking when I read Price. Excellent."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I first read Richard Price's \\"The Wanderers\\" in the 70's several years before Philip Kaufman's excellent film adaptation. It remains one of my favorite all time books, and none of his works since then have compared to that early novel.\\"The Wanderers\\" differs from his later work in that the characterizations are less drawn out, but no less interesting, and it is perhaps his most humorous work. Where Price excells is his mastery of creating urban street people . I believe he is a far better writer than George Pellacanos who has a similar reputation with his work. I am planning to read the highly praised \\"Lush Life\\" very soon, but decided to catch up on Price by reading this novel first. Other than the aforementioned \\"Lush Life\\" and \\"Freedomland\\", I have read all his other published work. I am not sure I will ever read \\"Freedomland\\" having wasted 2 hours of my life sitting through what had to be one of the 20 worst films adapted from a novel that I have ever seen.Samaritan is a decent mystery that is enhanced by Price's deep characterizations and gritty dialogue. I personally solved the mystery rather early on, but at the same time I found some of the characters less than totally believable. The protaginist Ray Mitchell was richly drawn, but at the end of the day,I just did not believe in the guy. He was overall a bit too weird. The other main character, a detective named Nerese was far more believable if for no other reason that she embraced a lot more of the typical big city detective close to retirement features that we as readers and film watchers have come to expect. The novel is a bit of a page turner and I read it very quickly. You would not be making a bad choice if you decide to curl up with \\"Samaritan\\" for a couple of days, but Price has done better."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Certainly Price is not a great novelist, but he is a good storyteller. This novel is current, a fast paced and easy read, not especially predictable, and with much more depth than the usual novel of this genre. If you like this type of mystery, this is a superior book."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"There are writers --- and then there are writers. We all have our favorites. There are times when you slap yet another metal sticky note onto your crowded psyche as a reminder to pick up a copy of something you read about in the book section of the newspaper --- and then there are those other times. You're headed down the freeway listening to an NPR program when you learn that a certain writer has a new book out. You very calmly but deliberately cut the wheel hard to the left with one hand, yank the emergency brake lever with the other and execute a perfect bootlegger turn across the grassy median in order to take the shortest route to the nearest bookstore. Once you're home with your new prize, you read with such intensity that, hours after you've turned the last page, your eyes still can't properly focus on anything more than a foot away from your face.I don't know who that writer is for you, but for me it's Richard Price. When I heard that the author of CLOCKERS and FREEDOMLAND (and the screenwriter behind a very respectable selection of screenplays, including THE COLOR OF MONEY and MAD DOG AND GLORY) had a new book out, I knew that I'd be putting in my time as a book zombie. No problem. Like CLOCKERS and FREEDOMLAND, SAMARITAN is set in the city of Dempsey, New Jersey, a kind of East Coast every-town --- run down, ragged and carrying the post-industrial scars that are all that remain after the good times have gone elsewhere. And as with those two previous novels, the various threads of the story at the heart of SAMARITAN converge in the grimy buildings and littered playgrounds of the Hopewell housing project. The multifaceted and richly detailed story centers on two characters whose common history begins in the Hopewell projects.Ray Mitchell, local-boy-made-good, has returned to Dempsey after a successful stint as a television writer --- a job he landed only after kicking a cocaine habit that cost him his marriage and left him estranged from his thirteen year-old daughter, who now lives with her mother in Manhattan, the skyline of which is visible from the balcony of Ray's apartment in the Dempsey suburbs. Ray's return to Dempsey is part of an effort to re-establish a relationship with his daughter, an effort that includes plans to give something back to the neighborhood of his youth.Nerese Ammons, on the other hand, never left Dempsey. In her job as a police detective, she is never far from Hopewell and the poverty, drug addiction and violence that marred her own childhood and left her a single mother. She stoically managed the responsibilities of raising a teenaged son and accepted with willingness and a touch of philosophy the additional burden of caring for members of an extended family inherited from her absent, unlamented husband.When Ray is found brutally beaten and barely alive in his apartment, Nerese, weeks away from retirement and escape to a new life in Florida, takes the case, her interest fueled by the sliver of preadolescent history she shares with Ray. But her investigation is hampered by Ray's refusal to name his assailant. So there's a mystery here to be sure and a darn good one. But there is so much depth and detail to SAMARITAN that to label it a mystery is like describing the Sistine Chapel as a building with a nice ceiling.At its core, SAMARITAN is an examination of the awesome responsibility inherent in the role of the parent. It is about how, in dealing with that responsibility --- successfully or otherwise --- every person acting in that role adds to the collection of stories that will ultimately define who he or she is and who his or her children will become. Ray Mitchell, a man who understands and values stories, knows that his own story needs a bit of nudging to get it back on course to something resembling a happy ending. In this pursuit he volunteers to teach creative writing to a group of students at his old high school, pro bono. He speaks passionately to his students about the value of the stories in their lives and his message resonates with a few. But even as he makes headway with his students, Ray's ability to truly connect with his daughter is hobbled by his desperate need to be liked. And while his daughter is a willing and eager audience for the tales of his youth, Ray, for all his talent and skill, can't penetrate to the truth of his own story.When Ray learns that an old school acquaintance doesn't have the money to bury her son, a victim of drug abuse, he and his daughter visit the woman in her Hopewell apartment and he presents her with a check, hoping that his daughter has taken notice of his extraordinary generosity. Though heartfelt and genuine, Ray's act of kindness, one of many in the story, is motivated by self-conscious needs so acute that they blind him to the responsibilities that go hand in hand with such generosity. It is this blindness that will leave Ray beaten and bleeding on the floor of his apartment and send Nerese Ammons on the trail of the person who put him in that condition.SAMARITAN, indeed a first-rate mystery, has something important to say, but it eases its message out drop by drop in doses so carefully controlled that the ultimate impact is at once surprising and obvious. Richard Price has demonstrated once again a profound and often chilling understanding of what is inside our heads and a masterful ability to translate that unimaginable complexity into compact, highly readable prose.--- Reviewed by Bob Rhubart"},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Ray Mitchell grew up in the housing projects of Dempsey, N.J., went to LA to become a successful TV writer, and now returned to Dempsey with enough money to allow himself a few quirks. Mainly, re wants to reconnect with his 13-year old daughter Ruby.Nerese Ammons, a black detective within months of retirement, knows Ray from childhood and remembers him as being on her side when the other school children gave her grief.Ray wants to do good so that people will love him. But he does not know how to do it without coming across like the Salvation Army. He gets lied to, he gets ripped off, he just simply cannot connect because he forgot about the slums and no longer speaks their language.And then Ray is brutally beaten up. Nerese takes over the investigation, because she owes him from way back. But Ray won't tell her who did it. and she has to detect the hard way.By now this book should be a mystery. But it refuses to. It is the story of the people living in the project, their hopes and aspirations. They will not make it out of that slum, and they know it. But still they keep trying. They act like mafia godfathers hoping the image will put them on a higher level. The children visit prison and the criminals become superman. Yet at all times they have a clear understanding of their surroundings and the psychological facts of their diminished lives.The author gives us an uncanny picture of people and locations but presents them almost like a stream of conscience. While it is fun to dig deeper here or there, the main attraction is in the swimming on the surface and let it all parade by."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I was drawn into \\"Samaritan\\" from the very first page. Rare among novels in the \\"mystery\\" genre, Richard Price has found a harmonious balance between developing a nerve-racking storyline and convincing readers that his characters are as real as can be. This delicate equilibrium results in feelings of attachment and ubiquity. That is, instead of simply wondering who the \\"bad guy\\" is and what the dramatic climax to the story might be, we are made to truly care about and love the characters who live in Dempsy, NJ. Price has suceeded in creating Anytown, USA, penned a story we can all relate to, and has shown us that -- in many ways -- we are all the \\"Samaritan.\\"Ray Mitchell, under mysterious circumstances, has left his high-paying job as a somewhat-accomplished television writer in Los Angeles and returned home to the New Jersey city that he grew up in. Settling down in his parents' old apartment, he attempts to put his life back together, recalling his past as a reject English teacher, a low-life cabbie, and a ruthless drug-user. He begins by giving back to the community that gave him so little while he was growing up -- his generosity knowing no bounds. He continues to give, and give, and give, clearly pleased at the response he receives from the needy tenants of the housing project he grew up in.Ray begins teaching a volunteer creative writing class at the underprivileged school he once attended, reconnects with his estranged teenaged daughter, Ruby, and makes several unwise loans to distant members of his even more distant past. It doesn't take long before Ray is able to bask in his reputation as a \\"good samaritan.\\" In a bizarre twist of events, however, Ray is found unconscious in his apartment, the victim of a violent beating that brings him within an inch of permanent brain damage.Meanwhile Nerese Ammons, a childhood acquaintence of Ray, is becoming tired of the sell-short assignments she is being given in the last few weeks before her retirement from the police force. Indebted to Ray due to an incident when they were children, and desperate to take one final case before retiring to Florida, Nerese resolves to find out who Ray's attacker was. But Ray seems more afraid of the perpetrator being caught than he is of the perpetrator.The wonderfully eloquent and descriptive story meanders between past and present, switching between Ray's new life in Dempsy and Nerese's post-incident investigation. This structure makes it possible for Price to develop his characters in astounding detail, all the while keeping the reader gasping for more.The book has very few serious flaws. While some characters fail to develop into fully dynamic entities, most of the characters are both real and interesting. Nerese is one of the former, never quite coming into her own -- one of my few disappointments with the book. In addition to a few under-developed characters, the book's ending is not overly difficult to guess after a short time reading. The ending, however, is not where the payoff is, unlike most mystery novels. Watching the characters develop and change is much more exciting, and the satisfaction of finding out \\"the answer\\" is merely icing on the cake.Price takes us on a fascinating tour of a world where first chances are rare, second chances are unheard of, and generosity is golden. He shows us the danger of selfish giving, and the addiction that overpowers all others: the desire to be admired and praised. And finally, he shows us the end result when a person becomes so dependent on the high of giving that he loses track of reality.We all live in Dempsy, and we are all in some way like Ray Mitchell, making \\"Samaritan\\" one of the most powerful and captivating books I have read recently."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I eagerly await every book by Richard Price. Samaritan was no exception. I appreciate his consistency - I have never been disappointed in any of his books. His characters always have rich inner lives and his plot line always keep the reader interested.

Those of you who have not read any of his other books are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"This was a very enjoyable book. It was a good mystery but the psychological and sociological aspects were what made it well above the quality of the average thriller. The characters stay with you long after the last page.

After returning to his hometown, an ex-TV writer is beaten within an inch of his life and refuses to reveal the identity of his assailant. Through flashbacks we learn of his attempt to reestablish a relationship with his daughter, the return to his inner city high school to teach creative writing and about the generous gifts of cash he bestows on various residents of a housing project. \\"Samaritan\\" is Price's third consecutive novel - following \\"Clockers\\" & \\"Freedomland\\" - to be set in the fictional town of Dempsy, N.J. and once again he gives us a small human drama presented on a large urban scale. Race and crime are familiar waters for Price and he navigates them well, but that's not to say this is a flawless novel - it isn't. The sexual relationship that occurs is perplexing to say the least, the childhood back-story is too coincidental and some of the classroom scenes are reminiscent of \\"Welcome Back Kotter\\". All that aside, \\"Samaritan\\" is still a compulsive page turner, sweet and riveting with a climax that's quietly powerful. Definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Why abridge an already short detective story?

The author leaves you constantly waiting for the book to begin but it never really does. The buildup is continuous, and when the climax comes it's not worth the wait. The characters tended to be very rigid. Clockers is a much better book."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I'll admit it: I was a sucker for detective stories for years. Bring me a Spenser novel, a cup of black coffee and a Barca-lounger, and I'd be happy as a clam. I'll also admit that, as I grew older, the spate of new mystery novels by Parker and Grafton and others began to seem dry, lacking in vitality. Sure, their protagonist heroes spat their share of wisecracks, but no amount of one-liners could hide the fact that most current mystery novels were devoid of substance and feeling. With Samaritan, Richard Price ups the ante fivefold on the detective story. He breathes life into it by giving the story and its characters a remarkable human touch, by going after our hearts as well as our nerves.We meet Ray Mitchell upon his return to his birthplace of Dempsy, NJ, so he can start his life over. There, he begins teaching a creative-writing class at his former high school, reconnects with the residents at the Hopewell housing project where he was raised, and attempts to rekindle a relationship with his thirteen-year-old daughter whom he lost in the aftermath of a divorce. Ray is often generous, which is impressive considering he's had a less-than-perfect past, involving the loss of his daughter, a lowly cab-driving job, a perpetual addiction to cocaine, and finally, a letdown after an ever-so-brief stint as a TV-writer comes to an unexpected close.Just as Ray begins to find his place again in Dempsy, he is found beaten almost to death in his apartment. Enter Nerese Ammons: a cop, a childhood friend of Ray, a former resident of Hopewell, and someone forever indebted to Ray for saving her life when they were just kids. Nerese feels morally obligated to take on Ray's case, but Ray obstinately refuses to identify his attacker and won't press charges. Nerese must now enter the abyss of Ray's past in order to solve the puzzle, while simultaneously working to keep her own life intact in the bleak and unforgiving Dempsy.On the surface, Samaritan is made out to be a whodunit thriller, and it is, but to call it simply that would be doing the book and its author a great injustice. The strength of this book lies in the way it is written, and this is how Price brings his cast of characters to life. He records every nuance, every movement, every thought the characters possess behind their lines of dialogue, turning story characters into living, breathing people. They speak with mellifluous street-savvy, but don't be fooled. They may be hardened but their words simply glow with realistic emotion, at times expressing unrelenting urgency, at others, heartfelt compassion. Price gives all of his important characters vivid back-stories, important details of their lives and psyches, all of which may seem to some readers as unnecessary belaboring, but nonetheless clue us in to exactly what kind of people we are dealing with at certain points in the story. Simply put, Price makes us care about his characters and their various states because everything about them is real, filled with a kind of depth and humanity that can only be pulled off by an accomplished writer with an eye for the intricacies of human life.Samaritan, all plot details aside, is about the powerful effect that adults have on children, and the similar effect children have on those adults. One of the many manifestations of this is shown in Ray's attempts to reconnect with his adolescent daughter, Ruby. Ruby has clearly distanced herself from her father following his return to Dempsy. Ray knows he's been guilty of poor fatherhood in the past and tries ceaselessly to mend the rifts, but Ruby is staunchly unyielding to her father's desperate attempts to reenter as an important part of her life. Without Ruby, Ray admits he feels as though he is nothing, hopelessly downtrodden. But Ruby is also powerfully affected by her father, shown by her stony revulsion towards him, the result of a debilitating sucker punch from her tainted past. The pain is felt by both: the child rejected by the adult and the adult rejected by the child, and the pain is felt heavily because the sacred relationship between father and daughter should be one of care, and not of heartache.Price compels us to sink into the thriller he ravels for us, but in doing so, he never strays from the true meaning of the work. Each piece of the puzzle has a greater significance than its literal role in the mystery would suggest. We want to read on; we want to find out what happens not only for the sake of knowing Ray's attacker but also to learn a greater truth about life and people. It is as if we are a bit wiser by the end of the book, because we don't just know who dun it...we know what it is about the world that makes who dun it tick; the 'why' behind the mystery.Richard Price thrusts us into a gritty, unfamiliar world with unfamiliar people, and by the end we couldn't feel more contrary. We know the town of Dempsy (love it or hate it we may), and we feel as though we grew up with these faces and their stories. We feel what they feel because we love them like people we intimately know. It's really for this reason that the story (and the mystery itself) has such depth: there are consequences for everyone involved in this web, not just the perpetrator. All of the characters must move their lives through the tumult of everything around them, some of them within inches of crumbling. In short, Richard Price has written a mystery novel where we feel something, where our thoughts and formulations coexist with our feelings and emotions quite harmoniously, and I believe that's precisely what a good reading experience should be."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"The NY Times wrongly disses this book, calling it &quot;hollow&quot; and saying Price gives away the theme in the Epigraph, a Bible quote.I'll spare you the King James; here's a modern English translation of the epigraph:&quot;Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. &quot;Safe to say, our hero, Ray, doesn't heed those words and, thus, a fine novel ensues. Price shows us what can go wrong when neediness occurs on both sides of the charitable transaction. For Ray, a simple &quot;thank you&quot; from God in heaven is not enough. He wants it here and now.Despite the Times complaint cited above, I don't think Price spoon-feeds us here. He thrusts us into the middle of what seems an unfair situation (paraphrasing one of the characters here, we may find ourselves wondering, &quot;what'd he do??&quot;) and slowly allows us to see the flaws at Ray's core -- flaws in an otherwise good man."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"In this masterful novel, former TV writer, cab driver, and drug addict Ray Mitchell moves home to Dempsey, New Jersey , after leaving a successful writing job in LA. Ray was raised in the projects, and now he wants to give back by teaching at his old high school. He also wants to be closer to his daughter, Ruby, who lives in nearby Manhattan. But before much of any of this can happen, Ray is assaulted in his apartment and in the hospital with a crushed skull. What he is not is giving out details to Nerese Ammons, the detective who's on the case. Richard Price takes the story from both Ray and Nerese's point of view and employs a flexible time line. Level after level of past and present are revealed to add depth, power, and real suspense to a completely engrossing and satisfying read. Price has a remarkable ear for dialogue, and knows places like Hopewell Houses in Dempsey inside and out. He is unsentimental about life in the projects. The characters are etched in such sharp relief that you know you\`ve seen them somewhere.It is a kind of liberation for readers to be in such capable hands that you know that whatever happens, you will not be disappointed. There are no false steps in \\"Samaritan,\\" no easy choices, and no plays for sympathy for Ray or anyone else. It's tough, good, and a learning experience about not only about what it means to be a samaritan, but about how a really good novel should be written. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I have to give Richard Price credit for creating realistic characters with dialogue that crackles and feels painfully real coming from this group of broken people. However by the time I finished I was left wanting more. The mystery surrounding who beat one time television writer and now teacher Ray Mitchell to death left me a bit cold. And when the person is revealed I can't even say I was surprised, but worse I didn't really care. I loved the book at the start and was expecting to tap into something I'd be telling eveyone to go out and buy. Again I thought the writing was great, I just didn't completely connect with this group of people, and so ultimately didn't connect with the book."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Price's \\"Samaritan\\" has exceeded his previous novels in several respects, not the least of which is his outstanding command of dialogue and \\"street language.\\" I doubt there are many other contemporary novelists - or playwrights or screenwriters, for that matter -- who have such a feel for producing natural-sounding conversations about urban life, particularly New Jersey urban life. Since the publication of \\"Mystic River\\" and the ensuing film, much has been written about Dennis Lehane and his emergence as a \\"literary mystery writer,\\" which many readers and critics apparently feel is in short supply. While this may be true, and Lehane's powers probably shouldn't be called into question, his ability does not match Price's. Lehane writes crime fiction with literary qualities, while Price writes crime- and mystery-related literary fiction. Perhaps Lehane will eventually evolve, but he is not at Price's level just yet.Michiko Kakutani wrote in the New York Times that \\"Samaritan\\" is not a successful novel because it is never revealed why main character Ray Mitchell has overwhelming feelings of guilt and feels the need to help people who live in the same Dempsy (Newark?) housing project in which he grew up, albeit in awkward and arguably pretentious ways. She also questions why no reason is given as to why Ray feels stronger connections with other children that aren't his own. Kakutani speculates that Ray's drug history may have something to do with the lack of revelations, and her frustration is understandable. Nevertheless, I'm not quite sure I agree with her when she writes that the ability for the reader to empathize with Ray is diminished as a result of this non-revelation. Ray's pain, his inability to connect with his daughter, and his discomfort with wealth are never less than palpable, especially when Price describes Ray's grotesque appearance while lying in a hospital bed, his poignant conversations with childhood friend and now police detective Nerese \\"Tweety\\" Emmons, or his vacillations when deciding if he should offer money. I personally felt that Price purposely didn't give a reason for Ray's quilt because he preferred the reader to deconstruct his or her own reasons. It could be that Price wanted white liberals to ask themselves if they saw themselves in Ray, and in effect gaining a better understanding of why they have felt a similar backlash after a possibly ham-handed, self-serving attempt to ameliorate their own anxiety. When read in this manner, \\"Samaritan\\" could very well be a kind of existential treatise for white urban liberals everywhere; or, possibly, a \\"faux-liberal\\" that Price finds particularly annoying and hypocritical."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"As always, Richard Price creates a thoroughly plausible world, grounded in a thousand little details, creates characters you believe in your bones, and suckerpunches you with raw emotion. I cried -- in public -- more than once reading \\"Samaritan\\". It's amazing."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Richard Price is a street-lyrical craftsman at depicting urban atmosphere. But he's also very funny. Just about all these reviews of \\"Samaritan\\" leave out the comic angle. Salim's raps to Ray Mitchell as he tries to tag him for T-shirt making cash are a riot. The mixed emotions of the teenagers are at once touching and comic. Tom Potenza's nervous fury of hypertalk brought me to tears of laughter. Yes, the book's got a keen gritty atmosphere, but a lot of the electricity in the dialogue comes from the edgy humor."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Richard Price's Samaritan is an excellent novel, one which explores the moral ambiguities of contemporary life, providing no pat answers, just thought-provoking prose. At the heart of the novel is Ray Mitchell, a man returning home to the fictional New Jersey town of Dempsey. He has had some successes and comes home for various reasons-some admirable, some not. He volunteers to teach a creative writing class at his old high school, and the next thing we know, he is in the hospital after being brutally beaten in his apartment. The novel moves back and forth in time (although all in the space of a few months), shifting perspective between Ray and Nerese Ammons the determined detective investigating the beating. She suspects he knows who beat him, and has various plausible theories. The resolution of the novel is unexpected, but certainly not unbelievable. The characters are terrific, as is the dialogue. Samaritan is an excellent novel-challenging, thought-provoking and completely readable. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Price's earlier strong work made the appearance of &quot;Samaritan&quot; the occasion of some anticipation, but for me the novel failed to deliver the expected punch.The premise is sound: a product of the New Jersey projects with a checkered past unexpectedly achieves success as a writer in LA, but returns to his old haunts, mostly to try to reconnect with is daughter, from whom he has been physically separated since his divorce.The novel, however, pivots on a vicious attack on the writer, Nick, who refuses to reveal the nature of the assault to a black female detective --nicknamed Tweetie -- who, remarkably, lived in the projects at the same time. In fact, Nick witnessed, and even participated in, a humiliation of a young Tweetie.Well, Ok, quite a coincidence, but maybe we're still willing to go along, except that Price introduces yet another character from Nick's past in a chance meeting that ultimately leads to the attack that Tweetie winds up investigating.Too much authorial meddling for me, but Price can write well, so I might be willing to go along. However, he compounds problems by insisting that his main character is an inveterate storyteller. And oh, how this character tells stories. In fact, that's about all he does, in endless forays into the past that seem merely to serve as an excuse for Price to wax eloquently through his characters. Well, other readers might have enjoyed the liberties Price takes, but for this reader, a series of speeches by the characters and long narrative expositions of what happened years ago is a prescription for a stagnant narrative, no matter now masterful the writer.In fact, I give three stars only on the strength of the prose. Unlike novels I best admire, which gain strength as they progress, &quot;Samaritan&quot; tired as it reached the finish line, leaving me both exhausted and relieved that the ordeal was over."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I read The Wanderers, Richard Price's first novel, when I was a teenager and have read every one of his subsequent (seven including the present one) books. Although I've liked some better than others, they've all kept me thoroughly entertained and intrigued with the gritty street life Price so expertly evokes. Samaritan, like his last two novels, takes place in Dempsey, the fictional but believable small New Jersey city only a tunnel ride away from Manhattan. Samaritan is a combination mystery and psychological study. The title refers to Ray Mitchell, a man in his forties who abandons a writing career in Los Angeles to return to his hometown of Dempsey to teach. Ray is at loose ends. A recovering drug addict, he is estranged from his ex-wife and Ruby, his teenaged daughter and has no concrete plans for the future. He hopes that by returning to the home of his youth and helping some young people he will find direction. It is his need to help and be appreciated that is his downfall. For Ray is not the kind of &quot;samaritan&quot; who only gives help when it is truly needed; he is the kind who desperately needs to feel appreciated and will do practically anything to meet this need. The story is told partly in the present, after Ray has been assaulted and nearly killed, and partly in flashback as the events leading up to the assault are revealed. A childhood neighbor of Ray's, Nerese Ammons, is the policewoman who tries to figure out who attacked Ray and why. The problem is, Ray won't tell her and she (and the reader) cannot understand why. Nerese, a black woman who is about to retire from the police force, has problems of her own; she is a single mother with a family that includes criminals and drug abusers. In describing all this, I realize that a lot of it may sound familiar, even cliched (e.g. the cop about to retire), but Price has an unusual talent for transforming such material into a compelling story. His knack for dialogue, especially that of the city streets, is unsurpassed. Some popular writers write dialogue that sounds like writing; with Price, you can always *hear* the words and inflections. Samaritan is also helped by several interesting supporting characters, such as Salim, a troubled youth who Ray may be harming more than helping, and Tom Potenza, an ex-addict who counsels people around the projects. Race is a major factor throughout the novel, especially the question of what motivates a white man like Ray in his quest to &quot;save&quot; people who are mostly black. If Samaritan were presented as some kind of lesson in ethics or race relations, it would be simplistic and heavy-handed, but it isn't really that. Ray is a complex character whose motives are not entirely noble, but he is not a mere hypocrite. The novel explores the fine line that divides helping people for genuine as opposed to selfish reasons. Samaritan, like its main character, has its flaws and it's not my favorite Richard Price novel, but it is still an enjoyable and thought provoking tale."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"- - that I picked up.

These questions are answered one by one as Nerese Ammons, the detective investigating his case, uncovers them.

In the end Mitchell and the reader both receive the gratification that comes with gaining compassion in return for a life of giving it."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"Samaritan is a novel that is being sold as a mystery. But it's like no other mystery I've read before. The main plot which, in any other hands, could have turned into your average thrill-a-minute police investigation is only the basis for character developement in Samaritan. Price isn't really concerened about plot. What he does care for are his characters and their interraction with one another.Ray is a man who doesn't really know what he wants. He needs to be loved, needs to be told that he is needed or wanted and, because of this very flaw, Ray is a very unhappy man. He can't connnect with his daughter, can't keep a job, can't seem to find a way to feel truly happy even when everything seems to be going okay in his life. When he is found beaten to a bloody pulp in his apartment, people believe that Ray has stepped into some sort of sour deal he can't find a way out of. But as we're about to learn, Ray doesn't want to tell who hurt him. He doesn't even seem to care about it.Enters Nerese, a cop who's on the brink of retirement and a woman who used to know Ray when they were growing up in a harsh and brutal part of New York. She's decided that she will figure out who hurt Ray before retirering, something that is easier said than done.Told in flashbacks and through dialog, the book is the kind that grabs you by the gut by its shear intelligence and brilliance. It is a rare thing to find a book where every single character feels real, as if he or she is about to jump right out of the page. Price brings his characters to life in a way no other author can. And as if that wasn't enough, Price proves himself a master at writing dialog. The characters often go on long rants, recalling the past, or more precisely, recalling their own interpretation of the past. These moments are like listening to a master storyteller telling a story. You won't want to skip a single word.Nostalgia drenches every page of this book, and so does pain and misery. Through each other, these characters learn to accept themselves in a way they've never been able to before. And although the book never reaches the high happy note each character is triving for, its quiet ending is simply perfect.Samaritan is a slice-of-life that completely blew my mind away. I can't recall the last time a book got to me so much. This was my first time trying Price, and now that I'm hooked, I'm sure it won't be the last."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"The setting is dark. We are drawn into an \\"inner city\\" world, a world of poverty, squalor, drug addiction, violence.And yet in some ways, this world is sometimes transformed into a utopian cloud. There is no racism in this world. The white, in fact Jewish, father, feels perfectly safe walking through it after dark with his pre-teen daughter. Excuse me, what world is this?In a park, in the dark, this white man and his young daughter have no fear or caution in the presence of a group of male teens who could pose any number of threats. Let's not confuse racial harmony and idealism with blindness and insanity. No, you don't take your 12 year old girl there at night and then talk loudly in order to attract the attention of the boys in the park.To increase the racial utopianism, there are inter-racial romances here. Apparently in Newark NJ or its clone (aka Dempsy, in this book) the races are all just one big happy family, perfectly at ease with each other, and hopping into bed.The story is very well written. You are carried along, even though the time line is choppy. We go from one date to another, from past to future to past to middle. By the end of the book we are placed firmly in the middle, when the big assault occurs.You can learn a lot about the storyline from the other reviews on this site, some really detailed and excellent.Halfway through the book I found myself counting the prime suspect out. There is one prime suspect, so obvious, and since we are reading a novel and not experiencing real life, it was apparent to me that the prime suspect can't possibly be the assaulter. I considered it a strike against the author, that he most likely followed the old formula of misleading the reader about the guilty party. I expected a surprise ending. They all have them. The culprit must be someone else, someone you don't expect, but someone already described in the book. I had no idea who it could be, and I was half-hoping it was in fact the prime suspect, showing that the author had the nerve to go against the grain and simply tell us who did it, and it turns out that's who did it.You'll have to read it yourself to find out. Maybe good old Freddy did it, and maybe he didn't. Maybe it was suspect number two, Salim, and maybe it wasn't. It couldn't have been daughter Ruby. Could it? No way. Could the girlfriend have done it? Nah. Freddy, we're back to Freddy. But could Richard Price really buck the system that much and have our prime suspect actually guilty?This book gives us a good lesson in personality types. I recommend the psychology books by Don Riso. The title character, Ray the samaritan, is a Type Two in Riso's personality type system, the helper, the giver, the instant friend, the easy touch. In the most famous personality type system, astrology, I suppose our samaritan is a Pisces, sympathetic and drawn to that world of illusion that can be reached through drugs."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"While I must reserve a 5 star rating for books like &quot;Clockers&quot;, this one was excellent.Story of a guy who probably is a good guy, but has a problem with wanting people to see him as a savior.

He has developed stories of his main and minor characters that are very interesting, all of which are intertwined with that of his protagonist, Ray Mitchell. What is lacking for me in Samaritan, and which keeps me from giving it a higher rating, is the development of a very interesting plot. What kept me reading this book was the high quality of Price's writing (5 stars), not the plot itself (3 stars). For me, Clockers and Freedomland, deserved 5 stars on both important factors. Nonetheless, Samaritan is a book worth your time and money. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"price is intrusive sometimes when points are made obviously for the reader's benefit (asides about parenting pitfalls, personality disorders, intimacy traps, etc.); and it's hard to believe that a character's deep personality flaw can be read at the glance of the savvy observing character as happens in this novel (to the benefit of the reader, who is also then made aware of what to watch for in the flawed individual; but actions speak louder than words, and a reader can usually be trusted to come to his own accurate conclusion thusly). _freedomland_ haunts me still, from a single reading years ago; _samaritan_ covers more territory and a larger number of characters; the pace is consistent, the style visceral, and the metaphors are witty and thought-provoking"},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I loved this book. It's funny, clever, tender towards its citizens and it's a compelling mystery with an explosive climax I definitely did not see coming.While 'Clockers' was all the above plus an education about a world I knew nothing about, this book described some of my own experiences very well. I once lived in a poor part of the city, tried some of the well-meaning things that the story's protagonist did, and now weeks after finishing the book, am still revisiting those episodes in my mind.I'm sure this will be one of my five favorite books of the year."},{"Title":"Samaritan","review":"I can't imagine how Richard Price will ever top this truly perfect book. The pace is as fast as a racetrack's but more importantly you recognize parts of yourself in his many beautifully defined characters. Not one is perfect: all are filled with humanity. And the title _Samaritan_ could be placed on each."},{"Title":"The marked Bible","review":"When Harold Wilson found a Bible hidden away in his sailor's chest, he flung the book over the ship's railing and into the sea. Harold would have nothing to do with the Bible his mother had so lovingly marked in hopes that he would read its pages and turn from his life of crime and vice. But like Jonah, the runaway prophet, Harold couldn't run from God no matter how hard he tried.This book is a classic story of a mother's love, a rebellious son, and the transforming power of God's Word. With the drama of a trans-Pacific Ocean voyage as a backdrop, the \\"marked Bible\\" takes center stage in the lives of Harold and his traveling companions as a strange preacher begins to reveal a forgotten truth from its pages. The entire ship is in an uproar, and soon lives will be changed forever. It is an electrifying story of what can happen when sincere hearts persue God's truth no matter what the cost."},{"Title":"The marked Bible","review":"This book displays how the power of God's grace reaches after us and waits until we're ready to receive it. I was truly touched."},{"Title":"The marked Bible","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story takes you on a roller coaster of emotions. The book reads like a Bible study but is not boring. The Truth will indeed set you free if you search for it with all your heart and let the Holy Spirit lead you."},{"Title":"The Moths and Other Stories","review":"In Philadelphia, over the past summer, I happened to be in a used book store perusing the shelves for a good read. Being a student of writing, I thought after a short time, that I should look for some works by my professors at school. The first author I looked for was Helena Maria Viramontes, because the way she talks about writing is better than a lot of the stuff authors publish. She always talks in class about her novel, Under the Feet of Jesus, or her new work. All they had was a collection of short stories that I didn't remember ever having heard her talk about, called The Moths and Other Stories. I picked it up, bought it, and by the end of the day had finished reading it. What a great collection of stories it is. It's so enjoyable to read that you finish it before you would like to. I have told professor Viramontes about my finding it, and she said that she rarely thought of the collection anymore, but that she was very happy with some of the stories it contained. I was very happy with the whole book. I think you will be too."},{"Title":"The Moths and Other Stories","review":"I have to admit it. I bought this book in a rushed in-and-out at a feminist bookstore because of its gorgeous cover. To my delight, the stories within it are as complex and deviant as the painting.Viramontes' writing is not breezy; it requires attention, especially as the book progresses.Her subjects are not for the weak at heart. They are raw and offer no excuses or apologies for it.The sexual ambiguity, the inminent violence, the imposing masculine presence, and the abundance of religion in the culture of Chicano women are all explored to the bone in these stories.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Moths and Other Stories","review":"I read this for a Literature and Culture class. We were presumably to read excerpts, but I finished the book, shut in that I am. I found these stories at turns fascinating, poignant, and annoying. The Moths is a touching and true-feeling story of devotion between a dying grandmother and her granddaughter. As one reads of the narrator tenderly bathing her disoriented, cancer-gnawed grandmother, the question occurs: Is the author commenting on the selfishness of our attempts at helping others, our efforts offshoots of a feeling of \\"obligation\\" to our benefactors? Or is it a comment on the Hispanic family structure, or merely an illustration of one moment?Growing is a bittersweet story of sisterly devotion, from the hispanic perspective. Naomi evolves from a perception of her younger sister Lucia as an onus (an escort) to a realization of her as a worthy, budding human being, all of which has for a catalyst a game of baseball played by some barrio children.Birthday involves a young girls abortion, and is the sometimes lamentable introduction of stream of consciousness into the author's stories. Other stories become more disturbing, both in topic (The Cariboo Cafe masterfully treats the brutality of the border patrol while neighbors studies the disintegration of urban hispanic neighborhoods), while Snapshots, the story of an old woman deemed crazy for her attachment to the past, is infused with a doleful brilliance.I have boundless respect for the technique of stream of consciousness, from Faulkner's babbling yokels to Woolf's introspective, ethereal characterizations. But it has to be done sparingly (especially these days, when the technique is old hat) and adroitly. These two stipulations are the only two for which Miss Viramontes does not answer in full on this work. Still worth your time, though."},{"Title":"Psalm Prayers","review":"David Haas has provided an excellent service - he has provided psalms for those who can't pray the psalms. More specifically, he has taken a number of liturgically important psalms, often only the liturgical selection of verses, and created psalm prayers in contemporary language and style. What is most impressive about this work is he has usually retained Biblical images, making these psalm prayers a school for the eventual praying of the psalms themselves.This is not to say that Haas' renderings are great poetry, but they are singable/chantable in the structure of the Liturgy of the Hours (i.e. they have antiphons, can be sung in unison or antiphonally ...).An example from Psalm 55: &quot;If I had the winds of a dove, / I would fly away to safety. / I would fly far, / far away, / I would hide in the wilderness.&quot;I recommend it as one of the best collections I have seen attempting to fulfil the &quot;praying the psalms but not understanding the psalms as prayer&quot; need."},{"Title":"Salt on Our Skin","review":"&quot; To be lonely is to never have been someone's Numero Uno&quot;, this is the quotation Benoilte Groult chose for the beginning of her book. This might have been the final words as well, because even death will not be able to keep the two title characters apart. Although married with families, from distinctively different backgrounds, with occupations as far apart as could be, Gauvian, as she calls her life-long love, is the son of poor fishermen in the Bretagne, where she spends summers with her family. He plays tricks on her and chases her as a girl; as teenagers, this changes, and they fall in love. He travels the ocean, not able to stay on land for any extended period of time. She goes to college and starts teaching and writing. Their affair continues through letters and infrequent meetings at exotic places all over the world. Their acceptions of each other's differences and of the herein founded limitations lets their deep love and commitment continue till the cormoran cannot fly anymore.

The author does a good job showing the protagonist's conflict between the cerebral and the genital, and showing how varieties of love exist in the wide space bookended by the brain and the groin. The feminine eroticism of the book reminded me of Mary Gordon's absorbing novel \\"Spending.\\"The author depicts the protagonist's selfish motivations skillfully, from childhood into late middle age. By showing her refusal to accept her lover's marriage proposal because of class and intellectual differences, Groult portrays the woman's haughtines: she rejects her first serious lover and chooses instead various spouses and companions based on financial, career, and intellectual considerations. The novel charts the course of the woman's repeated decisions to ignore her own choices and become involved again and again with the man she deems her cognitive inferior.Along the way she constructs snobbish, often funny excoriations of popular culture and how the effete-- herself and her husbands-- can lead unsatisfying lives by falling prey to avant-garde trends. Groult shows how self-serving this woman is by refusing to let her lover go, by causing him extended pain; the novel also reflects how much she gains by allowing herself to be truly loved. The heroine actually shows some emotional, moral, and social growth because of the affection she receives and-- finally-- recognizes."},{"Title":"Salt on Our Skin","review":"This book is the ultimate must for anybody who likes lovestories.

Patsy and Peter were five years old. Billy was just two years old. Patsy and Peter knew how to build things with a hammer and saw. In \\"Surprise on Wheels\\", they found a big wooden box and built a boat. The boat would not \\"GO\\" so they decided to build a train. They were upset because they did not have any wheels and the train would not \\"GO\\".Little Brother Bill said his big round wooden blocks could be wheels. The children attached the wheels to their train and the train went racing down the hill (with a push from the pet goat).In \\"Wings Over The Woodshed\\", the children build a wooden airplane and their Uncle Joe helped them make it fly! Uncle Joe strings a rope between his barn and a neighbor's tree. He then uses a pulley to make the plane \\"fly\\" along the rope. They use the plane to rescue a neighbor's cat who is stuck in the tree.The children in this story were very innovative. It is hard to imagine five-year-old children being able to build vehicles like they did in these stories. The children seemed to be very skilled with the tools and there was no mention of safety issues in the book.In the days before television, children had to entertain themselves. They had to use their imaginations to visit faraway kingdoms and play with whimsical friends. I think every child imagines building their own car, train or airplane. These children were doing what many dream of doing.I think most parents today would hesitate to turn their young children loose in their workshop. I do think these stories illustrate a spirit of adventure that many children of that day displayed. It was wonderful to turn back the years and read a book that was treasured by children over 60 years ago."},{"Title":"Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames","review":"I am a cousin of the author's, and think that anyone who picks up &quot;Mots D'Heures&quot; should be aware of the amazing life that produced such a witty author. Luis van Rooten was the quintessential Renaissance man. He was trained and worked professionally as an architect; acted in both radio serials and on film (see him as the sassy reporter in the Kirk Douglas film &quot;Detective Story,&quot; not to mention his stints in the cinematic classics &quot;Two Years Before the Mast,&quot; &quot;The Big Clock&quot; and &quot;The Night Has a Thousand Eyes&quot;); drew and did woodblock prints and painted; and, oh yes, he happened to put out a couple of priceless little volumes of writing as well. Luis' artistic and creative abilities come to full flower in &quot;Mots D'Heures,&quot; which requires neither a knowledge of French nor a particular facility with Mother Goose rhymes to enjoy--although both help deepen the reader's appreciation. It is the kind of high-minded silliness that makes you weak from laughter.

Watching Mr. Sebak's nationwide odyssey to find America's best sandwiches is guaranteed to rev up your appetite.\\"American Sandwich\\" is kind of a companion volume to Mr. Sebak's masterpiece--it includes some of the same memorable, droolworthy sandwiches--but it is actually much more. While Mr. Sebak took a \\"shotgun\\" approach in his travels around the country, \\"American Sandwich\\" goes it one better by featuring recipes for one hallmark sandwich each from all 50 states.After a short introduction to the mystique of sandwiches, and a brief timeline tracing the rising popularity of sandwiches in American culinary culture, author Becky Mercuri gets to the \\"meat\\" of the matter. Alphabetized by state, she covers each signature sandwich in two to four readable, well-laid-out pages that, in addition to the recipe, contain other interesting, useful tidbits. Each sandwich gets a sidebar that describes its origin and history--the story of the muffaletta, for example, takes up a whole page of the Louisiana section. There's a \\"Where to Go\\" entry (sometimes more than one) with the address of the best place to sample the sandwich when you're on the road. You'll know to get your Iowa loosemeat sandwich at Taylor's Maid-Rite in Marshalltown, for example. Many sections also have a \\"Need a Quick Fix?\\" entry that lists mail-order or Internet sources for ingredients or for complete sandwiches. Vintage sepia-toned photos illustrate each section, many of them old postcards that touch on each state's history and provide glimpses of life in much simpler times. The only thing missing is pictures of the actual sandwiches themselves, which may seem like a strange omission for a cookbook, but in no way detracts from its value and usefulness--the \\"word pictures\\" alone are enough to put your salivary glands on overtime.As a bona fide \\"foodie,\\" adventurous cook and inveterate road-tripper, I can't praise \\"American Sandwich\\" enough, and I can't recommend it too highly. These sandwiches are classic road food in the best sense of the term, and Ms. Mercuri's work includes the best of both possible worlds--she tells you where to find them and also how to make them yourself--a winning combination.

The Viking Portable Library collection excludes some of his most important stories and poems. This volume has a better selection of his early work -- although Kipling was so prolific that a second large volume of his best could easily be compiled. This book however excludes some his cryptic and difficult later stories such as \\"Dayspring Mishandled\\" which were little noted in their day.The master himself wrote the introduction to \\"A Kipling Pageant\\" in 1935 not long before his death and the essay is a priceless example of Kipling's imagination at work. Among the essential reading in this book I would list the following stories: Lispeth, The Man Who Would Be King, Without Benefit of Clergy, Mowgli's Brothers, Rikki-tikki-tavi\\" and \\"The Church That Was at Antioch.\\" The best poems include \\"If, Recessional, Mandalay, Gunga Din,\\" and \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy.\\" An essay, \\"An Interview with Mark Twain\\" is excellent. However, don't bother to read the novel included in this book, \\"A Light that Failed\\" unless you're really addicted to Kipling. Kipling was not a novelist -- except for \\"Kim\\" which is wonderfully atmospheric, although uneven.Kipling got a bad rap as a racist and conservative among his contemporaries. Actually, he had more sympathy with the subjects of British Imperialism than did many of his critics -- and vastly more understanding. What made Kipling great as an artist was an imagination so expansive that he could imagine himself as the ruler of a country in the future, the engine of a ship, a boy lost in the jungle, a Cockney soldier, an early Christian missionary, or an old woman looking back on life.Kipling and Somerset Maugham in my opinion are the best writers of short stories in English. Kipling, in addition, is one of the most quotable of poets. \\"On the road to Mandalay, Where the flyin'-fishes play, An' the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay!\\"Smallchief"},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Macbeth","review":"I read the play with this book and was able to understand it because of the commentaries. It was very helpful for writing a great thesis paper. It identifies reoccuring themes throughout the book to assist in writing reports of thesis papers.

Check it out. It's easy to understand the play because they explain it in modern english and there's this thing that lets you look up words while you're watching the DVD. You can get it here at Amazon. It's the one directed by J. Bretton Truett and EJ Kerwin. I bought it and these Cliff's Notes and the DVD had way better stuff and it was easier to use when I was studying for a test for this play."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Macbeth","review":"I homeschool my kids and found this \\"Cliffs Complete\\" version to be so comprehensive that I substituted this material for the curriculum I normally use (ABEKA) because this material was so much better. It includes pertinent questions and answers that any teacher can use to see if the student is comprehending the inferences and nuances of the play. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a better, in-depth understanding of one of Shakespeare's greatest works."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Macbeth","review":"I am taking a Shakespeare course at my high school and I bought this to help me in my study of Macbeth. I didn't want a book that \\"translated\\" Shakespearean verse into modern English, because that actually hurts more than it helps. You may \\"understand what's going on\\" if you read something like that, but Shakespeare chose the words he did for a reason: he rhymed, made allusions, used alliteration, metaphors, similes, backspeak, poetic compression, and all the rest, for a reason. And you can't find that complexity when you use the modern English versions. So I really loved the Cliffs Complete version. It has the original (or as close as you can come to it) text on one page, and helpful definitions of outdated words on the adjacent page, as well as interpretations of certain references and allusions.I like that the book starts out by talking about Will's life and times. It helps put things into historical context. Readers need to know that King James VI of Scotland and I of England had just ascended the thrown, and that Shakespeare would be performing this with his fellow actors infront of him. They need to know that attempts to take the King's life using \\"black magic\\" were made, and tales of witches and sorcery abounded. It also talks a bit about the play's themes/motifs, and the writing style/language used.At the beginning of each scene is a brief summary, and at the end a very thorough one. Commentary is easy to understand, and helpful for the more complex bits. My only beef is the lack of interpretation of certain lines of verse - most things can't be taken at face value, and have multiple interpretations that need to be unearthed and mulled over.The margins are good for taking notes, and it's not that tan, grainy book paper that doesn't take lead well. There's also note pages. If there's one thing a reader should do, it's make notes. Annotate! I never thought I'd say that...teachers always beat you over the head with it, and I never found it necessary before, but it is with Will.All in all, I love this book. I actually went and bought most of Shakespeare's other plays in the Cliffs Complete version. It couldn't hurt to also buy the Folger's Library version too...the text is a bit different (some word and poetic compression changes) and additional accompanying definitions. Regardless, I've never understood a Shakespearean play so thoroughly, and I enjoyed Macbeth incredibly.I highly recommend this book!!!"},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Macbeth","review":"Cool! I wanted to be first!"},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"VOICES CARRY is the first Mariah Stewart book I have read. The cleverly suspenseful plot was entertaining and the characters believeable. I especially liked that Genna Snow was as smart, if not smarter, than her male counterparts. Often when the lead female character and the lead male character work for the FBI or some other exciting government position, the male character seems to always be smarter and more intuitive than the female character. The author did a great job of bringing out the professional strenghts of Genna and John and the understandable romantic tension between them. You won't go wrong purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"Let me say first, I love Mariah Stewart. I'll read absolutely anything she writes, and I devoted the better part of an entire afternoon to 'Voices Carry'. After enjoying 'Brown Eyed Girl' as much as I did, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one to see how Genna and John's story would continue. There was lots of action here and a few twists I never even suspected. Thats the great thing about Ms. Stewart - she keeps you guessing !I thought 'Voices' had just the right blend of suspense and mystery and, of course, romance. Ms. Stewart writes characters you just can't help rooting for. It might be good to read 'Brown Eyed Girl' first just to get a feel for the characters, but 'Voices' will stand proud all on its own. And while you're shopping, if you happen to see any other books by Mariah Stewart - grab 'em! You won't be dissappointed !"},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"After reading and absolutely LOVING &quot;Brown-eyed Girl,&quot; I waited for a year for the story of John Mancini and Genna Snow, FBI agents and ex-lovers, with great anticipation, but I was sorely disappointed by this book.Unlike BEG, &quot;Voices Carry&quot; falls victim to the classic romantic suspense blunder. It tried too hard to be both a romance, and a mystery, and so did neither very well. The romance worked well in the beginning, creating a convincing tension between Genna and John. He left her to get his life straightened out after a brush w/ a serial killer, but he failed to tell her where he was going, or why. Genna has her own issues with abandonment, and she was crushed by his leaving. At the beginning of the book, we find them struggling to be friends and co-workers again. There is no bitterness, just a wary feeling between John, who loves her deeply, and Genna, who is cautious about getting involved again.Then, in the middle of all of this, we follow the characters though a series of unrelated cases, none of which ends up having ANY bearing on the book later, losing any hope for a passable romantic tension. 3/4 of the way through the book, we finally pick up the main suspense plot, and the romantic angle resolves itself abotu fifty pages BEFORE the end! The entire conclusion was both anti-climatic and flat.I was so impressed by BEG, I will give Mariah Stewart another chance, (though I might not rush out to by the next one new) and I hope that she is still getting an angle on romantic suspense. If she writes another like BEG, she will indeed be the new star of the genre, but she'll have to do much better than this one."},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"With her previous title, BROWN-EYED GIRL, Mariah Stewart started to make a name for herself in Romantic Suspense. With VOICES CARRY she has proven she is a force to be reckoned with and can compete with the likes of Sandra Brown, Tami Hoag, or Linda Howard any day.This isn't a mystery --- the identity of the villain is known fairly early on, but it's the layer upon layer of suspense, building up to one of the most nail-bitingly suspenseful scenes I've ever read (ranks right up there with the pivotal scene in Tami Hoag's CRY WOLF), which makes this such a terrific read.I loved these characters (Genna and John) as much as any I have in any book. In this story though, although there is romance, the suspense takes a front seat. And like I said, what suspense it is!I won't go into a synopsis here, that is well documented in other comments, all I can say is this is an absolutely unputdownable, suspenseful read, and I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.The Book Wizard, Publicist"},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"What first was thought to be random kidnappings in different states changes when a twelfth woman turns up missing and the FBI is called in to assist. John Mancini is an agent with the reputation of getting inside a criminal's mind and is chosen to lead this assignment. After reviewing the individual case files, his instincts tell him this is a master plan being played out and that only one person is abducting the women. He selects a team of four agents, one of whom is Agent Genna Snow. He believes that it will be Genna who will break the case by finding a missing piece of the puzzle. She has an uncanny sixth sense and seems to be able to instinctively feel and think like one of the victims.Genna and John share a past, one that John desires to rekindle. When he walked out of her life without a word, he left her shattered and feeling abandoned. An invitation to attend a baby's christening with his boisterous Italian family will reveal unknown facts to Genna, facts which begin to change her mind and open her heart again. They will have a second chance to find love as they work together to solve the mystery of the case they're working on. It's a case that allows John to learn the horror of Genna's past and help him understand her better, and also one to cause him great anxiety when he learns Genna could be the next target.Genna and John were introduced in the winning novel BROWN-EYED GIRL and now it's their turn to have their story revealed. While BROWN-EYED GIRL was a thriller-chiller type of story, VOICES CARRY is what I consider a true romantic suspense, with both elements being equal.Mariah Stewart offers much more than suspense and romance in this fictional work. She writes about parental abuse and child rape, but also shares how a foster-mother with a beautiful spirit changes a young girl's life by offering unconditional love and affection. This is a multi-plotted tale about good versus evil, where secondary characters play a major role and round out the story. One of the main points is the love story, but the thread of the mystery and the suspense in finding the criminal weaves throughout. Fans will swiftly turn pages to see if they have guessed correctly, and will be surprised with twists and turns along the way. Mariah Stewart is an author on the rise, destined to hit the best-seller list at any time. VOICES CARRY is an example of her creativity, and a title I highly recommend. I believe it will find a place on your keeper shelves, right along with her previous titles.Carol Carter as written for Under The Covers"},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"Mariah never disappoints her readers.

Boy, did that fade quickly!Her writing isn't that good, and the FBI -- including the unbelievably mixed-up hero and heroine -- came off looking like a bunch of stupid amateurs. The last third of the book would've never happened, since the investigators would've homed in on the location of the abducted women right away. I got the sense that the contrived ending was just so the heroine could be placed in jeopardy One More Time.I've read a lot of great romantic suspense, BLIND FAITH by Christianne Heggan leaps to mind, and this falls far short of &quot;good.&quot; I may look for her previous title in a used book store, but I won't pay money for it."},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"Near Bricker's Lake, Pennsylvania, nine-year-old Genna Snow attends the Shepherd's Way camp run by Brother Michael. She gets in trouble for sneaking wild flowers to her ailing sister. Michael tries to punish her by sexually abusing the child, but Genna escapes. Schoolteacher Patsy Wheeler finds the battered girl and obtains help. All hell breaks loose and soon authorities learn that Michael abused more children.In spite of her parents' condemnation, with the loving help of Patsy, Genna recovers and becomes an expert on abuse for the FBI. While Genna returns to the Amish country on a drug laundering case, her former boyfriend, Agent John Mancini, works what appears to be a serial killer case. John loves Genna, but when the Woods investigation got inside his gut, instead of turning to his beloved, he fled to cleanse his soul. He feared destroying Genna, but now he wants her back permanently. She loves John, but believes he will just leave again. As his serial killer case seems to somehow tie back to Genna, he realizes he must keep her and Patsy safe not because of duty but because of love.Highly talented Mariah Stewart provides her audience with a taut romantic suspense thriller that will provide the awesome author with new readers. The serial killer angle fits quite well with the elements of romantic suspense, as ultimately Genna is a target with John willing to die to keep her out of harm's way. The fast-paced story line is filled with action from page one with only romantic interludes to give the audience an occasional breather. Ms. Stewart provides her fans with another winner.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"I'm a big Mariah Stewart fan so enjoy anything she writes, however,this was not one of my favorites.

The suspense was richly developed and believable. The story at times was alarmingly evil but then Ms Stewart is a master of evil suspense. The only draw back was a bit too much time was spent on back story for our couple, bogging the story down at times and it really wasn't needed ( hence no five star rating).It is hoped Ms Stewart will continue to develop stories rich with strong heroines and supportive heroes: be they contemporary love stories or her current trend toward evil suspense. Having been a fan of her earlier work, it is hoped she will continue to help set the standard in Romantic Suspense: few have her touch in developing heart stopping evil intent.

They were once deeply in love until John was emotionally destroyed by a case he was working on. He left Genna without a word until he could get his life back together. When he felt ready to resume their relationship, Genna opted not to take him back due to issues from her past that she had never really dealt with. Now they are assigned to work on a case together. Twelve women are missing. Twelve ordinary women who have families and jobs and no known enemies. There doesn't seem to be a pattern, the crimes don't happen in the same city, let alone state. Nothing makes sense.I was thrilled when I found out these characters were from Ms. Steward's previous novel, Brown Eyed Girl, a novel I really enjoyed. However, I didn't feel satisfied with this story. The book is label romantic suspense. There is more suspense than romance, which is fine. The killer's identity is revealed early on and that wasn't a problem since we see Genna and John struggle to make the connections. For some reason, this story just didn't jell for me. Maybe there was too much thrown into the plot, or maybe I just wanted more romance with Genna and John. While there are wonderful secondary characters, some of the subplots have a tendency to drag the story down. I will give Ms. Stewart credit by saying the ending has a neat twist to it."},{"Title":"Voices Carry","review":"I have read 'Brown-eyed Girl' and loved it, but I felt the story was over too quickly.

Some say that it tries to hard to be a romance, while I say that it IS a romance novel trying hard to be something else. This book tries to fool you into thinking that there is any suspense or thrill while Stewart places all of the emphasis on the story on this ridiculous romance between the future head of the FBI's special investigations unit who is eager to investigate fellow agent Genna Snow's body rather than the crimes in question. If you are uncertain as to the type of book that this is, you merely need to flip to page 323-324 in order to find out exactly what kind of mindless dribble that Stewart is trying to pass off to readers. In these pages, you will obviously find a steamy sexual encounter between these two characters that would have a difficult time garnering an 'R' rating if it were a movie. In fact, it is so ridiculously descriptive that I would say that it borders on being soft-core porn. Stewart is not a suspense writer, she is a romance novelist at heart and it is obvious that many readers are fooled into thinking otherwise.

One cannot, in any case, generalize from one man (Eichmann) to the conduct of ordinary people. As for the guilt of the Judenrat and the Jewish ghetto police, and the passivity of those Jews being literally railroaded to extermination, Robinson presents counter-examples to Arendt's generalizations.Robinson believes that the Madagascar plan had been a real plan. It was not merely a cover for the already-decided physical extermination of Europe's Jews (p. 51).Although he used neither term, Robinson was an early proponent of the Uniqueness of the Holocaust (pp. 99-100), which is commonly paraphrased by the slogan: \\"Not all victims of the Nazis were Jews, but all Jews were victims of the Nazis\\". Robinson upends his own premise. Even limiting oneself to the contents of this book makes it obvious that, not only were ALL Jews not targeted for extermination, but more known Jews were deliberately spared by the Nazis than is commonly realized. For instance, the 1,684 Hungarian Jews, freed through the Kastner-Eichmann deal (p. 177), is the tip of the iceberg: \\"This is by no means the total number of Jews rescued as a result of the efforts of the Kasztner [Kastner] committee. Rather, it is the number of Jews saved in one operation, the transfer to Switzerland via Bergen-Belsen...Other rescue operations carried out on the initiative of the Kasztner committee were: (1) The transfer of 15,000 Jews to Austria (to be \`frozen' there), of whom 13,500 survived...(2) The placement of 5,000 Jewish children in shelters of the International Red Cross...(3) The issuance by the Swedish and Swiss consulates of approximately 15,000 protective passports to Jews...Thus, at least 35,000 Jews owe their lives to the efforts of this committee.\\" (p. 333).Elaborating his Holocaust-Uniqueness position, Robinson (pp. 97-98) maintains that, unlike the cases of their Jews, Germany's satellites Romania and Hungary were never asked to take measures against their Gypsy populations. This is a bit disingenuous, as German actions against Jews were also far from uniformly exterminationist. When Hungary's Horthy balked at sending Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz, the Germans invaded Hungary to ensure the extermination of the Hungarian Jews. But the Germans never invaded either the German satellite states of Finland or Bulgaria for refusing to turn their Jews over for extermination.Although Poles rescued more Jews than any other nationality, and that under the constant threat of the automatic death penalty, frequent accusations of anti-Semitism are leveled against them for the \\"meager\\" percentage of Jews saved. In fact, the large-scale concealment of Jews, even under the best of circumstances and the most favorable of local Jewish-gentile relations, was impossible: \\"Did not the Danish Resistance consider hiding the Jews, only to reject this proposal as too perilous even among the traditionally philo-Semitic Danes, insisting instead on escape to Sweden? Has history ever recorded a case of millions going underground? In The Netherlands--a country with a three-century record of Jewish-Christian harmony--only 20,000 Jews out of 140,000 went into hiding; of these, one-half, or 10,000, we caught.\\" (pp. 203). Moreover: \\"As for the Netherlands, non-Jews who gave shelter to Jewish escapees were often not punished at all; in other cases, perhaps the majority, they were arrested and sent to the concentration camp Vught for a period of six months. There they were severely maltreated and a number of people died.\\" (p. 337). Would that Polish rescuers of Jews, when caught by the Germans, enjoy such nonexistent to limited punishment!Robinson demythologizes the Danes and the Bulgarians. We learn that the Danish King never donned a yellow badge (p. 244). The Danish rescuers overlooked entire groups of Danish Jews: \\"...some were caught while fleeing, but most were found by the German police because they were poor and had no means and no connections to arrange for their escape, or because they were inmates of the communal old-age home, whom no one helped.\\" (p. 204). There were 13,600 accused Danish collaborators, and these faced only mild postwar punishment (p. 149). Tales about the King of Bulgaria giving an order forbidding the shipment of Jews, and of Bulgarians blocking the movements of Jews to the death trains, have little or no basis in fact (pp. 255-256). (Of course, individuals and groups of Danes and Bulgarians acted, and they had incomparably more freedom to act than the German-ruled Poles).At least some \\"Polish collaboration\\" against Jews was coerced. Robinson quotes Pankiewicz on the evacuation of the Krakow Ghetto. The Germans forced the Polish Blue Police (Policja Granatowa) to form a cordon around the Jews, and the Germans did the same to: \\"...groups of the Polish boys forcibly recruited for the so-called Baudienst (Construction Service).\\" (p. 192).Robinson addresses German plans for the Poles. He first cites the German historian Broszat, who spoke of the colonial exploitation of Poles by Germans on a scale never before seen in history. (pp. 92-93). He then cites Erhard Wetzel and Dr. Gollert, who had rejected the prospect of using the same methods on Poles as had been used against Jews for a variety of practical reasons (particularly the fact that there were so many Poles, and certainly not because the Poles were deemed more worthy of life than the Jews). Otherwise, Robinson says: \\"In a speech made by Himmler on March 15, 1940, to the commandants of the camps in occupied Poland, he foresaw \`the disappearance of the Poles from the world' (Dann verschwinden alle Polen aus der Welt) and the \`extirpation (Ausrottung) of the Polentum,' and he expressly formulated the mission of the German people as \`the destruction of all Poles' (alle Polen zu vernichten). (p. 93). Robinson concludes that the planned Nazi extermination of the Poles is \\"arguable\\" (p. 94), though he rejects Arendt's premise that the forced wearing of a star or other identification is necessarily a prelude to extermination."},{"Title":"Kinship and marriage among the Nuer","review":"This book is part of the classic study of the british anthropologist Evans-Pritchard about the Nuer.

And faster to use, since you are already reading 10 books & adding tons more work can be a bit of overkill.The Teaching Guides do have more info on introducing/teaching the material, worksheets, and essay-type assignments, if the student does better with that."},{"Title":"A History of US: Assessment Book: Books 1-10","review":"Joy Hakim did a fabulous job with her 10 volume \\"A History of US\\" boxed set. We bought the set 3 years ago to use in our homeschool. I was thrilled to find this assessment book to compliment the set. The assessment book is written for secondary levels, however, I think the set and assessment book would be appropriate for grades 5 and up. There are multiple choice tests every 3-4 chapters. The answers are provided in the back of the book. This book contains tests for all 10 volumes in the complete \\"A History of US\\". This book makes one of my many jobs as a teacher a bit easier. The questions deal more with understaing the basic ideas of each chapter and less on memorization of dates. If you prefer your student memorize important dates, I would suggest having the student build a timeline as he/she reads through the set (volume 1 begins with pre-America history and each volume moves forward through time). We also plan to purchase the 16 part series PBS aired, which was written from this history set titled \\"FREEDOM: A HISTORY OF US\\"."},{"Title":"A History of US: Assessment Book: Books 1-10","review":"We use this series in our homeschool history program. I also have the teacher guides which are helpful but I appreciate the tests in this guide. They are multiple choice questions that test the comprehension of the students reading which helps in grading."},{"Title":"A History of US: Assessment Book: Books 1-10","review":"As a homeschooler this is nice to have to show what the student has learned. I would suggest it to anyone who is using The History of US as a course. There are 8 tests for each of the ten books in the series. It is broken down so that a single test covers a few chapters at a time and has 15 multiple choice questions. Although it is multiple choice the questions are geared toward understanding not memorization. The answer key is in the back. It even has a grade chart so you don't have to figure that out. There is also a few pages that cover Using Rubrics to Asses Writing for the writing assignments in the Teacher Guide."},{"Title":"A History of US: Assessment Book: Books 1-10","review":"We are using Hakim's History of US series in our homeschool and we discuss as we read, but I didn't have any other way to assess reading comprehension, except to write questions myself. I was glad to find this resource which has multiple-choice questions for all ten books in the series. There are 15 questions on each test, each test covering 4-5 chapters in each book, which means there are 6-8 tests for each of the 10 books in the series. So far I have found the questions to be comprehensive and reasonable; the answers do require some thought and are not typically 'easy'. I have found a few for which I think there may indeed be multiple 'correct' answers, so we discuss those more. Overall, this is a welcome, time-saving assessment book which I recommend for middle and high school levels."},{"Title":"A History of US: Assessment Book: Books 1-10","review":"The assessments do a great job covering the text and allow mehands free review/testing for my student."},{"Title":"A History of US: Assessment Book: Books 1-10","review":"History is made of people in circumstances making decisions based on their family histories, the times, their emotional state. This set of books is a brilliant examination of American history through the understanding of those elements.

I was given these books when I started home-schooling my daughter. Family events made it impossible for me to continue and I placed her back in public shcool.

As a novice on the Net, I found the descriptions and comparisions of the most prominent search engines and how they work very informative. Chandra Sekhar takes the reader through the levels of search engine positioning, how to choose the best one for your product(s), shows you how to wisely spend on your business place, how to get positive results with limited funds, and how to set up a professional-appearing site free of charge. Using a dummy product, the author takes the reader through the process of creating a site. He offers numerous illustrations to enhance the text. You will find a list of web sites that offer technical assistance, and Sekhar thoroughly covers E-mail privacy laws. I was impressed with his comprehension of how many Interent users feel about being &quot;spammed&quot;.

The author's knowledge of the search engines, the behind-the-scenes workings of the large &quot;markets&quot;, reminders of the pitfalls, and asssitance for readers with or without technical skills should appeal to everyone who has thought of marketing on the Internet.

This book has some basic overviews of what search engines desire but doesn't reference any websites that have been successful following this advice. Each topic receives a cursory overview with marginal examples. This book is a simple overview with no in depth information.For example, maybe 50% of websites out there are developed using MS FrontPage and not one word in this book describes how to use this development environment to promote FrontPage created websites. There is a strong bias that one should focus on Yahoo as the major website promotion forum but fails to mention that this is a 'pay as you play' listing directory that defeats the intended 'Do It Yourself' audience."},{"Title":"Internet Marketing And Search Engine Positioning - A \\"Do It Yourself\\" Guide","review":"Chandra provides a good very basic foundation to Search Engine positioning, a good understanding of how search engine positioning works.

Chandra has organized it in a very easy-to-understand fashion.As a webmaster myself, I found it difficult to even know where to start. With FrontPage, I had the tools. With this book, you will understand what FrontPage can't teach you. There is some information in chapter four that greatly increased my site visitors. In fact, they almost doubled in a short time. The word to look for is \\"central.\\" :) It is just easier to have someone else list your site, and that is finally what I did for a very small fee.This book is like a book of webmaster secrets.

There are also pages of Web site addresses to assist you further. I found that to be a very helpful tool.This book is well worth ordering if you are a new webmaster, especially if you are using a program like FrontPage.

It covers most any area that Mr. Buckley holds an Interest whether it be politics, social affairs, sailing, classical music and spending time with dignitaries and well to do people. It is fantastically written (as can be expected from Buckley) however it seemed to talk just over the head of the common man. With his infatuation with the Ryder Cup and talking about people who are important to him, really have no impact on my life. All in all it is a very well written fast paced collection. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys political and social commentary. And to anyone who just like to read something different than a novel or text of history.Thanks For Your Time:T"},{"Title":"Happy Days Were Here Again: Reflections of a Libertarian Journalist","review":"William F. Buckley is unquestionably one of the most articulate and knowledgeable American debaters of the second half of the twentieth century. Buckley seems to know a little bit--if not a lot--about everything, and he reflects and gives observations about various topics in this collection of essays from the mid-to-late 80s and early 90s.As an author, Buckley is unfailingly witty and acerbic, and this book is littered with quips and sapient remarks. Buckley is particularly good at analyzing other peoples' positions, and at poking holes in their poor logic. That is where this book succeeds.This book occasionally fails when Buckley attempts to elucidate his own position on an issue. For instance, in one essay Buckley suggests that Beethoven is &quot;a national monument&quot; and should be entitled to governmental protection, so that vacationers can listen to the great composer's symphonies when they are traveling in non-cosmopolitan areas. My suggestion to Buckley would be to rent a car with a tape deck or cd player. It is not necessary for the government to mandate all-Beethoven channels in all cities and towns in order for citizens to listen to Beethoven when they are on vacation.In another essay Buckley spells out the case for allowing women to serve in the military, but then says that he takes the opposite position. His explanation for why he is against women serving in the military is vague. He says that allowing women to join the armed forces is repugnant to &quot;human nature,&quot; which leads one to wonder how Buckley would respond to someone who believes that what he calls &quot;human nature&quot; is an artificial construct. Maybe he did not provide a response to that question because of spacial constraints, but I think that if he is going to base a policy position on human nature, he should provide readers with some sort of idea of what his theory of human nature is.I hope that I have not accentuated the negative too much in this review, because Buckley truly is a wonderful writer and an interesting read. He has opinions about everything, and he is fun to read not only for what he has to say, but also for how he says it. His vocabulary is expansive and his word-choices are colorful. This book should be read by anyone who wants intelligent and fiercely-opinionated commentary on newsworthy events, and the various parties involved, from 1985 to 1992."},{"Title":"Happy Days Were Here Again: Reflections of a Libertarian Journalist","review":"This is Buckley at his acerbic best on subjects as varied as John Lennon, Ted Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor to academia, Gorbachev and The First Gulf War.It's always illuminating and stimulating to explore the brain of one of America's foremost conservative thinkers and as these essays drift more into history, his insights and deliberations become astounding in their perspicacity and accuracy.These essays cover everything from the fall of communism, the Los Angeles riots, Playboy magazine and lots more. The time spent reading this delightful paperback is time spent in the company of charming brilliance."},{"Title":"Happy Days Were Here Again: Reflections of a Libertarian Journalist","review":"As I read this book, I laughed, I cheered, and, most amazingly, I remembered. WFB's resume gives him a wide range of ideas from which to draw, all of which do seem to find their way into his work, and serve to make the most mundane of topics worthwhile. As a conservative commentator, he is without peer, so you who would buy this book will gain insight. But what I found most valuable was that Mr. Buckley's writings don't just remind me of the past, they create memories of the moods, the voices; the hysteria when Reagan said &quot;evil empire&quot;, the absolute shock when the Wall fell, the absurdity of Senator Weicker, and so on. I was at West Point in the late Eighties, and so got most of my news, as Mr. Whiting will attest, from the New York Times, and this helps me remember that there are more than just my former service mates and left-wing journalists in the world. And finally, those of you who just can't stand WFB's mannerisms and delivery, it's not an audio book, and you can put whatever soundtrack you want to it, and have full control of the dosage."},{"Title":"Happy Days Were Here Again: Reflections of a Libertarian Journalist","review":"As a libertarian conservative it is always good to end the day with a reading from Buckley.It gives one faith that the Republican Party can again find it's way, accept those \\"who agree 80%\\", and cease to attempt to tell othershow they should lead their lives...."},{"Title":"Happy Days Were Here Again: Reflections of a Libertarian Journalist","review":"I have recently read several of Mr W.F.

Published here are only the nine &quot;Dublin Discourses&quot; from Part I on &quot;University Teaching&quot; and but four of the ten chapters of Part II, &quot;University Subjects Discussed in Occasional Lectures and Essays.&quot; For the hundred-page displacement of Newman's essays, the editor substitutes five interpretive essays supposedly inquiring into the relevance of Newman's book for today's higher education debates. These interpretive essays have major inconsistencies and repetitions among themselves and are of mixed quality, with inaccuracies and serious misunderstandings of some of Newman's central ideas. As accurate forays of the Newmanian mind into the twentieth- and twenty-first century university, only the engaging and intellectually challenging essays by George Marsden and George Landow succeed. (COMPLETE paperback editions of Newman's IDEA are available from Loyola University Press, 1987, and University of Notre Dame Press, 1982)."},{"Title":"The Idea of a University, Defined and Illustrated","review":"A review currently listed for this book pertains to \\"this Yale edition\\" and says it leaves out \\"about half\\" of what Newman published.

My anticipation was rewarded by an interesting seven-page introduction.However, the endnotes by Svaglic are of such great value in understanding the Newman's references to then-present and past events and authors and even in translating some of his Latin that I greatly prefer that edition.

Now, with all universities being forced to rethink their own identity and mission, the values which Newman enuntiated for them over 100 years ago will return to guide their reinvention in our own day. Or, they can return, if they are given the chance. Yale University is to be commended for putting Newman's ideas on the university back on the table in such a splendid format. Every aspect of this work deserves praise, from the editor's introduction and special footnotes, to the analytical essays which merit a careful reading in their own right.

Newman is also careful to point out that the liberal arts and even theology may attempt to establish a single, inadequate framework for the discovery of truth.Newman's complex epistemology does not fall prey to the heresy that truth is not one, but reminds us that in our present state, truth present various aspects and that the tyranny of any particular branch of knowledge is the victory of ignorance."},{"Title":"The Idea of a University, Defined and Illustrated","review":"The book is in excellent shape; tight binding, clean pages, and delivered promptly.

He wrote many influential books, such asApologia Pro Vita Sua (An Image classic),An essay in aid of a grammar of assent; (A Doubleday image book), etc.He wrote in the Preface to this 1853 book, \\"The view taken of a university in these discourses is the following: that it is a place of teaching universal knowledge... it is the diffusion and extension of knowledge rather than the advancement. If its object were scientific and philosophical discovery, I do not see why a university should have students; if religious training, I do not see how it can be the seat of literature and science. Such is a university in its essence, and independently of its relation to the Church.\\"He argues that in an institution in which \\"nothing is professed, nothing is taught about the Supreme Being... then the institution in question professes every science, and yet leaves out the foremost of them... it is very plain that a Divine Being and a university so circumstanced cannot co-exist.\\" (Pg. 65) He states his opinion that \\"the Church's true policy is not to aim at the exclusion of literature from secular schools, but at her own admission into them. Let her do for literature in one way what she does for science in another... She fears no knowledge, but she purifies all...\\" (Pg. 237)He notes that \\"the great Newton himself would have been silenced in a Catholic University, when he got upon the Apocalypse; yet is that any reason why we should not study hisThe Principia (Great Minds)... which French infidels have developed? We are glad... that anti-Catholic writers should, in their posthumous influence, do as much real service to the human race as ever they can, and we have no wish to interfere with it.\\" (Pg. 291)While almost 160 years old---and seriously \\"out of step\\" with current trends in education---Newman's educational ideas are still provocative, and worth reading."},{"Title":"Ginnie and Geneva","review":"Bring Ginnie back to print!

Thanks for the prompt service."},{"Title":"Bridge for Tournament Players","review":"There are a number of good books about duplicate bridge. But I'm glad that this one, one of the first really good such books, is still available.As the authors point out, in duplicate bridge, one routinely risks one's contract to get an overtrick, because the margin by which one beats the other pairs in one's direction does not matter as long as one beats them. Your +630 at 3 NT making 4 may be fine, beating the +620 scores for 4 of a major, while +600 (which you get by making a safety play) may well get you a zero. On the other hand, in competitive auctions, while +200 beats all part scores, you only need to double if you feel that most pairs your way will indeed get a plus score.Those who play Acol will enjoy the recommendations made to modify it for duplicate bridge. Of course, you may already play many of them. These include a variety of competitive doubles. There are some \\"old\\" conventions, such as Swiss, Lightner doubles, and Unusual notrumps. These conventions were around for some time when the book was written (1968), but the way the authors use them is a little different from what you might expect. And some \\"new\\" (1968) conventions are suggested, such as Aspro over opponent's 1 NT opening in second or fourth position (bid 2D with spades and a minor, bid 2C with hearts and any other suit).The book includes a discussion of relay bidding systems and gives an example of a \\"futuristic\\" system, namely the \\"Little Major.\\" I think you may not want to take up this particular system, even if your tournament director allows it, but it makes for interesting reading. And the book then has a discussion of leads and signals.Oh yes, there is a final chapter about the personal factor. Reese and Dormer give a great example. What blind lead do you make against 3 NT from:Spades K J 6 3 Hearts Q 7 5 Diamonds J 6 4 2 Clubs 10 9Anything could be right, so just lead something quickly and smoothly. A player who hesitates over this lead \\"is not cogitating\\" but dithering. \\"Meanwhile, an astute declarer will be thinking\\" that you do not have a five-card suit, that your four-card suits are unattractive, and that the suit you finally lead may well be short.And a final piece of good advice has to do with your opponents. When they make a mistake, tend to be silent about it. Good manners are the same as good tactics here.It's a good book that is well worth reading for tournament players"},{"Title":"Last Days in Babylon: The History of a Family, the Story of a Nation","review":"I was looking for a book which told of Operation Ali Baba, the informal name for the flight of Iraqi Jews to Israel (and elsewhere) in the early 1950s.

Gissing has never been a popular novelist; but his books have lasted. He has a small but loyal group of readers and his books are becoming accessible and in-print once again. Some critics, such as John Halperin in his biography \\"George Gissing: A Life in Books\\" rate \\"Sleeping Fires\\" highly indeed within Gissing's output.\\"Sleeping Fires\\" is set in Greece and in London. The two major characters are Edward Langley, age 42 and Lady Agnes Revill, age 37. As the book opens, Langley is touring in Greece. Langley is well-to-do, has never had to work, and feels a sense of emptiness in his life. Sixteen years earlier Langley had courted a young woman named Agnes Forrest, but his marriage proposal was rejected when Langley confessed to Forrest's father that he had fathered a son out of wedlock three years earlier. The mother had taken the boy away and married another man. Langley did not know of the child's whereabouts. Langley had remained unmarried living an essentially leisurely life. Agnes Forrest had married a member of Parliament to become Lady Agnes Revill, where she had moved in powerful British society, become socially prominent, and conservative in her outlook. Revill died, leaving her a widow courted by another influential member of Parliament, Lord Henry Strands.While in Greece, Langley meets a companion from his college days named Worboys who has become a classical scholar-- and an unmitigated pendant. Worboys is accompanied by an 18 year old boy, Louis Reed, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Langley. It develops that Reed is the ward of Lady Revill who has sent the lad on tour because the youth is coming under what she fears is the unfortunate influence of a woman named Mrs. Treslian, who has liberal views about social equality and about helping the condition of the poor. When Reed gets a letter from Treslian saying that her relationship with him must end due to her guardian's objection, Langley agrees with Reed to sail back to England and discuss the matter with Lady Revill. Langley is still unhappy over the rejection years earlier by Lady Revill and her family.When the two meet after so many years, it is with an awkward formality, as Lady Revill informs Langley that Louis Reed is his son. Louis soon thereafter dies in Greece, and the two former would-be lovers engage in a sharp dialogue of recrimination. Lady Revill blames Langley for fathering the child and not offering to marry the mother. Langley, in turn, blames Lady Revill for not telling him about his son and for making a loveless marriage following her rejection of him.With Louis dead, the story shifts to the possible renewal of the relationship between Langley and Revill. Much of the tale is played out in dialogue between the two, which is frank and cutting for a Victorian novel. Langley and Revill excoriate themselves and each other for what they see as the meaningless of their lives. Revill exchanges letters with Mrs. Treslian, who works with the poor in a London slum, and comes to appreciate the value of Treslian's efforts and of Louis's idealism in trying to follow her. Langley renews his proposal of many years earlier and is again sharply rejected. Revill does not want to surrender her independence and her will. But with time, she softens and reluctantly admits that she still loves Langley. She asks for time to reflect as Langley returns to Greece to attend to burial arrangements for his son.Here is a key passage from the end of the story in which Langley pursues his marriage proposal.\\"How strange it is, Agnes. We seem so far apart. The long years of utter separation -- the meeting at length in cold formality -- the bitterness, the reproaches -- so much that seems to stand between us; and yet we are everything to each other. If you were the kind of woman who has no will of her own, could I love you as I do? And if I were less conscious of my purpose would you listen to me? There is no question of one yielding to the other, save in the moment which overcomes your pride and leaves you free to utter the truth. Those are the old phrases of love-making -- they rise to a man's tongue when his blood is hot. We shall never see the world with the same eyes; man and woman never did so, never will; but there is no life for us apart from each other. Our very faults make us born companions. Your need of me is as great as mine of you. We have forgiven all there is to forgive; we know what may be asked and what may not. No castles in the air; no idealisms of boy and girl; but two lives that have a want and see but the one hope of satisfying it.\\"Unlike much of Gissing, \\"Sleeping Fires\\" ends with a sense of hope as Langley and Revill move towards each other in hope for the \\"day that is still granted to us.\\" With all its Victorian trappings, this story speaks clearly of love as the source of meaning in human life. The manner in which the two primary characters verbally expose each other's shortcomings is highly modern. The book can be read easily in a single sitting. While probably not the best of Gissing, the book will reward reading.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Success Stories","review":"Success Stories by Michael B. Davie is one of the most unusual and inspiring books you're ever likely to come across.Unusual because the book combines most aspects of a business book with a coffee table book that's heavy on both pictures and text.Inspiring because much of the content concerns the life stories of highly successful people who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps to become rich and influential.Of particular interest is the story of Michael G. DeGroote who immigrated to Canada as a child, barely spoke any English, dropped out of school at age 14 and landed his first job - hauling manure to Southern Ontario tobacco farms. From these humble beginnings, DeGroote went on to acquire and build Laidlaw into a multi-billion-dollar giant, then sold his shares to move to Bermuda and begin a new empire in the sun. All in all, a very inspiring, thought-provoking book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Success Stories","review":"I absolutely love Success Stories by Michael B.

DeGroote's life story is told in compelling detail by Davie - and it's just one of the gems to be found in this excellent, thought-provoking, inspiring book."},{"Title":"Soldier's Return","review":"Bragg does a fantastic job bringing this little town from the English North West to life. Bragg's treatment of his characters is very sympathetic and well rounded. His slow meandering way of describing people and event serves to let us know the people very well. Bragg does that not just for Sam and Ellen, but for all the characters we come across in this wonderful work, no cardboard here, they are all very real.Sam, an ordinary working class man returns home after 7 years fighting on the Japanese front in Burma. Sam returns clearly suffering what we call now post combat trauma, living through it and fighting it. Many from his town were with him in Burma, many never came back, a close friend is suffering a sever case of trauma.Ellen and Joe lived with Ellen's aunt and uncle during the war. Bragg deals very well with the struggle the family goes through coming together after such a long absence, this at the time of Sam's internal suffering from his memories of the war.For Sam, a major element of his suffering and to a certain extent his resentment is his feeling that his years of war and service have done little to advance his status in England. Eventually Sam decides with a friend to move to Australia to start a new life; the old life was just too painful to endure after all that he had been through. But Ellen, who lost her parents as a child and grew up with her aunt and uncle, is a fixture of this little town. The town means a great deal to her; it is her anchor. Ellen chooses to stay and Sam decides to go.Bragg's sequel, Son of War is even better. Both books are wonderful, very human, very real.

It offers a snapshot into 1940s life- rationing, slum housing, social life etc. The 'trauma', such as it is, is gentle- perhaps because the characters are not very convincingly developed- and has a nice romantic ending.Somehow I expected something a bit more from this author- a lifetime peer and president of the National Campaign for the Arts!"},{"Title":"Soldier's Return","review":"Melvyn Bragg's The Soldier's Return is the memorable and poignant story of Sam Richardson, a young man from rural England who has fought in the Burma campaign in World War II and who then returns home to a world totally different from the world he has left--everyone and everything has changed.Sam has seen such atrocity that he is now harder and less willing to show a soft side. His son Joe, now five, doesn't know him. His wife has been successful working two modest jobs and does not want to give them up. Sam has been exposed to the outside world, a world which has shown him how limited his future is in the socially inflexible world of Wigton, while his wife Ellen, in contrast, has been supported by the friendships, traditions, and familiarity of this community, where she knows everyone.The tensions within the family and within individual characters grow and boil over, as stiff-upper-lip-ishness comes into conflict with the human need to communicate and share, creating real drama and intensity. Bragg's written dialogue is completely natural, and his descriptions and his narrative style are simple, as is his choice of vocabulary. The reader will have no trouble following the various threads of the story while learning much about Cumbria, post-World War II social upheavals, and the kinds of personal problems that may have been typical for many other young soldiers. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Soldier's Return","review":"Melvyn Bragg's highly acclaimed novel &quot;The Soldier's Return&quot; is a poignant story of a young post-war English family crumbling under the pressure of war induced trauma suffered by the returning spouse and father. Sam's displacement from his domestic environment is mirrored in his wife's and son's futile attempt to rediscover his old familiarity which seemingly evaporated during his long absence. His inability to articulate his feelings about the war locks him into his own world where nobody can reach him. The fragile nexus holding together conjugal relationships is also revealed in the aftermath. The novel opens optimistically with the reunion scene but from there it's downhill all the way. Soon, the nerves start to fray and bouts of anger fill the void. The horrors of war may have reduced Jackie to a mental invalid but Sam is forced to admit that he misses the sense of purpose fighting for kin and country in the jungles of Burma. Coping with the vestiges of the old life is just too much for him. Ellen and Joe are the victims of this cruel irony when Sam decides to build a new future for himself and his family away from home. Bragg captures the tension of disintegrating relationships with a rare economy and insight. He pays great attention to period details with elaborate descriptions of provincial life. The novel is filled with many such passages which will no doubt endear themselves to British readers for the air of familiar nostalgia they create. For the rest of us, they can seem rather interminable. &quot;The Soldier's Return&quot; doesn't break any new grounds. It treads a well trodden path but does it with authenticity and honesty and for that, it is has to be applauded. It is an accomplished piece of work that deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Platinum Vignettes: Ultra-High-Yield Clinical Case Sceneros for Step 2 -Surgical Subspecialties, 1e","review":"It's hard to find good subspecialty info when trying to review for step 2, even though all my colleagues warned me this stuff was on the test.

It is an important addition to the knowledge of a reader who enjoys exploring basketball history or wants to better comprehend the battle waged in women's team sports to have viable leagues at the professional level.Porter covers every facet of the game - from the front office and hardcourt, to the media and fans - and thoroughly describes the financial stumbling off the court that doomed the product on the court.Ultimately it was the shabby treatment of players that destroyed the league. In the final season, several teams and individuals staged walkouts in protest of not being paid. A showdown between owners who wanted the league to be operated professionally and those who had more shallow verbiage than cash caused a rift that sunk the WBL in a sea of broken promises.But how close the WBL came to making it.At least one NBA owner was interested in investing in an existing team, but watched to see if the league would stabilize financially.

While the snapshots are interesting and amusing, media coverage remains a hot issue among fans and I think many would have been greatly interested in it - particularly as it also gives us the history of the first women's college basketball poll."},{"Title":"Mad Seasons: The Story of the First Women's Professional Basketball League, 1978-1981","review":"Devotions and dedication can be such admirable qualities, particularly in an author.Karra Porter certainly has those qualities. She's worked very hard on this history of the Women's Professional Basketball League. The research is evident throughout the book \\"Mad Seasons,\\" and a peak at a Web site indicates she had been trying to sell the book to a publisher for some time. She found one in the University of Nebraska Press.Books like this really need to be published. Otherwise, parts of sports history would be more or less forgotten. What's more, Porter has done a good job assembling the story, albeit with some flaws.The WBL, as it became known, played from 1978 to 1981. Women's basketball was just starting to catch on in the college ranks, and players had received some publicity. It seemed a natural to give those players a next step, although everyone involved knew there would be obstacles ... mostly in the form of money.New leagues always have money problems. This league's woes were compounded by the fact that there were no professional women's team sports. The WBL was moving into uncharted territory. But the owners, coaches and players pressed on.Porter takes an unexpected approach to the book. Each chapter represents one particular issue surrounding the three-year life of the league. There are stories about starting up, promotion, travel problems, racial matters, stars, etc. Three of the chapters at the end are particularly interesting. There's a tale about the murder of one of the players, the story of an entire team walking off the court in a financial dispute, and a divorce case involving one of the WBL's players that turned into ground-breaking law.Still, it's the funny/sad moments, moments that were sad then but funny now, that are good to read now. For example, New England one time was supposed to play New Orleans in a preseason game, but New Orleans didn't show up. So the Gulls called some members of the New Jersey Gems, who drove up, put on New Orleans uniforms and played the game. It's not like any of the fans knew the difference.The book has a few problems worth noting. There are some good-sized factual errors here that do jump out. It's Julius Erving, not Irving. And it's the Golden State Warriors, not the Oakland Warriors. (A newspaper's mistake got copied.) Ouch, twice. Meanwhile, Porter crams a lot of information into the chapters here, to the point where fewer quotes and more perspective would have been useful.More importantly, there is absolutely no sense of what the leagues were like from a competitive standpoint. Who were the good teams? Who were bad? Who won championships? How did the caliber of play compare with top college ball at that point? A chapter covering the basics about those issues is badly needed here. Failing that, an appendix with season records, statistical leaders and playoff results is absolutely needed and not to be found. In fairness, a Web site is helping to fill some of those gaps now.Those issues somewhat spoil the finished product, which is likely to be the first and last word on the history of the first women's basketball's league. Still, it's nice that the league is remembered. It paved the way for the WNBA on some levels, and it introduced a smaller basketball for the women's game that eventually became a worldwide standard. Porter deserves plenty of credit for making sure that this labor of love saw the light of day."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I'm usually not the type to make the time to write a review but with this book I felt compelled to.There are so few books written on this topic.

Due to some recent issues that have come up, I was looking for some insight. This book was the ticket! Well written, interesting, solid business wisdom, and relevant case studies. You can't spend a better 12 bucks if you are in a partnership."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"Reading this book is one of the best ways that I can imagine to start or fine tune a partnership. Its concise and well written yet comprehensively covers the issues partners need to address before they become problems. The examples and anecdotes are incisive and reflect practical experience in fixing the disasters Dr. Gage would like us to avoid. Follow the directions in this book and avoid the bad accidents."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"This cornerstone book is a must for anyone wishing to form a partnership, anyone who is already in a partnership, and anyone who is in the field of partnership development.I found the book to be very well structured, clear on the issues and very rich in examples. No doubt, David Gage is a pioneer in the field of partnership development and his rich experience working with partners & partnerships is felt all along the book. The book is written in such a way that it can be used as a reference-work book or a reading book that will enrich you on partners and partnerships and all the interesting stuff that is going on between people in partnerships.I deeply recommend this book, which I found to be one of a kind."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I have skimmed this book and it looks great.

Even though the book touched on these points, a major part of the book is devoted to discussing (at length) subjective issues like values, understanding etc between partners. Even though these are important, I guess I was looking at something for a book with a different focus. The book is decently written, has examples, and ends with a sample charter which I think is the biggest takeaway."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"This is an excellent book if you're thinking about forming a partnership (as I was.) It's all about communication, with yourself and with your prospective partner as you define your business and discuss your plan. Easy to read, logical, great tips. I used some of the topics in the book as part of an outline for discussion between my partner and I during a formal retreat we took before we opened our business. You don't have to read the whole book, just skim, but the basic premise of the book - communication - is solid advice."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"Despite the need for partnerships in business, little is actually taught in how to go about it in a careful and thoughtful manner. David Gage addresses this as he offers a short course and a concrete tool in how to be a business partner. Gage uses his skills and talents as a mediator in an easy to read manner. Many examples illuminate how the model works in real life. Those most likely to benefit are people in business. I think too that mental health professionals who wish to work in business and organizational settings will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"This book is a must read if you are considering forming or have formed a partnership.

Most of our agreement was oral with a handshake. We survived to success but were faced with the fact that neither my partner or I understood what our relationship actually was. This book was a small education for me. Within three weeks I now have a written, fair, and well constructed agreement with my partner in our thriving food service. This book should be mandatory reading for anyone considering a business partnership. I'm extremely fortunate that we were able to use this guide to fix the one I was in. I especially like that David Gage uses real examples from his years as a partnership counselor to explain his principles."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"It amazes me how much valuable professional quality intellectual property is shared.

I am very glad I got this book!"},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I think it's a most read for every entrepreneur and partnerships.I really enjoyed all the examples and also that it structures a very difficult topic because business it's about marketing, production, finances and expectations, search for equity or human relationships. It helped a lot in my family business to get things out and think ahead for problems, it's much better when you have clarified things than just assume that is what is going to happen.The only tricky thing is to get all of the test's he suggests and to actually create you charter might require their help or support from the workbook on their page and some improvisation and neutrality which becomes a lot harder if you are involved already in some conflicts with your partners.What I think are main topics:* Expectations* Interpersonal equity* Psychological profiles* Understanding others and how perceptions change with time* Memory issues and why is good to write things down* Taking in consideration future changes* And some points from a business plan or strategic planning."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"There is a lot of good info in the book but the author goes overboard with examples and stories. I got it. You're a published author. The fact that I paid for the book means I designate you an authority in the subject matter. Quit trying to win me over with the stories.Everything else was really cool. Good outline. Good brief examples from time to time, in between the long forms.If you get into it, its about a 6-hour read and you'll feel compelled to make a move in your current partnership or think heavily on the correct steps to take before you enter one. I wouldn't say this is a must read, but its close for anyone starting a business and thinking about taking on a partner."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I wish I had been privy to this book when I set up a family business partnership 6 years ago. If we had considered the multitude of ways that a family partnership could go wrong and put our partnership charter in place from the outset, we likely would have avoided the 3+ years and counting of misunderstandings, pain and destruction of what was a wonderful family. We're truly the living cautionary tale of what bright-eyed, bushy-tailed and hopeful will get you in the long run - exactly what David Gage talks about in his book. He guides you through the kinds of questions you should be asking yourself prior to getting into a partnership as well as the questions you should be asking if you find yourself already in one. He gets to the heart of issues such as each partners' vision for the company, it's strategic direction, the complicated issues surrounding who should get how much of the profits from the company and when you should start taking those profits out of the company. He also addresses the things that nobody every seems to talk about but will greatly impact the success of the partnership - the values each partner holds and whether they're compatible, what each partner perceives as fairness in the operation, and how to mesh individual operational styles. Finally, he gives instruction to help plan for the unexpected and how to resolve interpersonal conflicts that arise. He provides a very proactive stance in the formation of a company - an ounce of prevention is worth tens of thousands of dollars of cure, excrutiating heartache and endless therapy visits! There are certain books that should be a staple in any business owners' library - this is definately one of them!!"},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I came across this book in the small business section of the library, and once I had read it, decided I needed to purchase a copy for my permanent collection. I have been through the partnership anguish described in the book, and I wish I'd found the book earlier because I think my partner and I may have had a chance at working things out had we followed Gage's advice. Moreover, I am writing a book on women and small business, including a section about how natural and helpful it is to take on a business partner. I plan to refer to and recommend Gage's book in my own. The Partnership Charter is insightful, useful, and well-written. In a very professional way, Gage tackles one of the most vexing challenges of small businesses: they are personality-driven. I won't pretend that implementation of his advice is easy, but at least you'll have a roadmap that helps you and your partner to reduce the risks, get to know each other better, and give it your collective best shot."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"This is a top-notch book - nicely written, smartly organized, and easy to follow and understand. It provides insightful information, telling case histories, useful checklists and exercises, and even includes a fully developed \\"Partnership Charter\\" in the appendix. Author David Gage offers an inside view of partnerships, and his case studies make the text a pleasure to read. More importantly, he shows you how to create a partnership charter that will function as your enterprise's Magna Carta in the years to come. If you are planning a partnership, we advise you to study this expert presentation first. You will save yourself a lot of trouble."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I read The Partnership Charter as I was about to enter into a partnership to start a business requiring large amounts of startup capital which I had almost finished raising. Upon reading this great book, I realized that my partner was not the one to do this venture with and I pulled out at the last minute. I thank David and this book for saving me from a great deal of anguish and aggravation. Had I entered into this partnerhip, I would have ended up doing the lion's share of the work and would have had to break up the partnership."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"As a business advisor I'm constantly looking for tools to help my clients, and this is the best one I've found for partnerships. Gage's book explains how to defuse potentially explosive issues by detecting them in advance using a positive and creative process. While the underlying concepts make perfect sense --- addressing compatibility, on multiple levels, before there's a crisis --- what really impressed me was the practical, systematic approach to identifying and working on these issues. The author's depth of experience and expertise is made easily accessible by his clear, jargon-free style of writing. Not a panacea --- these are realistic suggestions that require commitment and work --- but worth the effort if you want to improve the chances for a successful partnership."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I really enjoyed this book and wish that it had been required reading in business school. Unlike many \\"business\\" books, this one is covers not only the theory behind what makes a good partnership but also the practice of building and maintaining a good partnership. Anyone who is part of some sort of organization, for-profit or non-profit, will find practical advice here. A must read for any entrepreneur, family business or new venture."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"After reading this well written, easily read, book, I ordered seven more copies for friends and associates. Any one in a partnership or contemplating a partnership should read this."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I've been regularly informed that its not a matter of if, but rather when your partnership will fail. David Gage starts out warning the reader about business partnerships and makes you take stock and check your head if really do need a partner or not. Ultimately, this book develops a framework for setting expectations and creating lines of communication up front for a sucessful long term partnership. The real-world examples, years of experience and clear, concise straight-up language makes this a great read. The unspoken expectations of a business partnership are no more! Buy this book and read it throughly."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I am a management consultant that helps companies with growth, and work with 3 partners in my firm. We developed a partnership agreement, but, as the company has developed, it has lacked depth in thinking through how we continue to work together as circumstances have changed. Gage's book provides a structure and process by which this would not happen -- i.e., partners have a better discussion at the start of the partnership (or whenever it is needed/wanted -- we'll be having one soon) that enables them to better plan for what might happen and create a framework for bringing these issues up when they need to be discussed. This is a terrific book because it provides background and context, as well as practical, actionable advice. And it is useful for people considering, in, or dissolving a partnership."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"The Partnership Charter contains all of the elements needed to start a partnership out right, or to mend one that has been sidetracked. Most of the Partnership Charter framework is also transferable to other relationships, e.g., teams in a business setting. The systematic approach to discussing issues such as values and expectations accelerates the ability to work together effectively, and to create better long-term relationships. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is working to establish better working relationships in a small group setting, be it in a partnership, or in a team environment."},{"Title":"The Partnership Charter: How To Start Out Right With Your New Business Partnership (or Fix The One You're In)","review":"I was surprised at how easy this book was to read. The subject matter could have become dry, but David Gage provides so many interesting examples that I was curious to continue reading. Half way through the book, I was also struck by how this is more than just about how to form a business partnership. There is some good advice here on all kinds of partnerships, including marriage and any other endeavor that requires you to work with different personalities. I'd recommend to anyone that was thinking about starting a business with another person, something that often involves a heavy time and/or financial commitement, to take the time to read this short book. I found the example Charter in the back especially useful."},{"Title":"Typography Now 2: Implosion","review":"&quot;Required reading&quot; for designers, typographers, and students involved in Graphic Design today.

Anne Cameron aims her retellings of Northwest Native tales at a young audience but all of us can enjoy all of them.In this tale, Spider Woman saves the earth from the birds of torment - Spider Woman uses a spider web and a tall tree to hold the earth in place - and to put most birds of torment into their proper place on the other side of the sky blanket.An aside - one bird of tormet not expelled is tooth-ache, the subject of the oldest known written tale (from Mesopatamea)."},{"Title":"The betrothed (Waverley novels)","review":"In this entertaining volume, Scott characterizes the unrest between England and Wales in the year 1187, during the time of the Crusades. The Western Marches had not yet been subdued by English authority, and clouds of banditti continue to make inroads into English territory. Our characters are besieged in a castle that only at the moment of crisis is it put into a posture of defense to withstand the siege. A phlegmatic Fleming and his daughter form the sensible counters to the hot-blooded English family who owns the castle. Intrigues and sorcery (the product of the times), conflicts between religion, the foreign wars, infighting within the family (when a son would murder his father for his possessions) all have equal place here. A fascinating glimpse of the times, and a highly readable story make this yet another jewel in Scott's wonderful body of historical fiction."},{"Title":"The betrothed (Waverley novels)","review":"I enjoyed this book. The plot is set in medieval England and focuses on a young woman named Eveline who feels herself compelled to marry her deliverer from the Welsh. Her deliverer is forced to embark on a Crusade to the Holy Land before their marriage can take place. The two will be betrothed for at least 3 years, if the man returns alive. In the meantime, he has a very chivalrous and attractive nephew who will stand as Eveline's guardian. I was surprised by the ending which is unlike other Sir Walter Scott books. A good read!"},{"Title":"Pilot Handbook","review":"This book was a rare find! Written in an easy to search and cross reference numbered outline format it provides a great source for an experienced or new pilot trying to stay current. The text is easy to read, spaced to allow for adding your own notes and the graphics are exceptionally clear! The coverage of FAR regulations is in summary format, not the complete text. This is sufficient for a BFR review but not the source to go to when the FAA comes knocking. Gleim takes care to keep the book current with frequent printings and an internet site with the latest errata info. The book covers all the topics on the private pilot exam however it does not include a practice exam. Some worked examples are scattered throughout the book expecially in the weather and navigation sections. It is a resource not a training guide. There is a section on the BFR that will be helpful to all pilots. Contains a complete index.

North to the Orient is my first reading of anything written by Anne Morrow Lindbergh and so far, I am very pleased. She writes in a very easy going style. You can almost imagine her gentle facial expression, as one reads her written words. Her descriptions of experiences are just enough to let one feel like you were there. When I'm finished with this book, I will read another by Anne. I have read \\"We\\", written by Charles Lindbergh and that was most enjoyable. I will read again, \\"The Spirit of St Louis\\", as soon as my husband finishes reading it. I believe it is a much better read, than \\"We\\". \\"We\\" does not go into enough detail, whereas \\"The Spirit of St Louis\\", is excellent, if you are one that likes all the details, as I am."},{"Title":"North to the Orient (Harbrace Paperback Library, HPL 5)","review":"Three years after her marriage to Charles Lindbergh, Anne Morrow Lindbergh left her infant son with her mother and a nanny in North Haven, Maine, strapped herself into the open cockpit of a Sirius floatplane, and flew with her husband to the Orient, following the Northwest Passage through arctic Canada and Alaska that her husband was surveying for the airlines. Her literate, supremely controlled prose is remarkable quite beyond the adventure itself. A year after her return, Anne Morrow faced the horror of her child's kidnapping and its aftermath and quite understandably fell into a prolonged depression. She wrote &quot;North to the Orient&quot; partly to rescue herself from the isolation and despair of those circumstances. The memoir went on to win the National Book Award and launch a celebrated career. You will not believe how gracefully she writes, what suspense she contains in her tight chapters. Finishing it, Anne Morrow Lindbergh not only contributed a literary adventure tale on a par with Wilfred Thesiger's &quot;Arabian Sands.&quot; The writing of the book itself was a courageous act. This is one of the great neglected works of American nonfiction."},{"Title":"North to the Orient (Harbrace Paperback Library, HPL 5)","review":"Anne Morrow Lindbergh's own description of her life, and that of her husband Charles Augustus, is as great a love story as has ever been told... ...and &quot;North to the Orient&quot; but a mere chapter!They seemed destined to be at each other's side, living tales such as this.Anne describes best her attempt to chronicle this aerial and literary journey for her reader:&quot;I have not written a technical account of a survey flight on the great circle route from New York to Tokyo. I do not know enough to write one, and if I did, the time for doing so would be past. Aviation moves a long way in four years. No geographical knowledge can be gained from reading my story. We constructed no maps or charts, and I have not even kept a scientific record of all the territory passed. It is not in any sense a guidebook. Our stops were so short and hurried that only a superficial picture remains. Nor is each point on our route portrayed, but only those which seem to warrant description for the vividness of impression.&quot;She adds pointedly that, &quot;It was not that we arrived in Baker Lake on August third by plane, but that three hours of flying had brought us from the modern port of Churchill to a place where no white woman had ever been before...&quot;, concluding that:&quot;One has only to see the chasm between accessibility and isolation--narrow, so one could reach across, but deep as time--to appreciate what can bridge it.&quot;In &quot;North to the Orient&quot;, we gain the opportunity to see air travel pioneered &quot;first person&quot;--through the eyes of a woman--yes:...riding along......but not as baggage or ballast, but rather, as a working participant in an important expedition....one who crews not only a primitive, tandem-cockpit aircraft of wood and fabric, but also operates its radio of tubes and coils where transmissions are made via a Morse Code key....and one who also flies this wooden wonder into the unknown, as her companion silently rests--trusting, and not fearing--while she takes him to places he too, has never known.I think that is where the beauty lies--not in the journey or the adventure itself--but how she somehow manages to remain side-by-side with her companion in life; how he responds and thrives just by being in her eyes; and how she is needed.How no one dares question this soulfully-dependant relationship between the two!Rather, all the world endeavors in its attempt to understand these two lovers and adventurers......and in understanding her, in particular.One marvels at her words from the confines of the cockpit, as they embark from North Haven on the first leg of their dangerous journey, leaving friends, family, and even their baby behind, on this remarkable, selfless quest:&quot;The day was hard and clear and bright, like the light slanting off a white farmhouse. The island falling away under us as we rose in the air lay still and perfect, cut out in starched clarity against a dark sea. I had the keenest satisfaction in embracing it all with my eye. It was mine as though I held it, an apple in my hand.

I do not know enough to write one, and if I did, the time for doing so would be past. Aviation moves a long way in four years. No geographical knowledge can be gained from reading my story. We constructed no maps or charts, and I have not even kept a scientific record of all the territory passed. It is not in any sense a guidebook. Our stops were so short and hurried that only a superficial picture remains. Nor is each point on our route portrayed, but only those which seem to warrant description for the vividness of impression.&quot;She adds pointedly that, &quot;It was not that we arrived in Baker Lake on August third by plane, but that three hours of flying had brought us from the modern port of Churchill to a place where no white woman had ever been before...&quot;, concluding that:&quot;One has only to see the chasm between accessibility and isolation--narrow, so one could reach across, but deep as time--to appreciate what can bridge it.&quot;In &quot;North to the Orient&quot;, we gain the opportunity to see air travel pioneered &quot;first person&quot;--through the eyes of a woman--yes:...riding along......but not as baggage or ballast, but rather, as a working participant in an important expedition....one who crews not only a primitive, tandem-cockpit aircraft of wood and fabric, but also operates its radio of tubes and coils where transmissions are made via a Morse Code key....and one who also flies this wooden wonder into the unknown, as her companion silently rests--trusting, and not fearing--while she takes him to places he too, has never known.I think that is where the beauty lies--not in the journey or the adventure itself--but how she somehow manages to remain side-by-side with her companion in life; how he responds and thrives just by being in her eyes; and how she is needed.How no one dares question this soulfully-dependant relationship between the two!Rather, all the world endeavors in its attempt to understand these two lovers and adventurers......and in understanding her, in particular.One marvels at her words from the confines of the cockpit, as they embark from North Haven on the first leg of their dangerous journey, leaving friends, family, and even their baby behind, on this remarkable, selfless quest:&quot;The day was hard and clear and bright, like the light slanting off a white farmhouse.

Has a German-English dictionary in the back, and footnotes for new idioms."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"Having read Roberts book, \\"Mountain of my Fear\\" I thought I was in for a great mountaineering read. Instead what I received is an introspective autobiography attempting to describe why he climbed and how his life developed.Raised in Colorado Roberts spent a substantial amount of time describing teenage influences that had profound effects on his life forever that he continually revisits in this book, a mountain tragedy and a personal tragedy not handled today in the same manner as the 1950/early 60s. His formative education at Harvard in mathematics gets sidetracked by his love for the mountains and the expeditions to Alaska to climb and conquer new peaks. Along the way his life forms not as a mathematician but a writer. Roberts describes in great detail the hardships and drive required to be a successful climber. And yes, he's seen his share of death and as described in the book, been very close to it himself.The next interesting facet of this book has him at a new-age college in New Hampshire teaching writing and running the outdoors program. Here he meets and helps shape a young obsessed climber, Jon Krakauer. In fact, Roberts takes credit for talking Krakauer out of a life as a carpenter into a career as a budding writer renowned for his book \\"Into Thin Air.\\"The final part of the book brings closure to this interesting life and how he drifted away from the dangers of the mountain and why. This introspective look is fascinating as he ties his parents, early girlfriend and climbing partners into the web that is his life. If you have an interest in climbing or are interested in growing up in America from the 50s on, I think this book will be enjoyable. David Roberts is truly one of the great climbing writers of his generation and this is a worthy tribute to his legacy."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"I'm a climber only in the sense that I have paid guides to lead me up big mountains, which in the climbing world doesn't count for much. But I have been cold and afraid in the mountains, enough to appreciate what Roberts is talking about. A few days before what was my biggest climb, I met a young Argentine who would die a few days later on Alpamayo. We heard the news on the radio our Peruvian porters listened to incessantly (yes, I used porters). Something that has always bothered me about real climbers is their attitude toward risk, which is a euphemism for death. The 'hard man' attitude that Roberts discusses is very real. It is just casually accepted that people die climbing, and that it is worth the risk. Roberts's unique honesty allows the reader to see where the hard man comes from. He does it by painting a fairly painfully unflattering portrait of himself. Maybe even more unflattering than he intended. I am not a very hard man, and I found his description of Ed's death on Mt. Huntington and the subsequent telling of his parents almost unbearably sad. As is his description of his disastrous high school love affair. Somehow, Roberts has managed to write a book that conveys the majesty of the grand ranges, and why climbing breeds obsession, without letting the tragedy, of which there is plenty, fade entirely into the background. He has also ruthlessly kept out the various hackneyed sentiments often found in mountaineering books. Not any Mark Twight type hard man preening here, and the brooding is more under control than in Joe Simpson's later books, though I like them as well. But,when the rat is gnawing, and you're wondering whether maybe your planned route is too ambitious, like maybe fatally so, this is not the book to read. Save it for a chair and a warm fire."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"I was surprised by the openness of David Roberts book. The first that I've read of his works, it revealed what a climber thinks before, during, and after a climb, regardless of its technical difficulty. I found the feelings of climber's spouses, immediate family, and friends to be contradictory, yet aligned in an odd fashion. I thought that Roberts was brave, not only in his climbing, but in sharing his intimate feelings with the world.Roberts' book also took me into the world of higher education, revealing the politics and how many administrators are stuck in stupid mode.Despite the descriptive nature of the book, I still wish there were photographs in the book to help me visualize the book's many characters. Roberts' vocabulary helped me to expand mine, as I frequently sought out the dictionary."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"This book drew me in from start to finish. Being an avid climber myself I enjoyed reading about someone else so caught up in the lifestyle. I was swept away to the remote ranges of Alaska fully entertained by his stories of first ascents and failed attempts on some very respectable peaks. Just when I thought the book had climaxed and couldn't get any better, there he was, telling about another gripping climbing trip back to Alaska, or Canada, or a close call in the states. The book is laced with tragedy, both in his life, and his accounts of what has happened to others in the climbing community. Roberts evaluates what climbing has meant to him and what the impact has been on others. You don't have to be a climber to enjoy this book. Is it worth the risk?, read the book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book as I have enjoyed reading David Roberts' other books on climbing and the Southwest. In this book Roberts' gives us an honest, revealing look at his early high school years through to the present day, concentrating on the various aspects of his life from climbing, teaching, and writing and what he gets out of each. He is directly involved in several climbing fatalities and yet continues climbing putting up many extremely difficult first ascents in Alaska. He examines his changing attitudes about the risks of climbing while reasessing the impacts the fatalities have had on his life and more importantly the families involved.Here we have a 62 year old who is looking back over his life, feeling pride over his accomplishments (justly deserved), shame over past behavior, and struggling through career choices, which can help all of us with our own moments of self evaluation.From reading Roberts' other books, I have wanted to know more about him. In this book, he shares his life with us, from the complexities of relationships with women to lifelong friendships he has made with the likes of Jon Krakauer, all interwoven with amazing climbing stories from Colorado to Alaska. Well written, and like usual, I kept a dictionary handy."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"Wow! Having read many climbing narratives and essays, I was expecting more of the same--exciting adventure writing similar to war accounts. David Roberts' newest book has all the first-person nail-biting drama, of course, of putting up world-class routes in frozen wilderness, but the surprise here is the intelligent, unflinching inner dialogue off the mountain. Roberts has seen and experienced high risk, death and deprivation, has lost and gained much from his chosen battles, and has explored the consequences here in an amazingly conscious way. This rare book sheds a great deal of light on the reasons Roberts was drawn away from the safe, tame and mundane 'everydayness' of modern life, even as he fought the demons that drew him away from his quests, even as he became aware of the spreading ripples that emanated from his passion for the climbing life. Undoubtedly these internal struggles rage inside many who try to balance a burning love for earth's wild and dangerous places (climbers, explorers, kayakers, surfers...) against the tidal pull of human relations."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"David Roberts (born in 1943) is a climber, mountaineer, author and, notably, past-professor at (hippieish) Hampshire College. In this book he looks back at his life to explain why, despite extreme danger, he chooses to climb. Roberts takes readers through events of his young adulthood, including his first romance (and impregnation, no surprise considering the pair's cluelessness about conception and contraception) and the tragic death of friends, twice, on climbs with him. The first occurred just after the two graduated from high school, the second, four years later. He also talks about his relationship with his wife, Sharon, his famous inventor father, and, especially, his mountaineering friends. By the end of the book, readers learn the approximate odds of dying during a climb over 8,000 feet and the fact that, as he's grown older, Roberts has made new interests, but kept the old. A deep thinker, he provides plenty of robust vocabulary and includes intriguing excerpts from famous stories and poems about climbing as well as important historical information on the subject that help put things in perspective.Even for non-mountaineer types like me (my biggest climbing accomplishment being Mt Fuji, a total walkup, though during a nonstop rain storm...ought I not get credit for that) OtRBLaD, well written with wonderful imagery, is a marvelous memoir about mountaineering. One of the book's highlights is the appearance, nearly three-quarters through, of my favorite adventure writer, Jon Krakauer (though I'll be rethinking that after reading Roberts), who attended Hampshire College because of its mountaineering classes, climbed (and still climbs) with Roberts. Also good: anything by Jon Krakauer (especially Into Thin Air), Miracle in the Andes by Nando Parrado and Vince Rause, and The Perfect Storm by Sebastian Junger."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"I loved this book.Roberts put succinctly and eloquently into words what a climber feels before a challenging climb, during a climb and, unfortunately, after the death of a partner on a climb.As he continues to climb and explore today, Roberts carries along in his hip pocket the deaths of three friends - the most influential of which is his childhood friend, Gabe.As you read the autobiography, you learn to understand, along with Roberts, the great impact the young kid's fall from the the Flatirons near Boulder, CO and death had on Roberts now as an over-the-hill-climber.His visits with the sister and friend of Gabe later in life present some very electrifying conclusions. I won't explain what he learns from these two interviews, but it is moving.As a very amateur climber myself, I could totally relate to his ruminations.I usually take my used books directly into Hastings for credit on new books - not so this one. I have kept it on my shelf for future reference and inspiration."},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"Like Clint Eastwood's early \\"spaghetti westerns\\", Roberts's memoir is a too long, but generally fascinating narrative replete with seemingly numberless dead bodies, and one terribly misused girl, about whom the \\"hard man\\" protagonist shows remarkably little feeling.Let me acknowledge: I'm not a climber. I LOVE mountains, especially the world above timberline, and like Roberts I was awed by Maurice Herzog's Annapurna in my youth and by the accounts of Hillary and Tenzing - and earlier Mallory - on Everest. But my fear of heights - and perhaps good sense - have limited me to the walk-ups like Mt. Elbert which Roberts ridicules.Let me also ackowledge why Roberts's memoir troubles me so much. One of the finest young men I taught and coached in prep school was lost in a crevasse on Shishapangma in 1996. He was a 3rd year med student who had very limited climbing experience, yet the expedition leaders never acknowledged that he should not have been allowed to proceed solo between camps at 21,000'. To me his loss epitomizes the awful waste of life on mountains and the callous attitude of those like Roberts who encourage neophytes beyond their capacities and seem to feel no genuine remorse.The major drawback of this memoir, for the general reader, simply from a story-telling point of view, is its far too-long descriptions of many of Roberts's Alaskan climbs. Serious climbers may revel in the details of carabineers (I may or may not have spelled it right - and don't care) and route-finding and the like - almost minute by minute at times, but non-climbers will become weary and bored. With some skimming of those sections, I persevered to the end. Roberts's narrative style is, otherwise, effective plus I had to find out if he really was as hard and cold and short of compassion as steely-eyed Clint Eastwood. Yup. But, hey, telling about all the dead, and about \\"Lisa\\", will bring Roberts a few dollars more, right?"},{"Title":"On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined","review":"An introspective recap of a climbing life by a pioneer in the field.

Especially in Europe, many people were afraid that the new more sophisticated nuclear missiles would sooner or later destroy humanity. At the same time there were growing worries about the environment, as trees and whole forests seemed to be dying from the exposure to pollution. That is the background of Grass' novel &quot;The Rat&quot;, which is his own version of the Apocalypse.The construction of the novel is very intricate, poems and prose interweave several plots. The rat of the title is a pet which the narrator keeps, and which suddenly starts telling him about the end of humanity in a nuclear war; rats survive and found a new civilisation. The narrator does not want to accept this and starts telling stories to prove to the rat that he still exists. There definitely is a feeling of endgame about the novel, as Grass summons characters from earlier novels (such as Oskar from &quot;The Tin Drum&quot;), all the women he has loved (the five of them corss the Baltic Sea in a boat) and his native Danzig-Gdansk as if to say goodbye to them all. In another subplot, characters from well-known fairytales try to start a kind of revolution to save the German forests.Much of this is very poignant, some of it full of brilliant black humour, yet somehow I get the impression that maybe Grass tried to do too much here. The novel is far from being a page turner. As both the rat and the narrator insist on their points of view, some annoying repetitions occur. - To me it seemed quite dated, too. Even Grass himself seems to be less worried about the end of the world today, as his recent novels are more concerned with the injustices of German unification. That said, &quot;The Rat&quot; is representative of its time - and it is a daring vision which few writers of Grass' standing have attempted. Maybe it will prove a case of greatness which was not recognized in its own time."},{"Title":"The Rat","review":"_The Rat_ is my favorite novel by Gunter Grass. It is miserly and potent, with very little wasted space or filler. It is an almost continuous stream-of-conscience monologue; it is the nonstop ranting and raving of an angst-ridden person in the midst of a spiritual crisis, venting his frustration and confusion. Overall, this technique proves to be a very successful literary device. It reads almost like nonfiction philosophy, and because Grass does not get bogged down with an absurd plot and characterization, this novel provides an ideal vehicle for his undiluted spiritual-philosophical beliefs. Keep in mind, however, that there is very little in the way of action, charaterization, and concrete plot events in this novel. If you are looking for a more traditional novel, you may want to look elsewhere. Nevertheless, I still believe this is Grass' best work because it is personal and revealing with regards to his deepest sources of philosophical angst and spiritual misgivings. I recommend this book to anyone who really wants to know what is going on in the mind of Gunter Grass."},{"Title":"The Rat","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long time. I agree that this book is very dense with symbolism, but I think that this is a virtue, not a fault. Grass orchestrates an amazing chaos through out the book, tying together themes as diverse as the death of fairy-tales, the destruction of the environment, human attitudes toward rats, and a host of other ideas, and somehow turns them into something remarkable. For all its different plot lines, I felt a unity running through this book that few authors could have achieved.This book is certainly not for everyone, and I would not advise reading it until after you have read \\"The Tin Drum\\" and \\"The Flounder\\" both by Grass, but for me this book was a remarkable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Rat","review":"I was throughly entertained by this imaginative book. With a background of Germany's recent tumultuous history and the more recent destruction of the environment as well as our favorite fairy tales characters, humanity's destruction is described. The earth has simply expelled us to such a degree that even the genetic mixture of humans and rats (Rattenmenschen oder Menschenratten) is eventually wiped out.After I finished the book, I even had a fonder, or more tolerant, view of rats.Can't wait to start Die Blechtrommel."},{"Title":"The Rat","review":"One of my favorite books along with Crime and Punishment, The Sea Wolf, and The Castle but not just a story for page-turning entertainment. It is a mistake to expect to fully understand the book it seems to me. Still, it is a fantastic book, off the beaten track, combining Sci Fi, psychology, history, art, fairy tales, religion, politics and much more."},{"Title":"The Rat","review":"There is almost too much going on in the story. Grass' creativity is astounding, with the she-rat and the space ship, but portions of the plot with Grimm fairytale characters are somewhat annoying. Oskar turns up, along with others. It's difficult to imagine someone staying with this book long enough to meet him if they hadn't already read Tin Drum. Here, Grass has taken the post-modernist position of the teller and chats away. The books in which he shined weren't chatty at all. The sections of the \\"plot\\" don't meld together as they do in, say, the Flounder. Some books bring tears when finished. One simply doesn't want it to end. I managed to finish the Rat, but just put it back on the shelf.

It provided images that sustained and nourished me as I worked to be reconciled to my tragedy. It has continued to be a powerful force in my lifetime. The images and the well chosen phrases are part of me, and arise whenever they are needed. If this wonderful epic were familiar to everyone in our culture, as it was to the Babylonians who made it their national epic back in the third millenium B.C., we would be the richer for having a wealth of images to sustain us as we encounter our tragedies and walk through our dark valleys. Mason's retelling of the great story of Gilgamesh and his doomed friend, is beautiful, nourishing and empowering."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"The well meaning Mr. Mason does not represent the Epic of Gilgamesh well in his verse narrative. In fact, it is not a translation of the Epic, rather has he cooked up his own version of somebody else's translation. He did this in times when few knew much about Gilgamesh, and made many novices belive it was the Epic. I have even heard of a small country where the most prominent philosopher translated Mason's narrative into the native language. The literature professor entered it into the curriculum for early literature and everyone thought they were reading the Epic of Gilgamesh.Mason's verse narrative is strikingly purged of place and time specific references. In his hands this complex monument of Babylonian literature has become just \\"an old story... that can still be told\\" about friendship, loss and human mortality. In Mason's popular retelling, the character Gilgamesh has been reduced to a sentimental simpleton, who cannot deal with the facts of life. Such a retelling can be recommended for children, but it is too full of anachronistic references to \\"thoughts\\" (unheard of in early texts) and other modern phenomena to deserve the attention of grown-ups. From Mr. Mason's recreation of the poem alone it would seem unlikely that the Epic of Gilgamesh had held the fascination of generations of writers and scholars, ever since it was rediscovered in the 19th century.One former reviewer states: \\"If this wonderful epic were familiar to everyone in our culture, as it was to the Babylonians who made it their national epic back in the third millenium B.C., we would be the richer for having a wealth of images to sustain us as we encounter our tragedies and walk through our dark valleys.\\" I do essentially agree, but in that case it is imperative to keep closer to the Epic itself, not to rely on an imitation. My recommendations: For those who need textual supplementary information and variant readings I recommend either of Maureen Gallery Kovacs or Andrew R. George's translations. Stephen Mitchell's New English Version should be easy to use for those who are looking for a simplified translation for a clear understanding."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"While there cannot be much doubt as to the cultural value of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the importance of the story transceds mere literary significance. The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of those simple and yet deeply insightful stories that one can relate to. The verse narrative style that mason adopts, while by no means a flawless poetic translation, takes you through the events in a seamlessly captivating manner. One can infer a lot from the story about the meaning of life, especially as regards how the ancient ones chose to answer questions such as eternity and why humans cannot live forever (u'll have to figure out which part of the story I am talking about!!).Overall this is a great reading. Shouldnt take too long to finish either, although I recommend that you take your time reading this one."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"As a high school humanities teacher, I've used this text for over a dozen classes, and I've looked at a number of different translations. Mason's version is, hands down, the best. He writes with such poetic eloquence, and with sparse language, and he creates a bridge between the human struggles for meaning today, and those faced by those thousands of years ago--a truly magnificent translation. If yours is a history class, and exact and literal translation of the original cuneiform is important to you, you can try the Norton version; that is a very dry, and somewhat arduous, read, though. Mason's version will inspire your students and get you to the heart of the text."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"The epic tale of Gilgamesh comes alive in this exqisite poetic retelling. Mason's version is sublime: poignant, evocative, and graceful. While the slender volume is deceptively accessible upon first reading, this abiding treasure will be valued ever more deeply with each re-reading."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"Mason's translation of the epic can be easily read in one sitting, but it is worth savoring and pondering passages filled with beautiful imagery and timeless meaning. This is a simple story of hubris, friendship, and loss. It is a tale of accepting both the limitations and beautiful power of being human. I have read this translation yearly, and I plan to continue to do so, to remind me of the univeral pain but ultimately triumphant power of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"In short, the Epic of Gilgamesh is about life and death and how one should live, and touches the most important aspects of the human experience, such as friendship, love, loss of loved ones, and how to live.The central actor is Gilgamesh, king of the important city of Uruk, ancient Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Gilgamesh and a wild man from the steppe, Enkidu, become friends, go through one adventure after another, until Enkidu dies. The death of Enkidu devastates Gilgamesh, who sets out to find immortality. He doesn't find it, but he finds wisdom and returns to his people and his city with wisdom.The story of Gilgamesh is fascinating and deeply touching, and I have read a bunch of versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh. However, Mason's version is one of the worst. It does not fully capture the complex nature of the epic, is too short and focuses on the experience of loss and death, while not sufficiently capturing other aspects of the Gilgamesh. Mason's version is from 1970 and outdated, and I think there are much better versions: e.g. Stephen Mitchell's version (as an introduction) and, in particular, Gardner's and Maier's version (the best version I am aware of)."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"Words fail. I love this book, this translation, especially. It's not verbose; it relies on detail to express pathos. The lack of embellishments enhances the story and characters. I'm afraid to talk about this book too much. Simply elegant, and heartbreakingly honest."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"When I read this version, I wanted to buy and I did! I loved this simplified translation and Herbert Mason provided a clear understanding of the Mesopotamian story. I loved the use of the blank verse style, Mason has done well in this abridged version of the epic. I'd like to see more abridged works of ancient epics by Mason! I loved the Babylonian relief on the front cover too. I would have appreciated Mason to provide to ending where Gilgamesh finally dies. Get this version of Gilgamesh."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I picked up this book back in the early 1970's from a little card shop in 140 Village Shopping Center, Westminster, Maryland. The owner and his daughters were almost my family because I came back again and again to the small \\"classics\\" rack they had on the back wall of the shop, and I sometimes fantasize that they stocked the racks with me in mind. There I found cheap paperback editions of Shelley and Milton and Pope among others, and one day I noticed this wonderful book and bought it with my spare change for something like 50 cents. Not only did the story of Gilgamesh as retold by Mr. Mason grip me, but I was enthralled by the \\"easy\\" free verse of the lines. The simple prose narrative was made to look and \\"sound\\" somewhat like a poem by the way it was set up on the page. I recognized this same kind of sensibility at work much later when I read Charles Reznikoff's Testimony and his long poem on the Holocaust, and encountered Dennis Tedlock's exercises in ethnopoetic translation. In a sense, then, this was my introduction to a new kind of postmodern poetics, and for that this \\"verse narrative\\"--now appearing in its latest version from Mariner Books, and augmented by an autobiographical postscript by the author--holds an important place in my development.On the other hand, it was not until I began reading Armand Schwerner's \\"Tablets\\" that I went back and began to investigate the more scholarly versions of Gilgamesh, and I discovered the extent to which Mr. Mason's narrative diverges from the original both in form and content. To get a real feeling for the true Gilgamesh I recommend the Andrew George translation (published by Penguin)of all the available versions and fragments. However, for a good introduction to Gilgamesh's quest to recover Enkidu from the dead suitable for high school classes or ESL college classes, I would suggest this one. Indeed, I plan to use this book in future in my comparative literature classes in Japan. Mason's description of Gilgamesh's grief retold in such plain language is very understandable to students at all levels, and very moving."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I read this book in my western civ class during college. I was not sure what to expect from it, but found that I was pulled in and the book and meaning of the book would not let go. This is the meaning of life at its best. Athough not much history is involved with this epic tale, the writing is. This well done verse translation gives a glossary at the end of the book to help with hard to pronouce words and makes the read a bit easier. I do suggest reading this great book. It is very well done."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"The story Gilgamesh is an ancient tale of friendship between the king Gilgamesh and his dear friend Enkidu. The story begins by describing Gilgamesh as a king. He is a selfish man who cares for himself more than his people. One day, a farmer sees a wild man living in the woods. This man is Enkidu, who lives like a King of the animals. The farmer asks King Gilgamesh to help by civilizing Enkidu. The wild man is then introduced to life as a human being. He soon adjusted to life as a human, and the people of Gilgamesh's village thought that Enkidu looked just like him. The people also loved him dearly, which made Gilgamesh very jealous. Gilgamesh decided to fight him, but saw himself in the other man's eyes and so they quickly became great friends. As soon as they became comrades, they decided to team up and fight Humbaba. Humbaba is a huge, lumbering creature who lives in the cedar forest and cuts down trees for the Gods. Enkidu is injured by Humbaba, and eventually dies as a result of that injury. I do not want to give away TOO much of the story, but Gilgamesh then goes on a quest to bring his friend back to life. In the process, he grows tremendously as a person (which is appropriate for any heroic tale).I very much enjoyed Herbert Mason's version of the story. His wording flowed very well, and the book was a quick read despite being full of complex ideas. To be honest, I actually read the book twice. The first time that I read it, I thought that it was just \\"ok\\". However, after I had read it that first time and gained a fuller understanding of the key concepts; I absolutely loved it the second time. Once I had become familiar with the main ideas of the story, I was able to better grasp the deeper meanings that were presented in the poetry. All in all, I think that it is a wonderful poem and I would highly suggest it."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I was assigned to read the Epic of Gilgamesh for a World Literature class in College, but I have to say that I wish I had read it sooner. The translation by Mason is easy to read, and truly draws you into the story. However, even though completely understandable by the modern reader, it still has a sense of authenticity. It made me feel like I was an actual Babylonian, being told the story first hand. It certainly doesn't read like your average classical work. When I read it, it was if it was actually being read to me. I sat down and read the entire book in one sitting and time felt like it was flying by. This is an excellent translation, and I would highly recommend it to anyone..As for the story itself, I hate to sound like a sentimentalist, but this is the classical work for anyone who has ever truly loved a friend. The story truly captures what it is like to have a purely platonic relationship with a best friend. Also, it is incredibly entertaining with the adventures the characters go on. When Enkidu died though, I cried a little myself. It is incredibly easy to become attached to the character. And we can all relate to Gilgamesh's quest to bring him back. In a way, we all wish we could prevent not only our own death but the death of our loved ones. Also, the story gives a true to life picture of the desperation that comes with the death of a loved one. Not to mention, the fears that this book touches upon. Are their people out there that are our matches? Will we be remembered after death? Truly, this book shows why it is one of the greatest examples of classical world Literature."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I actually really enjoyed this story. I thought Gilgamesh, in this transition, was a very easy read. It kept my attention well, and I was very interested in the story. The story has a great plot and many moral and life lessons. Anyone could take something away from this book. The story of a stubborn, careless king is one that anyone can relate to. Gilgamesh is careless, in terms of his people and his kingdom. He takes advantage of everything present in his life. This is relatable because all people have the one friend who is selfish, and Gilgamesh learns, over many obstacles, that he has to care for his people. This story explains the importance of friendship through the struggles Enkidu and Gilgamesh over come together. Gilgamesh learns that friendship is indeed necessary, and he is made a much better person because of this. He learns he cannot take advantage of everyone and everything. He learns to appreciate things and people much more after he realizes friends are very much a necessity in life, for happiness and to learn appreciation. After their journey together, Gilgamesh returns to his kingdom a new person, and is finally pleased with his people, and his people are pleased with him. I would recommend this as a quick read for anyone, the life lessons are timeless and very much applicable for everyone."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"Mason provided a clear understanding of the struggles and triumphs between Giglamesh, the king of the city of Uruk, and a wild man from the land, Enkidu. It is a simple story of growth, friendship, and loss. It touches the most important qualities of human experience. This book kept me wanting to know more, it is an easy read, almost too easy. The story line is even better. I have never been much of a fan of verse narratives but this has changed my viewpoint, this was by far my favorite book to read during my World Literature class.I would highly recommend Mason's version of Gilgamesh, only if you want to be pulled in to grasp the real human emotion written inside, between two strangers who became friends."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I had to read Gilgamesh for my World Literature class and I really enjoyed the story. I was able to understand this translation and follow it pretty easily. I wasn't familiar with this story before I read it and I thought it was very interesting. The friendship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu is certainly unique and I found myself becoming more emotionally involved in the story than I thought I would be. Usually I don't like things like this, but I really loved Gilgamesh. This is a story that is easy to like and I would definitely recommend it. Gilgamesh is a great tale and really gives you something to think about."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I had to read this book in a world lit class for school and I am not someone who reads often or for leisure but I found this book to be very good and liked they way it was translated by Herbert Mason. The first day that we were assigned to read it we were only supposed to read the first half, but I enjoyed the book so much that I read the whole thing the first day, even though its not very long that's still saying something because I don't enjoy reading. I think he does a good job of writing in a way that provides you with a clear image of his depiction of the epic of Gilgamesh. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in epic novels because this one is short, interesting, and provides good imagery and you get a good sense of how gilgamesh and enkidu are feeling and what they experience along the way."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"I found Mason's Gilgamesh to be a good read. The book was easy to read and flowed nicely. It is a shorter story which allowed the reader to stay involved in it. The length also made it easy to remember past events to make connections throughout the story. I also found Mason's translation easy to understand. The language he used was not complex, but still common for the times. Mason's Gilgamesh is also relatable, not only to life today but to other literary works and structures. The story of Gilgamesh and Enkidu can be fit into the hero's journey. This allows for a greater understanding of the plot. I found the themes portrayed in the book positive and powerful. They were clearly portrayed and added depth to the book.The story in Gilgamesh is a story of great friendship. The story shows how society can change a person as well as how friendship can affect people and change them as well. The plot involves the trial and triumph of Enkidu and Gilgamesh. These events show the strength of friendship and how much it can impact one's life. The actions of the two men change each one of their lives significantly. This shows that all actions come with consequences, even if they are not immediate. After a series of events Gilgamesh is alone and searching for immortality. The latter half of the book is spent taking the reader on Gilgamesh's journey seeking immortality, ultimately ending with his return to Uruk. When he returns he is a new man and ready to rule over kingdom again.This ultimately shows how one person can change after a series of events as well as how one event can completely change a person.Overall, I think this book is a very good read.I personally enjoyed the story and read it in one sitting. I would recommend it to others and believe it is worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Gilgamesh: A verse narrative","review":"A riveting story of antiquity that absolutely resonates to the modern times in so many ways!

I had read a different translation in high school, and I was expecting pretty much the same thing. However, I found that Mason goes into much more detail and focuses mainly on the hero of the story, Gilgamesh: his transformation into a more mortal man, his struggle with his own humanity, what inspired him to begin his journey, and the beauty of his coping mechanisms as he learns and realizes the difficulties of love and friendship. Mason's version of Gilgamesh is ultimately a story of the journey of realizing, accepting, and growing in one's humanity. It is a timeless tale of both the difficulties and the beauty of the human condition. I recommend this book, but give the warning to do your best not to read too literally and just take things at face value, but attempt to understand the meaning behind the words.

The prose is so simple, so beautiful, and yet it still so rich in exploring the themes of friendship and loss, immortality and grieving. The storytelling elements are in perfect form, the three battles that bring the two friends together, making Gilgamesh mortal by taking away his friend.

How?","review":"Although Dr. Rosenvolt's book is written in a very practical and easy to understand way, it deals with problems that have not been taken seriouly by many medical professionals. His ability to observe and come to meaningful practical conclusions is evident in what I relay below. It has indeed saved my life as well as my daughter's and grand daughter's.In my case, I had been feeling so week that I was contemplating asking my children to come get me and take care of me because I just had no energy to work any more. I had been waking up with an eletrical discharge from my brains every morning. It was terrifying. My muscles were weak and sore. One morning I knelt by my bed and asked God to please show me what was wrong with me if I still had a mission in this world.It was than that books like Dr. D'Adamo's and Dr. Rosenvolt's fell in my hands. Dr. D'Adamo mentioned the problem with gluten and made me interested in knowing more about it. Then I was ready for Dr. Rosenvolt's book.I could see my story and the story of some other members of my family in his accounts.I immediately cut gluten out of my diet and began fo feel more energetic and the short circuits disappeared. Now, two and a half year later I'm fifty three and work 50 hours a week as a teacher.My daughter lives in the USA and I in Brazil. Soon after I began to feel better she, pregnant of about 16 weeks, called, very up set because the doctor had said that she was going to lose the baby because her liver had stopeed funtioning and the toxins were building up fast and she may have eclampsia at any time. I mentioned to her what I had read and that to me had worked wonders, but she didn't see much sense in it. A week later she was desesperate and upon my insistence she decided to try a gluten free diet. In only three days she eliminate four pounds of toxins and her liver began to funtion again.Although her doctor was very happy and told her to keep the diet, he never even asked her what kind of diet it was. When it was about time for her to have the baby and I was already there, I heard him say: &quot;Young lady you are fine now but for a while there, I thought you wouldn't get here.&quot; It is thanks to God, Dr. D'Adamo and Dr. Rosenvolt that I can work again, have my daughter without sacrificing my grand daughter."},{"Title":"Can a Gluten-Free Diet Help . . . How?","review":"This is a book in which Dr. Rosenvold's many years of clinical experience are brought to bear upon a complex, difficult topic. His insights into the health benefits of a gluten-free diet suggest help for a variety of gastrointestinal difficulties, neuological complaints, and a variety of autoimmune diseases. Rosenvold's observations and discussion are a testament to his very perceptive and rational analysis of his patients' health problems.Researchers continue to find immunological evidence to support Dr. Rosenvold's claims. This heroic work was published before most of these researchers were willing to grant more than a coincidental genetic association between celiac disease and autoimmunity.The alcohol soluble proteins from wheat, rye, barley, and perhaps, oats appear to begin many of the associated illnesses in celiac disease. Rosenvold's suggestions of the incidence of health problems arising out of immune reactions to these proteins are very similar to those numbers revealed by very recent reports of serological screening.If a hero is a person who is well ahead of his time, then Dr. Rosenvold is just that .......a hero of modern medicine. His book offers information, guidance, and insight into the complex problems induced by dietary gluten in those without the ability to properly metabolize these relatively modern foods.Loved ones may come to understand the importance of compliaince with the diet, as well as considering the possibility that the diet might help with some of their health challenges.best wishes, Ron Hoggan"},{"Title":"Can a Gluten-Free Diet Help . . .

How?","review":"This book is not very long but it is full of information. The author is a medical doctor who admits that he did not always know much about celiac disease/gluten intolerance. He shares what he has learned in a clear and compelling way.I have multiple food allergies and sensitivities. I have avoided wheat for over ten years and have read extensively about food allergies and nutritional therapies. This is the first book that explains clearly how gluten sensitivity leads to other dietary problems such as dairy intolerance. Now I wish that I had known early on that I should not consume gluten (which is in wheat and certain other grains). Perhaps my long list of food allergies would be much shorter.Rosenvold also explains how gluten sensitivity can worsen the symptoms of a number of other conditions include MS, schizophrenia, and dementia. Recent news reports on a study of dementia proved him correct on this count.Readers who have a relative with celiac disease should read this book because they may have the disease too. Avoiding gluten is not really terrible - just shop the perimeter of the supermarket (produce, meat, dairy), check out the rice products and the health food aisle, skip the convenience foods (sorry!), and read the labels. New label rules have made it MUCH easier to avoid gluten.This is an excellent book for consumers, nutritionists, and even doctors - especially doctors! Celiac disease is not as rare as once thought.

The caveat of exploration of the book is to critically compare how things got to be this way in our US technological/mechanical system of birthing, and to compare this to other cultural systems. The fallicy of the safety of hospital birth is examined as well as why physicians have (what I believe is) inappropriate status and power in decision making during pregnancy and birth. Researchers describe how culture and women themselves have contributed to their own relinquishment of control over their bodies for what is supposed to be a normal physiological event with the capacity for profound meaning in family life. This book is not for the faint of heart. It will challenge all of your assumptions about how we blindly enter the arena of physican dominated decision making in birth, letting those with technological knowledge hook us up to machines and gadgets, strip us of our clothing and identity, and then tell us how our bodies are functioning based on what machines and those with power say, not what women and families say. Data will prove how midwives can deliver safer (or safer) and sensitive care while respecting womens bodies and the status of her innate knowledge during labor and birth. I highly recommend this book to childbirth educators, midwives, OB nurses, obstetricians, and consumers who want to take back power and control over their pregnancy and birth experience. However, you will see that this cannot be easily done in a hospital setting, and almost impossible with a physician as the care provider. This may sound like I am bashing doctors - this cannot be further from the truth. However this book convinced me that the arena of birth belongs with those who believe in the physiology of normal birth and can spiritually as well as emotionally support women and families experiencing this momentous occasion. The place for doctors is best modeled after the European system of care - as specialists of abnormal pregnancy and birth. The book is written on the upper college to graduate level."},{"Title":"Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives","review":"Inspired by birth anthropologist Brigitte Jordan (author of Birth in Four Cultures), editors Davis-Floyd and Sargent have collection of articles written by scientists studying birth all over the world who have taken Jordan's concept of authoritative knowledge and applied it to myriad studies. Authoritative knowledge refers to the dominant accepted theory (usually the Western medical tradition and dependent on technology) and how its acceptance translates into customs and practices surrounding birth.Many of the studies were very easy to read and the articles that &quot;told the tale&quot; of births in Greece, Mexico, and Sierra Leone were especially good. A surprise for me was how much I enjoyed Marsden Wagner's article - a doctor and public health official by training, Wagner was appointed the head of the World Health Organization's Maternal and Child Health Department. As he studied the efficacy of midwifery techniques the world over, Wagner began publishing WHO reports recommending the adoption of midwifery systems and a rejection of technology-oriented birth. His story of how the Western medical community continually attempt to disparge and undermine his work (my words as his are more understanding of the difficulty of change) is an excellent overview of the power of medical professionals."},{"Title":"Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives","review":"This is a book that requires concentration and focus.

I did so because I had read not long before, thanks to the Amazon.com VINE program, a much more recent collection of scholarly essays. That collection is called THE HARLEM RENAISSANCE REVISITED. {SeeThe Harlem Renaissance Revisited: Politics, Arts, and Letters} It is edited by Professor Jeffrey O. G. Ogbar of the University of Connecticut.Over and over I read Essay (Chapter) Number Eight by McKinley Melton, a doctoral candidate at the University of Massachusetts. Its title: \\"Speak It Into Existence: James Weldon Johnson's GOD'S TROMBONES and the Power of Self-Definition in the New Negro Harlem Renaissance\\" (pp. 109 - 126). That essay persuaded me to read Johnson for myself. I am glad I did.According to Melton, a key goal of the very self-conscious New Negro Harlem Renaissance (NNHR) was to \\"let the Negro speak for himself\\" (p.109). But New Negro writers could not just parrot Henry Ford's dictum that \\"history is bunk.\\" Black writers could not, that is, turn their backs on black history and start \\"writing black\\" from scratch. But how do this without repeating the stereotype of black folks as either figures of fun or profoundly to be pitied for their sufferings?In 1927 James Weldon Johnson found a key example of Negro creative, assimilative culture for himself to investigate and to glorify: the old-time negro American Protestant preacher and his \\"song sermons.\\"Imagine a West African \\"griot\\" (teller of folk tales and folk histories). He is captured, shipped to America, sold into slavery. His master exposes him to Christian teaching and history. The Americanized griot is converted to Protestant Christianity and then retells the ancient stories of Israel as he heard them in the King James English translation.The result is the Negro American song sermon -- \\"a new art form\\" drawing on West African \\"rhythm, melody, chant, mime, and dramatic impersonation\\" (p. 110). The black Protestant song sermon is a high Negro cultural contribution to America and the world.In the seven sermons and a prayer of GOD'S TROMBONES James Weldon Johnson, using standard English rather than dialect,\\" tries, successfully in my opinion, to capture elements of Negro preaching rhetoric and theater. All done meditatively, prayerfully, and briefly.Take, for instance, the final sermon, \\"The Judgment Day.\\" Time is finally up for the people of earth. Earth will be destroyed by fire. God summons Gabriel and tells him to trumpet the end time into existence.\\"And the wicked like lumps of lead will start to fall,Headlong for seven days and nights they'll fall,Plumb into the big, black, red-hot mouth of hell,Belching out fire and brimstone.And their cries like howling, yelping dogs,Will go up with the fire and smoke from hell,But God will stop his ears.Too late, sinner! Too late!Good-bye, sinner! In hell!Beyond the reach of the love of God.\\"Take this little book and eat it up.

This is a Penguin Classic, reprinted in 2008 from the original in 1927. It presents seven inspiring Negro sermons in verse.A thought-provoking statement comes from the Forward: \\"African Americans are the only people in the whole world and history who really practice Christianity.\\" No one else has ever found in their hearts the gift of forgiveness, the Forward claims. African Americans forgave the slave owners who worked them without payment for 240 years. This ability to forgive made many former slave owners uneasy, so incomprehensible was their forgiveness.These transplanted Africans accepted Jesus as their savior and laid all their worries on him. God's trombones--the old time Negro preachers--were powerful, eloquent figures in their community. A community surviving on hope. When the lyricists wrote, \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, coming for to carry me home,\\" neither the singer nor the audience had to tax their imagination to consider death a sweet chariot or to doubt that heaven was their destination.

A novelist, poet, songwriter, diplomat, educator, and activist, he left behind a towering legacy when he died in 1938. An essential part of that legacy is &quot;God's Trombones,&quot; a book in which Johnson pays poetic tribute to the &quot;old-time Negro preacher.&quot;&quot;God's Trombones&quot; contains seven poems, each of which is inspired by the art of the classic African-American sermon. Most of Johnson's poems retell Bible stories. &quot;The Creation,&quot; &quot;Noah Built the Ark,&quot; &quot;Let My People Go,&quot; and more--each one carries the reader to the traditional Black churches of Johnson's era. In his preface Johnson discusses the cultural significance of the traditional African-American religious orator and also reflects on his own literary strategies in the construction of these poems.Johnson's poems beg to be read aloud. Whatever your own ethnic heritage or religious inclination, try giving voice to these masterworks: you'll be amazed at the effect. If you are a lover of Christian inspirational writing, a scholar of African-American culture, or a person who appreciates great poetry, &quot;God's Trombones&quot; would make a fine addition to your library."},{"Title":"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"Many times I have used the poems from this book as dramatic readings and audiences have always responded in positive ways.

It never goes out of date."},{"Title":"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"James Weldon Johnson (1871 -- 1938) is best-known as the author of \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\\" the \\"Negro National Anthem\\" written in 1900 for Lincoln's birthday. Johnson had extraordinary gifts as a poet. His celebration of the African-American preacher in God's Trombones, published in 1927, is a masterpiece of American poetry.Johnson was inspired to write \\"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse \\" after hearing a stirring African-American preacher in Kansas City in 1918. Johnson wrote seven free-verse poems on biblical themes to capture the rhythm, content, language and religious commitment of the African-American preacher. Johnson also wrote a celebrated prose introduction to the book in which he described the place of the preacher in African-American life and explained his decision not to use dialect in writing the poems. Johnson also explained why he used the trombone as the guiding figure of his poem. Johnson wrote of his experience with the Kansas City preacher:\\"He strode the pulpit up and down in what was actually a very rhythmic voice, a voice -- what shall I say? -- not of an organ or a trumpet, but rather of a trombone, the instrument possessing above all others the power to express the wide and varied range of emotions encompassed by the human voice -- and with greater amplitude. He intoned, he moaned, he pleaded, -- he blared, he crashed, he thundered. ... [T]he emotional effect upon me was irresistable.\\"The poetry opens with a short preliminary call to prayer, \\"Listen, Lord\\" followed by the seven sermons. The sermons open with the preacher's account of \\"The Creation\\"; and they conclude with a sermon on the end of days, \\"The Judgment Day\\". Four of the remaining poems deal with Biblical subjects, \\"The Prodigal Son\\", \\"Noah Built the Ark\\", \\"The Crucifixion\\", and \\"Let my People Go\\", the story of the Exodus from Egypt. The remaining sermon \\"Go down death -- a Funeral Sermon\\" is a meditation on the death of an elderly woman in Georgia who, in the preacher's language, is carried by Death to the throne of Jesus. The poems are in free verse, move in an elevated and lively style, include vivid imagery, and a sense of rhythmic speech and propulsion. It is useful to read them aloud. The poems make use effective use of repetition. Look at \\"The Crucifixion\\", for example, and see the many different adjectives Johnson applies to the figure of Jesus. The opening lines of the first three stanzas alone refer to \\"my gentle Jesus\\", \\"my burdened Jesus\\" and \\"my sorrowing Jesus\\". Each of the poems conclude with a short and effective exhortation to the listener. Thus, in the final words of the final poem, \\"The Judgment Day\\":\\"Sinner, oh sinner,Where will you stand,In that great day when God's a-going to rain down fire?\\"These poems are short and the book can be read quickly. But they will have a long-lived impact on the reader. This book would make an excellent introduction to poetry for young people. And Johnson has given a lasting and eloquent treatment to the art and spirit of the African-American preacher."},{"Title":"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"I read this book two years ago as a freshman in college. The poems touched me so much that I still continue to read them. Through this book James Weldon Johnson has retold familar Bible stories in a new light.

The themes he chose were expressed in sermons and in Gospel music. For the black person, God was aware of their struggles, would bring them out of \\"Egypt\\" (slavery) and would eventually take them to their home \\"over Jordan\\". Death would be a gentle freedom for those who were weary (as in \\"Go down Death\\").Johnson's introduction explains that he was trying to express the fervant Southern black preacher with his pauses and emphases. He has done both well.This is a book to be read for its beauty and inspiration, but more important, it shows (theological inaccuracies aside) how an oppressed people trusted in God's gentle hand, and God's constant love for even the \\"least\\" of his Creation.I recommend this for historians, teachers, lovers of poetry, and for its spiritual content, anyone seeking inspiration."},{"Title":"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"My dad teaches Sunday School and was looking for this book to incorporate into his lesson plans.

This is but one of a great many tragic cultural losses of our time.The poems evoke those trombone-like voices of Black preachers ringing with their simple themes, imaginative colorations, and powerful deliveries contrasting the pain of mortal life with the glory and joy of the eternal one. With their plaints and affirmations, their truths and contradictions, they embody a crucial aspect of the American heritage.Moving? \\"Powerful\\" hardly expresses it. When I first acquired the book, I read to my wife the poem, \\"Go Down Death -- A Funeral Sermon.\\" We were in the car on the way home from the bookstore.

Unfortunately this EDITION gets only one star - it does great disservice to Johnson's great work.This book has undergone great violence in this Penguin Classics edition (2008). It suffers from several defects:1. The book has been published as part of Penguin's \\"African American Classics\\" series, and the Foreward (Penguin's spelling) by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. (General Editor) takes away from the power of Johnson's own Preface. This Foreward drifts far away from Johnson's work. Johnson was a great pioneer in race relations in the USA, but \\"God's Trombones\\" is not a book about race - it's a book about the Black preachers Johnson heard in his youth and his homage to them. By narrowing the book into the genre of \\"Black literature\\" it takes away its significance as simply a great piece of American literature.2. Maya Angelou's additional Foreward is simplistic and attempts to frame Johnson's poems in the context of slavery and the Black experience that resulted from slavery. The problem with this is that Johnson himself - in his excellent Preface that fortunately is still in this edition - doesn't frame his poems that way. Johnson mentions slavery in one sentence of his Preface; Angelou wants us to think the poems are about a subject - slavery - rather than people - the great black preachers of Johnson's time.3. The wonderful illustrations - which were tipped into the original publication in 1927 - are poorly reproduced, appearing to be low-quality scans of previous paperback editions. The pixilating of the images is unfortunate.4. Penguin has laid out the poems anew, taking away Johnson's original layout. Presumably this was necessary because of the addition of the Forewards by Gates and Angelou as well as several pages of Penguin advertisements in the back of the book made the book too long. Alas.What to do:1. Buy a copy of the original 1927 hard bound edition, published by The Viking Press. Copies are available on used book websites such as abebooks.com, and on amazon.com from time to time. A bonus is that the lettering in the book by C. B. Falls is in color - yellow - in this early edition - color gives a new dimension to reading the poems. The tipped in illustrations by Aaron Douglas are superb. This and the other editions below contain only Johnson's words - no contemporary contextualization\\" by Gates or Angelou.2. Buy a copy of the 1969 paperback edition, also published by The Viking Press (Viking Compass Edition). It is in most respects faithful to the 1927 edition except the drawings are no longer tipped in (although they are nicely reproduced), and the poem names are in black rather than yellow. The layout is the same as the original 1927 edition.3. Buy a copy of the 1976 or 1999 Penguin paperback edition. These editions preserve Johnson's layout and font for the poems, although the text is in a smaller type size and the drawings are also smaller. It also includes a short introductory paragraph, typical of modern Penguin Classics editions; this introduction contains some biographical information about JohnsonIn short, Penguin has done readers a disservice with this 2008 edition. Johnson's poems - and his Preface - are masterpieces. Fortunately, older editions are still widely available. Most of the reviews of \\"God's Trombones\\" were written before this new Penguin edition. I have given the book 1 star to bring the flaws in the new edition to the attention of potential buyers. But Johnson's book deserves 1000 stars. If only Penguin had left it to speak for itself."},{"Title":"God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)","review":"This is a wonderful work of poetry written by a man who has been forgotten so much over the years.

Please read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Maitreya","review":"Living through difficult times, we like to think about a better future. And sometimes we \\"freak out\\" imagining just how bad things might get. Steve Fortney has done both in a brave and timely book. \\"The Maitreya\\" depicts America a decade or so from now. Extremist politics and religion have grown even closer than they are today. A single willing intermediary stands between the right-wing governor of Wisconsin and an armed, underground militia. Forces of oppression and repression seem poised to plunge the U.S. into a dark age. Among those standing in the way is an unusual collection of artists, academics, and meditators calling themselves the American Buddhist Community. Their aim is to fuse the best of Buddhism and western culture, renewing America's vision and, if possible, saving it from doom.Inhabiting this story are characters as three dimensional as the most interesting people you and I have known. They express themselves eloquently, sometimes drunkenly and humorously. They fall in and out of lust and love, they live and die in scenes of great power and beauty.One charismatic and puzzling figure is Martin Butler. First encountered as a derelict living in an abandoned warehouse, he gradually becomes the focal point of the novel. Important people inside the Buddhist Center believe that he is The Maitreya, the long-prophesied Buddha of the West who will bring about deep cultural change. Powerful forces outside fear that this is true and plot to abort his mission before it begins.Our own times and terrors are frighteningly present in \\"The Maitreya's\\" glimse into the near future. Though Fortney is too steeped in Buddhism to take a narrow dualistic view, this reader got very caught up in the contrasting hopes and fears surrounding the book's central character. Here is a novel for the heart, the intellect, and the gut. I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Flowering house plants, (The Time-Life encyclopedia of gardening)","review":"What a piece of trash!

To make a few comments:Insufficiently Authoritative?? - that hurt! I have a DMA in percussion performance from Indiana University. I am the Director of Percussion Studies at the University of Arizona. I have a number of works published: over a dozen musical compositions, three books, and over 400 published articles. This book was the result of over two years of research for my DMA document. The entire document and rationale of why certain recommendations were made, was over 900 pages long. I honestly feel that my background and research makes me an authoritative figure on this topic. I started writing music calligraphy back in 1973, and have worked with computer-based notation since Professional Composer came out on the Mac in 1984.These recommendations were not decided by some arbitrary means. The claim that these recommendations are contrary to standard practice is simply wrong. This book was created by making a very thorough analysis of the notation used in over 200 drumset examples, both using precise notation - such as actual transcriptions and drumset method books, and improvisatory notation - such as big band and studio drum charts. In addition, over 25 books on contemporary notational standards were analyzed in respect to drumset notation. The final recommendations were nothing more than an acceptance of what is currently being done the most. HOWEVER, some recommendations were made in order to help drumset notation work for a small 5-piece kit, or a kit the size of Terry Bozzio's!\\"Theta\\" claims that some of the instructions are \\"absurd\\", but please keep in mind that requirements change depending on what the composer is trying to do. For a short example, having one cross-stick rimshot on the snare is an easy notational example - Theta suggests using an \\"X\\" on the snare space. That's fine, but what if you want to use that same technique on a tom tom? Using the \\"X\\" for that technique now means that it can easily be confused with the cymbal. Not a big problem if you've only using two cymbals, but what if your kit includes 8 toms and 8 cymbals. Then the book's recommended notation makes much more sense.Concerning the statement that the \\"standardization\\" has yet to be implemented - I put forward the FACT that the book has been adopted by: The Percussive Arts Society and the PAS Publishers Committee, Hal Leonard Publishing, Alfred Publishing, Studio 4 Publishers, Meredith Music Publications, Modern Drummer Magazine, Drum! Magazine; as well as the Finale and Sibelius notation programs - to name just a few influential organizations. Hell, I wrote the section in the Sibelius manual for drumset notation. I was also a beta tester for Finale for over two years, working exclusively on their drumset notation capabilities.To make a comment to Max Parish's suggestion to use \\"my own Guide\\", is exactly the reason why this research was done in the first place! So that everyone didn't create their own notation from scratch. The book also goes so much further than simply recommending the proper line or space for a particular instrument. The main purpose was.... Here's something that works for every type of musical situation, let's just all adopt it and we'll be much better off.If you're looking for a book that HAS been and CONTINUES to be a standard for drumset notation, then this is the book. Check it out and you'll agree.Here's what Peter Erskine said about the book: \\"...I hope and recommend that ALL composers, arrangers, authors of pedagogical studies and drummers read, digest and use this long-awaited standard of drumset notation. Norm Weinberg has done contemporary music a great service with this book...\\"Here's what Ron Spagnardi (founder of Modern Drummer) said about the book: \\"After much research, Norm Weinberg has carefully refined and clarified the current, most common methods of drumset notation. If everyone who writes for drumset adopts these guidelines, the ambiguities inherent in much current drumset notation can be alleviated.\\"Here's what Joe LaBarbera (one of Jazz' top composers and arrangers) said about the book: \\"This book is a must for all arrangers and orchestrators. I wish this text had been around years ago when I was trying to make sense of the collective, 'hand-me-down' drum notation of the day. Let's have a big drum roll for Norm Weinberg!\\"Here's what George Gaber (percussion performer, educator, and PAS Hall of Fame recipient) said about the book: \\"Authors, publishers, composers and performers are now liberated to communicate in a common notational language. What a triumph to release us from the 'medieval' practice of slash marks with the term ad lib.\\""},{"Title":"Guide to Standardized Drumset Notation","review":"This is an excellent book that answered my questions about drum notation. I am a composer. I was confused about the various ways I've seen drums notated. I myself was using three different systems and wondered which I should settle on. I found my answer on page 29. There's no one particular way to do it, but several you can choose from and even switch between if you follow certain guidelines. Everything I would ever want to know about how to notate drums is here. The book is as thorough as I could possibly need. I'm so glad it's there to help people like me. Thanks Norman! This is a treasure."},{"Title":"Guide to Standardized Drumset Notation","review":"I see a few misinformed people are writing reviews for this book. Theta for example, who while trying to use big words to sound smart says \\"Insufficiently Authoritative\\" about Norm Weinberg, who is a hugely qualified and respected figure to composers, educators, drummers and percussionists around the world.The standards in the book reflect what is the most commonly done in the real world. Not sure what world Max and Theta are living in.Considering the reason for the previous lack of a standard in drumming notation, i.e. the endless customised drumkit setups one can potentially create, the book makes sense, because it not only addresses today's most common practices, but sets out guidelines that make sense when you consider larger or smaller drumsets.

We are supposed to show the bell of the ride symbol, for example, by actually drawing a ride cymbal and a stick pointing to the bell. This would be very difficult to accomplish by hand or even in engraved music and impossible with most notation software.2) Some of what the author demands is contrary to standard practice. He wants us to show the technique involving the butt of the stick hitting the rim while the tip of the stick rests against the drumhead with circles around the note-head, but the standard practice is to write an x in the snare space. (I think it a particularly bad idea to put a circle around a traditional note-head to show the above or, for that matter, to show anything else. I think this because in order for the circle actually to be seen, there has to be a gap between it and the note-head, which means that the combined symbol will take up more than a single space. So, for example, if you were to strike the above simultaneously with any of your three toms, you couldn't notate the result, at least not without making a mess. Circling an x, on the other hand, the most common method of showing the bell of the ride cymbal, works perfectly well because in this case there doesn't need to be a gap; the circle can touch the edges of the x.)3) The author does not address the problem of equivocal or ambiguous terminology. In fact, he contributes to the confusion by redefining \\"rim click\\" to mean \\"rim hit\\". The technique I described above--in 2)--, for example, is sometimes called rim shot or alternatively, rim click, cross stick, or side stick, among other names.4) The author does not provide notations for many very basic and common techniques such as, for example, stick shots or brush sweeps (stirring soup).Recommendation:This would have been much more useful if the author had listed common alternative notations with citations and approximate frequency and discussed them, rather than arbitrarily dictating to us. The book was published in 1998 and as of 2005 it is clear that his \\"standardization\\" has yet to be implemented--for very good reasons."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"I'm new to Plato. That should be said first. With that said, these are the things I have read: The Republic, Meno, Crito, Euthyphros, Symposium, Phaedo, Phaedrus and The Apology. With THAT said, you can appreciate, maybe, what I wanted to say about this book:Not all of those translations were in this book. Phaedrus was one good example of what was missing, and when I read that, I had read it in another book that I own, with the translator being Benjamin Jowett. I also read Jowetts translation of the Republic. After reading that translation, I came to this book, translated by Rouse.Hands down, Rouse takes the cake. I immediately noticed a difference in how easily the material is understood. Within the first ten pages of a reread of The Republic (and Symoposium and Apology), I could understand what was being presented far better than I could in the other translation. I had thought before that the material was difficult to understand, and in books like Phaedrus, it can seem so. What I discovered though, is that the material is only as difficult as the translators skill, or lack thereof, makes it. I know that some people have complained about how the material is 'anglicized' for the public, but I would think that this would be a good thing. Plato is from a different time and place than the mass of people living today (with only an elite few really having the full scope to understand everything needed to slog through Jowetts translation- I wasn't really one of them) and should be changed slightly to help accomodate those with the desire to understand him and the contributions he made.This book does that wonderfully. The annotations do a wonderful job of helping to explain what might seem vague. The quotation marks help to place dialogue in the (english) readers mind. The arrangement of the books is done in an order that makes sense, allowing a person to logically progress through the series of Platos' thought process. The material itself is something that every human being with a desire to learn should experience, and Rouse did a wonderful job of exacerbating that to the public at large.Bottom line: if you want to read Plato and don't have the time to earn a degree in ancient Hellenistic culture first, then pick up this translation. Also ignore the detractors that might think this way of seeing the ancient Greek as too 'tainted', they're just jealous because Plato is now accessible to everyone in this book."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"For those who do not know, Plato was Socrates' preeminent student. The dialogues are treatises on various interesting questions, such as what is love, virtue, etc.... The style of the texts are based on the Socratic method of asking questions and use of analogy to test an hypothesis. This gives the texts the style of mysteries as you follow the twists and turns of the arguments to get to the conclusion. Socrates is often the protagonist guiding the reader so it also gives the texts a sense of biography.This collection contains probably the best works, and Rouse's translation is clear and easy to read. Enjoyable, entertaining, mind-opening."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"Love him or hate him (and there are plenty who feel both ways), Plato is essential reading for anyone interested in Western thought. So much so that A. N. Whitehead made the famous, if controversial, comment that \\"all of philosophy is but a series of footnotes to Plato.\\" Even if that's a bit over the top, Plato is still simply one of those \\"must reads,\\" for philosophy in particular, and for the humanities in general. Plato raised questions about virtue, justice, love, government, god, society, epistemology and metaphysics that we still wrestle with today, and his answers, for better or worse, have greatly impacted our culture and history.If you're new to Plato, this edition is a good start. I've had my copy of the Great Dialogues of Plato-now dog-eared, scribbled in, and Scotch-taped together-since I first wrestled with the Apology and the Republic in my high school humanities class. These are hardly Plato's only dialogues, but they are arguably the most important, especially for general students. Rouse's translations are highly readable. He captures the flavor of what Plato wanted to say and how he wanted to say it, without sounding antiquated or artificially modern.It's worth noting that this edition does not present the dialogues in the order in which Plato probably wrote them, but in the order which seems to represent the unfolding of the particular events described. Thus, the Apology, Crito and Phaedo-describing the trial and death of Socrates-come together at the end, even though the Apology was one of the first dialogues written by Plato, and the Phaedo was among his middle dialogues. This is important because earlier dialogues are probably more representative of Plato's teacher, Socrates, while later dialogues reflect increasingly Platonic thinking, even though Plato continued to use \\"Socrates\\" as a character. The Socratic ethics of the Apology and Crito, for instance, seem sharply at odds with the ethics of the Republic, probably Plato's most complete and representative work.So you might want to read the dialogues in the following order: Apology, Crito, and Ion, for roughly Socratic thought; Meno and Phaedo, for transitional dialogues; and Symposium and Republic for solidly Platonic thinking. Of course, there is no universal agreement on the order of Plato's dialogues, nor as to which represents whose views most faithfully.As for drawbacks to this edition, there are no introductions to the individual dialogues, Rouse's general \\"Preface\\" is short and weak, and the standardized reference numbers to the original Greek pages are only summarized at the top of odd pages, instead of given as line-by-line annotations, which makes cross-referencing a chore. (Because of the lack of introductions, you should read at least an article or two on Socrates and Plato from any general history of philosophy.) Nonetheless, I like Rouse's translations, and the edition is worthy of five stars despite its shortcomings. I still refer to my banged up copy, which I'll keep on my bookshelf as long as the pages hold together."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"There is no point in trying to detract from the works of Plato themselves; anyone who is buying a collection of his dialogues is already convinced of his preeminence in Western philosophy.This translation, however, is honestly lousy, and it surprises me how well it seems to have been received. Though I have some training in philosophy (an undergraduate degree) I'm certainly not an ancient philosophy expert, and I found no difficulty in reading Jowett, and I imagine the average reader approaching Plato would not either. Rouse's modus operandus appears to be to make Plato \\"accessible\\"--to a fault, I think. Whatever gains are made in clarity are more than countered by the awkwardness of the text and frequent anachronisms. To illustrate, here are two quotes from the first dialogue included, Ion:\\"Socrates: I'm glad to hear it, Ion, for it is clear you won't mind giving me a show.Ion: I will most certainly. You'll find it a treat to hear, Socrates, how finely I have decked out Homer! I believe I've earned a golden crown from the Homer Association.\\"What Rouse awkwardly translates as \\"Homer Association\\"--which sounds like a group of middle-aged men who get together every Wednesday to bowl and drink, or something--is preserved in Jowett's text as Homeridae, a group of ancient Greek Homeric scholars. How this could be confusing, especially with a simple footnote, is beyond me.Second:\\"Ion: When someone speaks about any other poet, I can't attend. I can't put in one single remark to the point, I'm just in a doze--but only mention Homer and I'm wide awake in a jiffy . . .\\"The term \\"jiffy\\" is so anachronistic and silly that it really distracts the reader from the flow of the text. I cannot possibly understand why Rouse thought this was a good word to use here.These are just some examples. All translations of Plato that I've encountered have some anachronism--Socrates quotes Latin phrases in Jowett, for example--but there is and should be a limit, and I think it's obvious that Rouse exceeds that limit."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"I did not know it was such a good read as I have never touched any classical literature until someone recommended that I read Plato to start with. The translation is excellent. The plot is exciting. It certainly adds a new dimension to thinking about life subject matters."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"The translation and collection is admirable, but the quality of this Signet paperback I received is very cheap looking. For some reason it just seems crammed and most pages seem like they are typed in bold and others normal. Sometimes there will be a diagonal bolding of a page (like a line of bold going through from top left to bottom right) to the point where an \\"a\\" will have the entire bottom filled in. Not sure if I got a bad copy, but this isn't something I've ever noticed in a book before. This also makes some of the footnotes hard to read because they are even smaller so a \\"w\\" is all filled in and looks like an upside down triangle with the tip cut off."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"This book is the older version of this book:Great Dialogues of Plato (Signet Classics). This older version is a little book, and that means that it takes a little bit of effort to hold the book open when the sentence gets close to the spine. (You know how it is with little books, how you have to pry them open to read all of the sentence.) But it is a good translation. Either this older version or the new one would be a good purchase. I would suggest that, in addition to this book, you also get another translation. If you have two different translations, you can go to your backup when you don't understand something in the text. It's really a great way to understand tough passages, and since old books are so cheap on Amazon, it's an easy thing to do.This book contains a short preface (about 2 pages). In the back of the book, they decided to stick in the Greek alphabet! It's pretty interesting that they did that. Also, there is a pronunciation index, although I couldn't understand it. It seemed muddled to me. Anyway, it's a good little book, but probably not a version that you would keep forever."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"Where do I begin? These dialogues of Plato encompass the early beginings of philosophy from arguements of love to arguements of justice and education. Even if you are not a true philosophy at heart, the shear talent of Socrates twisting his opponents gives enough warrant to read. I will admit, the book is not an easy task, so take it slow, and digest the material. And you will walk away from the book with an increased knowledge of wisdom."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"I was looking for Jowett's translation of 'The Republic'. I couldn't find it, so I bought this one.'The Republic' is, quite simply, the greatest book produced by the Western civilisation. It has everything in it: metaphysics, ethics, epistemology, logic, aesthetics and politics. Someone said that Western philosophy began with Plato and ended with Aristotle. He was wrong; it began and ended with Plato.The book is best known for its noble idea that philosophers should be kings. The authoritarian system that Plato proposes to ensure this may not be desirable or feasible (Democracy is here to stay). But the course of study and training that he prescribes for the philosopher-king can certainly be taken to heart by those who want to serve their countries.There are strong parallels with the Bhagavad Gita. Plato's vision of a three-class society (philosophers, warriors, masses) mirrors the original Aryan society (Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas). His division of the primary tendencies corresponds with the modes of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. Above all, his definition of justice (each doing his own thing) is identical with the concept of Swadharma.The translation is adequate. Plato is supposed to be the greatest Greek prose writer, and one of the greatest in the world. That doesn't exactly show in Rouse's version. But Jowett may be too outdated for today's readers.A useful summary is provided for each book of 'The Republic'."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"Beautiful translation, the timeless texts of Plato -but delivered in tiny print without many notes.

I found that the Rouse edition of Plato is actually closer to the original Greek than various other translations.

Still, a nice big hardcover edition would be more impressive on the bookshelf..."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"There is little to say about this publication that has already been stated. However, I would like to point out that the inclusion of 'Ion' is a bit baffling. I would not classify it a 'great' dialogue in the vein of even other early works by Plato, e.g. the 'Protagoras', 'Phaedrus' or 'Euthyphro', and certainly does not match up to the 'Timaeus', 'Parmenides', or 'Theaetetus', all of which could have just as well earned a place in this compilation. Its inclusion is perhaps justifiable to provide new readers with a quick 'introductory' dialogue to acquaint themselves with the Socratic process, but one would ask why the publishers would try to grab readers this way: shouldn't the dialogues speak for themselves?Regardless, the translation and annotation is excellent for the beginning and intermediate reader of Plato, and Signet books are typically of high material quality to begin with, so this may be the best paperback Plato on the market."},{"Title":"Great Dialogues of Plato","review":"Needed this for my philosophy class, and this book is very practical to have.

They become friends until someone murders Darleen's Aunt Clara. Though the case is not solved, everyone blames Eli's dad forcing the Wades to leave town.Twenty-five years later Darl, a defense attorney for the downtrodden, and Eli, a very successful reformed gambler, meet again in her hometown. Though still in love, but adult style, Clara's murder keeps Darl and Eli from a permanent relationship. In front of him, she digs up her aunt's grave that she helped dug twenty-five years ago so that Eli can learn the truth.STONE FLOWER GARDEN is filled with twists and turns so that each time the audience feels they grasp the tale, a new angle appears. This gives the story line extra oomph so that the reader has more than just a steamy southern romance. Though the era seems wrong to contain the southern dynasties that ruled one-company towns, the charm and angst of the lead characters manage to overcome that counter-anachronism. Deborah Smith provides her audience with a four-tissue box tearjerker that never eases off the high emotional tension of the plot until the climax.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"Hmmmm. I have no idea why this book was in my TBR pile. As far as I can tell, the only thing I've read by Deborah Smith previously is the first two or three Mossy Creek anthologies, and I doubt I'd have bought a book based on that.Darleen Union and Eli Wade meet as children when the town princess defends the dirt-poor newcomer from bullies. Darl's family owns the Hardigree marble company, which owns the town, and when Darl's grandmother, the matriarch, learns about the Wades, she gives Eli's father a job, and the family a house to live in. When Eli's mathematical genius becomes evident, she puts him to work, too, training him and offering him an education.Darl and Eli become close friends, and as they grow up, the friendship shows signs of developing into something more. Then Darl's aunt Clara, the black sheep of the family, arrives and makes everyone nervous and upset until she's killed and Eli's father is blamed, and the family leaves town in disgrace.Twenty-five years later, they're reunited when Eli's sister is determined to find out who really killed Clara, and to clear their father's name. In the process, a lot of secrets people have killed to keep are revealed.This is a very intensely emotional story, and one that's quite easy to get caught up in. The deep friendships, and the heavy weight of secrets permeate the story from the beginning. The characters are wrenched with guilt and shame, torn by love, and tend to waver between tyranny an martyrdom.Ultimately, it got to be a bit much for me. I enjoyed the story and the emotional ride up to a point, then I hit emotional overload, and I just wanted it to be over. I admit I have a low tolerance for emotional intensity, so YMMV.I'll probably look for more Deborah Smith books, though--I like reading something intense and complex like this, just not all that frequently."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"Years ago I read Blue Willow.

Strongly written characters. Real, believable characters.It's a roller coaster ride from innocence... murder... a harsh reality... deaths... a burden on everyone... they carry that burden for twenty-five years and it shapes the adults the children grow up to be. There is great joy mixed with great sorrow. And it includes the joy and pain of being family... when things aren't always as they seem to be.Mystery, murder, silence... a search for the truth... this roller coaster of a book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"I would say this is more of a mystery than a love story with a fairy tale ending. Definetly, the darker side of love . It has an interesting plot, with twists and turns that keeps you going. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"I cannot figure out how Deborah Smith does it. Every single book she writes tugs at the heart, makes you laugh, makes you yearn to be part of the world she creates.She NEVER disappoints. She sucks you in at all levels."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"I recently read some other books by Deborah Smith (Crossroads Cafe series) and really liked them for the character development and plot twists and humor. When I saw this one, I thought why not? I am glad I did download this Kindle freebie. I was pleased with it, and although it took a bit of reading to get into it, I couldn't put it down and really enjoyed it. I would have liked to see Darl have more happier moments in her life as an adult. She was always so sad and bitter about the past, reasonably so. I loved the sense of family and tradition in all the branches of family. It doesn't have too much cussing, and just a handful of mild sex scenes. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"This was the first book I read by Deborah Price and I will probably read more. This was an excellent book, the story of Darl Union and Eli Wade and the secrets of a past that happened before they were born.The story flowed well and I liked all of the characters, I thought there were nicely fleshed out and their motives didn't seem far fetched. At first I was a little confused when the narrative switched from first to third person, but I didn't notice it after a while and even looked forward to the switch. It was a great way to see how Darl and Eli viewed their situation.The only complaints I really have are: that everything is known to the reader except how Eli and Darl will resolve the secrets between them; and that the second part of the book is slightly ridiculous.Eli finds Darl after 25 years; she doesn't know who he is, he doesn't tell her, romance ensues. His identity is revealed and she must deal with the secret. But the reader is already privy to all of this information, there is no reading to find out the answers. After the conclusion of the first part of the book, these events are set in motion and you are reading simply to see how things resolve, like watching a movie.I would have liked it better if some things, like the secret between Eli and Darl, were not revealed so early in the book but in a more gradual way.I liked that there were no loose ends and everything was wrapped up neatly but looked toward the future."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"Reviewed by Kristie Leigh Maguire ...The pale pink marble buildings glistened in the sunlight shining through the shadows of the North Carolina mountains like some fairy tale city ' or perhaps it was a little slice of heaven that had descended to earth upon the wings of fairies. The Wade family, pushed almost beyond endurance, gazed down upon the vision with awe. They had never seen anything like it in all the poor existence of their lives.The two little girls, who could have passed for sisters except that one was a little pink white girl and the other was a little pink honey girl, stood in front of the Hardigree Marble Showcase watching the little raggedy family walk into town pushing the old beat up truck packed with their belongings. The truck, with pots and pans and household belongings hanging from every nook and cranny, stopped in front of the Hardigree Marble Showcase ' and the two little girls. The little pink white girl had never seen anything like it in all her protected pink existence. The dirty little boy standing by the beat up old truck glared at her, daring her to laugh at him.The town of Burnt Creek, North Carolina was built from the beautiful pale pink marble dug from beneath the ground surrounding the town. But the pale pink marble had a dusky dark rose streak running through it. Some things are best left uncovered - or are they?Deborah Smith has created a world that draws you in and won't let you go. It is a world that is full of twists and turns and the haunted past of not only the little pink white girl but of her ancestors as well. Stone Flower Garden is a mystery yet it is a fine love story as well.

In fact, had this been the first book I had ever read by her, I would have struck her off my \\"Authors to look for\\" list entirely. The book is predictable, banal and I struggled to get through to the last page.

The plot of the book is typical Smith: girl and boy meet at a young age...boy and girl get seperated at a young age...and meet again when they are adults and reconnect emotionally and romantically.

Her only friends are Karen, the maid's daughter, and Eli, whose family lives on her land.At age 10, a series of questionable deaths leads to the separation of the friends, until Swan suffers a heart attack 25 years later.This novel is written in a strong first person voice, shifting from Darl's first person POV and Eli's 3rd person POV. The author masterfully shifts from a child, to adult voice when Darl and Eli reach adulthood.Smith has created complex, three dimensional, flawed characters that we root for, even when their actions are less than honorable.This is the first book I've read from Smith, but it won't be the last."},{"Title":"The Stone Flower Garden: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed reading Stone Flower Garden and hoping for the best from the characters.

I've been in the sex trade ever since college, and found the book to be absolutely insightful and fascinating. It is NOT a &quot;a suger-coated [sic] way of talking about prostitution&quot;, but a very accurate representation of the business--at least for those among us who choose to be empowered rather than exploited. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone considering entering the sex trade, or to anyone curious about the reality of sex work."},{"Title":"Live Sex Acts: Women Performing Erotic Labor","review":"For anyone who hasn't enjoyed this book, all I can say is that you probably haven't met many of the women whose stories are cited in here. I have, and I find them well represented. Chapkis doesn't drown out their voices the way so many other scholars have. She begins by tracing the debates concerning sex work, which is helpful for people new to the topic. She then develops her own argument (see editor's review) and concludes with a personal story on how she discovered her own sexual pleasure. I found it informative and touching, even though I've been doing similar field work on sex workers for the past four years."},{"Title":"Live Sex Acts: Women Performing Erotic Labor","review":"The intro to this book presents a clear, concise account of contemporary feminist perspectives on sex work, ranging from the adamantly anti to the decidedly pro (no pun intended).

It contains many interviews, but they are all bascially the same. The issues are all the same, the interviews are all the same and the debates are all the same. The erotic labor performed by the women mentioned in this book is nothing we all don't already know about, so this book is not telling us anything new or even interesting.

It talks about women performing different sex acts-WOW! These women don't perform anything that most married women perform, only difference is, they are performing these sex acts with total strangers! It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that erotic labor can be complex, downgraded by society or considered by some people as prostitution, but in this day and age, everything is pretty much acceptable. The book contains about 50 interviews with men and women in the sex industry, all which give basically the same story, the same experiences, the same gains and the same regrets. I read this book hoping to get some useful insight into the adult industry, but I didn't. The book talks about sex acts that, we are not only familiar with, but as adult people we too perform these sexual acts, just not in front of a screen.

Endeavoring always to avoid lewdness and unseemliness, the author, John Cleland, is endlessly creative and expressive in the euphemisms he uses to maintain propriety. His dialog is ever so correct, in keeping with the times and style of his day and in contrast with the rogues, reprobates and strumpets who populate his novel. He gingerly handles the most common and indecent situations with delicacy and refinement. His vocabulary and sentence structure, certainly old-fashioned nowadays, are a rich and delicious banquet for contemporary readers. If his style seems a bit stiff, it is certainly in keeping with his subject.Cleland never fails to amuse, and he certainly conjured up some good laughs on my part.The novel is written by a man from a woman's point of view--something I always find interesting."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"Forget the story or the quality of the writing, I have to warn you NOT TO BUY this edition of the book! The pages are low quality, it's put together very cheaply, and worst of all...THERE ARE NO PARAGRAPHS! That's right, the text all runs together in one long block. This is shabby treatment for a piece of classic literature. Very disappointing. Will have to look elsewhere now that I've returned my copy."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"This was a very entertaining read, as much to do with the way it is written than with the content... Loved it!"},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"Maybe it's because I don't think it's particularly newsworthy that people in the 18th century had sex (after all there wouldn't have been people the 19th, 20th, or 21st centuries, otherwise, and lots of the other 18th century novels and quite a few of the poems give the secret away). And I'm not saying, \\"Don't read Fanny Hill,\\" because it is an interesting read once, as interesting to read as any 18th century tale that's purely about sex would be. But it's not high literary art--while entertaining to read once, it's really little more than a picaresque sex tale, clearly designed for men to read, moving from one incident to another with a \\"reforming\\" ending tacked on. The plot setup is totally unrealistic and perfunctory--i mean, would any woman in any century ever write down her sexual activity in such detail to send to another woman to read as memoirs?? As a novel, it pales in comparison to any of the other myriad 18th century works that feature sex as a plot element (e.g., Defoe's Moll Flanders, Fielding's Tom Jones, Matthew Lewis's The Monk, de Laclos' Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and so forth). The difference between those works and this one isn't just the explicitness, it's the fact that in those other works the sex serves a purpose in a larger plot. They may not get into the size of their characters' \\"machines\\" but they're simply better, more entertaining books over the long haul. So I'd say check this one out from your public library (it's all right, no one will suspect its contents!) and spend your money to feast on Tom Jones and his late night \\"conversations\\" instead."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"...Even if it seems like it isn't, it really is.

How can anyone give less then 5 stars to a classic of its stature...especially such a classic with so many naughty bits. Of course it was written by a man...geez guys look at the first author on the list. Ok ok so maybe the 5th time you hear Fanny rapsodize about &quot;from his prodigious size I feared he would rip me asunder&quot; it starts to get a bit old (or maybe not for some), but on the other hand, this is the erotica everyone grew up on before the days of xrated magazines. Just think...a naughty book your grandmother couldn't disaprove of...she probably read it too."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"This book is fascinating, not merely as an erotic novel (and the historical significance of this book cannot be denied) but also as a glimpse of society and mores of the mid-18th century.Fanny is an orphaned girl who goes to London to Seek Her Fortune and ends up with a career alternating between prostitution and being a kept woman. Unlike most porn, she's not always happy about her sexual encounters, and there are times when she's heartbroken over a lost love. She's decieved by a woman who claims to be hiring her \\"as a companion,\\" in a another scene she's exploited by a money-hungry landlord.As she grows older, though, Fanny becomes more in charge of her sexuality and more open to exploration. We, as readers, also see a glimpse of 18th-century prostitution and the demimonde of kept mistresses (which many wealthy men of the period kept).Hardly a rollicking farce (there are times when sex has serious consequences) but at times it is humorous. Never crass or vulgar, but nevertheless explicit, this bawdy gem is worth checking out. Fanny is always honest about herself and what she does to survive, and pulls no punches. (I took away a star because, at times, it is difficult going because of the outdated language, but don't let that deter you.)"},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"I was astonished when I read the book. It is really erotic and therefore a real book of this century. And it is filled with all the ingredients you need to have a successful book; drama, despair, love and sex.

The author can makes you sizzle with every sentence without using one vulgar word. Most incredible! A master of the English Language."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"I have just finished reading Fanny Hill, and I was really surprised at just how explicit the novel was! I was expecting a story that made much of a few kisses behind the pantry door or a bared ankle or two, but I was certainly wrong about that.Cleland manages to write a steamy story without ever being crass or resorting to using filthy language to get a reaction. It's hard to belive that it was published in 1749. Everything about the people in the novel seems so modern and no one ever thinks that the people of Cleland's time even had thoughts or lives like he describes.Yet this novel has it's problems too.The plot is an old one, young innocent country girl goes to the big city to seek her fortune and falls in the hands of some disreputable people. It's a story that's as old as the profession the book is about. At one point in the novel I wondered if maybe the people who wrote the script for Pretty Woman had been reading Fanny Hill for plot ideas.Cleland starts a very nice love story for our heroine, but then it fades out for most of the novel and returns without warning or explanation at the end. In fact, the end of the novel seemed rushed in this readers opinion, and rendered the whole story a bit silly. Not to mention a couple of holes in the plot that are big enough to drive a Mack truck through.Overall, it's a good book, and should be read if for no other reason than to see for yourself just how erotic it really is. No matter what expectations you have when you pick the book up, it will surprise you, and probably pleasantly so."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"I have always been rather fond of this work. Not only is it well written, in a Victorian way, but it is a very nice \\"dirty book\\" to boot. There is never really anything crass or gross in the book, the author's use of the language sees to that. The story is certainly realistic, there is humor and a certain sadness all at one time. I am old enough to be able to remember when this particular work was not available in the United States. Thank goodness those days are over. We did miss a lot of purely good writing in those days. I am not at all sure if this one is appropriate for a High School Lit. class, but is certainly worth the read and the study for the more mature reader. On the other hand, the work is certainly a lot less graphic than some of the material the kids have ready access at any time. All in all I have to recommend this one. It is interesting and certainly gives us a good lesson in writing."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"I can easily understand why this book was banned for a long time. It is...explicit. But because it was written 2 centuries ago, the descriptions are far from crass and you have to read some sections twice to make sure that what you thought just happened really did happen.That having been said, I think this book is a classic, and not just a literary \\"curiosity\\" for one simple reason: it portrays sex as something good despite the fact that Fanny is clearly repentant of her past ways. I went into this book expecting a tale of woe, but that aspect of it was only weakly attempted. In short: promiscuity is undesirable, but the sexual act itself is not some kind of horrible sin. This is surprising for a book written in that time, and thus breaks certain boundaries which make it worth reading."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"Question: What does John Cleland have in common with D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Aristophanes?Answer: The Comstock LawAll four writers (and a host of others) have had their novels banned in USA for years under the Comstock Law of 1873. Officially known as the Federal Anti-Obscenity Act, this law banned the mailing of &quot;lewd&quot;, &quot;indecent&quot;, &quot;filthy&quot;, or &quot;obscene&quot; materials. The Comstock laws, while now to some extent unenforced, remain for the most part on the statute books today. The Telecommunications Reform Bill of 1996 even specifically applies some of these outdated and outmoded laws to computer networks (without much success, it is noted).So what's my message here? Simple - if we continue to allow censors to dictate what we can and cannot read, we stand the chance of being robbed of some of the world's finest written works - and we're not talking exceptions here. Consider, for example Candide, Voltaire's critically hailed satire - Jean-Jacques Rousseau's autobiography Confessions - Chaucer's Canterbury Tales - Boccaccio's Decameron - Defoe's Moll Flanders, and various editions of The Arabian Nights. All were banned at various times in the US. That noble book 'Ulysses' by James Joyce was recently selected by the Modern Library as the best novel of the 20th century yet, like Aristophanes' Lysistrata, Cleland's 'Fanny Hill' and Lawrence's 'Lady Chatterley', it was banned for decades from the U.S.Fanny Hill is no longer distinguished for the once-shocking treatment of the sexual activity of one 'loose' woman. Now that we're used to hearing and reading about sex, it's apparent that the novel is memorable for better reasons: namely, that Cleland was a masterful writer whose intelligent descriptions take us bodily into the world of his characters. The book's moderate language on an immoderate subject make it a unique, original work - a triumph of passion and eroticism over sterility.The next time you hear that something has been censored, question whether it is really to protect public morals (where the pornography of senseless war, and starvation appear to be more acceptable than freedom of sexuality), or whether it is to protect the censors' own frustrated identities! Fanny Hill is yet another powerful reminder that all the censors have ever succeeded in doing is to ban outstanding literature in the name of public morality."},{"Title":"Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (Victorian erotic classics)","review":"This is perhaps the most elegantly written erotic novel of all time. Considering that it was written by a man, but from the female character's point of view, it is curious to think that all these luscious descriptions of the male body could be mistaken for Cleland's own opinions."},{"Title":"Government in America: People, Politics and Policy with LP.com access card (10th Edition)","review":"This book edition is a little different than what we needed but it worked out just fine.

I know I bought models of the &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; several times and it was not until about ten years ago that I finally got to not only see but climb inside an actual Flying Fortress, only to be amazed at how small these bombers actually were. That becomes an important fact when reading &quot;Mission Number 52,&quot; the opening chapter of Stephen W. Sears' book on &quot;Air War Against Hitler's Germany&quot; for the American Heritage Junior Library. The story of the 52nd mission flown by the U.S. Eighth Air Force was a raid on the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory at Bremen in northwestern Germany. Sears details the entire mission, from the pre-dawn briefing, to the bomb run over Bremen, to the finally tally of how many American bombers did not return from Mission 52.Sears presents Mission 52 as providing his readers with both the promise and the problems of the American air offensive against Hitler's Nazi Germany and the controversial policy of daylight precision bombing; after all, the Luftwaffe's attempt to use daylight bombing during the Battle of Britain had not succeeded. After a thorough explanation of the debate over the theory, Sears provides a look at what the Germans were doing to defend the Third Reich. Other chapters are devoted to the famous raid on the oil refineries at Ploesti, the &quot;Autumn Crisis&quot; of the American daylight bombing offensive, and the P-51 Mustangs and other American fighters that served as &quot;Little Friends&quot; to the bombers. The final chapter details the victory that was won in the air, despite German advances in creating the first jet aircraft, and covers the fire-bombing of Dresden, which becomes the European theater equivalent of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with three RAF and American raids doing what it took one atomic bomb to do to a city in Japan.The editors of this book take a dual perspective, that the air war over Europe proved to be more that Billy Mitchell and other advocates of air power had ever conceived, and that from a contemporary perspective these lumbering propeller-driven bombers carrying payloads of &quot;conventional&quot; bombs are considered obsolete. However, in this interesting volume Sears shows exactly what they accomplished to win the war in Europe. This book is not only illustrated with historic photographs taken during World War II, including combat photographs, but also by paintings and sketches done by American, British, and German artists. &quot;Air War Against Hitler's Germany&quot; is not a comprehensive look at what the 8th Air Force accomplished, but it certainly covers the main points with enough depth and insight to make reading it well worth the effort for young students interested in the subject. For older readers it is a reminder what the &quot;Memphis Bell,&quot; which I finally got to see on display at Mud Island, and thousands of other Flying Fortresses and Liberators accomplished during World War II."},{"Title":"Air war against Hitler's Germany, (American heritage junior library)","review":"This is a great book, very well written and a joy to read. It was the book I continually checked out when I was in middle school in the late 1960's. I recently bought my own copy on the internet, and it brought back pleasant memories."},{"Title":"Air war against Hitler's Germany, (American heritage junior library)","review":"\\"Air War Against Hitler's Germany\\" by Stephen W. Sears.Simon & Schuster, New York, 1964 & 2004.The famous author, Stephen W. Sears (\\"Landscape Turned Red\\", 2003), has produced a concise history of the air war against Nazi Germany. The author's emphasis is on the USAAF Eighth Air Force, which flew out of England against the Nazi Occupied continent. The very first chapter, \\"Mission Number 52\\", recounts the first real mission that the Eighth Air force had against Nazi Germany: the bombing of the Focke Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen, April 17 1943. From then on, the author retraces the history of air war, how the RAF took over the night while the USAAF took on daylight \\"precision\\" bombing. The book builds up to the build-up of thousand aircraft raids, the fire storms in cities such as Hamburg and the need for fighter escort for the daylight American attacks.The author likes (in my humble opinion) the B17 Flying Fortress more than the less \\"pretty\\" B24 Liberator, and he provides much detail about the development and general workings of the B17, how the aircraft is started and taken off from an airfield, the B17 ability to fight off fighters, and the ability of the B17 aircraft to carry bomb load. Having said this, I point out one of the most interesting chapters is Chapter 4, (page 45), entitled \\"Target: Ploesti\\". The raid on Ploesti was flown by B24 Liberators (for a single book that addresses the Ploesti raid, see, \\"Into The Fire: Ploesti\\" by Duane Schultz).The importance of fighter escort for the bombers is presented in Chapter 6, \\"Little Friends\\"; this chapter is a concise summary of the impact of P51 Mustang and its ability to prevent the German Luftwaffe from interfering with the American Air Force's bombing of Nazi Germany. In fact, this small book (only 124 pages) is a concise summary of the air war in Europe, the pros and cons of the bomber war and the highlights of the actual events. The paper back that I borrowed from the library was profusely illustrated with black & white photos of the B17 in action, the insides of the bomber itself and action-torn aircraft."},{"Title":"Air war against Hitler's Germany, (American heritage junior library)","review":"Am glad to see this old American Heritage Junior Library book in a reprint addition - it's a classic.As other reviewers have pointed out, the writing is particularly clear and well-structured, but I would like to call to attention that the book contains great illustrations by war artists such as Peter Hurd, Floyd Davis, John Lavalle, et. al.Whether you pick up the new addition or find a dog-eared original copy at a yard sale, Air War Against Hitler's Germany is a good introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Air war against Hitler's Germany, (American heritage junior library)","review":"I think I first picked up a copy of this book from my school's library when I was about eight years old. It was one of a series of books in the American Heritage Junior Library, all intended for young readers, but completely suitable for the adult reader as well. Because it was aimed at a young audience, it is very readable, and it would be an ideal introduction for a novice who is interested in learning more about the subject of the European Air War.At the same time, I think even a reader who is well-versed in the subject would find a lot to enjoy here. A while back, the book was reprinted in a paperback edition, but I would strongly recommend that anyone who is thinking of buying the book should go out and find a used copy of the original hardback edition like the one that was carried in school libraries. The original version contains a wealth of photographs and wartime art which enhance the story infinitely. We tend to think of adult books as being primarily narrative with perhaps a few photos thrown in. This is a shame, because all of the illustrations in books like this one make them so much more enjoyable.There was a whole series of these American Heritage Junior Library books, and a related series called \\"Horizon Caravel\\" books (which were not in the strictest sense related to American subjects.) I believe they were predominately published in the early to mid-1960's. They all followed the same pattern of providing an excellent text along with related art and photographs. They were of universally high quality, but for some reason they disappeared off library shelves years ago. I can only speculate as to the reason for this. Perhaps they were not \\"PC\\" enough. In any event, they are easily obtained through Amazon and on ebay. I obtained a fairly complete set when my kids were young, but ended up being the primary reader. Although I wish my kids had more interest in these books, I still came out well as the books were not expensive and they provide great reading.I'd guess that many present-day historians cut their teeth on these great books. This book is one of my favorites, and if you have not read it, do yourself a favor and dig up a copy. I suspect that once you do you will soon be looking for the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Air war against Hitler's Germany, (American heritage junior library)","review":"Very good for young adults to learn about the WW2 bombing campaigns against germany."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"PHARMAKO-DYNAMIS and PHARMAKO-POEIA by Dale Pendell contain much of interest to gardeners, artists, historians, drug counselors, and drug users. Pendell suggests that how a plant substance is defined (poison, drug, medicine) depends on the dosage, length of use, and intent of the user. In other words, if plant-based drugs are \\"abused\\" the problem lies not in our plants but in our selves. He says the reader can begin anywhere in either of his two books and arrive at the same place. I read PHARMAKO-POEIA last, not because it isn't interesting, but because coffee, tea, and cocao are covered in DYNAMIS. As a tea drinker, I wanted to find out more about my herb of choice before I ventured onto others.POEIA includes a wonderful section on Absinthe which may be related to the seduction of angels. Students of 19th Century French art history and the Belle Epoch know about Absinthe. Absinthe is that lovely green substance the Impressionist painters liked to portray, which according to some was the devil's own drink (he being a fallen angel). Wilde was fond of Absinthe, and may have been using it when he wrote \\"The Portrait of Dorian Grey.\\" On the other hand, it may have been his drug of choice when he developed his witty and amusing stage plays. Readers associated with Lewis' Screwtape Letters will recognize Absinthe's plant name-Wormwood. Wormwood was probably the bitter herb offered Christ in his last hour of agony and Revelations 8:10,11 has something to say about it. Artemisia is Wormwood's proper name, and the Greek Artemisia is the Roman Diana, Goddess of the Moon. Pendell says Oberon uses \`Dian's bud' to reverse the effects of a love potion in A Midsummer Night's Dream. What was Shakespeare thinking??Besides Artemisia and Valerian, Pendell discusses a few other suspect plants I grow in my own garden, such as Papaver, the Opium Poppy. Oh the feds tried to ban it once, but all the little old ladies came after them and Poppy reigns supreme in American cottage gardens. According to Pendell, the worldwide persecution of the Poppy plant continues even though Poppy plants (and Cannabis) have killed far fewer people than tobacco plants. This is wonderful wise book for crafty gardeners and their friends."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"I've read a lot of books on herbalism, but this series of books is a unique and extremely valuable find. Dale Pendell covers a wide variety of herbs and their affects on the human mind, body and spirit. What makes his book different from others is the poetic way in which he conveys his information. It makes reading the books far from dull or dry, and some herbal books read like medical textbooks in that sense. The authors brilliance, wisdom and sheer depth and bredth of knowledge shines through in this series, and I can't think of any other books that cover the \\"poisonous\\" herbs and substances in such a way. Read Pharmako/Poeia and you will probably want to buy Pharmako/Dynamis and Pharmako/Gnosis. They are all valuable to the herbalist, folklorist, entheobotanist, or anyone who just wants to know about the uses and side effects of various plants that are often stigmatized in our culture. Subjects range from:OpiumMarjuanaAlcohol (beer, wine, distilled spirits)AbsintheSalviaTobaccoNitrousKava KavaAnd even, fossil fuel.But don't think that he advocates the use (or abuse) of all these plants. He gives you the information, what they do, their history, and side effects. You will find no propaganda or scare tactics, just the truth (and the truth of what some of these plants can do is scary enough without embellishment!)Another plus of these books: They're aesthetically pleasing. I honestly can't think of any problems with this series of books: Informative, accurate and beautiful. Dale Pendell is an asset to the herbalist community."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"Dale Pendell brings together the magic and mystery of plant intelligence and the poison path. He taps into the ancient wisdom that human beings have developed as human beings from their close association with plant intelligence and plant body. A long time associate of Gary Snyder and the other poets of the San Francisco Bay area Pendell is a major voice in his own right. He weaves the magic of his verse deeply into the stream of consciousness flowing through his work and takes the reader, like the plants he discusses, into worlds that themselves change consciousness. A tremendous work in the field."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"I am an herbalist, and I found this book by Pendell and Snyder to be full of information that was presented in a fascinating way. Interestingly, finding information about herbal poisons isn't as easy as it might seem, but is still important. I can honestly say I learned a few things from this book that I did not realize, particularly from a historical standpoint! I can't wait to get my hands on the other two volumes as soon as they become available - however I have been waiting for almost a year for the promised second and third volumes of the book. I am hoping that the publisher or author can give us a firmer lead time for their final release."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"All medicine is poison, and all poisons have some medicinal quality to them. \\"Pharmako/Poeia\\" is a scientific AND poetic exploration of common and uncommon plant poisons for the magician/alchemist. Pendell explains how nicotine is similar to acetylcholine (part of why it is chemically addictive--- it is spookily similar to neurotransmitters in the brain); he offers transphysical images for certain plants (Salvia divinorum, for example, vibrates to the quantum signature of Shrodinger's Wave Equation); as well as mystical and religious points (wine's Tarot card is the High Priestess, its Humour is phlegmatic). Highly recommended if you're into alchemy, poetry, and pharmacology. Avoid if you're seeking an easy high. As Pendell himself says, \\"If you can't kick a tobacco habit you are no doctor, and had best not proceed.\\" Five stars, but don't look for the companion volume any time soon. The publisher, Mercury House, has been promising its availability in the \\"next few months\\" for five years now.Covered poisons: Mad River Plant, Bulrush, Tobacco, Pituri, Alcohol, Aether, Absinthe, Cale zacatechichi, Opium, Kava Kava, Salvia divinorum, Marijuana, Nitrous Oxide. Beware: here be dragons.Update 3/8/2003: \\"Pharmako/Dynamis\\" is now available.

The only difficulty so far has been waiting for the second volume to come out and continue the story. But now it is available. The author uses poetry and images mixed with concrete chemical information about the psycoactive substances in each plant. The chapters are well arranged, in the categories the author has devised with the help of his plant allies to divide the plants into compatable chapters. I've never read anything like this, and read the book over and over, I have my favorite chapters, and the detailed information included on how to prepare and use the plants is reference information too keep on hand."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"Mr Pendell is a modern day adventurer, sending back tales of his exploits at the last frontier for humanity. As in the nineteenth century we who read in the comfort of our lounge chairs are entertained and enthralled by these lucid accounts, from places that few of us have ever been and even fewer are ever likely to go. Mr Pendell though stands above his counterparts in the quality, the power of his words. His is not merely a linear narrative of what he saw and did; rather Mr Pendell seeks to convey the essence of the experience. His goal is for us to glimpse the spirit of where he taking us. His spare, but beatifully chosen words enable the reader to be there with him, whilst at the same time allow some lattitude to explore and reflect on personal feelings and attitudes. He tells us that part of the story, that we could never know of our own accord, whilst giving us glimpses of the spiritual heart. Mr Pendell's writing has the rare quality of 're-readability'. In fact the second, third and fourth readings are just as profound as the fifth, sixth and seventh times! It is possible to discover new insights each time, a different way of looking. There lies the measure of the true value of Mr Pendell's gift to humanity. This book will continue to delight each new reader (and re-reader) for all the generations to come."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"In a culture where it seems impossible to have an intelligent discussion about &quot;drugs&quot;, where drug-use (prescription &amp; other)seems to be coupled with either total unconsciousness, or shame and confusion, a book like this is truly redemptive. It approaches several drugs-- or in Pendell's terms, &quot;plant poisons&quot;-- from several different angles. It discusses each plant's history, uses, pharmocology, effects, possible preparations, etc. It does so in the form of long poems, or odes (much of it prose-poetry) which manage to celebrate each plant without idealizing any of them, and without ever forgetting the (often) intense dangers that accompany them.It is difficult to claim that any approach to drugs is a &quot;balanced approach&quot; in that what drugs provide are often the very real extremes. That said, this book manages to discuss those extremes in a remarkably balanced-- I would say wise-- manner.Even as Pendell urges again and again the need for those on the &quot;poison path&quot;-- i.e. those who believe that drugs can have value for consciousness-- to remain in touch with the &quot;ground state&quot;, he slyly acknowledges the profound difficulty of such a task. Staying mindful on the posion path is what Pendell seems to achieve, and what he not always optimistically hopes for others.For me, who am about to make a movie about someone struggling with his complex relationship to marijuana, this book is indespensible."},{"Title":"Pharmako/Poeia: Plant Powers, Poisons, and Herbcraft (Pharmako Vol I)","review":"Dale Pendell's sensibility is Blakean,shamanic, scientific and witty. This gathering of plant, folk and mythic lore is both useful, inspiring and fascinating.There is a richness of wisdom and poetry woven into a unique blend of intelligence,long time research and realized experience.Pendell embodies a unique alchemy of genius in addition to spontaneity and fine poetry.America is blessed to have someone with this range of insight, freedom and flat out thorough going research. All three volumes of this collection are an education in themselves and I rank these works alongside Grave's \\"The White goddess\\" not only in view of their ecstatic muse driven energy but for their plain usefulness and reminderof the mystic AND earthly derivation of consciousness and very,very organic assistances to be gained by plant allies and the courage to travel with them.

Every page, I mean, practically every line, contains wit, humor, insight, and wisdom all written with the utmost eloquence. Pendell's breadth of knowledge in his not-so-small area of expertise is simply awesome, in the true sense of the word. This way is not for all, however, and the type of person attracted to Pendell's work, as he puts it himself, is probably eccentric. What makes perfect sense to me is scoffed at by my friends. So I keep things to myself more often, the views and practices found in this book not being an exception. This is a volume full of ancient herbal lore and methodology (but not just confined to that), it is exceedingly fun to read, and I couldn't love it more. I've got volume 2 on the way, and as another reviewer has already mentioned, Mercury House is sluggish when it comes to releasing these books.

He lives above Scene Of The Crime, an art gallery specializing in photos of crime scenes that were taken by his uncle Knut. Paul Raymonds, a SFPD detective sergeant and old partner of Jack's father, tells Jack he's sending a special client over in the morning. The relationship between Jack and Raymonds is strained, partly because Raymonds is cheating on Jack's aunt. The next morning, Jack meets Alex Jordan, a woman he figures out is Raymonds' lates girlfriend. Alex says her sister Maggie has vanished, and that she might be at a hippie commune called Lunarhouse. Once inside Lunarhouse, Jack finds himself up to his eyeballs in trouble. Maggie was there but is gone now, and some of the commune's big bouncers chase Jack from the scene. In no time at all, Jack's quest takes him through the dark alleys of the city, the bleak fall-out from emotional pain and suffering of a family, and force his own black rage and weakness to the surface so he has to finally deal with those things. Secrets are everywhere--even Jack has them.Ed Brubaker currently scripts he BATMAN monthly comic, the CATWOMAN comic in which he revamped the character, POINT BLANK, SLEEPER, a SLAM BRADLEY back-up and THE COMPLETE LOWLIFE. Also a cartoonist, Brubaker's work has been nominated for many Eisner Awards. Michael Lark is a favorite artist on noirish-type comics. His graphic novel, THE LITTLE SISTER, written and drawn by him, based on Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe novel of the same title. Other work includes TERMINAL CITY, short stories for Vertigo's WINTER'S EDGE, SUPERMAN: WAR OF THE WORLDS, and BATMAN: NINE LIVES.Brubaker's natural feel for crime writing lends Jack Herriman's world the luster of a dark and gritty reality. San Francisco is accurately portrayed without ever stepping too close to becoming a travelogue or a stereotype. The mystery and murders at the heart of the story, the years of loss and betrayal that come to culmination and spark to unleash the homicidal blaze that rocks Jack's world and leave him both more and less than what he had been are all played out honestly. Brubaker's got a gift for dialogue and allows the characters to come on stage and introduce themselves in ways even the excellent first-person narration can't quite do. Jack's world is full: he has his uncle and his uncle's girlfriend, Paul Raymonds--his dead father's partner, Steve Ellington--a friend and private eye for a big investigations firm, and an ex-girlfriend of his own that he can't quite get over. Besides getting entranced in the rich mystery that Brubaker presents, readers also get to wander through the impressive tapestry of pain, misery, loss, guilt, and half-truths that are Jack's life. The story offers quiet jokes, deep characters drawn in a few knowing lines, and the intensity of a steadily depressed spring. As Jack narrows the scope of his investigation, readers know that all hell is about to break loose: especially when additional bodies drop out of the woodwork and the violence escalates. Michael Lark's artwork is awesome: dark and moody, readers can smell the smoke in the seedy bars and will check the seats before sitting.SCENE OF THE CRIME: A LITTLE PIECE OF GOODNIGHT is a wonderful graphic novel in the vein of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe detective novels. Brubaker says that Ross MacDonald was his favorite crime novelist, and a lot of the movement and rhythm of this tale shows that interest. Private eye fiction lovers who have never discovered the intricate joy of a graphic novel couldn't find a better place to start exploring the genre. Fans who already are familiar with Brubaker's work on BATMAN or CATWOMAN will want to add this one to their collections if it's not already there."},{"Title":"Scene of the Crime: A Little Piece of Goodnight","review":"I like detective stories only when they're well told. Dashiel Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, Walter Mosley, Robert Parker, and Sue Grafton are the only ones I read regularly. Brubaker's work here is in that class.Brubaker creates a great family-tangled-in-the-past mystery a la Ross Macdonald and adds a cast of supporting characters for the private detective that is only rivaled by those created by Robert B. Parker, from a persnickety crime-scene photographer to a bellicose national-agency private operator.The real contribution this book makes to the genre, though, is its protagonist, Jack Herriman, whose youth makes for a refreshing contrast with most classic detectives but whose former morally questionable lifestyle, which began at the age of 14, gives him a moral depth of greater immediacy than that of most private eyes. While other detectives have seen everything, this kid has already done everything. This gives the story a new perspective, which Brubaker makes the most of.I hope Brubaker takes time out from his regular series, Deadenders, to write more Herriman stories. And I hope Michael Lark sticks with the book, too -- his work is as good here as it was in Terminal City."},{"Title":"Scene of the Crime: A Little Piece of Goodnight","review":"okay folks, lets face it, private eye stories are usually pretty predictable; PI gets hired on a case (mostly by a beautiful woman), does some digging, finds out more than he figured, puts it all together and catches the bad guy/guys. the art of a good story is how the author twists up those cliches and keeps you turning pages. well, ed brubaker has written a pretty twisty story here. the PI, jack herriman, takes on a missing persons case from a woman looking for her sister. he manages to find the sister pretty quickly but thats when the problems start, people die, questions stack up and he finds out fast the case is far from wrapped. the artwork, by michael lark, is quite good and does a very serviceable job of storytelling. overdrawn comic hero art would totally not work here and the slightly subdued colors fit the book perfectly giving it a slightly noirish feel without overdoing it. sorry, my plot summary wasn't more descriptive but you'll want to experience this for yourself. if you like quick paced mysteries this'll be right up your alley. this is a brilliant work of fiction and art... comics? for kids? ...not this one..."},{"Title":"Scene of the Crime: A Little Piece of Goodnight","review":"I just got an email from my sister; she was raving about WATCHMEN, catching me up on where she is on FABLES, planning on starting THE WALKING DEAD volume that I gave her and letting me know that she has made friends with another comic geek in town. It was enough to make a grown man cry.For those of you that haven't given comics a chance ever in your life, or have looked at a few and dismissed them, please keep reading. I want to help you realize something that my sister just came to grips with: Comics are for everyone, you just have to find the right ones. And that is what CrimeCritics is all about, helping you guys know what to check out so that you don't waste your time and money. Leave that to us.It is important to distinguish between the medium and the content when we look at entertainment. Dismissing all of TV would be to miss out on Discovery Channel's PLANET EARTH. Celebrating books in general would be to laud MEIN KAMPF, DIANETICS and THE SHACK (I just had a ton of fun lumping those three together). Comics are just a medium of combining visuals with literature. There is nothing more to it. Dozens of comics win awards every year by referring to themselves as \\"graphic novels\\". They are just a longer version of a single comic book. But now that most comic stories are written over several issues, and then collected in a single volume for publication, the difference is pure semantics.Today I want to look at an Ed Brubaker comic called SCENE OF THE CRIME which Vertigo published in 1999. It was a four issue series which is now collected in a single paperback available from most bookstores. If you are into noir detective stories, enjoy watching serial crime shows on TV, or just want to take a break from your pulp novels to try out something different, please give this comic a try.In classic Brubaker style, there is a ton of exposition in this comic. I love lots of dialog, it keeps your eyes lingering on the art of each panel and it makes you feel like you are getting a ton for your money. And at $10 for over 100 pages of art and excellent writing, there is no doubt about value here. Along with Brubaker's tight plotting you also get his normal partner in crime, the artist Michael Lark.Lark has a realistic style and talent for grit that makes this a team that just can't be beat. One of the things that I love in SCENE OF THE CRIME is that Lark uses a lot of short panels that go the full width of a single page. You can see some of these panels in the gallery below. They give you the impression of watching a film on a real 1:2.35 screen. Or perhaps you are seeing these events through window blinds that are barely cracked. Either way, the characters always have a stooped-over feeling, as if they can feel the panel border just above them. It works without you even noticing it.This is also one of Brubaker's best plots ever. A murder mystery with hippie communes and tons of twists and surprises, the story is broken up into 21 chapters. Instead of constricting himself to the four-issue release schedule, Brubaker breaks each scene up into its own container, and drops a doozy at the end of every issue. It makes reading this book in a collected work extremely satisfying. I also enjoyed following Jack Harriman, his young noir detective. Classically broken-down, Jack deals with several of his own demons as he attempts to solve the case. And instead of having to carry the plot on his own shoulders, he is joined by several friends and colleagues along the way which really makes the book feel more honest and real.There is just too much here to like, and so much bang for the buck, that I will be disappointed in those of you that do not rush out to get a copy. Next time you are in your favorite bookstore, see if they have a copy to thumb through. Or check out the gallery below and just order one from Amazon. You spend more than this in Starbucks for a coffee and a scone. If I could ruin the ending for you and let you know what the final twist is, I guarantee that every one of our female readers and mothers from DreaminDemon would be tripping over themselves to snag a copy."},{"Title":"Ellen Elizabeth Hawkins: Texas 1886 (American Diaries)","review":"Ellen is a 12 year old girl growing up on a ranch in Texas.

Ellen herself is a dissapointment to her father - he wishes for a son that can help him out more around the ranch. When her father goes away during a drought, Ellen's first true challenge comes. The windmill is broken, the valuable herd is scattered, and her grandfather is injured. Ellen must find the stock, bring them to water, and help her grandfather.

A good historical novel with a strong main character."},{"Title":"Ellen Elizabeth Hawkins: Texas 1886 (American Diaries)","review":"It was that boring! I usually don't even give up on books, but this one was an exception. Ellen was one of those classic tomboys who just wants to like her daddy and grandpa. How original is that. She just happens to also live on a ranch where she just acts like the real cowboy. Wow. I'm not saying that Ellen couldn't be that way, but she could of been less one-dimensional (just like many of the other characters in SURVIVAL! and American Diaries, the latter not as much). Her Grandpa gets hurt so she has to think up some crazy plan using all these ranch equipment pieces that people from the nineties could really care less about. The description where she was trying to move her grandpa (about five million chapters long) drove me so crazy I just had to stop. Try reading one of the first American Diaries books, they have more on the character of the person and less historical mumbo jumbo (and don't get me wrong, I love history!)"},{"Title":"Mastering APA Style: Student's Workbook and Training Guide Fifth Edition","review":"APA style is a bear to learn using only the Publication Manual.

Ultimately though, the book reaches far far far beyond politics or media, and questions how we see the world through our own vision. We use different maps to navigate through reality, in the form of beliefs, preconceptions, ideals, attitudes, etc... are these maps actually tyrants that dominate us?The hilarious (and incredibly enjoyable to read) ideas in this book help to clear away mental baggage, helping readers to question what they take for reality. Is reality what you have read in newspapers or heard from politicians, but have never experienced? Is reality going to a boring job every day, waiting until you retire to enjoy yourself, having routinized and predictable conversations, never thinking about what other possible ways you could be living your life? What would life be like if you stripped away everything you have learned, all the beliefs and habitual ways of living that have been socialized into you from the moment of conception?Through \\"guerilla warfare of the mind\\" we can begin to live more free lives, and understand what we are by clearing away habitual ways of thinking/acting. For people who have read SSOTBME (another highly recommended Ramsey Dukes book), this book explores darker and deeper terrain and aims at a more intense rewiring of readers perceptions. This is one of the most original books i have ever encountered, and it would be difficult to match. A very interesting characteristic of Dukes' work is the way ideas weave through his various writings, forming an interesting body of work that seems to constantly develop and progress. So, if you have read anything else by Ramsey Dukes you should definitely get this one.One very tempting comparison to make with this book is to the movie \\"Fight Club\\"... they share the general idea of changing the way you live, living outside of convention, and testing the limits of what your mind will let you get away with. I would not be surprised in the least to find out that Fight Club is inspired by this book (well, actually... it would surprise me if Chuck Pahlaniuk, authour of Fight Club, was interesting enough to have even heard of Thundersqueak).Your will not regret buying this book, it is totally amazing!"},{"Title":"Thundersqueak","review":"Ramsey Dukes is brilliant in writing convincing arguments to bring about your own inspiration for change and growth.

The tests in this book contain a lot of &quot;none of the above, all of the above, only A and B, only C and D&quot; type questions. There were none of these on the actual test. These questions made it more difficult to practice process of elimination techniques and made the questions more difficult to make educated guesses on (which you will be doing a lot of on the actual exam).

I work part time in educational psychology and what I tell parents, and what I understand, is that with standardized testing the best way to increase your score, (other than taking more classes and studying over periods of time--and realistically who is taking that much time and energy for a test), is just knowing how to test well by knowing the strategy of the test and feeling comfortable with the format. There is only so much more knowledge you can cram into your head before a test like this, so I think time is better spent by understanding it and taking as many full length tests as you can, rather than focusing on content knowledge (unless you have the time to cover a lot of content).this book is useful in both aspects."},{"Title":"GRE Psychology w/ CD-ROM (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the GRE (GRE Test Preparation)","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

The answers to the test questions are not thorough. Reading over 200 answers will not help you learn the material well, as the questions and information are in random order. This is a very inefficient way to study and difficult for consolidating new information.3. The GRE Psychology test is paper written. I wish I knew before I bought this so-called review book with its CD-rom. It is important to practice taking the test in the format it will be given in.4. Buy a Kaplan Guide--they're cheaper anyway.

S/he probably entered \\"gender\\" as a keyword and indiscriminately wrote negative reviews of whatever s/he found.I say this with confidence because Felski actually challenges the heretofore conventional approach of theorizing the modern as patriarchal or male-centered, and she problematizes feminist readings that demonize modernism as said same. She disturbs simple-minded dichotomies between masculine and feminine experiences of the modern world along their own fault lines. She is not a rank-and-file second wave feminist (at least not from I've read with this book)--she challenges much that is typically found among feminist theorists, including those often considered to be mouthpieces for third wave feminism (the generalized term i would assign to Felski, if pressed to assign one at all).Her work here is full of negative capability: she allows for doubt and for contradictory readings to exist without yoking them into some grand narrative. I can't see how anyone who has actually read the book and understood it on its own terms (rather than through the lens of a fringe-dwelling reactionary) would walk away thinking that she is trying to further some political agenda. She's an academic, a scholar who has offered an interesting detour here to conventional readings of the relationship between feminism and modernity.The book uses history as well as cultural theory, and focuses mainly on the fin de si&egrave;cle, with writers such as Zola, Wilde, Sacher-Masoch, Simmel, Rachilde, Marie Corelli and Olive Schreiner. Felski examines the work of these authors, as well as sociological theory, realist and naturalist novels, decadent literature, political essays and speeches, sexological discourse, and sentimental popular fiction. She explores the gendered meanings of such notions as nostalgia, consumption, feminine writing, the popular sublime, evolution, revolution, and perversion.I used this book along with another work that touches on many of the same themes, Susan Stewart's _On Longing; Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection_ for a long paper for a graduate course I'm taking this semester, and I found both to be amazingly insightful and thought-provoking as well as good resources.I apologize for spending so much time defending the merits of the work and not discussing its contents, but I feel inclined to try and refute the irresponsible comments made in the only other review that's been posted here. Since that reviewer gave it one star, that's all that appears next to the title and that's a gross misrepresentation. It's unfortunate in a way that academic titles such as this one do not receive the attention that popular titles do, as such biased ratings are probably quite common."},{"Title":"The Gender of Modernity","review":"Won't the Seventies ever come to an end?

Sarah Foner had very sharp criticisms of religious intolerance, and expressed even harsher antipathies against the various factitious conflicts that diverse Jewish groups engaged against one another in spite of violence committed against them by Russians and Poles, and much, much more. Six of her works are adroitly translated into English by Morris Rosenthal in this powerful, thought-provoking, highly recommended anthology of a truly remarkable and articulate woman."},{"Title":"A Woman's Voice: Sarah Foner, Hebrew Author of the Haskalah","review":"Sarah Foner had a gift that few authors can claim, the ability to make both fiction and history live and breathe. Her fictional stories cunningly interwove real social events and concerns into the lives of her characters. Her autobiographical works open a clear and brilliant window for historians and cheer the hearts of feminists. Few authors, amongst them Marge Piercy and William Shakespeare, are so astute.

We are reintroduced to the Walkers and Becketts on their next summer holiday. The action is fast paced, and keeps the reader turning the pages. The chapter about the shipwreck is a gem. The dialogue is entertaining, and not without a decent amount of humour, and it is interspaced with delightful descriptive prose passages that show a deep love of the landscape of the lake district while informing the reader of important plot devices. Towards the latter 3/4 it slows down for a chapter of two, but then returns to its strengths for the final race back to Wild Cat Island."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"For what it's worth.

I wouldn't hesitate to try one of these books even with a jaded modern young reader."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"This is a sequel to Ransome's children's adventure book \\"Swallows and Amazons.\\" And Swallowdale is just as good, if not better than the first volume. It is another captivating book full of adventures. This time, the Swallows and the Amazons (two groups of children with sailing ships spending their summer holidays at a lake in England) are forced to spend the first part of their holiday on land. It makes for a nice change of scenery in the story line as they explore inland, discover caves, climb mountains and try to get away from a very stern great aunt. In the end, they are able to return to sailing their beloved ships, at which point their summer vacation can truly begin.Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series are fabulous books. And Swallowdale is one of the best. It's well written, captivating, inspirational, uplifting, enjoyable and funny. The adventures of the main protagonists take any child on a wonderful journey of experiences most children dream about. Sailing, exploring the unknown, plotting with friends and allies against naughty grown ups, fishing, hiding, playing games...what more would any child want to do spend their summer? This series was written before WWII when children had no TVs and video games so they played outside. These books were always inspirational to me and I'm glad to say that they help inspire the same sense of adventure and appreciation for the outdoors in my children. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"At the start of this book, the Swallows sail to Wild Cat Island, looking forward the adventures they plan to have with the Amazons. So, of course, they are devastated discover that the Amazons are being kept at home by their great aunt, the G.A. The Amazons manage to escape and meet the Swallows in Horseshoe Cove, where Titty and Roger make an exciting discovery. They don't tell the rest of the group, wanting to keep it a surprise. When John's sailing skills are tested, the discovery comes in handy.This book is one of my favorites because it has all the original characters; John, Susan, Titty, Roger, Nancy and Peggy. It is funny, as the characters begin to develop more personality. Like all the books, this book is a wonderful, delightful story."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"The Swallows and Amazons series is great and I think that each book is great on its own but that hey are even better as a series.

Now we are reading Peter Duck..."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"&quot;Swallowdale&quot; continues very much where its predecessor, &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot;, leaves off, with the Walker children returning to &quot;that remote lake in the north of England&quot; one year after the events of the first book and looking forward to another couple of weeks of fun, sailing with their friends, the Amazon pirates. Plans quickly begin to go awry, however, and Ransome turns events away from the anticipated activity of sailing on the lake to an altogether different sort of fun, as the children take off camping and exploring in the surrounding fells and mountains.The book has all of the fine qualities that make its predecessor such an excellent read for children (and adults) of all ages. Ransome's prose is a delight throughout, his characters engaging and the events that befall the children entirely believable. As in all of the other books of this series, simple pen and ink drawings by the author add considerably to the enjoyment. If only the world (and the Lake District!) was still like this!Incidentally, although this was the second of Arthur Ransome's &quot;Swallows and Amazon&quot; books to be published, it is best read after the third volume, &quot;Peter Duck&quot;, because it is set chronologically after the events of that book, and makes occasional back reference to it. You will enjoy &quot;Peter Duck&quot; much more if you read it BEFORE you read &quot;Swallowdale&quot;. And if you enjoyed &quot;Swallows and Amazons&quot; you will certainly enjoy this."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"Small boat or dinghy sailing, camping out, excitement, nice people and strong writing: what more could a reader ask for? I first read this book at the home of a boyhood friend about ten years after it was originally published, and I count the series (this is the second of 12) as responsible for my lifelong interest in camping and sailing. More than half a century later, I acquired a set and found to my absolute delight that they read as well and are as powerfully satisfying as ever.Here, within the covers of a very well-written book, you'll find a group of charming children and a few adults, spanning a wide range of ages and character types. Swallowdale is by turns funny, thoughtful, insightful and so well written it is a distinct pleasure for readers of any age.Did I mention the writing? It's better written than most current novels."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"Swallowdale has it all for adventurous minded children - sailing, shipwrecks, pirates, camping, exploring, caves, climbing, battles...The Swallows (Captain John, Mate Susan, Able Seaman Titty and Boy Roger) and Amazons (Captain Nancy and Mate Peggy) meet up again along with Captain Flint and his parrot Polly to explore the mountains and lakes of the English Lake District.Written by Arthur Ransome over 60 years ago, this is a book for grandparents, parents and children alike - a book to be passed from generation to generation."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"One year after the events of &quot;Swallows and Amazons,&quot; the four Walkers return to the Lake to spend the summer holidays, looking forward to more thrilling adventures with the Blackett sisters and their uncle, Captain Flint. To their dismay, they discover that the Blacketts' Great-Aunt--a strait-laced and somewhat tyrannical person who brought their mother and uncle up--is staying at Beckfoot and badly cramping the two pirates' style. And then the Walkers' boat &quot;Swallow&quot; is wrecked on the far side of the lake, forcing them to find a new camp. In dealing with these challenges the six show their mettle once again--and even manage to get away for an overnight climb of Kanchenjunga, as they christen the tallest of the nearby hills. Along the way Roger and Titty get lost when a sea-fog rolls in over the moors, and the outwitting of Great-Aunt Maria furnishes a fair share of suspense. Once again Ransome tells his tale without talking down, seeming to assume a child's viewpoint with an ease matched by few writers. Another excellent family read-aloud that should be owned by every household even if they don't care for boats or camping."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"The second and my favourite of the Swallows and Amazons series starts with a mystery. Where are the Amazons? It continues with a near disaster that threatens the Swallow's entire holiday, but a chance discovery saves the situation.The children explore the hills of the English Lake District, have battles and meet strange but friendly &quot;natives&quot; all while trying to keep the Great Aunt happy.It is a great story for children and adults which combines Ransome's characters with exciting but realistic adventures and marvellous descriptions of the English countryside and its inhabitants."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"My mother, who was twelve years old in 1938, wrote a letter to Mr. Ransome telling him how much she loved his books, and asking if she could &quot;be&quot; Nancy, her favorite character. Mr. Ransome very kindly wrote back and bequeathed that character to her. That thought was very important to her, helping her get through some difficult times in her childhood. And her kids grew up to enjoy the books just as much. If I ever have children (or nieces &amp; nephews) I will certainly share the books with them, too. They are fun and adventurous, and also show kids being &quot;real,&quot; and also being independent and responsible, and able to help each other out. I wish the world could still be that way for kids."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"The Swallows return to their favorite lake a year later, but things have changed slightly...the Amazons are dealing with a visit from a tyrannical great-aunt and can't go sailing with them! While sailing about on their own, the Swallows' boat experiences a wreck and their sailing adventures on the lake are in danger.This book continues the adventures of the brave kids we first met in SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS, only they're a year older and a little nervier. The books' descriptions of camping and exploring are fun, fun, fun; I remember doing similar things as a child. The story also gives some good lessons to kids, although not in a preachy fashion...we see the importance of being calm in a crisis, and how an otherwise bad situation can be turned into a positive experience. Also, the boat-race scene at the end has a great scene of good sportsmanship, as the losers enthusiastically and sincerely congratulate the winners and compliment them on their sailing. And, as present in SWALLOWS AND AMAZONS, there is the element of using one's imagination.The mountain-climbing scenes are good, with an unexpectedly poignant moment at the summit. The lost-in-the-fog scenes are actually quite atmospheric and memorable.The book's main problem is that it is rather dated, but for some readers, that's part of the charm. The great-aunt's insistance on Victorian-era manners may not click too much with modern readers, although they'll probably be able to think of their elders who they see as being too old-fashioned. The book takes place in a circa 1930 England, when charcoal-burners and horse-drawn wagons were still commonplace in rural areas; some might find the setting too alien, while others may become absorbed into it.Despite those few flaws, this is still a 5-star book in my view. Great for parents and children, and a great inspiration for outdoor adventures.Note: This book makes references to an imaginary character, \\"Peter Duck,\\" who was the subject of a sort of collective fairy tale that the group made up over the winter holiday. That story is told in the next book in the series, PETER DUCK."},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"My favorite aspect of Arthur Ransome books is that they always take place in a self-contained community of children that is totally devoid of an adult presence. Ransome's characters are not only are skilled sailors (under the capable leadership of Captain Nancy), but they fish, camp and go on a variety of overnight adventures and arrange for their own food, shelter, warmth and the other personal needs without any adult intervention whatsoever. Of course, they also get into a variety of scrapes but also manage to get out of them on their own.In Swallowdale they go exploring and camp in a secret valley, experience ship wreck and get temporarily lost. The writing is appropriate for a 4th grade reading level and up, though children five and up will enjoy having Swallowdale read to them. Arthur Ransome always leaves me nostalgic for a time when children spent most of their free time in the streets playing stick ball and kick the can, rather than taking piano and soccer lessons.A great read for outdoor enthusiasts of any age who enjoy sailing, camping and/or fishing.By Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, author of THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE"},{"Title":"Swallowdale (Puffin books, PS339)","review":"What more can be said than knickerbockerbreaker?

This is the bio of Queen Victoria at home. From the race to the successor of the Enlish throne upon the death of the Princess of Wales, to her reign as an eighteen-year old, her happy marriage and numerous offspring, to the fat and stodgy old Empress who gave her name to an era, this is a view of Victoria we seldom see in history accounts.The best part of the book is about her marriage to Saxe-Coburg Prince Albert, who was &quot;hired&quot; by Victoria as her consort but found himself in love with the diminutive German-English queen. They exchanged paintings (Victoria loved male nudes and was always smitten by male beauty), they read novels and poetry outloud to each other. Victoria handed over a key to the dispatch boxes wherein lay the documents of State, and the unpopular German prince soon was an invaluable right-hand man and man behind the throne.Sadly, Prince Albert died (whether from exhaustion after his successful staging of the Crystal Palace exhibition) or from stomach cancer) and Victoria plunged the Throne into interminable mourning. Afterward, her role in the affairs of state, even with important events such as the Sepoy Rebellion and the Boer War, seemed less intense.The biography focuses on the domestic Victoria, less so on her children, especially the wastrel Edward (Bertie) and strives to keep history as a backdrop to Victoria's life. In this, the biography succeeds admirably, but those interested in English history will want to read other accounts to fill in the events and political intricacies that are only sketched out here."},{"Title":"Go On Girl!: Works Worth Reading, Chats With Our Favorite Authors, Tips For Starting and Sustaining a Literary Circle, Questions and Topics to Get You Talking...and More!","review":"This book is more than just a guide to starting your own book club.

The character of Hal Jordan develops throughout this tome that brings back to life the most mature plotting and themes of any early Sixties DC comics. Because of the interesting writing, this stands out among the Showcase and Marvel Essentials, and so it survives the harshness of black and white.It is a shame that color is apparently prohibitively expensive. I'm sure, especially with a character whose NAME IS A COLOR, the publishers held their breath when they released it. Yes, I miss the color A LOT, but this and a few of the other Showcases have enough nostaliga and entertainment value to make for good bedtime reading. Plus some of the key background material for Infinite Crisis originates in early Green Lantern mags.Put it all together with the value, and this is a very satisfying purchase. (Great marketing too--buying a few of these Showcase volumes prompted me to buy a few of the more expensive premium products DC has put out.)Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Green Lantern, Vol. 1","review":"DC's Showcase Presents series is something which makes this old comic book fan very happy. Presenting 500-plus pages of silver age (or later) comics in chronological order makes for a terrific way to purchase a huge chunk of a character's history for cheap. The catch - they're in black and white. While this is a nice way to showcase the pen and ink artwork of the period (sorry, colorists!), it does diminish a very appealing aspect of comics - especially one like Green Lantern, whose powers and vulnerabilities involve different colors to a high degree.Nonetheless, Green Lantern Volume 1 is a great buy. It's cheap, it's huge, and it presents the character, to my mind, that best exemplifies the period of the early 1960s. Hal Jordan is a test pilot who inherits a powerful ring that allows him to travel in space and join an intergalactic police force. I can't imagine a more exemplary character for an age and a country just beginning its space flights, harnessing new and powerful energies in both war and peace, and attempting to police the world in the Cold War.John Broome's writing is good, if simplistic in spots (a requirement of the era's Comics Code authority, unfortunately, which restricted violence, moral ambuguity, and all other sorts of things which make \\"modern\\" comics so interesting). But the stories still almost universally contain kernels of good sci-fi ideas. Time travel, antimatter universes, shrinking to subatomic size, all sorts of sci fi ideas populate these pages. Younger readers ought to find the stories exciting and entertaining. Older readers might be a bit more bored, but there's plenty of period subtext for the avid student of sociology or 60's futurism to enjoy.The art is the main draw, here. Gil Kane is unquestionably one of the greats of the silver age. His style here is fluid, uncluttered, and not quite as dynamic as his later stuff, but the elements are there. His layouts and anatomy are still creative and interesting. Watching his style evolve over 20 issues is a treat. Later volumes show his style progressing even further.In summary, this volume should appeal to any fan of the character, any student of the 1960s, and any appreciator of Gil Kane's art. Since I am all three, this was a certain buy for me. Other than this group though, I would say that this book is appropriate for Silver Age aficionados and bright, inquisitive kids. At this price, it can't be beat."},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Green Lantern, Vol. 1","review":"I started reading Green Lantern comics during Blackest Night, and this was recommended to me by a friend who was an ever bigger fan than I am.It was awesome to see the origin of Green Lantern in this Showcase and the first appearances of Sinestro, Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris and Star Sapphire. The powers of the ring seem to be all over the place and a little inconsistent, but still it was fun to read.But be warned that you're going to read the same 2 or 3 editor's notes over and over and over and over again about the yellow impurity in Hal's Ring, and about Carol Ferris.All in all, I say if you're a fan of Green Lantern, check this out so you can see the origins of this awesome hero."},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Green Lantern, Vol. 1","review":"Capturing the elements of the growing national fascination with science and space, the Green Lantern was a super hero for science fiction, as this stories from 1959-1962 clearly demonstrate.What is neat about this bulky volume of 526 pages is the inclusion of the seven Showcase (#22-#24) stories, which can be considered as a pilot project for an ongoing series. Test pilot Hal (Green Lantern) Jordan is quickly introduced and the recurring elements in the story lines unfold quickly, especially his pursuit of Carol Ferris, who happens to be his boss.What is lost in the newspaper-styled reproduction is the rich colors of the comic book artwork - especially in the Green Lantern series, with numbers one to seventeen included here - which actually made it a trailblazer to the graphic novel.\\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight,\\" chants the Emerald Gladiator, though his adventures just may take him out of this world."},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Green Lantern, Vol. 1","review":"When I was a youngster in the 70's, one of the comics I used to love reading from DC was Green Lantern. Imagine my surprise when I walk into my local BAM Bookstore and find a digest of old Green Lantern comics called Showcase Presents Green Lantern, Volume 1 for a real low price of $9.99. I quickly purchased it and brought it home for an all-night read. Thing is, it's three days later and I still hadn't finished it, lol. While storytelling in this volume might seem a bit rigid & straightforward as opposed to comics in this day and time, it made me learn alot about one of my favorite DC Comics characters of all-time. Many of the characters I know and love from the GL universe were introduced in these older reprints so I have a deeper understanding of them now. True, it's clear from reading these old stories that the comic was aimed more toward a younger audience back then but I love taking a walk down memory lane. This volume includes Green Lantern's first appearances in Showcase #22 through #24 as well as his first adventures in Green Lantern #1 through #17. It's written by John Broome and Gardner Fox. With art by Gil Kane, Joe Giella and Murphy Anderson. The cover is done by Kane & Giella. If you're just getting into comics and want to learn about the Silver Age of comics or are a new GL fan, you might want to check out the DC line of Showcase paperbacks.

Gil Kane's pencil work is the epitome of clean, sylish DC econmy and class- so unlike today's overworked, overcrowed junk. The inking, mainly by Joe Giello, is really smooth, sophisicated and reserved. That was a great era.

This Showcase is thus much more interactive than the rest.(I do wish they did a showcase for the Golden Age version of GL, but that's just me.)Still, like the rest of the Showcase Presents series, this is an excellent value and a great way to catch up on the semi-ancient history of classic characters!"},{"Title":"Showcase Presents: Green Lantern, Vol. 1","review":"Put yourself in a frame of mind to enjoy some good innocent fun, and this 500-plus page \\"Showcase\\" volume presenting the earliest Hal Jordan/Green Lantern stories will provide a winning good time.It's all here: the first appearances of the Green Lantern Corps, renegade Green Lantern Sinestro, Carol Ferris and the Ferris Aircraft gang, and the mysterious Guardians of the Universe, to name a few of the classic G.L. elements that make their debut here.The emotional subtext is a little simplistic in these lates 1950's and early 1960's stories by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane: all Carol Ferris cares about is marrying Green Lantern (even though she has no idea who he is behind the mask) and all Green Lantern's alter ego Hal Jordan cares about is getting Carol to love HIM, not his exciting and secret superhero persona. But that stuff is kept to small doses, so it's tolerable and even a little fun.Tying everything together, however, are several crazy, imaginative villains, many well done earthbound adventures, and a handful of universe-spanning science-fiction plots that actually flirt a little with genuine sophistication.As I did, you'll probably miss the color a little in this inexpensive reprint edition, but not enough to ruin things for you. Besides, if you really like a few specific stories in this edition, chances are that many other comics fans do, too, and those stories have probably been reprinted in color in smaller (and thus not too expensive) editions available in your local comics shop or here on Amazon.Anyway, this telephone book of a collection is great fun.

Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books... Maybe you could buy a box of crayons to go along with all the artwork that the publishers ruined in this format.

She sees any potential relationship as an abuse of the subordinate-boss relationship when she is left in control of the company after her dad decides to travel the world for two years. While Hal is testing a training simulator that he designed the sim is ripped from the floor and enveloped in some sort of green energy as he is flown to the site of an alien spaceship crash. There he meets a dying Abin Sur who identifies himself as a \\"Green Lantern\\", a sort of intergalactic policeman whose power ring is only limited by the willpower of its wielder. Before he dies, Abin Sur passes on his responsibilities to a dumbstruck Hal Jordan to fight evil not only on Earth but its surrounding planets. A further complication in Hal's life occurs when Carol begins to show more interest in Green Lantern than Hal Jordan, not knowing that the two are the same.I'm a big Green Lantern fan and I was really excited to pick up this huge book for $9.99 numbering over 500 pages because I had never read any of these early stories. Imagine my disappointment when I was confronted by some of the most horrible writing I have ever encountered in my brief life. I will discuss a few stories which were indicative of the low quality of plot that turned this from an awesome piece of nostalgia to an unintentionally comic burlesque.In one story, Green Lantern and Carol go out on a date, yes, that's right, they go out on a date with Hal in full costume. In fact Green Lantern actually is a social gadfly in some of these early stories, romancing all the rich and beautiful women in Coast City. When Carol actually has the nerve to propose marriage to GL, our quick-thinking idiot summons a huge Godzilla-size creature with his power ring to wreak havoc in the city so he will have an excuse to get away from Carol, a creature that looks like a R. Crumb crossed with a underwear clad bum! Just at that moment a model airplane that some kids were flying in the park hits GL in the head and knocks him out, leaving his creature to wander around the city, charting a course to the military's atomic stockpiles! What kind of superhero INTENTIONALLY creates a monster that could take millions of lives to get out of a marriage proposal!!!??? And what kind of superhero gets taken out by a model plane??? Oh, the humanity! In fact, GL gets the snot kicked out of him a lot, runs his power ring too long, and constantly runs into buildings and walls. Maybe he has a death wish. Or maybe this was the beginning of the insanity that would plague him later on.One of the other representations of bad comic book scripts is issue 8 of Green Lantern, the cover of which hypes the story as \\"Presenting the FIRST of a series of stories which we confidently predict will make comic book history!\\". In it, GL is kidnapped through time to the year 5700 AD to be a \\"Solar Director\\" to fight a menace that has emerged from under the Earth. What menace, you might ask? It seems that around 2000 AD, Gila Monsters, yes, those ugly red and black lizards that inhabit our American deserts, disappeared. Little could mankind know that the Gila monsters were hatching an insidious plan beneath our planet's surface, willing themselves to evolve into biped belt-wearing, pistol shooting, eye-beam ray weapon advanced civilization would-be conquerors of the Earth!! I don't know much about evolution, but 4000 years seems a little short for a species to evolve so radically. Maybe there was a black monolith down there. And why were Gila Monsters chosen above other animals. Why couldn't it have been lemurs? Or dung beetles?Have you heard enough? These are only two stories in this large book, but they are pretty representative of the quality you're going to get here. Don't even get me started about a trip to Venus in which GL has to help cavemen fight pterodactyls! And the charming adjectives that are used to describe his \\"greasemonkey eskimo\\" assistant Pieface, a name which itself seems to invoke a racist minstrel show title. Yes, we do have the first appearances of Sinestro and Star Sapphire, but Sinestro's stories always end up with GL leaving him in a state that will end in a slow and horrible death. The Star Sapphire story is also marred by dumbness as aliens come to Earth seeking a new ruler for their galactic empire. How do they choose a new ruler? They scour the universe for somebody that looks like their previous ruler! Pretty advanced method.These stories are awful. It makes you wonder how this character was able to survive for all these years if this is how it started. I mean, who would actually have bought this trash? The only thing that kept me going was that the stories were mildly amusing and I wanted to see just how far the dumbness would go. Even at $9.99, this book was a complete waste of money. If you see it at a garage sale, maybe THINK about buying it."},{"Title":"The Changing Nature of Physical Geography, 2Ed","review":"Many physical geography instructors provide no history of, or detail the prospects for, the discipline they instruct in. This is by far the best scholarly attempt to provide a synopsis of the possibilities for physical geographic research: where it was, and where it CAN go. The bibliography is outstanding. Highly recommended as a supplement to American Intro. Physical Geography courses (for motivated majors) even though it is written for the British university. It may help breath life back into a neglected subject that the authors believe has great promise for examining past, present, and future global environmental change."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"The author (N-P) fervently believes that ancient and modern social ills are most often the result of forceful subjugation of large numbers of the peoples of the world by an exploitive elite and that, again most often, this has been done in the guise of religion as, supposedly, the will of God. The author wants to find out why Jesus is missing from Christian worship. For example, why is it that the Apostle's Creed declares that Jesus Christ was born, suffered and died with no mention how he lived, or what he said. N-P thinks that it is important to look into why he was killed and what his message said about God --- a message which, evidently, inspired and energized his followers to live as if he was still with them.The book can be divided into three sections.1. The first examines images and expectations of God in O.T. and N.T. scriptures and concludes that, far from giving a consistent, monotheistic picture of One God, it doesn't take a degree in psychology to recognize that many different Gods are pictured, often behaving in widely inconsistent ways and all too often demanding actions that are pathological and violent.2. The second section details the sociological, political and religious situation in which Jesus lived including both domination by foreign powers and by the Temple elite. N-P points out how the oppressive and violent domination systems which the Jewish people had endured for centuries coupled with a belief in an Almighty God led to Messianic expectations involving a violent intervention by God.3. The third section examines Gospel narratives and parables to find evidences for Jesus' non-violent opposition to Rome and to the Temple authorities. Jesus' opposition is rooted in his faith in a god of unconditional love rather than a God of vengeful justice. N-P rejects images of Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet who preached God's ultimate wrath for wrongdoers. Jesus' God desires justice but, since coercion is incompatible with God's nature, he is powerless to enforce it through violent action. Violence and injustice can only be defused by non-violent means --- including sacrifice (as Jesus himself demonstrated), if necessary.The Bible verses referenced below illustrate the all too common presence of passages supporting troubling images of a kind of God who, in the O.T.:1. orders parents to murder disobedient children [Lev.20:1-2a, 9],2. orders a test of faith by one's willingness to murder one's child [Exo. 22:2, 9b-12],3. is angered and so commits worldwide genocide [Gen.6:13,7:23],4. steals land from its rightful occupants [Gen. 15:18-21],5. steals land and orders \\"ethnic cleansing\\" of the occupants [Num.21:31-35],6. is a Holy Warrior killing those who follow other Gods [Exo. 11:4-6, 14:27-28],7. destroys his own people [Jer. 21:3-6; Lam. 4:4,9-10]To dispel the notion, held by some smug Christians, that this behavior is only found in Jewish scriptures, we find in the N.T. troubling images of a God who:8. is a wrathful judge [Matt. 3:7-12],9. kills the disobedient [Acts5:5-9],10. is the violent avenger of injustice [Rev. 11:17-18]To summarize, then, although there are beautiful and inspiring passages regarding the merciful and compassionate nature of God in the Bible, by far the most numerous and dominant Scriptural assertions about the nature of God are concerned with: 1. God's power (violence) is superior to that of our enemies, but 2. God withholds using violence on our enemies, thus allowing us to suffer, in order to chastise and redeem us (in answer to the question \\"did God fail, or is this a punishment for our disobedience?\\" when we are in a crisis of faith). Redemptive violence saves God's reputation of all-powerfulness when we are forced to live under conditions not in our best interest.This all leads to N-P asking \\"So what do these insights lead to with regard to the ways in which Christians should live and worship today?\\" and he goes on to describe how Christians can revise their outlook. Perhaps the greatest reinterpretation he calls for is his rejection of all aspects of the atonement theory of Jesus' death. Jesus was killed by the Romans with the cooperation of the Temple elites because both parties viewed him as a dangerous subversive leader whose teachings undermined Roman political domination as well as Jewish religious authority. The dogma, perhaps arising in Paul but emphasized particularly by Augustine and others, that a sacrifice of life, no matter how precious or divine, was required to appease an otherwise unforgiving God is diametrically opposed to Jesus' foundational teachings about God and the nature of God's kingdom. Such a prerequisite would be inconceivable by a God of infinite love. [My note: An immortal being gains or loses nothing from the physical death of another immortal being, especially if this lost mortality can be resurrected!]N-P sees a re-ritualization of present Christianity is necessary:1 The Last Supper should drop all references to atonement or substitutionary guilt and become rather a celebration of God's abundance in community where we rededicate ourselves to lives of service and sharing.2. Baptism should drop allusions to original sin or the remembrance of the great flood and become a dedication to accept and care for God's abundant gifts.3. The Lord's Prayer should reword its paternalistic and heavenly director images and address the real notions of debt forgiveness along with our gratitude for God's abundance.4. The Apostles Creed should be rewritten to include Jesus, his life and goals and reject the images of \\"almighty\\" God in favor of \\"all-compassionate\\" God.5. [My note: Hymnody should omit or rewrite those hymns whose major thrust seems to focus on declarations of violence or of punishment or of exclusivity.]"},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"For years I have been troubled by the discongruity between the God portrayed in some Scripture as going out of God's way to &quot;seek and save the lost sheep&quot; ... only to find other passages imaging God as a wrathful entity hungry to visit judgment on we mortals.

But he is not willing to stop there. He sees in Jesus' life and teaching a relationship with a God we can embrace. The author looks at who Jesus was and how he related to God and then sets that as his standard for evaluating whether an image of God resonates with the God Jesus knew and experienced. He helps the reader understand the apocalyptic views of some of the Biblical authors and his evidence on why he thinks Jesus broke with that view that was shared by one of his mentors, John the Baptist.

There aren't many books that thoroughly document and discuss the ethically problematic passages in the Bible as this one, especially from someone inside the faith that believes in it's emancipatory possibilities.Because of the comprehensive amount of \\"pathological\\", violent passages found within the Bible, one cannot easily duck the implications that they raise. Nelson-Pallmeyer quotes Raymund Schwager: \\"There are \\"600 hundred passages of explicit violence in the Hebrew Bible, 1,000 verses where God's own violent actions of punishment are described. 100 passages where Yahweh expressly commands others to kill people, and several stories where God irrationally kills or tries to kill for no apparent reason (e.g. Ex 4.24-26).\\" And that's just the Hebrew Bible!Part of N-P's thesis is \\"either God is a pathological killer because the Bible says so, or the Bible is sometimes wrong about God\\". N-P believes Jesus is the one who authoritatively corrects the Bible's faulty images of God by showing his Abba Father as a God of love and redemption not of retribution and violence. Jesus taught a non-violent ethic (\\"love your enemies\\") that was very much at odds with the retributional passages throughout the Bible and congruent with a God of absolute love.N-P relies very much on a Jesus Seminar-esque portrait of the historical Jesus. The Gospels actually contain a fair amount of the troublesome passages N-P wants to free Jesus from. After all, Jesus talked a good deal about judgment and hell. More liberal scholarship has seen these as the early churches' interpolations in addressing their own contemporary situations, not the verbatim words of Jesus. Thus, Jesus is exonerated and freed from any implication which supports N-P's attempt to rescue faith in Jesus' teaching alone. I am of the persuasion that is a very thin line to dangle on but am appreciative that N-P does his best to come up with his best solution. After all, in light of the issues raised, what would anyone sympathetically suggest?Overall, I agree with N-P's assessment that \\"the Bible is sometimes wrong about God.\\" The Bible was written within a specific cultural context that very much colored the perceptions of the biblical writers. They weren't simply God's dictational secretaries. That does not rule out that they were truly God inspired, but that like us, they were also fallibly human. Obviously, most Christians would prefer to believe in an infallible/inerrant Bible and thus gain absolute certitude. But under more open-minded scrutiny, that just doesn't seem to hold water in light of NP's discussion (and many, many other's). I am not as skeptical as N-P, that the other portions of the Bible, besides the Gospels, can't be mined more for the profound revelational insight they do contain. But can we continue under the illusion that the biblical writers always got it exactly right? Vibrant Christian faith doesn't necessarily fall under such conclusions.This is a challenging call to the church and believers to seriously wrestle with this perplexing issue. I don't think it helps much to side-step the implications of this problem and simply chalk it up as a mystery of God's inscrutable nature or the thinking of an avowed troublesome liberal. God's alleged promotion of the genocide of whole groups of peoples: men, women and children (Joshua 8:24, 10:26-43 etc. etc.) simply won't allow that to wash. (And if one has no problem with these type of passages, then how can one say religiously driven terrorists are automatically evil? If God's goodness is incomprehensible to human sensibilities, then maybe we have no entry point to understand what is or isn't God's justice.)As \\"people of the Book\\" we need to have the courage to be forthright about our own pathologies that come from that Book. The current global terrorism, often in the name of religion, calls all faiths to purge away their destructive elements. (And some Christians have no difficulty that it's all the others who have the problems -- strange!) Perhaps God's revelation is ongoing in the light of the supreme revelation in Christ?In conclusion, I would like to compliment N-P for raising the issues that many of us would not have the audaciousness to raise. Many conservatives, no doubt, will have little patience for N-P's questioning because he undermines their core belief in an inerrant Bible. But can we just listen to his legitimate line of questioning above the din of our demands for orthodoxy? Perhaps for most, the answer is no but if some can entertain the question seriously, perhaps it will enable the way forward."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"I think this is a phenomenal, eye opening book. I read it while working at a bible camp having been stigmatized for taking the kind of views that Jack Nelson Pallmeyer did in this book. It is a fascinating exegesis on the gospels and on the old testament with some good eye opening historical information. However, it is not a book for the light hearted and i think it takes the miracollous wonder of the resurrection away. Pallmeyer seems to want to focus merely on the life of Jesus, which i think is a legitimate topic in more progressive circles. However more literature needs to be done focusing on both issues of Christ, not claiming a conservative or liberal agenda. Pallmeyer really did not provide much new information or insights in the book. While it might be good for a religious scholar to read, I would suggest Walter Wink's books for anyone who wants a good solid introduction to the issue of power and dominance in the church."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer is idealistic, compassionate, intelligent, creative and intentional about living out his faith in the real world. In this text he makes a noble effort to interpret scripture through the life, actions and sayings of the historic Jesus of Nazareth.Unfortunately, he attempts his hermeneutic task with a degree of certainty unjustified by the evidence. What Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer forgets is that neither Schweitzer nor any of his successors, up to and including the Jesus Seminar, have been able to define the life and sayings of the historic Jesus with any degree of certainty. Consequently, Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer projects back on the historic Jesus concerns that are more appropriate to the twenty-first century a.d. than to the first. The result is that Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer interprets scripture through a Jesus of his own making. Sadly, he has succeeded in recasting Jesus in his own image.Nevertheless, Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer's concerns about the subordination of faith to culture are important and worth pondering. His response, forged through years of focusing his scholarly and personal life on issues of justice and peace, is worth considering. Read this text and take Professor Nelson-Pallmeyer seriously, just as he attempts to take Jesus seriously. However, take him with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"For years I have been troubled by the discongruity between the God portrayed in some Scripture as going out of God's way to &quot;seek and save the lost sheep&quot; ... only to find other passages imaging God as a wrathful entity hungry to visit judgment on we mortals.

Non-monotheists will find it boring. Non-Christian monotheists and uncritical Christians will find it very threatening.The author, Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer, claims to be a Lutheran Christian. He is definitely in a minority in his faith community- of course, being in the majority or the minority has no bearing on the truth of his views. But as a Christian he should be considered as an insider to the Christian faith. This reviewer, a Roman Catholic Christian, thinks that most people who seriously challenge long established Christian teachings do not know Biblical history nor the official teachings of Christianity. But this author does know both very well. His views deserve serious attention.He starts with an assumption about Reality (God) and then proceeds carefully to deduce the implications of that assumption. Assumptions are necessary for all human beings to think, reason, argue, and prove. Without assumptions we would not be human. But assumptions cannot be 'proven' to others who do not share those assumptions. Very rarely does someone change his/her basic assumptions about Reality- this is classically named a 'conversion'.The author's basic assumption is that Reality (God) is nonviolent-totally and permanently. He claims that Jesus somehow detected this during his lifetime and glimpses of this insight are found within the New Testament- if it is properly interpreted. Armed with this assumption, the author then states that the Christian creeds and even the Bible (both OT and NT) have seriously mistinterpreted what is the truth on the issue of violence. He points out, in some detail, the huge differences within the Bible on the issue of God's violence, and His authorization of violence to His followers. He then cites many of the atrocities that God's permission of violence has produced in history. He then says that a real follower of Jesus must choose between these competing views of violence. Nelson-Pallmeyer is honest enough to say that his view of violence cannot be 'proven', but neither can the opposing view be 'proven'. He claims the support of some very notable liberal theologians.If he is right, then far reaching conclusions emerge for today's Christians. He names the spirit of the world (past and present) and most monotheists as constituting the \`domination system'. This label indicates the idea of various kinds of physical violence used to dominate other human beings, contrary to what Jesus wished. This system corrupts both its direct perpetrators and most religious people who are indirectly supporting it. God's compassion is overwhelmed by the alleged God's (violent) justice. What Jesus wanted was for all humans to detect and live the \`abundant life' that God makes available to us in the present. By so doing, we can possibly slowly remake the world to be the nonviolent environment that mirrors God Himself.However, this reviewer disagrees with the author's basic assumption. If you assume that monotheism is correct, then consider the following: if God created the universe that we experience, then how did He do it? By some smooth gentle process? No! If modern science is substantially correct, then He did by a process of unimaginable violence (big bang), and this evolving universe is constantly being changed by violent processes. Even on earth, elements violently collide with each other, nature is structured as predator and prey (nature \`red in tooth and claw'), all that we humans eat to sustain our lives are the bodies of living animals (meat) that we kill or living plants that we kill. History is full of examples of people being violent to one another. Why would a completely nonviolent God create such a violent environment for us? To say that God is totally and permanently nonviolent is an assumption without much historical and empirical evidence.To say that violent images can be distorted is another matter. Most Christian scholars in history have noted the different images of God regarding violence in the Bible. But their response was to try to harmonize the differences rather than to eliminate the differences. For Christians, heresies were usually the result of some process of reductionism- eliminating troubling ideas from scripture, instead of integrating things into a higher unity. This author is continuing a long tradition, usually credited to a scholar named David Strauss, of trying to separate the \`Jesus of History' from the \`Christ of Faith'. Those who disbelieved in supernatural events would simply eliminate them from scripture- thus eliminating whatever they disagreed with. When applied to the foundations of Christianity (Bible and Creeds), all such attempts are reductionisms. The issue of God's violence is so central to the faith that just wars and apocalyptic thinking and actions hang in the balance- the author is correct about the importance of this issue. Can God's compassion and justice be balanced, and His abundant life be realized, without some kind of violence? Classic (theistic) Buddhists and the author's Jesus think so. Although this reviewer thinks not, Nelson-Pallmeyer's kind of faith, if it becomes widespread, would be a welcome improvement on the typical uncritical behavior of many Christians. Orthopraxy trumps Orthodoxy--- if you can't have both."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"This book is great. I recommend it to anyone interested in liberal theology. It is almost an apologetic for non-fundamentalist thinking."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"This book reflects the views of an individual who envisions a world of peace and justice. Isn't this what we all want? But to ignore the fact that there is evil in the world, or to blame that evil on the God of the Holy Bible being vengeful, murderous, insane, and even schizophrenic in nature, is not only an exceedingly unjust act itself, but simply AND profoundly incorrect. The author is an Assistant Professor of Justice and Peace Studies, but he completely lacks knowledge of history. Over and over, vengeful, murderous, greedy individuals, people who were created in the image of God but who chose paths of violence to suit their selfish interests, have come into power and oppressed people. He acknowledges this about the Romans, but then tries to make oppression and violence appear as outgrowths of a God-fearing people. (The Romans were a pagan culture.) Every brand of religion as been subjugated as a means of controlling people by individuals attaining and then misusing power. While the God of the Holy Bible did indeed allocate land for His people, you need to learn more history than this book or any other single book could cover to discover how it truly began and how it played out. (The story began long before Abraham. Remember, the first words in the Holy Bible are \\"In the beginning...\\") It is hypocritical, and in the long run, harmful to his cause, when authors like Jack Nelson-Pallmeyer promote their utopia of a just society by being untruthful and by advocating injustice (even if it is passive), rebellion, and revolt toward people who do not share his views, as you will find in the final chapter. Late in the game, he's trying to hijack Jesus to further his vision just as so many he opposes have done."},{"Title":"Jesus Against Christianity: Reclaiming the Missing Jesus","review":"This book is positively awful. I am not a Christian, but this book still presented an extremely poor argument to me. The premise is acceptable, but the author clearly skewes this book to fit his own religious views.

The evidence he presents for his arguments is shaky at best, and many of his biblical translations are completely different than every other source I checked.

His tale breaks off before the revolution kicks into high gear in the late 70s.This is an impressionistic account that powerfully conveys experiences of solidarity, courage, self-doubt, and resistance.

After that, take a class or learn more formally, but this will really give you a leg up into actually using the language."},{"Title":"Modern Hebrew I, 2nd Edition (Pimsleur Language Program)","review":"The right way to think about Pimsleur is as a glorified phrasebook. It teaches you some useful phrases, and it has a few added advantages: (1) it teaches you to vary the elements a little (2) it helps you with pronunciation (3) you can listen to it in the car, when textbooks and flashcards aren't handy. It also comes with some disadvantages: (1) it's much, much more expensive and (2) it doesn't teach you to read or write. In Hebrew, the latter is non-trivial.As a result, it's most useful for learning the numbers, since this involves practicing combining a few elements in a variety of forms as quickly as you can. (This is a little harder in Hebrew than in most languages, since you have to learn the masculine and feminine forms of each number.)Buyers should also be aware of certain editorial choices the creators made. Some grammatical and phonological forms in Hebrew are omitted by many speakers, even though they're required in formal registers and widely perceived as being more \\"correct.\\" Examples: (1) \\"And in shekels?\\" is given as \\"vebeshkalim?\\" not \\"uvishkalim?\\" (2) \\"She lives\\" is given as \\"hi GARah,\\" (stress on the first syllable) whereas in formal Hebrew \\"hi GARah\\" means \\"she lived\\" and \\"hi garAH\\" means \\"she lives.\\" (3) \\"Harbeh\\" is used in some places where formal Hebrew requires \\"rav\\" (4) The two Hebrew words for \\"why\\": \\"lammah\\" and \\"madua,\\" are not distinguished; lammah is used everywhere. Some of these choices are justified for pedagogical purposes--many Israelis omit these features, after all--but others involve teaching forms that are actively stigmatized. For instance, Pimsleur consistently uses \\"eizeh\\" for \\"which\\", but many Israelis view this as an error, and use different forms for masculine (eizeh), feminine (eizo), and plural (eilu) nouns.I think a lot of the appeal for something like Pimsleur comes from the idea that it tries to teach languages without formal grammar (ugh, who likes that), the way children learn it. The thing is, research seems to indicate that children don't really learn languages more easily than adults; we just don't remember the years of slogging it took to learn our native language. In fact, a lot of features and regularities are actually quicker to learn with a textbook and some admittedly unpleasant memorization. For instance, with a textbook you'll instantly see that the verbs \\"hayah\\" (be), \\"raah\\" (see), \\"kanah\\" (buy), unlike other verbs, take an \\"i\\" sound in the past tense because the third letter of their root is \\"heh\\", instead of having to learn the paradigm anew for each verb with Pimsleur.The bottom line: If you want to learn Hebrew well, be prepared to work really, really hard. Pimsleur can still be a component--but only a component--of your study plan. But keep in mind that you'll do almost as well with a textbook and some elbow grease, and it'll cost you a lot less."},{"Title":"Heatwave","review":"Another one of John Patrick's popular anthologies of gay erotica: HEATWAVE features a hunky Brit cover model Jay Alexander courtesy of Mike Arlen's Guys Studio in London.

I have a collection of his poetry books in Italian, plus this translation by Anthony Reid with illustrations by J. Martin Pitts. I myself had the honor of being Stefani's first translator. I corresponded with both Stefani and Reid. Stefani is one of my favorite poets. People really need to learn Italian so as to explore writers who are rarely translated. Stefani killed himself ten years ago. I was not expecting this and was quite shocked. The theme of his poetry is the same as with Sandro Penna, namely ragazzi. This effectively puts him out of the sympathy range for about, oh, 99% of possible readers. But fine poetry is fine whether you like the theme or not."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Hamlet","review":"This book is the essential resource for anyone who wants to understand Hamlet. I eagerly recommend it to students from 8th grade to master's level, and to anyone who plans to teach this play. This text contains the complete original play, expert commentary, and very useful additional resources. Dr. Mategrano has done a thorough job of explaining the play, providing historical, theatrical, social, and religious background information. Explanations are provided to such crucial questions as why Hamlet, the dead king's only son, did not automatically become the reigning monarch. I found the section on the status of women to be especially insightful into the behavior of Gertrude and Ophelia. Anyone who teaches, studies or attends a performance of Hamlet will benefit greatly from having read this text."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Hamlet","review":"This book is a great way to make it through Hamlet and actually understand it! The sidenotes really help wtih the vocab, and at the end of each chapter is a commentary that pieces everything together so it totally makes sense."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Hamlet","review":"This book is a fantastic resource for anyone wanting to read the actual text of Shakespeare's Hamlet, including those who won't typically venture into the realm of Shakespeare. The book contains the actual text of the play, as well as an extensive introduction that discusses the history of Shakespeare and his times and brief history of Hamlet itself. Each scene starts with a brief summary of its contents, which keys the reader into what they are about to read, and the thought-provoking analysis at the end of each scene helps the reader digest and more fully understand what they just read.The real strength of this book, however, is the translation of the less common phrases on the same page as the text. The glossary allows the reader to quickly understand more obscure phrases in the context of the play without losing their place, pace, or rhythm. The glossary makes this version of Hamlet shine and it makes the play accessible to all readers. I found that I was learning phrases and getting more used to Shakespeare's language as the play progressed, so I didn't need to refer to the glossary as often near the end of the play.Finally, although relatively simple, the index is a huge resource. I read the play for a class, and the index made flipping to a particular scene much easier. Looking up \\"Laertes, Apology from Hamlet\\" (or \\"Hamlet, Apology to Laertes\\") is far easier than trying to recall the act, scene, and line of a particular event.Whether for education or pleasure, this is an excellent resource and a huge help for anyone who wants to read and understand Hamlet. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete Hamlet","review":"Excellent scene summaries; helpful vocabulary definitions in margins; good comprehension questions at end.

In this large and fascinating volume we meet the minds that analyzed and chronicled the lives these women lived and observed.One might argue about the selections included and excluded here. Pearl Buck, the only woman to win both a Nobel Prize (1938) and a Pulitzer (1932) is excluded.The book is divided into 6 eras, each with a lengthy \\"period introduction\\" giving historical and thematic backgrounds for the works included in that section.From the five earliest women writers (dating from 700 to 1600), women began to shape and define their literary voices. England's first professional woman writer, Aphra Behn, whose literary career began in 1670, is the writer who women must honor above all others. According to Virginia Woolf, \\"it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.\\"Here the reader will find rare works such as Jane Austen's \\"Love and Friendship\\" and George Eliot's \\"The Lifted Veil.\\" Three notable novels are included in their entirety: JANE EYRE by Charlotte Bronte, THE AWAKENING by Kate Chopin, and THE BLUEST EYE by Toni Morrison.Poems, stories, memoirs, essays, plays, letters, novels -- all literary works originally composed in English -- over 150 authors decrying, exalting, agonizing over, and celebrating the things we all have in common: Life...love...and death.This is a fascinating collection and one that will stand reading and re-reading over a long period of time."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women: The Traditions in English","review":"This anthology has been more relevant to me over the years since I've graduated from college (with a BA in English) than any of the others I own.

I am constantly pulling it from the shelf to look up the author bios, historical background information, etc. But more than that, I really enjoy returning to it to read favorite poems and short stories by the most celebrated women writers of all time. I have given this anthology as a gift and recommended it on numerous occasions to friends and acquaintances who are interested in further understanding women's history, literature, feminism, etc. I also have some of the literary criticism the editors have written (Madwomen in the Attic, others) and recommend those as well."},{"Title":"The Norton Anthology of Literature by Women: The Traditions in English","review":"I first opened this book because of a Women's Lit class I took last year. Sure, I was excited, but I really did not expect to find it interesting. After all, the public school system only allows a few women writers to be taught: Mary Shelly, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Kate Chopin, and Emily Dickerson. But what about the many wonderful women writes who have not been taught at length? Anne Sexton, Toni Morrison, Elizabeth Bareet Browning, Christina Rosettie, Maya Angelou, Sylvia Plath, Anne Finch...the list is endless, literally. Every woman should own a copy of this book, regardless of whether you need it or not. It is time to spread the enormous talent of the world's best poets and authors.

Unbeknownst to everyone who speculates about this benefactor is that though he dresses like a man, MIDNIGHT ANGEL is Lady Lydia Beaumont, wife of an earl dying from syphilis.Actress Louise Canfield visits Beau and Lydia to obtain help as someone abducted her teenage daughter from the theater. Louise informs a stunned Beau that Sophia is his child from a long ago tryst. Beau's friends Todd and Clara Leach obtain the services of Lord \\"Clue\\", Hugh Montgomery known for solving cases. However, he and Lydia know each other from when they fell in love five years ago when she was known as Addie Parker. He thought she was dead while she felt he deserted her. As they work together, their love remains strong, but before either can think of the future a young girl needs rescuing.Readers will enjoy this Victorian romance starring two intrepid females trying to break the mode that leaves women in lesser roles. From the start, the story line grips the audience with Louise dressed as a man trying to rescue an aging whore who just lost her teen child to a nasty John. Though the personal relationship between Louise and Hugh is heated, resolution is simplified with Beaus' deteriorating health. Still fans will relish this powerful historical romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Midnight Angel","review":"I love Julie Beard, and I just wrote a glowing review for her book, the Duchess' Lover, of which this is a sequel of. I started Midnight Angel with high hopes, and while it's not a complete waste of time, it doesn't measure up to the first book. There is some good stuff here, but there were a lot of weak points as well.Hugh and Lydia share a past, and it's always nice to see the hero pining away for his true love. :-) It was different that we watched him battle his drug addiction and we found out about Lydia's painful past. And for once we see, in Lord Beaumont, what the price is for being a rake and bedding all those prostitues. It was nice to see Clara and Todd again, from the Duchess' Lover. I hope she makes it through this pregnancy okay.But there were problems here too. The pace was a bit odd. They started out only having a few days to solve the crime, but you never really feel the urgency. And then a week or two later we have the show down. And I was left feeling that Hugh really didn't do a whole lot. He didn't find the girl...he was led around by the nose by the villian. There wasn't a whole lot of characterization in this story with more focus being on the murder plot. The whole channeling of Sherlock Holmes was very obvious though not a terrible thing. I never really believed anyone could mistake Lydia for a man and I waited with baited breath for some smallest mention of the beloved Duchess from the last book...but in vain.So I guess, it's a matter of, not the worst book I ever read, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Midnight Angel","review":"Lady Lydia Beumont, the young wife of an earl dying of syphalis, knows knows what it is like to be without options and left to fend for oneself in London.

I bought this book for the pretty cover. Though, a few pages in, I wondered why the designer bothered to change Dante's \\"Proserpina\\" from a brunette to a redhead considering that the heroine of the book was also a brunette. But I digress.Our heroine has a secret identity. Once a prostitute, she is now undercover as the Midnight Angel, who rescues women from the streets and helps them return to respectable work. She becomes embroiled in a crime investigation, and winds up working with her former lover, and sparks fly as they race against time to rescue a young girl from a twisted Druidic cult.What worked for me: The heroine wasn't innocent! I loved the conflict within her as she desired to be passionate with her lover but felt compelled to hide her experience from him. It was a realistic struggle that was more interesting than the parade of virgins who simper their way through most romance novels. Also, I liked the cult. Twisted version of paganism as it was, it was still fun to see White-Goddess-ish material in the novel.What didn't work for me: Mostly, the whole idea of the Midnight Angel sweeping hookers off into \\"real\\" occupations. I've read several novels depicting the same period, very well-researched ones like *The Crimson Petal and the White* and *Slammerkin*. Many of the women who were prostitutes during this period got into \\"the life\\" not because they had no other opportunities, but because the other opportunities were even more grueling and degrading. I just can't see these women gushing, \\"Oh, Midnight Angel, thank you so much for saving me from prostitution so I can work 20 hours a day in a sweatshop instead!\\""},{"Title":"Midnight Angel","review":"This was such a waste of money and such a waste of time. There's a lengthy review which refers to the books focus on opium addiction and prostitution in 1880's england. The story line is rather stupid and not believable that the &quot;midnight angel&quot; is a female in disguise venturing to the slums in the middle of the night. I don't know why I bought this book but...I tossed it by the end of the 2nd chapter. Even the writing is stilted and formal and the main characters aren't warm and likeable. Can't find a good thing to say about it except that I dumped it."},{"Title":"Midnight Angel","review":"Lydia Parker and Lord Hugh Montgomery share a past of pain and shattered dreams. Now Lydia is the wife of the Earl of Beaumont, and she must put all the anger and distrust she feels for Hugh behind her in order to find her husband's kidnapped illegitimate daughter, for Hugh has become one of England's topnotch criminal investigators, and if anyone can help them find the missing girl, it's Hugh. But while putting aside her feelings of anger and injury may not be as difficult as she had foreseen, can Lydia also sweep aside the treacherous feeling of passion and tenderness she seems to still harbour for Hugh?It's not an easy thing to do -- writing a novel, that is. And it is even more difficult to write an evenly paced and balanced novel that has two subplots that have to share equal prominence. And unfortunately, in spite of the many promising plot premises, ultimately, Julie Beard's &quot;Midnight Angel&quot; proved to be a bit of a bland read for me. Part of the problem, I felt, was that things were stretched out too thin. Where the kidnapping subplot was concerned there was no sense of urgency. Lydia and Hugh had only a few days to find the missing girl, and yet because of the poor pacing there was no sense of urgency or tension(or if there was, I definitely did not sense this). Clues fell conveniently into their laps with very little investigating on their parts, and given that the authour had gone through the trouble of setting up a rather interesting alter-ego for Lydia, the very fact that this entire plot gambit was very poorly featured throughout the novel was rather frustrating. Also, as the book reached it's finale, the entire kidnapping/mysterious deaths subplot took on elements of the farcical that almost beggared belief mainly because that entire subplot had not (in my opinion) been properly developed.The other problem with this novel was the supposed romance subplot. For me, this subplot lacked energy. We know about the painful history that lies between Hugh and Lydia, and that Lydia feels a lot of anger towards Hugh. No matter if this anger was justified or not, if Lydia had held onto this anger for at least half the book, it might have made for a more exciting read. As it was, one had to settle for Hugh languishing looks of longing and tenderness for Lydia, and her alternately melting and pushing him away.Unfortunately, in spite of the rather promising subplot premises, &quot;Midnight Angel&quot; didn't exactly take off. The entire novel lacked focus, proper character development and energy. And this was a shame because the book could have been a rather engrossing read."},{"Title":"Midnight Angel","review":"It's rare that one reads a book and at the conclusion decides the author was completely mad at the time of writing it, but this is one of those cases. The plot is terribly convoluted, and the novel features characters that are highly unsympathetic. For instance, the heroine is a former prostitute and the hero a drug addict. Top this off with a bizzare club for homosexual men that defies the realms of ordinary imagination, and you've got the ingredients for a terrible book. PLEASE don't read it. I feel like Ms. Beard owes me four hours of my life spent wasted reading the drivel she calls a novel."},{"Title":"Midnight Angel","review":"I didn't particularly like the characters; it all felt too contrived.

This poet has a strangely wonderful diction in which he twines the vernacular with the formal, the observant with the speculative. His isolation has saved him from faddishness and foppery -- he wouldn't have much use for a creative writing exercise, much less a workshop -- and he is an original from sole to crown. Imagine Paddy Kananaugh without the Dublin literary partisanship, or Robert Penn Warren without the Fugitive amalgamation! I strongly recommend starting with this book and feasting on as much Scarbrough as you can lay your eyes across."},{"Title":"The Modern Amazons : Warrior Women on Screen","review":"What this fun, engaging book lacks in depth, it makes up for in breadth. I did not find this especially helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the changing roles that strong female characters have been playing in popular culture in the past several decades, but no book I know can match it for its range and scope. I've done a great deal of reading about women in the movies and on TV, but this books goes way beyond that to show how women have appeared in a vast array of media during recent years. I give the book 4 stars instead of less simply because it provides an incredible services by calling attention to strong women in a number of areas that have been neglected in previous surveys. Nonetheless, I think the book can at best serve as a jumping off point for further work. But by helping map out the areas where strong women can be discerned is an invaluable service. It was very close to being a near complete cataloging of the most important female figures in popular media. There were a few minor omissions, but as far as I can tell only one major one: the inexplicable failure to mention FARSCAPE, the show above all others that not only features multiple strong female characters but places these in a non-patriarchal universe. No show I know engages gender issues so interestingly and few female characters on TV are as pertinent to the authors' discussion as Claudia Black's character Aeryn Sun.This is also one of the more lavishly illustrated books that you can ever hope to own. There are photos on nearly every page of the book, many of them full page.There are, however, a number of problems with the book. First, the sheer breadth means that nothing can be discussed in much depth. I was ecstatic when the authors bring up Third Wave Feminism (many TV critics look at shows like BUFFY or DARK ANGEL and describe them as post-feminist, when in fact they are better understood in the light of the Third Wave), but not much more than that is done with it. Still, kudos for bringing that up at all! More troubling is the utter lack of critical distinction in bringing up all the various \\"Amazons.\\" The brute fact is that many of the shows and movies mentioned are just flat out awful. CHARMED is discussed as well as BUFFY, with no indication that CHARMED is critically reviled while BUFFY is by consensus one of the masterpieces of television. BLADE: TRINITY, ELEKTRA, and CATWOMAN are mixed in with THELMA AND LOUISE and BLADE RUNNER, with no mention that the first three were universally trashed. There is a long discussion of Linda Carter's turn as WONDER WOMAN, but no mention that 1) the show is bad and 2) Wonder Woman on the show is distressingly subservient to men and spends most of her time trying to make her boss look good. I can fully understand a discussion of Xena in a book like this, but there is no acknowledgment that the show has always been a cult favorite, but has been universally considered a not very good show, while she doesn't by contrast bring up the enormous critical acclaim of BUFFY, ALIAS, and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.Finally, there is that term \\"Amazon.\\" The book wants to celebrate the various warrior women in popular culture, but roping the majority of the women into that category is a bit of a stretch. I absolutely love Emma Peel in THE AVENGERS, but I have a lot of trouble viewing her under either the category of a warrior woman or an Amazon. A very strong female character? Absolutely. But I think the book stretches conceptual categories a bit more broadly than is advisable.Nonetheless, I definitely recommend the book. The panoramic scope outweighs weaknesses. At the very least it has mapped out the terrain to be explored in any discovery of strong female characters in popular culture."},{"Title":"The Modern Amazons : Warrior Women on Screen","review":"After briefly citing some references to women warriors in ancient mythology and history, the authors with broad backgrounds in film studies and popular culture note their book does not speculate \\"about the possible existence of Amazon women in the past, but rather document[s] the proliferation of the warrior woman archetype in popular culture, film and television in particular.\\" An encyclopedic filmography and another back section on women warrior movies and television series records the varieties of this proliferation. Used loosely, the term woman warrior encompasses not only women warriors like men soldiers, but also women detectives, science-fiction characters, prehistoric humans, cowgirls, spies, martial arts experts, athletes (e. g., \\"Million Dollar Baby\\"), and more or less ordinary women who at moments accomplish extraordinary feats such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Though such extraordinary women characters transgressing the conventional image of women can be found in films from its beginning in the early 1900s, the overwhelming majority are from the post-WWII years with the numbers of films increasing exponentially in recent years as gender roles have weakened and popular interest in the potentials for women has grown. The approach is to classify the categories of \\"warrior women\\" and discuss the women characters and the films or TV shows in each category. Like the term \\"warrior women\\" itself, the categories are loose. But the aim is not strict definition, rather recognition of the expansion and diversity of this genre involving unconventional, in many cases quite imaginative women characters.

There is less analysis about the characters and stories in the overall big picture of feminist films.There is a bibliography, but few sources are cited within the text; the casual reader to whom this is aimed may not care, but academics should.A more academic, but less broad, book on the same topic is Rikke Schubart's \\"Super Bitches and Action Babes;\\" the theories she applies to some of her subjects can be applied easily to others.

Here is Wonder Woman and Batgirl, Princess Leah and lots of pictures of Xena.Along with the pictures is a discussion of warrior women in history, myth and literature, and a from this a discussion of how they have been portrayed in film over the past forty years or so.This is a discussion of an aspect of pop-culture that has not been covered very well in the literature.

An illustrated filmography and alphabetical list of warrior women finish off the book. In some ways, this is more of a 'guys' book - chock full of scantily clad women. But interesting nonetheless.

Lowry not only exposes the problems, he offers very viable solutions that merely need the political support of the common man to be implimented. Unfortunately, since this book's publication things have gotten worse, especially in Canada. One of my biggest frustrations has always been that the American public doesn't know the extent to which self-serving congressional interests are ruining our national treasures by preventing the NPS from doing its congressionally mandated mission of historic and natural preservation. It's not just budget cuts folks! As Lowry explains, its mega-cooperation owned concessions exploiting visitors at the expense of the very ecological health of parks in the name of &quot;visitor services.&quot; It's scientific research intentionally poorly funded and results ignored, or worse yet, severely censored before they are allowed to be released to the general public. And it's all here, well documented in &quot;The Capacity for Wonder&quot; including scores of interviews with rangers from all over the continent who haven't given up... yet. This book is for all of us rangers who dare not speak because we have to feed our families, and for all you voters and tax payers who do &quot;GIVE A DAMN!&quot; but until now, just don't quite have enough accurate information to act."},{"Title":"The Capacity for Wonder: Preserving National Parks","review":"This book examines national parks in the United States and Canada, two neighboring countries with extensive park systems. Clearly each of these countries can learn from the other's experience, and Lowry's book is an excellent introduction to the similarities and differences in the two park systems. He also provides extensive discussion of a sampling of parks in each country, some well-known and others not well-known at all.Lowry's central theoretical framework examines political support for the parks and the degree of consensus on the goals for parks. He treats these as if they were exogenous, independent variables. However, clearly the political economy of each country affects these goals. A pro-development agency such as the Army Corps of Engineers enjoys political consensus because it operates in a pro-development political system. It's hard to know how you could change the Corps (or many other agencies) without changing the political system as a whole.The research and most of his writing reflects the Reagan and G. H. W. Bush administrations, which were hostile to the environment. Thus, his book casts US politics as generally \\"bad,\\" while Canadian policies are generally \\"good.\\" However - - as he realizes - - the history of the two park systems is very different, and for most of the twentieth century he would have classified Parks Canada as having worse policy than the US National Park Service.To better understand the two countries, Lowry should distinguish more clearly between the legislative and executive factors affecting the parks. As Lowry acknowledges, Clinton's Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt had very different priorities than the Reagan and Bush administrations, yet the system of congressional pork remained unchanged. Understanding park policy means separating out changes in executives from continuities in the legislature. Moving outside his framework of consensus and support to consider executive-legislative relations would be helpful.Looking more closely at executive-legislative relations would also enrich his comparison of the US and Canada. Obviously, Canada's parliamentary system works very differently than the presidential system in the United States. Ironically, Lowry does discuss the differences in federalism in the two countries, though in a global perspective there are more similarities than differences between US and Canadian federalism.Those objections aside, this is a notable book. The literature on national parks is dominated by historians, and it is welcome to have a different discipline's perspectives on the issues."},{"Title":"Will You Be My Valenswine?","review":"Poor Polly feels rejected, because all her animal friends have sweethearts. Thus, Polly sets out in search for a valentine, but asks inanimate objects such as a rose bush, and her slop to be her valentine. Kids understand how silly it is to pose such questions to a rose, and to slop, so they laugh. The illustrations are soft and simply rendered with little details, but enough to get the point across. The pages are colorful with lots of neutrals, greens, pinks, and reds.I'm partial to this story because it's about a parent's love for their child, and young children relate to that. The text is a blast to read aloud. Bateman works the meter like a pro, and I purposely read the story fast for emphasis. The 24-paged book only takes about 3-minutes to read aloud, thus I recommend it to the 3 to 7 crowd. Fun holiday story, or for year round reading as well."},{"Title":"Will You Be My Valenswine?","review":"This is for my 4 year old granddaughter.

This covers the first half of her dazzling life. Her prose is like her acting: direct, simple, intelligent, moving, riveting and unforgettable. Anyone even remotely interested in the theatre should take the opportunity to read this marvellous book. And if there is ever a chance to see the lady on a stage, RUN, don't walk, to get in line. A great book by a great artist."},{"Title":"I Will Be Cleopatra: An Actress's Journey","review":"Zoe Caldwell OBE is one of theatre's finest living actresses with one problem. Outside the theatre circles, most people haven't the faintest clue who she is. Despite that she has won four Tony awards and is probably in the New York Theatre Hall of Fame, most people don't know who she is. In this book, she chronicles her modest upbringing from Melbourne, Australia and her experiences in the Australian theatre before venturing to Stratford to act in Shakespeare and finally to North America where she settled in Westchester, New York with her husband, producer Robert Whitehead and their two sons. She also worked as a stage actress. THe book stops by the time that she plays Cleopatra in Shakespeare's play. To her, the stage is the thing and the ultimate pursuit for the actor in their art. She doesn't go out and sell herself to endorse products. She doesn't get the roles that go to other equally trained and veteran actresses in the films and television nor does she care about that. She is quite happy being in the theatre. I was kind of interested in her experiences with Dame Edith Evans, Albert Finney, Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn, and others and her time abroad in England before coming to America where she has felt most at home in the theatre on stage mostly in New York. This quadruple Tony Winner is a winner in the field of drama where she pursues the ultimate experience as the actor in playing before the audience. She has never failed her audience."},{"Title":"The Quotable Fisherman","review":"Having read several books by Nick Lyons, this one was typical of his style of writing.

Now if only we could have an inexpensive anthology that covers the classical through the Renaissance periods."},{"Title":"Master Game","review":"Gary Gygax, Master of the Game (Perigee, 1989)I picked this up blind hoping I'd found an autobiography by the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons, but alas, it was not to be. What it is, however, certainly has merit: a guide to making yourself into a better Game Master from a guy who's been doing it for pretty much his whole adult life. It's basically an inspirational-business title for gamers. (Think The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Half-Orcs combined with Start and Run Your Own Money-Making Tavern.) It gets a bit self-aggrandizing at times, which can be grating, but can you blame the guy? After all, he did write most of the early source material."},{"Title":"Master Game","review":"Way back in the late 60s I came across a copy of this book. This at the time was the only book of its kind available in commercial bookstore. Nearly forty years later there are many books which may be similar, but Master Game continues to shine as a glowing example of how one can approach spiritual life."},{"Title":"Master Game","review":"This is one of the most essential books I have acquired in my life-long search for higher meaning. It is a handbook to read over and over. It would be a mistake to think that it is outdated because it was written in the 1960's. It is even more urgent and compelling. For example, \\"In man the will to power has operated at various times as a destructive force, activating certain individuals to become 'conquerors' and to destroy vast numbers of their fellowmen in the process. It is certainly a dangerous will and badly needs restraining and directing, especially in the contemporary period of 'megadeath' and 'overkill.'\\" His occasional acerbity is refreshing; he does not waste a word."},{"Title":"Master Game","review":"A pioneer of the \\"Master Game\\".

The Master Game is not about using drugs; it's about going beyond them to personal enlightenment. It details the games people play, much like Toffler, then it defines the Master Game: one in which the person is not so involved with their life that their view is blinded by personal situations, much like Dyer's observer. If you got beyond the drugs in Castaneda, you can discover the genius of The Master Game. It is truly a book to base your attitude on."},{"Title":"Master Game","review":"I bought this thinking that it was a semi-autobiographical book in which Gygax talked about the creation and development of D&D.; Not the case: this is his advice on how to perfect your skills as a game master and get the players involved. There's almost no autobiographical information in it.Having read both, I would say this has been completely blown out of the water by the 4e Dungeon Master's Guide, whose wealth of sage counsel on this topic makes Gygax look like a neophyte. True, James Wyatt has like 30+ years of experience and all of Gygax's wisdom to build on, but still."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"Being a survivor myself I really need books like that ... and the beginning was great, the details and facts. However when I came to the chapter of incest between siblings and she explains that it is more a problem for the elder brother than for the younger sister and downplays the situation among siblings, I thought this book needs to be burnt and taken off the selling list. This is a total non-understanding of the situation and adds to the guilt of the smaller sister in this case. Unbelievable how an author can put things the ways she did. Besides that - there is a lot, a hell of a lot of self-promotion which is not exactly what somebody concerned needs."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"What do you say when you read something like this? What do you say when you know deep down inside somebody's life has been destroyed this totally? What do you say when you understand an innocent human life has been annihilated? What do you say when you realize that a person can be so selfishly preoccupied with their own agenda that they go through life hurting other people without batting an eye, all because they are blinded by their own painful circumstances and negative self image? There are some who will read this and for the first time in their lives recognize the harm these innocent victims have suffered(like me), but whatever they realize about it, it will represent only a small fraction of what the victims really suffer, through every day of their tortured lives. When another human being has no empathy or compassion for others, they hurt people. They cannot give what they do not have...empathy, and their lives are driven by their own selfishness. Empathy and compassion can be learned though. It's never too late, but so many are hurt before that point is reached that the guilt, shame, and reproach are almost too much to overcome, and many will take their lives, one way or another, before they ever get there.Life is full of choices, and every bad decision we make has the potential to hurt someone else. I should know...I have made plenty. What do you say, when \\"sorry\\"...is not enough? I hope and pray for the fullest recovery of these innocent victims...and wish for them to know that what happened to them...is not in any way their fault. They are zero% responsible for what happened to them. May God make His face to shine upon them always, share with them His patient and unending love, lift their spirits, and give them grace and mercy in all things.God grant us the wisdom to make the right choices and decisions in our lives...the courage to act on those right choices and decisions...and the strength to persevere in His righteousness.This is a great work by Dr. Susan Forward. How I wish she would contact me some day. Everyone that reads this book will develop a level of compassion and empathy they did not have before...of that, you may be assured. God bless the victims with His unconditional love, and help them on their way to a full recovery."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"I didn't read this book! I'm relaying my husband's critique. I read Forward's more recent book Toxic Parents and it was sooo helpful. My Christain counselor somewhat assigned it as homework between my 1st and second appointment. Wow! So we decided to try this one. My husband read both her books first as my personal screener (yes, he's that wonderful). He felt reading this book might be more of a hindrance to my healing since it so raw. Warning! It is not Christain, (neither is Toxic Parents) and has some thoughts that would be disturbing to a healing Christain. He felt it was more about telling tragic stories about incest vs ways to heal. He felt Forward grew a lot as a person and counselor between writing the two books. If you're new to the healing process of incest, I strongly recommend the Toxic Parents as a starter, then use [...] to find a local Christain counselor."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"I was hoping to gain insight into the repercussions of incest. I couldn't get past the beginning of the book, as it was filled with Freudian pseudoscience.Perhaps another revision is in order."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"I read this book on the advice of my therapist. Eventhough I read this book at least 15 years ago, I can still remember vividly the encounters of other children as recounted by the author. Although I read most of the book with blurry vision due to tears, I also felt some comfort from knowing that I wasn't alone, that I wasn't to blame, and that I had no reason to feel guilty. The analysis of the author between some of the cases was very insightful. I learned how much responsibility my mom actually shared in the incest, although as a child I thought of her as being completely innocent. I thought I was protecting her with my silence. This book was a great comfort for me. I hope that others who have been victims of incest will also find it to be a comfort."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"This is a good starting place for anyone wishing to research the subject of incest.

Even though it's been in print for 20 years, it's up to date and still the best book available."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"This book takes an amazingly balanced view. It describes the complete dynamics of all types of incest, including Father-Daughter, Mother-Son, Father-Son, Mother-Daughter, and extended family. It also has an excellent chapter on suggested modifications to our legal and social system that would help the problem.I do not agree with the review that the book describes the aggressor as always being some kind of horrible person. Sometimes this is the case, but the book shows a more significant social issue in that the aggressor is often \\"the average joe\\" with a significant boundary crossing issue that must be resolved. She indicates that incest may be a much more prevalent problem than most people are willing to admit, particularly if you extend the definition of incest to include inappropriate sexual behaviors beyond intercourse, and may affect up to 40% of women in the U.S.!I found Susan Forward's suggestions that our social outrage and reactions to the incest taboo are very destructive to society, in that it prevents disclosure of incest, and makes positive and effective treatment of the victim and the aggressor very difficult; that our reaction in this particular kind of crime, society and the family are almost always better served by modifications of our legal system to better treat the entire family dynamic as well as the personal issues of the aggressor, who she claims is the \\"most easily rehabilitated\\" of all of the sex offenders. I was surprised to learn that she has seen success rates of up to 90% in reuniting entire families after incidents of incest, which would be impossible if the offenders were the stereotypical \\"heartless scum\\" that we see in the popular media.All this from a person who herself was a victim of incest.I think this book should be required reading in our high schools."},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"\\"Incest was once called the ultimate taboo. Today we realize that it is a reality with which millions cope on a daily basis. In this insightful and sensitive book, Dr. Susan Forward, bestselling author of Men Who Hate Women and the Women Who Love Them and renowned expert on sexual abuse and addictive relationships, uses twenty-five case histories--including father and daughter, mother and son, siblings, grandfather and granddaughter, mother and daughter, and father and son-to explore the traumatic effects of incest and to analyze its causes and consequences on every member of a family. In Betrayal of Innocence, Forward shows that the public's new awareness of the problem and increased availability of treatment can be of enormous benefit to victims and their families. By breaking the silence that has always surrounded this devastating subject, Betrayal of Innocence offers practical help and comfort to the survivors of child abuse and to those who love, live, or work with them.\\""},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"This has been the most amazing and eye opening book for me. I have also shared it with my therapist. My abuse was by my father so the father-daughter incest is of most interest to me. I have learned all of the below from this book!!!It explains how and why incest occurs. It describes how the child perceives the event, the personality of an abuser, and the dynamics of abuse and the incestuous family. It talks about the aftereffects, diagnosis (PTSD) and treatment. We often have traumatic reenactment as we become sexual in outside relationships. We are either disconnected sexually from our bodies or we act out sexually with multiple, often random partners.Being sexual or doing things for others was the only way I felt I was of any value to anyone else. Why else would they love me if I didn't service them? How else was I of any intrinsic value? I felt power, love and acceptance when I sexually pleased a man. This became my goal in relationships and was how I attracted men. I have confused love, guilt and sex and seen myself as a sexual object.We must have the understanding of the child's reality, understand that it confounds and contradicts adult logic. Incest abuse is a process with five stages. The child usually learns to accept and accommodate and basic trust is violated. This causes fundamental trust issues for the victim for the rest of his/her life. The family is often enmeshed with lack of appropriate boundaries and role reversals where the child often becomes the significant other to the abuser.To understand why children blame themselves look only at the child's perception of reality and their defense systems. To a young child, adults, especially parents, are the embodiment of all wisdom and goodness. The child must believe the parent is good because the child is totally helpless and dependent upon the parent. To believe, even for a moment, that a trusted adult is bad would be terrifying and overwhelming. THEREFORE, IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS, THE CHILD AUTOMATICALLY BELIEVES IT IS BECAUSE HE/SHE IS BAD!!! Any other belief causes too much anxiety. Self blame is a powerful defense mechanism for the child. Without it the child would feel unbearable feelings of panic and terror.The problem is that while this defense is an important survival tool for the young child, victims often take it along with them into their adult lives. They forget they are no longer defenseless and helpless and continue to feel and believe exactly as they did as children. \\"IF I FEEL BAD, I AM BAD.\\" This is what I am still working on today. I have felt the three D's of incest: Dirty, Damaged and Different. I have felt everyone else is more deserving than I am. I have tried continued self punishment to try to cleanse away the sins I never committed.HOWEVER, INCEST IS NOT ABOUT SEX!!! IT IS ABOUT PURSUING POWER OR VALIDATION. There seem to be two powerful forces at work inside the large majority of incest aggressors. The first is an almost insatiable need for unconditional love and adoration. There is something terribly engaging about the way that a child can love. No adult relationship is free from conflict or criticism, but children love totally without judgment. This can be a powerful aphrodisiac for a man who, no matter how powerful or competent he may appear to the outside world, carries within him deep feelings of inadequacy. Another type of aggressor defends against his own feelings of inadequacy by gaining power and control over a helpless, dependent child.It helped me to put the blame and responsibility back on my abuser instead of myself. It explained to me why my family has reacted with denial and a desire for suppression. The role and power of the abuser and family loyalty determine how the family will react. Some members have contracts of silence with the abuser. Many family members will look to suppress it or minimize it. The mother is most often a codependent enabler. Denial is what makes incest abuse a generational problem.It has allowed me to understand why I feel bad when I have bad feelings. It has explained to me why I have made bad life decisions and shown self destructive behaviors. I felt it was my fault. I continue to want to act out so that I can feel justified in my guilt and be in my comfort zone of shame and blame once again.I attempted to be good, both to deal with my guilt and to earn the love and acceptance I so desperately craved. I received special attention from my father and that is what kept me quiet and guilt ridden. I became my father's lover as my mother was distant and disconnected from him.My bed and home were never safe. I had and still have constant nightmares, night terrors as I call them. I often \\"played possum\\", dissociated and pretended nothing was going on. I had a hard time often determining if something really happened or it was a dream. I felt powerless. I tried to gain control in other ways through addictions, such as my eating disorder. I developed OCD and an anxiety disorder. I was constantly afraid and felt like I was dodging bullets.I idolized my father and always painted him as the \\"romanticized\\" version of the father that I always wanted. He had to be a loving man so I must be the bad one that was getting what I deserved. This caused self loathing. I hated my body and myself. I tried to kill both multiple times.Secrecy is what communicates that something is wrong and it is dangerous to tell so no abuse and coercion rarely are needed for incest abuse to occur. Had the other family members been safe to tell then the dynamics of the incestuous family would not have been present, and the abuse would not have occurred.We must stop denial and dissociation. We need truth and reality to heal. We need to get away from our family systems, intervention from the outside, to disclose and heal without desiring to suppress our abuse once again. Acceptance and validation are key for healing. If the victim is blamed, shamed or disbelieved then the effects of the abuse are compounded instead of changed.Let us heal and shift the blame and responsibility from the victim to the appropriate place, the abuser. Let us recover and move from victims to survivors. LET US GO FROM VICTIMS TO VICTORIOUS!!!"},{"Title":"Betrayal of Innocence: Incest and Its Devastation","review":"This is one of the best books I have read regarding the subject of incest and child abuse/molestation.

And it's not just the offending parent. What about the other parent, the one that should have protected the unprotected? Because it is so unimaginable to accept such betrayal, the human mind typically cannot accept it. I found only one in four who could take that critical first step--acknowledgement of the problem. And it took books like this to get them there, books that clearly say, it's not your fault!

Author Bilger examines the works of Frances Burney, Maria Edgeworth and Jane Austen, and posits that the humor they used was subversive -- laughter at the expense of the overbearing patriarchal culture in which they lived.While this isn't exactly what I'd hoped it would be, it was more accessible than many scholarly works, and after I got into the rhythm and jargon of the academic writing, I found myself entertained as well as informed -- such a lovely combination.Laughter is a commodity too often ignored and a tool too often overlooked, but the author makes her case that these three authors consciously used satire, burlesque and parody to criticize their culture while maintaining the guise of docile co-conspirators. Bilger begins with interesting chapters on women &amp; comedy and Mary Shelley's feminism before discussing the lives of her subjects, their beliefs and their use of comedic technique and characters to undermine the dominant paradigm, as it were. Naive observers, female tricksters, competitive women, nimcompoop suitors and ignorant patriarchs are described and then illustrated with short excerpts from the many works by these talented authors -- in particular Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and Northanger Abbey; Burney's Camilla and The Wanderer; and Edgeworth's Belinda and Helen.I thought the most interesting chapter was on &quot;goblin humor&quot;, dark humor that is still considered distasteful by many and seems shocking when found in these quiet comedies of manners. Here the author displayed a mastery of comic theory as well as the literature, and made her case admirably, without descent into the jargon-laden victimization theory that dominates feminist film theory, for example. Rather, Bilger posits that Austen, Burney and Edgeworth found an outlet for what they could have considered a hopeless situation, and that they consciously and actively did their best to undermine the system in which they lived, reflecting and building upon the work of earlier feminists, and sending out beacons of camaraderie to women living under cultural and personal subjugation.The book concludes with a fine Notes section, a bibliography and a good index."},{"Title":"Little Silver Volume II (NJ) (Images of America)","review":"As a new resident of Little Silver, I loved to read and see the rich history of this area so well presented."},{"Title":"History of the Sabbath [and first day of the week","review":"The complete record of Christian 7th Day Sabbath keeping, from the earliest Church Age till modern times.

But after reading Tom Neven's book, I found that I was---dare I say it? I was WRONG! In his journalistic way, the author took a fairly common subject (Christian worldviews)and analytically broke down misplaced arguments that we make to ourselves. But his style isn't so heady that a teen has trouble with the material. In fact, my fourteen year old daughter promptly conviscated the book and is using it in her teen accountability group. I would recommend this book as one that parents and teens could read together. But be prepared to have a few old myths shattered."},{"Title":"Do Fish Know They're Wet?: Living in Your World-Without Getting Hooked","review":"I just finished reading \\"Do Fish Know They're Wet\\" and I was impressed not only by the information presented, but also with the readable explanation of some pretty difficult subjects. I am sending my copy to my younger sister so she can read it before she heads off to college, because I think that it will give her a clear picture of different worldviews, many of which she will encounter in college, and how they relate to truth. There were several topics in the book, including logical fallacies, which had never before been explained to me in such a clear, understandable way. After finishing the book, I feel equipped to give a reasonable, logical answer to the challenges I face on nearly a daily basis on my college campus. Neven's book is an invaluable resource for teens and adults alike, particularly in a world where we are constantly combatting worldviews and ideals which are in direct opposition to Christianity."},{"Title":"Do Fish Know They're Wet?: Living in Your World-Without Getting Hooked","review":"In \\"Do Fish Know They're Wet?\\" author Tom Neven explains the importance of your worldview and how it shapes your opinions and decisions. He shows the difference between worldviews like nihilism, existentialism, and postmodernism, and how they compare to a Biblical worldview. He also gives lots of practical examples of the way your worldview affects how you see everything from education, philosophy, government, art, music and pop culture. Very interesting read. Check it out."},{"Title":"Do Fish Know They're Wet?: Living in Your World-Without Getting Hooked","review":"Neven is the senior editor for Plugged In magazine and the former editor of Focus on the Family magazine, so as he writes primarily to a teen or young adult audience, he is very familiar with them and their mind set. The book is a wonderful and easy-to-read examination of the concept of a Christian worldview and exactly how that affects a person's daily interaction with a postmodern and relativistic culture. Neven starts by laying down a few basic rules, as he calls them:Rule No. 1: God is.Rule No. 2: God is the God of truth. All truth is God's truth.Rule No. 3: Because we are created in God's image, we have the ability to recognize truth, although that ability is tainted by sin.Rule No. 4: The ability of a person to recognize truth diminishes the closer that truth is to his or her own heart, to the very nature of being a person.Neven then does an excellent job of giving a history of some of influential thinkers and their contribution to cultural transformation over the years. After that he turns from principles to practical and begins to examine modern culture exploring how a Christian worldview interacts with and runs counter to much of modern thinking in areas such as public policy/government, family, art, music, literature, science and history. Neven concludes by reminding the reader that all worldviews are religious in nature and that the reader must not back down when engaging the culture because of attack or perceived prejudice or bias.Do Fish Know They're Wet is a pretty good read, especially for someone new to the worldview concept. Neven is an excellent writer and communicator and gives the reader just enough without complicating the issues beyond his intended audience's appetite."},{"Title":"Do Fish Know They're Wet?: Living in Your World-Without Getting Hooked","review":"Found this book to be very informative on the importance of a Christian Worldview. Tom Neven does an excellent job presenting his arguments in a very readable manner.

Excellent book."},{"Title":"Notebooks of the mind: Explorations of thinking","review":"&quot;What is thinking?&quot; That is the question with which author Vera John-Steiner opens this definitely thought-provoking book. It is a tall order to fill, but she does so both with insight and eloquence by studying experienced, productive thinkers. I have read this book twice because it is so full of gems I could not seem to collect them all in one visit. One of the biggest strengths of the book is that it provides the depth needed by academic researchers as well as the accessibility of language and explanation most non-academic readers prefer. She examines how thinking develops, the emotional and intellectual intensity of creative work, the tools creative thinkers use, and the similarities and differences among &quot;languages of the mind&quot; such as words, images, music and models. She bases her ideas on the reflective sources of thinkers themselves more than 100 interviews, plus letters, journals, works in progress, biographies and autobiographies sources which have been neglected by behavior scientists in the past but have proved invaluable for illuminating the succinct, telegrammatic thought processes or &quot;inner shorthands into artistically and intellectually convincing achievements.&quot; By using in-depth analyses of these self-reports and &quot;working papers&quot; of great minds in the arts and sciences, John-Steiner shows that creativity (1) requires sustained effort (it is not an instantaneous &quot;aha&quot; as it is sometimes portrayed) and (2) is not a product of &quot;lone genius&quot; but of social scaffolding, interaction and apprenticeship. Creativity, like this book, is a journey of wonder, exploration, evaluation and novel ideas that is well worth taking."},{"Title":"Notebooks of the mind: Explorations of thinking","review":"The title of this book led me to expect an analysis of and lots of anecdotes about how artists, thinkers and scientists work out their ideas. And yes, that's what I got, but it just didn't go deeply enough for me. I had no \\"aha\\" moments reading this, and none of her anecdotes really reached me to get me excited. I think it's because of the plodding, quasi-academic tone of the book. It's well-organized but without any spark."},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","review":"This is a clear and vigorous statement of the libertarian position on biotechnology. Bailey argues for \\"liberation biology\\" as \\"the earthly quest to overcome the physical and mental limitations imposed on us by nature, enabling us to flourish as never before.\\"Bailey insists that the technological manipulation of nature to satisfy human desires has been part of human life at least since the development of civilization based on agriculture. Using biotechnology to enhance human nature--to promote our physical and mental health and to extend our life span--is a continuation of this ancient human effort to conquer nature by articial means.Although he recognizes the need for some legal regulation to secure the safety and efficacy of biotech products and to protect against force and fraud, Bailey prefers to leave adults free to decide for themselves (and their children) whether to employ biotechnology to enhance life. People will make mistakes. But they will learn by trial and error what uses of biotech are desirable and what not. Some people will decide to avoid such biotech advancements--following in the tradition of the Amish and other groups that choose to restrict their reliance on technology.In arguing for this libertarian position, Bailey attacks both the bioconservatives (such as Francis Fukuyama and Leon Kass) and the Leftist bioluddites (such as Jeremy Rifkin and Bill McKibben).I find Bailey's reasoning generally persuasive, although I think that at some points he exaggerates the power of biotech for changing human nature. He appeals to the natural human desires as the moral motivation for biotech--for example, the natural desire of parents to care for the health and happiness of their children. It's hard for me to see how biotech is going to alter, or even abolish, those desires. (I have elaborated this point in my book DARWINIAN CONSERVATISM.)Bailey has a clear argument that is forcefully presented. He has made a great contribution to the continuing debate over biotechnology and the future of human nature."},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","review":"Ronald Bailey presents both a sensible investigation into human enhancement technologies and an inviting discourse that is better written and more thoroughly researched than most books on the same topic. Bailey does not skirt issues and does not cut and paste information. If you want knowledge that is pertinent and from a voice of logic - read this book!"},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","review":"It seems that everyone agrees biotechnology will have a profound effect on our species' future; where they disagree is how much of a good thing this is. \\"Liberation Biology\\" is written by Ronald Bailey, who takes an essentially Transhumanist position on this; that the options given to us by biotechnology will give us longer, happier, healthier lives.Bailey is a writer for Reason magazine and a libertarian, so it's choice and freedom that drives his moral arguments. I have a hard time disagreeing with him when it comes to the blatantly paternalistic arguments that he deals with from biotechnology critics like Fukuyama and McKibben. (McKibben's arguments that genetic selection will turn kids into products and not people are particularly awful, although this may be in how Bailey presents them I suppose). The critics can romanticize suffering, death, and ignorance all they want, but I'd rather improve my chances of choosing where and how I die.Bailey has more trouble in other areas - although he very effectively deals with concerns over GM food safety, as a libertarian he's far too inclined to believe that corporations won't misbehave when they get a good deal of control (as in the case of biotech crops - they've obviously helped, but farmers being dependent on one or two companies for their food supply unsettles me).The book's biggest issue is the format, however. This is adapted from web essays, and it shows - the topics are disjointed, and the chapters are an odd mess of a tour of current technology and batches of moral arguments. This makes it a slow read; one topic bounces to another, and while it's true that moral issues are often dependent on specific technology, taking a more planned approach would have read to a better and more readable book - a broad argument instead of a bunch of discussions of individual topics.Still, it's often informative, and although due to the fast pace of technology a couple of sections (most notably the stem cell chapter) are somewhat out of date, this will give you a good grounding in a lot of the current science and moral arguments surrounding biotechnology."},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. My biology professor suggested it, and I was not disappointed. Anyone interested in the history of this field, and the major players will enjoy reading this."},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","review":"\\"Liberation Biology\\" (LB) reminds me of blogger Glenn Reynolds's futurist tract, \\"An Army of Davids,\\" in that both cover similar material from a soft libertarian viewpoint. While I found both books pretty pedestrian, I think LB should have sold at least as well as Reynolds's book because Bailey and Reynolds have attracted comparably sized followings on the Web. Instead LB fell dead-born from the press and into obscurity.I suspect the Prometheus curse accounts for Bailey's relative failure. Prometheus Books often publishes some very good stuff, especially its critiques of religious and paranormal beliefs. But I notice that its titles usually don't do that well commercially, much less appear in paperback editions a year or two later. Sam Harris, author of two surprisingly best selling attacks on religious belief, apparently noticed this problem, so he avoided Prometheus when he went shopping for mainstream publishers of his books that unexpectedly made him a pile of money and turned him into the public face of atheism in the U.S.LB also seems a bit like a cut-and-paste job from Bailey's writings on Reason magazine's Website and other online venues. I get the impression that Reynolds put together his book in a similar fashion. I don't have a problem with writing a book that way, as such. But if you've read Bailey's works online for a few years, the contents of his book will look recycled to you.The title, \\"Liberation Biology,\\" also feels \\"wrong\\" coming from a small-l libertarian like Bailey. In the Preface on page 12, Bailey rationalizes his choice of title by writing:\\"In the twentieth century, liberation theology was a spiritual movement aimed at helping humanity to overcome political and economic oppression. In the twenty-first century, liberation biology is the earthly quest to overcome the physical and mental limitations imposed on us by nature, enabling us to flourish as never before.\\"Even though liberation theology has a strong MARXIST component and Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI have held it in suspicion for that very reason? I would expect a leftist transhumanist like James Hughes to draw an analogy to a Catholic-Marxist syncretism for rhetorical purposes; but not a free-market advocate like Bailey. (In fairness, however, Hughes's effort at transhumanist outreach, \\"Citizen Cyborg,\\" has hardly taken the publishing world by storm, either.)Beside, we already have a name other than \\"liberation biology\\" for \\"the earthly quest to overcome the physical and mental limitations imposed on us by nature, enabling us to flourish as never before.\\" We call this \\"earthly quest\\" transhumanism, which Bailey mentions in three places early on in LB, but he seems strangely reluctant to use it to describe his fundamentally similar world view.Bailey does a workmanlike job of arguing for the currently socially acceptable goals of transhumanist thinking, but only that. His writing lacks the energy and moral fervor I'd like to see in making the case for these exceedingly powerful ideas. LB should have sold at least as well as comparable books about the scientific transformation of the human condition, but Prometheus Books' kiss of death probably doomed it from the start."},{"Title":"Liberation Biology: The Scientific and Moral Case for the Biotech Revolution","review":"It's easy to tell humans that they are amazing angels and gods, who have every right to transform all other life, and the planet itself, into whatever humans believe will benefit humans.

Stock or water is often recommended as a substitute, despite lacking whatever flavor the wine, beer, or sherry called for in the recipe would contribute, and the results are what you'd expect: flat, dull, or off-putting.Scott's approach to substitution is more nuanced. By considering the flavors the alcohol would contribute and the role it plays in the dish, she arrives at substitutes that truly work. Where wine plays a supporting role, as in a pan sauce, for instance, she recreates its fruitiness and acidity with a mixture of unsweetened grape juice and wine vinegar. Where the alcohol stars, she reworks the recipe entirely, like the boeuf bourguignon where she uses currant jelly to give depth of flavor and body to the sauce.I bought the book for the discussion of substitution after I heard Scott interviewed on the radio, but I've found that it offers much more. She provides extensive information on nutrition and practical suggestions on eating better, both in early recovery and over the long haul, by eating more fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes, and, without faddishness, by starting to pay attention to food's glycemic index. I was inspired to try roasted soybeans for the first time in a \\"road to recovery\\" trail mix with chocolate chips that I liked very much.The other recipes I've tried--iced herbal tea, granola; a leek and potato soup; pan-fried steak; a roasted pork tenderloin with cumin and apples that took only ten minutes of prep--have been uniformly good: clearly written, easy to prepare, and great-tasting.The book is structured according to stages of early, established, and long-term recovery, and it allows Scott to be supportive and even gentle-having that ice cream probably won't kill you-while aspiring to continuous improvement. For those in AA, her recommendations about triggers, cravings, HALT, fellowship, and other concepts are mainstream program. Although stricter than some might feel necessary-she tossed out her corkscrew and won't use alcohol-based vanilla extract-her suggestions will help keep you safe.I recommend the book highly for anyone in recovery who likes to cook, or for that matter, is just interested in taking better care of oneself."},{"Title":"The Sober Kitchen: Recipes and Advice for a Lifetime of Sobriety (Non)","review":"Liz Scott was a professional chef when she stopped drinking.

Because there were no other books of this type available when she was early in recovery, she did a lot of research on how to substitute out alcohol in her cooking and catering business without losing the flavor and fun. AS someone who is not in recovery herself, but has a medical condition that makes alcohol use detrimental to her health, I was thrilled to find a cookbook that I could use myself.For anyone who is in recovery, doesn't drink alcohol, or is restricted diet wise, not only are these great recipes but the books are filled with great side bars and information that really helps me to understand the role of alcohol in foods, preparation, entertaining, etc. I couldn't recommend this book any higher.

The case she has been given, to straighten the books of one of their clients, may prove that a senior partner of the firm has been embezzling money. When Maya is advised by the client to ignore her findings, her suspicions go on full alert. But Maya must be careful that she does not step on the wrong toes and jeopardize her career.While trying to sort through her suspicions, she meets Victor, a songwriter and currently the mailroom supervisor at the firm. The attraction is instantaneous, but Maya has too much going on to pursue a relationship, plus she has reservations about what her colleagues will think. Victor has noticed Maya on more than one occasion, and has passed her off as a sister with her head in the clouds. When Maya seeks Victor's assistance in exposing the corporate thief, they are forced to reevaluate their initial assessments; the passion that luxuriates around them presents a most persuasive argument.PACK LIGHT is Kim Shaw's debut novel and it is sexy, and suspenseful in a subtle way.

Personal interviews with families of all types make up the main substance of their brand-new book. If your spouse travels regularly, you will easily sympathize with the people interviewed and you will know you are not alone. If traveling is not part of your family's lifestyle, you will come away with a new sensitivity to families who cope with this challenge--and you'll appreciate your own situation that much more.Each chapter addresses a particular situation and gives first person accounts from people coping with that challenge. So, while reading about other people's struggles may either depress or comfort you, the extensive lists of suggestions at the end of each chapter are worth turning to again and again. Seeking to give help on many levels, pracitical advice is given for couples, for the wife, for the traveling husband, and for others including the church family.

There's a stultifying sensibility amidst the 'come-hither' poses and angles in use here. The Mapplethorpian conventions are all here: buttocks, genitals, abs, biceps, quads. No eye contact.

There are over 150 pages of photographs presented here, a section for each artist.Za-Hazzanani's photographs I found to be my favorite. She has a unique way of using the right lighting and of posing the models in such a way that they are very erotic and pleasing to the senses. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the other photographers images. Tony Butcher's beautiful photographs of nude black males are truly stunning, and his work reminds me a lot of Mapplethorpe's. Trevor Watson also showcases many black male models using light and shadows to highlight and sensual his images in just the right way. Toni Catany uses old calotype printing techniques which give his photographs of the nude male body intensity and a moody texture that makes them all seem like old photographs.There is a wonderful introduction by Paul Ryan who gives a history of the development of male nude photography and it's gradual acceptance over the years. You'll also find a section of biographical notes on all the photographer's featured in this book.

The works of four male photographers -Trevor Watson, Tony Butcher, and Toni Catany - and the lone female photographer Za-Hazzanani are well presented in both black and white and sepia toned images and are more sculptural than expository.The apparent intent of these photographers (or of the editor) is to present the nude male form as an art object and in doing so each of these fine photographers has succeeded in exploring muscle mass as it reflects or absorbs light and shadow. The models are of the 'ideal' sort and there is no pretense to encourage us to get to know the inner workings of the models' response to the art of photography. These fine photographs are more about Objective then Subjective, and in that stance they flow in this beautiful portfolio with an elegant sophistication. Grady Harp, March 05"},{"Title":"Man: Photographs of the Male Nude","review":"I cannot get very excited about this volume of male nudes by four photographers. They are Trevor Watson, Tony Butcher, Za-hazzanani and Toni Catany. It should be pointed out, I suppose, that Za-hazzanani is a woman photographer, not that it makes any difference that I can ascertain in the quality of her work. My biggest objection here is that there is a tremendous sameness to the shots. For example, I would be hard put to tell the difference between Watson and Butcher's work if Butcher didn't just do black males. Many of the photographs are framed and composed nicely and beautifully printed; but the models could be made of marble. There's hardly a live one in the bunch. Mr. Catany's photos are sepia in color and grainy. At least you know which pictures are his, but I find his images no more interesting than those by the three other photographers.Finally many of these photographs consist only of body parts with an inordinate number of close-up shots of someone's rear. There are very few images here of complete bodies-- feet, hands, legs-- the head bone connected to the neck bone-- as the old Spiritual goes. If only these bones could rise again.There are many fine books of photography of male nudes on the market that will excite and inspire you. This one sadly is not one of them. Three stars is most generous, aka the Gentle Person's C."},{"Title":"Man: Photographs of the Male Nude","review":"Some of the reviewers were critical of this book but I found it to balanced and varied. Photographer Trevor Watson approaches the nude with an eye of androgyny. Both black and white models are used to convey the monumentality of the body rather than a narrative. However, the use of a thin black model repeatedly at the head of a staircase evoked a narrative, especially when the last of the photographs shows this young man staring through the rungs with the stance of those who wait for the lover to return. I wish all this series had been printed together in Duane Michael's style so that the narrative emerged. Sometimes photographs of nude males have an emphasis on musculature and not the genitals. Two of Watson's photographs show considerable thought and composition to show the genitals in the same flattering light as are torsos and buttocks. Tony Butcher's photographs are more likely to capture the elegance of the movement of nude men. Butcher uses all black models and he contrasts these models against stark white or darkest black. This means that the graphic linear nature of the male nude emerges from the high contrast photographs whereas a more textural, contextual sensation comes from the black men emerging from a black field. This use of a black field may evoke images of a shaman in one image but a Caravaggio impression in another. However he use of the stark white field creates some superb images where the nude becomes as basic and yet subtle as the Korus of ancient Greece and Crete. Za-hazzanani's photographs are more likely to be romantic, seductive, and even secretive. She uses white models that with long hair and goatees evoke images of pirates. They sleep with their genitals partially exposed under veils of sheets and silk. The male is often depicted in her images as sleeping, as if this is the only time a female may study the structure of the male. Toni Catany's photographs appear to be either photographed through gauze or printed on silk, the texture becomes part of the image. In contrast to Butcher's dancing men or Za-hazzanani's sleeping men, we often see odd and uncomfortable contortions in the poses that Catany captures in his models. Butcher captures the harmony of the male body in motion whereas Catany captures the dissonance. I found the contrasts between the photographers to be highly interesting and thought the book deserves a bit more credit than did some other reviewers."},{"Title":"Man: Photographs of the Male Nude","review":"Detailed descriptions of what this book contains (factually) have already been given. I would just like to add that some of the negative reviewers greatly exaggerate. It's not true that most of the photos are just body parts. There are numerous full-body or nearly full-body shots, and many that contain heads and faces. Personally, I'm not grabbed by the abstracting special effects in Toni Catany's work, because I prefer more straightforward photos--more like Tony Butcher's work, which easily exceeds Mapplethorpe's work, imo. Therefore I'd prefer spending my money on the works of one photographer I really like than on a sampling of several photographers, some of whom I don't prefer. It's really hard to rate art because tastes and opinions vary so much; the best reviews are those which carefully describe the work as objectively as possible, and some reviewers have done that here. So I don't expect my review to be particularly \\"helpful\\" beyond what they've said; but I did want to contribute to the overall rating."},{"Title":"Man: Photographs of the Male Nude","review":"Let's start with the good things. This collection is composed of high-quality images, well produced and well presented. The paper is high quality and the binding good. It is a good coffee-table book that won't offend many people.The bad parts are legion, and I'm grateful that I was baought this book as a gift. I would have felt cheated if I'd bought it myself. Why? Well, firstly there are too many images of black men. This may be fine if you like oil-smeared, shiny black muscles but not if, like me, you are not a great admirer of photograhps of black men. This may not be the &quot;PC&quot; thing to say, but coming from England I'm not, thankfully, gagged by this most objectionable of American crazes. (It's an interesting thought that one is able to make all sorts of negative comments about pretty-boys or muscle-hunks, but say a negative word about black models and the wishy-wahsy liberals get their hair in a tizz).Secondly, the poses are formulaic. They're stiff, uninteresting, mostly body-shots. There is little eye-contact with the models, and if there is they look totally bored by the whole process. How is it that Mapplethorpe managed to get so much more from these sort of poses?None of the models even dares to smile - not even a small wry smile. As a viewer I'm totally uninvoled with the book. I'm not invited in to free my erotic imagination. I received this book at the same time I got Hoffman's book of pictures of Johan Paulik, and that book is the other side of the coin. I would happily leave this book out on the coffee table in the hope that someone would ask to borrow it and fail to return it. I would chain the book of Paulik photographs to the floor to stop it leaving the house."},{"Title":"The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix","review":"The author writes about his encounter with Mathematician/numerologist Dr. Matrix. Dr. Matrix had a unique method of predicting who would be elected the US president. Had he been alive today, we would know who would be the president in 2004 election without having to take all the polls. Kerry or Bush ? I thought this was one of Gardner's best books.It is not all math and numerology. Gardner writes about his romance with Dr. Matrix's eurasian daughter to keep people with short atttention span engaged."},{"Title":"The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix","review":"This book contains many mathematical, and numeralogical puzzles and analyses. The author details all of his meetings and interveiws with Dr. Matrix. Dr. Matrix was a numerologist from the 50's to 1980, he was also a scam-artist involving mathematical scams."},{"Title":"The Magic Numbers of Dr. Matrix","review":"I enjoyed very much this book.

The human trait of trying to see \\"patterns\\" in the world around themis carried to an obsession that is sociopathic that includes cabala and Mysticism.I would have given it a two star, but there are still vestiges of the old Gardner in the points on a sphere polygons toward the end.This book will make me look at all the Gardner books with a different eye."},{"Title":"When God Takes Too Long: Learning to Thrive During Life's Delays","review":"A friend gave me this book during a waiting period in my life otherwise I probably would have taken a look at the title and decided I could skip it. Had I skipped it, however, I would have missed some really wonderful insights. Joe Bentz takes the stories we so lightly read over in Scripture and delves into them pointing out the silences in the stories that are so important and yet so easy to miss. I especially appreciated the \\"Almost, not yet\\" sequence with Moses and the plagues.On a practical level, the book is divided into comfortable sized chapters/sections that make it work very well as a daily devotional. It's a book that will make you want to keep reading, but it's best taken one bite at a time (with plenty of time in between to chew and digest).If you want a new perspective on all those waiting times from stop lights to career moves to retirement, this is the book to read. It will almost make you grateful for that red light!"},{"Title":"When God Takes Too Long: Learning to Thrive During Life's Delays","review":"Not sure exactly where said reviewer is coming from, especially since the exact same review has been posted by him/her for yet another book by a different author! This sounds like more of a soapbox than a fair review of the book.You can't compartmentalize the spiritual from the material aspects of our lives, and I think this is what this book makes clear. The things we see within our own human perspective aren't the whole of reality-- if anything, this book reminds us that our own ideas of success, failure, good and bad are pretty relative in the scope of eternity. If you can't compare the details of our 21st century lives with Biblical characters, you're boxing the Bible in and overspiritualizing the omnipresence of God in all the details of our lives.And there's no way the author is making all the mistakes M. Galishoff is pointing out-- just read the last 2 chapters and you'll hear about Scriptures imcredibly hard for Western American Christians to deal with, such as Hebrews 11 (all the people who never got to see the ultimate ripple effect of their lives or the 'rewards' for their faith and yet lived for what they couldn't see) and passages in Paul's letters about how eternity makes the present pale in comparison. Seriously-- you can't come away from this book thinking that it's 'all about me.' Clearly, it's all about God-- learning to live in surrender to his ways that are totally different than ours."},{"Title":"When God Takes Too Long: Learning to Thrive During Life's Delays","review":"Bentz has an incredible relevence in this book to those of us who feel like we are waiting! I highly recommend this book and this author. He writes with a wisdom and clarity of understanding. His words are helpful and illluminating. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Chamber music (Columbia bicentennial editions and studies)","review":"This a terrible edition of Joyce's first published book. The binding is flimsy, and the book is poorly put together. Many of the poems are not properly printed--for example, most of poems appear in paragraph form! Don't waste your money on it."},{"Title":"Chamber music (Columbia bicentennial editions and studies)","review":"These poems are like smoke rings. In a few moments, Joyce creates a scene and a mood; and in a few more moments, it is over! Very fleeting, very pretty when it works -- which is much of the time."},{"Title":"Chamber music (Columbia bicentennial editions and studies)","review":"We don't normally think of James Joyce in terms of poetry, yet, here in this work he demonstrates his considerable poetic skills.

Why are the little lyrics of this great lyric artist so minor, and however their charm and music, of minor significance? Is it because Joyce has much greater lyrical works, with it being possible to argue that Finnegans Wake is one long poem alone? Or is it because the minor perceptions and feelings here do not strike us to the depth of the soul as the lyrics of Dickinson or Blake do?As words of a great genius these small poems are valuable. As little poems of pleasure they also make sense. But had Joyce written only them he would not be remembered today. The same cannot be said of Dubliners or a Portrait or Ulysses."},{"Title":"Tug of War: The Allied Victory That Opened Antwerp","review":"Denis Whitaker was there on the sodden polders of Zeeland.

He admits that he didn't want to write this book and hoped someone else would have. Indeed it would have been better if someone else had.The book contains an exceptional amount of background information on mail protocols and procedures, and a lot of detail on Exim itself. If I had 5 weeks to read and absorb it all it would be wondersful.For busy systems administrators using this book is a hard work, finding the information needed is slow and then understanding it is difficult. Dr Hazel's writing style is terse and rather like a mathematical text. There is no fluff in it's 600 pages. I find myself reading sentences repeatedly trying to understand them. Also the implications of certain information is not made obvious.His lack of realistic examples is also a serious short coming. He glosses over remote access of mail via POP, IMAP and SMTP authentication even though this is the most common way of accessing mail these days. I would especially like to see discussion of an ISP type mail server with multiple domains, which is lacking.Finally, there is lack of reference material in the appendices, a short form listing of command options and configuration options would be a great addition.Warning: this book is for version 3 and version 4 is now available although version 3 is still used."},{"Title":"Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent","review":"Exim is fairly straightforward for an MTA, though I found I needed to understand a bunch of concepts before I knew what Exim was doing. Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent does an excellent job of covering those concepts, much better than the official documentation, and for that this is essential reading for Exim users. This is the 1st edition, however, and only covers Exim release 3, so many of the important things that you might want to do with Exim that are easy to do in Exim 4 are not covered. You will need the official Exim website to complete your education and get up and running.You might want to try using just the official documentation from the website and a good sample configuration file before buying this outdated book. (The Debian Linux installation of Exim comes with an excellent, well-commented default configuration.) If you get lost (like I did), buy this book used (like I didn't).A new edition covering Exim 4 would easily get a 5 star review and earn a permanent spot on my bookshelf. Some quick reference appendicies and tables and an improved index, such as those common to most newer O'Reilly titles, would also be nice."},{"Title":"Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent","review":"This won't replace the official documentation -- especially since it covers an old outdated version of EXIM -- but covers enough to be worthwhile as a supplement. Still, I was rather disappointed that much of what I was trying to do (such as set up spam filtering) wasn't covered by the book, and that I had to go online and read through back mailing list archives and read official documentation to get the job done. From any other publisher I wouldn't feel too bad about that, but from O'Reilly I expect better."},{"Title":"Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent","review":"If you can't (or won't) run sendmail, then IMO your only two real alternatives are postfix and Exim. I still believe that sendmail is a better choice, but both postfix and Exim are still quite good.If you decide to run Exim, there are few people who could give you a better insight into how the program is configured and how it works internally, than the author of the program -- Phil Hazel.However, keep in mind that the book is primarily oriented around version 3 of this program, and version 4 (with some significant changes) has already been produced. More information is available at [URL]."},{"Title":"Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent","review":"This book was a disappointment. While first reading the book I thought it was great. However, after I tried actually configuring the exim program I realized this book included only superficial examples. Any serious configuration required an in-depth understanding of the exim program far beyond the overview of this book. The necessary bits of information are scattered throughout the book. Unfortunately, these bit were often not referenced in the Index. This required my reading large sections trying locate a specific bit of information. The book's index is weak. It often includes references to variables, options and features that requires the specific name of the information being sought to locate. In contrast Exim's downloadable pdf documentation has the advantage of being quickly computer searchable. After being frustrated with this book I turned to the downloadable documentation and found it much more useful."},{"Title":"Exim: The Mail Transfer Agent","review":"_Exim, the MTA_ would be an appropriate book for someone who does not know anything about e-mail and suddenly needs to manage a server, and EXIM would be a good e-mail server for this person to use. EXIM is the default MTA in Debian and other Unix distributions too.Exim, the MTA, has been written entirely, except for contributed patches, by Philip Hazel, who continues to maintain it. [...]In conclusion, if I wasn't already in the habit of setting up qmail on new machines that appear within my aegis, a habit that, once I got the hang of it, has reduced the care and feeding of my e-mail servers to an absolute minimum, I might select exim as an MTA to specialize in. To restate, it's too late for me, but save yourself!"},{"Title":"Primal Justice","review":"Police officer Jon Stofferson has lost his zest. He no longer has energy for his ordinary routine, and his belief in his abilities has eroded. Jon once never hesitated to dole out his own sense of justice on the streets, in reasonable measures and appropriate circumstances. Now he has abandoned his former attitudes, proclaiming the right of all to their day in court. His partner has grown disgusted with his inexplicable changes. Others are beginning to notice his alarming changes as well.Jon does not know the cause of his exhaustion or understand the battle going on his head. Many years ago, he turned his back on the concept of becoming a lawyer and seeking justice in the courts, despite his father and stepfather's encouragement. His solution was to become a police officer instead, leaving justice to those in charge of the courts. But now as he sleeps a symbiotic being, a vicious predator, arises to seek retribution in place of a system gone wrong. And Jon is in danger of loosing himself to its ultimate, primal justice.Author Richard E. Gill pens a riveting novel in PRIMAL JUSTICE. The author's style boarders on experimental as the pace and tone shift to reflect the action of the moment. In addition, the gripping horror of one's man's descent into madness, or worse, serves as a fascinating counterpoint to a struggle to define appropriate justice. While incredibly violent and at times graphic, Gill mirrors the great masters of horror by allowing the reader's imagination to add the indelible details beyond the necessary, lending his novel a profound depth and fascination. At times crude and other times lyrical, the author's marvelous use of tone and flow will provide readers with a text impossible to put down. Add this one to your keeper shelf as PRIMAL JUSTICE earns the WordWeaving Award for Excellence."},{"Title":"Primal Justice","review":"A dark tale, brilliantly described. It held my attention until its unpredictable end. The author's vivid scenes transferred to the reader, the torturous pain of the central character endures. Jon Stofferson really doesn't know why his life was slipping away. I found it difficult to put the book down until I, too, found some reason for Jon's unsettling experiences. The reader might begin to believe that Jon is being punished for something that may of us want to secretly see happen. Written in short, powerful chapters the reading is easy, but challenges our concept of reality. It's a good one!- Joe HolbrookRetired television personality"},{"Title":"How to Paint Your Boat Pb (Sailmate S.)","review":"The author covers the conventional paints, epoxys, polyeurethanes, gelcoats, solvents, safety, primers, painting on various surfaces, possible problems you may encounter with poor preparation, and discusses proper temperatures and humidity. The information is good, but I still don't really know what to do with my boat. The author is very knowledgeable, but tries to cover too many topics/surfaces. I was looking for information on painting my fiberglass boat. He barely covered fiberglass, and now I will purchase Fiberglass Renovation, which I believe will provide the information I need. I think this is a good book, but I was dissappointed, because I still do not feel confident about starting such a project. This book needs more photographs, and step by step instructions for the DYI (Do it yourself) people."},{"Title":"Practical Beginning Theory: A Fundamentals Worktext","review":"Learning the ins and outs of music is a difficult task evenwhen an instructor is available. &quot;Practical BeginningTheory&quot; is, in my opinion, essential for anyone attempting to become a musician. This book precisely lives up to its title claim of practical. This book is useful to anyone regardless of musical background. The book flows naturally from the raw beginnngs of musical study and gradually adds theory as one proceeds through the lessons. After a solid introduction to the tools and notation of musical meter and the notes of the staff the lessons gradually inculcate essential concepts intrinsic to musical construction. Even if one is an intermediate or advanced student of music the information within the first few chapters is still very interesting and should not be glossed over by any reader trying to get on to the &quot;good stuff&quot;. The lessons and theory begin in earnest in each subsequent chapter. The sections on scales and triad construction are clear and exceedingly well illustrated graphically. The plain illustration of the logic behind music makes each lesson a boon to any musician. Lastly, The section on Harmony is complex and &quot;practical beginning Theory&quot; makes an intricate proposition such as harmony an understandable and repeatable enterprise. Although the material does get very dense the reader need only consult the index to review pivital lessons that are the foundation for the construction of Harmony. The book does an excellent job of applying each previous lesson to the next. The book teaches music theory so well that the student/reader is able to expand music using the knowlege gained from this book. It will teach every reader to play and understand the science of the art of music."},{"Title":"Practical Beginning Theory: A Fundamentals Worktext","review":"This was a book on my son's reading list from school.

Catch a thread and be pulled into Susan Thornton's world where even the most innocent item can be turned into that which can scare the life right out of you. &quot;House of Thunder&quot; slowly wraps it's reader into it's veil of deception and fear, and doesn't let go until you are screaming for more on the final page.

You're expecting a wonderful resolution to the tightening plot and Koontz tries to pull off a hare-brained, implausible explanation. The character of the doctor guy (I don't recall his name) is abit far fetched as well. Try reading Lightning instead...much, much better."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book is truly one of his best.

I read this months ago, and I still can't get the idea of this book out of my head! Mr. Koontz has challenged spy, mystery, suspense, and romance novels all in one book.

She is tended to by many nurses and a caring doctor, all seems well until the evil visions start to haunt her. Are they live or are they memorex? I can't tell you but I will say this novel's ending was nothing as I expected it would be and it totally blew me away. I had to read and read to find out what is going on here????!!!! Great read, thats the way to end a book and make me sit back afterwards saying WOW that was good."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"A woman named Susan Thorton wakes up in a hospital. Her entire body feels numb, and she can barely move. To make matters worse, she has no memory of the accident that brought her to the hospital, or even her own name. As she slowly begins to regain her memory, Susan notices four shadowy figues from her past that are supposed to be dead, and look exactly the same age they did thirteen years prior. To make matters even worse, there are secrets trapped within Susan's mind that these four men do not want Susan to uncover.The House of Thunder is a very well written psychological thriller. This book drags you in from page one and keeps you there with unending suspense and building paranoia. As Susan regain her memory, she keeps seeing more and more things related to her past, and becomes convinced that everyone around her from her doctor and nurses to the ordalies are in on it. Due to Susan's condition, no one believes her. As time passes, the reader is never sure what to believe or what characters to trust because of the fact that Susan might be telling the truth. This book really keeps you on the edge of your seat.Overall, The House of Thunder is one of the best psychological thrillers I have ever read. The book is filled with outstanding characters, tons of paranoia and suspense, and an unpredictable ending. If you are a fan of Dean Koontz, or love conspiracy theory type stories, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"One of Koontz's less-believable pieces, an early mind-control story that went overboard. Like most of his lesser books, this one starts out well but spirals downhill, until the shocking revelation is merely mundane - if you believe it, which you probably won't.This one comes off almost more as a soap opera spinoff than an espionage intriguer. It really just doesn't work. The characters aren't well-developed, the body of the novel is obviously padded.Anyone looking for bare-bones Koontz enjoyment after exhausting his many better titles may still enjoy House of Thunder. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but hardcore Koontz fans, though."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I've read a number Koontz books, and liked a great deal of them, however... This book is poor. It trys to be shocking and suprising, but it just felt dated. Russians are just not scary anymore.

Are they really ghosts, or is she losing her sanity?The premise is a good one and it keeps you interested. But the buildup is a bit too long compared to the ending. She encounters her tormentors several times, but it never feels like there's any imminent threat to her until the last half of the book. About 100 pages before the ending, the story really takes off and it's a great read until the somewhat too abrupt ending.Not one of Koontz' best, but still definately an entertaining read. A weak 4 stars."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book to me is a classic. Koontz brilliantly constructs this plot and makes it a joy to see unfold. I read this book a few years back and I still remember the pleasure I got from it. A couple months ago I gave this book to my girlfriend to read I got her hooked on Koontz now I am like her Koontz supplier hehehe. Anyways I dared her to figure out the plot before books end and to tell me. She had quite the imagination but could never come up with the plot. After she finsihed she was astounded by the sheer brilliance of this book. So why did I give this book 5 stars quite simply because it was a hard book to put down. I seen from other reviews some were disappointed with the ending but I bet for that moment of time when they were reading it all were captivated just as I was!!!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is a very interesting book to say the least. It's one that you never truly know whats going on. You may think you do but you really don't. At one point I thought I knew and I was close or partially right. Then when it was done I realized that is was so much larger than I had thought. If you like books that throws you curves all the time; ones that you never really on what's going on; ones that at the ending you have to laugh and go wow, I didn't quite see that comming than go get this book and enjoy."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Susan Thornton is the main character in this book. After a car crash she wakes up in a hospital and can't remember various parts of her life. What she does remember is a murder she witnessed when she was younger. Then anytime someone mentions her employer, who she can't remember panic sets in.This was a great fast paced book. I read it in one day. Like most of the books by Mr. Koontz, the characters are colorful and well written. At times this book is a little far fetched but that's fiction.If your looking for a book that is part medical thriller, espionage thriller, supernatural and just a lot of fun to read, then this is for you.I gave this book 5 stars and have recommended it to many of my friends.Pick it up and enjoy."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Koontz is a master of the psychological thriller. The House of Thunder twists and turns with alarming ease, leading the reader down a darkened funhouse maze, never letting on where he is going with the story.I could not put this book down once I began reading it, finally finishing it at 3am, after starting around midnight. I was captivated by the storyline, and had no clue that all the things that were happening were part of a big sham. However, I thoroughly enjoyed being fooled by Koontz, as this made the entire book so engaging and entertaining. I just couldn't put the book down 'til I knew what the outcome was!Good story! Would like to see this one made into a movie!Peace Out."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I read this Koontz book after some procrastination. The title and back cover synopsis just did not appeal much to me. Despite the irrelevance of the cover picture, the book was uniformly outstanding. The story progressed at a good pace with none of the drab repetitiveness of the more recent Koontz novels I have read. The characters are believable and the plot line for the first 3/4ths of the book keeps you riveted. The absolutely unexpected ending in the last 1/4th of the book makes this one of the best I have read. Not necessarily due to the written subject of the plot twist, but the hairpin turn into another completely different realm of story line. Overall, this book rates as one of the best I have read and I have already recommended it to another Koontz reader."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is absolutely one of his best books. The title is fitting too- House of Thunder.The house in this book is not one I've forgotten- even though I read this book years ago. And the characters, the ones that aren't on the good side, have left lasting impressions. I know I'll read the book again, I'm betting it will freak me out as much as the first time around.The best part of this book was the ending- it gave me a bit of a surprise."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I have read about 25 of Dean Koontz' books in the past few years and \\"The House of Thunder\\" is deffinatly one of my favourites so far. Extremely gripping and difficult to put down. Also, I have never read a book so filled with mysetery and suspence, I couldn't wait to find out what was happening to Susan - was it minor brain damaged caused by her accident? Or are these four dead men really extracting revenge from beyond the grave? Is she suffering from paranoid delusions? Part of some elaborate consipracy? These are questions you will be asking yourself throughout the book.These mysteries, and the suspence and terror built up in Susan's hallucinations (or are they?), are alone enough to make a five-star, fast-paced read but from around page 300 (the book has 438 pages) Koontz creates several ingenious plot twist and mysteries, some of which had me gasping out loud, they were so fantastic.This book has my highest recomendations to anybody looking for a good horror/mystery/thriller novels or fans of Dean Koontz - and if you have never read one of his books before, give this one a read and see for yourself the extent of his talent as a writer."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"The House Of Thunder,This being an older novel by Mr. Koontz, originally penned under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, is not in my opinion his best work. Although I liked the book, I felt I couldn't connect with the characters. Susan is an enigma, not only her past but her present conditions are thin, lacking the depth needed to actually care about her character. The same is said about most of the characters that make appearances in this novel. It's very hard to care about characters you literally know nothing about.Susan wakes from a coma, then the story moves on. We learn a little about her as she begins to remember, just not nearly enough to care about her. A handsome doctor, a friendly nurse and faces from her past are all encountered, but then again we learn very little about these people.In all fairness the book is a mystery, leaving the reader the task of figuring out the plot. I do feel Koontz has done much better than this with great works such as \`Dark Rivers Of The Heart' and \`The Servants Of The Twilight'.I did like the book, but not enough to recommend it as a must read to would be Koontz fans."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. There's so many twists in it you really don't know where it's going next and keeps you scared right until the last moment. I have only read it once, about 2 years ago and I still think about it now and about where it would have gone from there, will they be able to con the russians? I really enjoy all Koontz's books but this is his best."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Good, engaging plot. Easy read. Drew you back for more. For me, the conclusion wrapped up a little too fast. Will there be a part II? If yes, I will read it."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Early Koontz, another great story. Didn't want to put it down, kept me guessing, never expected the plot twist. Worth the read."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"STORY BRIEF:In 1967 Susan saw four fraternity brothers beat her boyfriend to death in a college hazing. They were going to kill her, but she escaped and testified against them. Two of them later died in a car accident. It is now 1980. Susan just woke from a three week coma from a car accident. During the next several days she sees the four fraternity brothers in the hospital. Two are working as orderlies and two are patients. The four men get her alone and tell her they are going to rape and kill her. This happens repeatedly. She is afraid all of the time. She tells her doctor about them, but he explains that they could not be the same men because the men in the hospital are about 20 years old, not 33, and they have different names. Logic says she must be going mad, because this couldn't be happening. No one believes her.REVIEWER'S OPINION:I listened to the first 4 hours and was very frustrated. She was such a helpless victim. Over and over again she is afraid and being hurt by these men. I wondered if this whole thing was going to end up being one long dream - because two men had died. Or did the deaths not happen? Or was this a hallucination or drug induced hallucination? Was she hypnotized? Or had she died and was this happening in hell? Or was she really going insane? It was not fun. I was tired of it, so I skipped the next 3 hours and listened to the last 2 hours. When I started listening at the end, the same thing was still going on. She was running from these men, but they kept showing up, hurting her, and frightening her. I was glad I skipped three hours of that. Finally, the last 50 minutes was a different kind of story. That part was more interesting and not just the helpless victim. The truth is learned and there is some action. However, it's done in a tell-all method with one character explaining everything. Tell-alls are not a good way to end a story. The ending was too easy to be believable, but at least it was happy.Some experts say don't write about a wimp. This felt like 9 hours of writing about a wimp. I would have preferred that the first 9 hours of possible madness be shortened to maybe 2 hours. It might have been better as a novella.The two narrators were good: Laural Merlington and Mel Foster.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Unabridged audiobook reading time: 9 hrs and 56 minutes. Swearing language: strong, including religious swear words, but rarely used. Sexual language: none. There was one sex scene, briefly mentioned with no details. Setting: 1980 locations not mentioned to avoid spoilers. Book copyright: 1982. Genre: mystery suspense. Ending: happy for main character.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Dean Koontz books, see my 5 star review of Lightning posted 6-27-12."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"\\"The House Of Thunder\\" is one of those novels that really has a fine flow to it and forces you to think while you read. It ends up having an ending that is too twisted and complicated that reading the rest of the book becomes a waste of time.The novel follows a woman named Susan Thorton, who mysteriously wakes up in a hospital bed. She comes with little knowledge of her past, but begins to uncover the mysteries one by one. Susan also begins to hold paranoia in the fact that she is being surrounded by treacherous figures from her past. Many of which are in the forms of doctors at the hospital. Who exactly are these people? That's the question that flirts in her mind.A twist makes the ultimate impact to this novel toward the end of the novel, when there is question as to what happens to her fiance. Unfortunately, that's what causes the novel to go downhill. Introducing something completely irrelevant and what seemed to be a plot twist that I've encountered before, but in a different context, makes the novel not worth the read.Generally, with just about anything, it's not about how it starts, but how it finishes. Something could start out slow, but end on a good note. Other things could start out quick, but end on a sour note. This started out like it was going to be intriguing, but it fell flat on its face. It's just unfortunate when a novel has so much potential energy before it goes haywire."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I have read a Dean Koontz book I liked, actually two and so I thought I would have some entertainment as I recovered from knee surgery, laying back and reading. What a simplistic, unsatisyfing book! The dialogue is like something generated by a computer program, the romance way too convenient and the suspense - gosh, turn on the lights, I am so scared. No. I wound up not caring what happened to the main character and her simplistic inner dialogue though now I am aware that I could end up in the hospital with a gorgeous,, single doctor giving me kisses as part of my treatment. This is absolute drivel. If you find yourself enjoying this you need to reach out and challenge yourself more."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Nope. This is is all glitter and very little substance. Dean Koontz tries a high-flying act here that simply falls on its face. This is all artifice and very little substance. Not at all satisfying to this reader."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is one of those mysteries where you have absolutely no idea what is going on until the very end. Is she imagining things because of her brain injury? Is she really seeing ghosts come back from the dead to take their revenge? Or is it all just an elaborate plot to send her crazy? I really enjoyed most this book and I would have loved to give it a higher mark. Sadly, though, it was let down by the ending, which seemed to be rushed and didn't really fit the rest of the story. It is as if the author ran out of inspiration at a certain point and just tacked on a stock ending. I was left with a feeling of dissapointment and anti-climax when I finished this novel. Such a shame."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Susan Thornton wakes up in a hospital, at first not even remembering her name, much less how she got there. Slowly some of her memory comes back, but not everything. She has no recollection of the car accident that put her in the hospital and can't place any of the names of her co-workers from her job. With the help of a handsome, caring doctor and a plucky nurse Susan begins to feel better. Then she starts seeing men from her past at the hospital. Men that killed her boyfriend in college right in front of her. She starts to wonder if she's losing her mind because several of these men she knows to be dead, but she sees them just the same. The tension is heightened when these men that shouldn't be there threaten to kill Susan. She begins to see a conspiracy among the doctors and nurses at the hospital and eventually escapes leading her to discover the strange truth of what happened to her.This was a bad book. Its not particularly well-written, the dialog being the worst offense. No one in House of Thunder speaks the way real people do. There is also a lot of repetition. Koontz keeps saying the same thing over and over in a different way. The character development is non-existent. Again, we learn a lot of facts about people, but not really who they are. It was boring at the beginning taking too long to spark my interest. I started to skim pages and the only reason I kept reading was because of the one strong point of the book. I wanted to know what was happening to Susan Thorton. Koontz had me wanting to know what was going on and I couldn't figure it out. You won't figure it out either because it's the stupidest ending to a book you'll ever read. As I saw the words on the page I said out loud, \\"you have to be kidding me\\"."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"The first 3/4 of the book was pretty good, but the end was just bad. He sums up the solution very quickly and gives an unsatisfying and ridiculous answer that sounds very very similar to other books. He recycled a lot of the ideas at the end and I was quite disappointed. I love dean koontz but im getting tired of him reusing ideas over and over. My favorite book of his is \\"Lightning\\"."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Early Koontz but a thoroughly ripping good yarn all the same. There are smidges of Koontz telltale signs e.g. the description of the shadows in Susan's hospital room and his overt wordiness which I lapped up eagerly as always.I know the budding romance didn't find favour with all readers but I was gripped and wish Koontz had gone into more depth. I fell just a little bit in love with Dr. Jeff McGee myself.I would love it if Koontz would rewrite the last 100 pages or so and give more depth to the relatively rushed ending. Please Dean - if you are reading this?"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This was the first Dean Koontz book I have ever read. This book got me hooked on his books--forever. Definately intense. My favorite Koontz"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. I could not put this book down. After reading it a few years ago, it is still my favorite Dean Koontz book. Anything is possible in this high tech world that we live in. Could this happen to you? It is kind of scary if you think about it"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Yeah, it is bad; and dated. As most have explained, the beginning is much better than the ending. The Russian angle is interesting only in that I can't believe we (Americans) we're really that paranoid, but I'll give him that one. What I really didn't like at all was all the over-explaining. It was really annoying being talked down to like that. Its like being told a story about a story when all you wanted was just the story. Ah well it is an early work, only a consummate Koontz fan should suffer it, though. Thank goodness his writing has matured. The good new is there is a new Odd Thomas book out!!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"The House of Thunder was a great book w/so many twists and turns, yet the writing was so vivid, it feels like I watched a movie. The end was a tad cheesy, somewhat romance novelish. Being a Dean Koontz fan, I know to expect happy endings, but this one was just rather... disappointing. It felt like the story was cut off too early.All in all, this book was very interesting and satisfying. It made you question the reality of the events happening in it. I'd recommend."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I thought this book was incredible. It was full of twists and turns and had great suspense.

Most of his books keep me completely on edge. But this book was different in two ways: One: It wasn't scary, the suspense stuff was, to be nice, dumb. It didn't contain his usual grip on the horror scene. Two: I fell completely in love with the developing romance between Susan and McGee, and I mean completely. Get this: one line just says: &quot;Then McGee kissed her.&quot; It's so dumb and corny, but I loved it. You have to read all the beginning stuff, but it was so sweet. I liked the doctor patient thing, and I hated it when the ending ruined it with all that Russian stuff. I want more of the romance stuff, I loved it!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I thought this book was good, even though other reveiwers were dissatisfied with the ending.

Keeps you spellboundwanting to know what is going to happen next. It's more likereal life than science fiction. He makes things that happensound like something that COULD happen! Makes you look atlife a little more deeply."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This was my 24th Dean Koontz book (I've written reviews for every one) and I thoroughly enjoyed it...up until the end when things were \\"explained\\".Susan Thornton wakes up in a hospital with partial amnesia. She's shocked to learn she's been in a coma for three weeks after being in a car accident. As she is being nursed back to help and a romance develops between her and Doctor Jeff McGee, Susan begins seeing terryfing visions. Hospital patients suddenly look identical to four men who brutally murdered her boyfriend over a decade ago, and they're threatening to rape and murder her come Friday. The nurses insist she's hallucinating. Have the four men come back from the dead? Are they ghosts? Look-alikes? Or is are they figments of Susan's aidled brain?There is one truly frightening scene where Susan is chased into the bathroom by a mysterious MAN'S voice calling her name from behind the curtain hiding her sleeping FEMALE roomate's bed. She then closes the bathroom door only to hear someone scratching and clawing on the door, trying to get in. Then when the noises stop, she opens the door....and no one's there. Then she decides to look behind the curtain....During scenes like these I seriously expected to give this book five stars, but the ending ruined all thought of that. The explanation for Susan's \\"hallucinations\\" is ridiculous. It's as if Koontz had no idea whatsoever how to wrap things up, so he came up with a pathetic, half-baked ending with little explanation. What IS explaned is laughable. It truly is the worst ending I've ever read from Koontz-very rushed and unbelieveable.Would I recommend The House Of Thunder? Yes, but not as an introduction to Koontz. It's most certainly a good book, with some good scares, but the ending will leave you cold. I recommend it for established Koontz fans. Like The Voice Of The Night, it was refreshing to have only one character viewpoint and less lenghty description.So far out of the 24 I've read, my favorites are:INTENSITYWATCHERSWHISPERSHIDEAWAYFALSE MEMORYTWILIGHT EYESDARKFALL"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Okay so my title has nothing to do with the book per se. What it has to do with is this. Koontz is like any other author. He reaches a period when his books are somewhat hit and miss. He's turning out so many stories that some of them are good, some...ehhh.... not so good. This one is not a hit in my opinion. There's just too much going on and I felt like it never truly got tied together in a believable knot.A car wreck, fear at her company's name, a dead former boyfriend and a Soviet conspiracy.... How one train of thought leads to the other is anyone's guess but honestly I felt like this book was just a bit over the top. Typical to Koontz, he writes characters you love, hate, or love to hate or hate to love...but you feel SOMETHING for them. They leap of the page into the realm of believability. That is the reason for my 3 star review. The plot itself suffers from an OVERactive imagination, I'm afraid. Many of Koontz's works are worth reading. If I were going to choose one to skip, this one would be at the top of my skip list."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"\\"House of Thunder\\" is one of those stories where you are never really sure if the heroine, Susan Thornton, is really experiencing the events unfolding in the novel, or is she simply crazy and hallucinating? After a horrific car accident, Susan suffers from selective amnesia, and while trying to put the pieces of her life back together, nightmare-like ghosts from her past suddenly begin to haunt her waking world. Are the visions real or are her tormentors just a by-product of a brain injury suffered during the crash? Together with a young doctor, Susan is determined to find out.This novel is pretty unusual and not what you would expect from Dean Koontz. There are several twists and turns taken through the story, and the ending is a doozie (if not a little dated). Hopefully, you've skipped the editorial review on the product page here, as they drop a whopping spoiler towards the end of their review. If you like Koontz, you will like \\"Thunder\\". It has the characterization Koontz is known for, and it's a quick read. The action has a nice pace, and doesn't lag, and Koontz does a great job of building up suspense and creating a spooky aire of paranoia that has the reader questioning everything by the end of the tale. Recommeded for readers already familiar with Koontz's other work."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I gave this book 3 stars because some of it is absolutely terrifying, I was actually afraid to turn the page a couple of times.

I have read it many times and am still blown away by it."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"It read fast and for the most part I enjoyed it, but I have read numerous Dean Koontz books and I can't say this was my favorite. It was great through out most of it...until the end. There was just something about it that I didn't like...a little too abrupt. I would still recommend it as it was definately a great read, however I wish he would rewrite the ending to give it the edge most of his books have."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"One of my favorites, I also read this under his pseudonym of Leigh Nichols. I was completely blown away by this story and have read it many times!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Wonderful book with a lot of frightening moments that had one of those endings that you totally don't expect, but when you get there, you realize it was a waste of time.

It started of very good and was very fast paced. Then 3/4 of the way through it took a turn for the worst. I forced myself to finish it,and I was glad that I did. The ending just seems a little far-fetched to me."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I thought that book was Koontz's absolute best... usually Koontz writes drawn out pages of boredom in his books.. this book was wonderful and thrilling on every page."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book opens when Susan Thorton has just awaken out of a coma. She is very disoriented and remembers very little about the 3 weeks before when she remembers the devasting car accident. She knows very little about her background or her life back home of the East Coast. The doctors don't have a clue either, or do they. That is the question you are trying to answer the whole novel as Susan tries to figure out the strangeness of small Wilawauk County Hospital. Basically, the plot of this book is very suspensful and flows well. The one minor thing is that the end unravel s so rapidly. This book is a very good suspensful thriller. I recommend this book to Dean Koontz and Stephen King fans alike. The plot keeps you turning the page and waiting for the end. The one minor flaw is that the end unravels so quickly."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"with stunning plot twists until the very end, Dean Koontz's &quot;House of Thunder&quot; keeps you in the story.

Way to go Dean, a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I have only read three Koontz novels, but I can still critique his work. This Book was great, until about three fourths of the way through it, when the fear that had building had the rug pulled out from under it. You were convinced the reasons for the strange happenings at the Hospital were supernatural, until he switches to a reality ending with really took away from the novel. It was a good twist, it just kinda stopped the suspense. Who cares what it is if it's not ghosts? But maybe you'll like it. Read it and find out yourself."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"First of all, I cannot believe that Dean Koontz, the guy who wrote one of my favorite books -- Dragon Tears -- is the author of this truly miserable story. Sure, there is lots of suspense that pulls you in and you're asking yourself 'what could be the possible explanation', but you are only on a ride to total disappointment. The ending is unrealistic, poorly thought out, and just plain foolish. I never yelled at a book before until I read this. What a waste of time. Only if you're still living in the Cold War could you possibly obtain any satisfaction from this book."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Don't waste your money. This book is so slow I almost gave up reading it, but since I have to finish any book I read I kept with it. The book did get somewhat interesting around page 300, mind you the book is only 360 pages long. If you really have to read this book, go the the library and borrow it. I've read many other books by Dean Koontz and this is my first disappointment."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"The power train of a truck consists of the engine, transmission, driveshaft, universals, axles and wheels. If the wheels can't be made to turn, the truck is junk.A story has a beginning, a middle, and an ending. If the ending can't be made to work, the book is junk. And such is the case here.Although Koontz and I are political opponents, that doesn't stop me from really liking a lot of his work. &quot;Watchers&quot; is on my read-again-and-again shelf. I have come to expect at least a good read from a Koontz novel, and for the first 320 pages out of 360 my expectations were being met.The protagonist, Susan Thornton, wakes up, apparently (it's never safe to assume, though) in an Oregon hospital after an auto accident. She has apparently been in a coma for three weeks and is suffering from selective amnesia - she can't remember anything about her workplace.She is also plagued by dreams of a ghastly murder she witnessed in her past, and then she starts to see the murderers - some of whom have died since! - walking around the hospital as orderlies. They threaten her diabolically, yet as far as everyone else in the hospital is concerned it's all in her head. Is it? Or is everyone in on the conspiracy? Or is there a reasonable supernatural explanation?The atmosphere of confusion and paranoia is handled well, the reader is pleasingly baffled, all the simple answers seem to be ruled out, and as you approach the end you say, &quot;Geez, I'm stumped - I wonder how he'll explain all this!&quot;And then - AND THEN - you hit pages 325-330 and all of a sudden the bottom drops out. The Explanation is given and you just gape and you cannot BELIEVE that it is as miserable and unconvincing as it is. I don't believe in giving away endings, but you know what it's sort of like? It's sort of like in the original Star Trek when Kirk's away team gets into an insoluble dilemma on an incomprehensible planet and all of a sudden an alien appears and says, &quot;We were just experimenting to see what your species would do in this situation.&quot; I don't mean that the Explanation here is indeed alien experimentation, but that it's something equally hokey, overused, and implausible.Furthermore the Explanation is revealed by having one of the characters just come out and explain the whole thing. Furthermore there are a million holes in the Explanation if you think about it for a minute and say, &quot;could this really work? In that case why did those people do that&quot; etc. Furthermore it is followed up by some closing action involving entities of great power and prescience making idiotic mistakes like Batman villains (1960's live-action series) and shooting themselves fatally in the feet.The best explanation I can think of for this awful volume - which was first published under a pseudonym in 1982 - is that Koontz wrote the first 320 pages and then realized he had written himself into a corner and just couldn't think of an ending that made everything work. So he tacked on this miserable one and tried to cut his losses by peddling it under an alias. But years later, Koontz became UltraSuperMarketable, and Berkley putout a uniform edition of all Koontz's stuff, and Koontz was cajoled into resurrecting this dead book and throwing it into the lineup in the believe that superKoontzfans will pay $8 for a dead mackerel with his name on it.But the fact that 30-odd people have given this book 4- and 5-star reviews here is more eerie and eldritch and Unexplained than anything in any book by Koontz!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Ok, first off, I would like to say this: Koontz was the first &quot;adult&quot; novels I read. I started reading his stuff when I was 12 or 13 (way back when...) and enjoyed him alot. Soon after, I started reading Stephen King. Ok, I really don't know what the hype is over King. His books are ok, but the endings are TERRIBLE! Also, he has alot of useless pages and pages filled with nonsense information thats not important to the books. And he just has to much sex in his books. What a pervert man! God...so anyway, I really prefer Koontz to King. Lets get on to the book then.... 3/4 of this book is really good. The story is good, believable, and there is really good character development. Also, your suspense is carried throughout most of the book. Then comes the end. PLOP! Oh was that the entire book going down the drain I heard? I thought so...I'm not going to try not togive anything away, but I mean...come on! Russian Tests? Government Conspiricies? Brainwashing? A FAKE TOWN! I'm sorry if that ruined the ending if you haven't read it yet, but it shouldn't give TOO much away. It's really weird. Overall I liked the book alot. Good plot, good characters, good suspense, but the ending was rushed and it sucks. So anyway, READ IT! It's good. I still don't know why King is considered the king of horror..."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I hardly ever give such a low rating, but I expected far more from Koontz. He spent way too long repeating over and over that the character was probably nuts. I was completely apathetic before the pace picked up. By then I couldn't have cared less what finally happened to her... he may have slipped political intrigue in, but by then it was just another crazy hallucination for me."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Susan Thorton awakes in a hospital bed and is told she has been in a coma for a long time as a result of a car crash which she can't remember. In fact she can't remember anything about her life at all except what happened to her fiance a long long time ago in the cave system known as the House of Thunder. He was brutally murdered by four bigots who did not want him in their fraternity. Those four men are dead now, she knows this for a fact but she swears she is seeing them in the flesh as other patients and staff. She is also falling in love with her neuro-surgeon who has a few secrets of his own.This is not a fast paced thriller with most of the book set inside the hospital with Susan in the bed with the reader going into her confused mind. The House of Thunder picks up the pace at the end but the ending is too easy and not real exciting. There are a lot better Koontz novels out there than this one."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book hit some good points as far as brainwashing and fear of yourself go. It was a little predictable but overall, not bad. I would be willing to try another Koontz book."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I really didn't like this book at all. It was way too creepy for me!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is probably one of Koontz's worst books ever. The plot is cliche' and dull, the characters unrealistic, and the sentence structures simple and repeatative. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"After reading \\"Watchers\\", which was quite possibly the most retarded literary effort in recorded human history, I was pleased with this book from the get-go. The fact is, the story is revealed piece by piece in a manner that does have you flipping the pages with zeal. Did I just use the word \\"zeal\\"?Anyway, enjoyed this book up until the last 30 pages. After finishing the story I was like, \\"Umm...okay. What was that all about? Was that a joke?\\" It was as if Koontz just totally gave up at the end of the novel. Like he got sick of writing it and just threw in the towel. Extremely unfulfilling end, and I would have given this book 2 stars, however, since \\"Watchers\\" was so apallingly awful, by comparison this book is a 3-star-er."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"By the looks of the reviews, some like Koontz no matter what he writes and that's okay. This is the 4th Koontz book I have read and I didn't care for any of them.Sorry - I guess I will go back to Stephen King."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"To tell you the truth, I have not read The House of Thunder by Dean Koontz. I'm a big Koontz fan and have read several of his books. I'm putting The House of Thunder on my list of books to read. Why? Because my name is Susan Thornton-same as the main chartacter. In Koontz's book, he spells it Thorton. This is a common mis-spelling. In some book reviews(of this book) I find it spelled correctly, in some incorrectly. Thornton is an old English name that goes back several centuries. We have never met a Thornton that spells it without the &quot;n&quot;. So, please remember the &quot;n&quot; in Thornton.Koontz books I have read, Demon Seed, Fear Nothing, Winter Moon, Tick Tock, Shattered, The Mask, The Vision, Lightening, and more. So I'm looking forward to reading The House of Thunder.(By the way when my husband played football in high school, his nickname was &quot;Thunder Thornton&quot;-and I'm not kidding.)"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I skipped through so many pages of this book because it was just terrible. Of course there is another goofy love story &quot;You're so gorgeous that I am in love with you&quot; storyline. And the conversations that these characters have are just bad esp the conversation between the orderlies. I have read some Koontz books and it seems that in every one of them some woman or women are degraded, tortured, or raped or all three. It was really difficult to finish this book. Even Koontz's The Key to Midnight was better than this and that was another bad read. Bottom line: this is probably one of the worst books written by Koontz or any author."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Koontz is among my favorite authors, but I must admit, I found this to be one of his weaker books. It starts out great, full of mystery, but it drags on a bit and I was disappointed with the ending. It was a decent read, but if you're new to Koontz, I'd recommend \\"The Face,\\" \\"Odd Thomas\\" or \\"Intensity\\" for a great story."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"For those who are Koontz fans and even those who have never hard of him this can be a real treat. One of the older novels, it really messes with the reader's mind when it comes apparent that the whole world the main character is in, might not be so real after all.When Susan wakes up in an unfamiliar hospital she knows there was some kind of an accident but she cannot recall what is going on and why is she there. Her freedom seems suppressed by mysterious hospital members and nurses, she starts suspecting something strange is going on and her life is in the middle of it.The story however has a few scary surprises, which made my heart race. Susan Thornton is one character that we grow to like, and we do not want anything to happen to her. Unfortunately for us and for Susan, there is a clever ploy going on at the hospital that will turn her world upside down - few nice scary chapters made me worry for her, it was an intense read! Just when you think she's safe, she ends up in a much worse situation.I read this book into deep hours of the night; it was hard to put down. The ending was very surprising, it left a deep memory that has lasted years, I cant wait to read this again!Great book from Koontz, truly worth your time : )"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Originally released in the early nineteen eighties by the author under his pseudonym Leigh Nichols, this book is a winner. From the well constructed, intricate plot to the downright creepiness of the tale, the reader will eagerly keep turning the pages of this highly suspenseful book.When Susan Thornton, a brilliant physicist, wakes up in the hospital after being in a coma, she has amnesia. As she begins to remember her past, memories about her work or the company for which she worked remain elusive.Then strange things start to happen at the hospital, as people from a dark part of her past, some of whom are dead, begin to appear among the living, very much alive and very threatening to her. Susan is completely terrorized by what is happening and begins to doubt her sanity.Although the ending is somewhat abrupt, and this is not uncommon with this author's books, it is still a satisfyingly suspenseful book. I simply could not put down! Fans of the author will love it."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This thing starts out strong with the definite potential of being a great psychological thriller, but it falls apart at the end. When you spend the last chapter explaining, or TRYING to explain your plot, you know you don't have a strong finish. I won't spoil anything, but it could have been SO much better."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This effort on Koontz's part is just not up to his usual level of entertainment. One of the reasons that he's so good is that you attach to the main characters and progress through the book like a tail hooked on a cat. You feel what the character feels and empathize as if you are the object of the story. This, however, enticed me only as an observer into the life of a character I really didn't care that much about. The book had the possibility of being one of Koontz's better novels but these prospects were never realized. We have a lady hospitalized after a car accident, a fraternity hazing, a sinister corporation, a hospital with secret doors, people who aren't who they say they are - wow - what a set up! Unfortunately, it just didn't come together. Love Dean - I'll patently wait for his next installment of the Frankenstein series. bg"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Hopefully you're not reading this fine DK tome on an airplane trip home...you'll want to bail out without a parachute, the spine-tingling twist toward the denouement easily makes this Koontz offering worth the price of admission!Viva el Koontz!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Susan Thorton wakes up--allegedly following a car accident--with partial amnesia, notably a big black hole of dread surrounding her work as a scientist . Susan can, however, recall the distant past such as the House of Thunder: a cave where she witnessed her boyfriend's hazing death by multiple murderers in college.The past has come back to haunt Susan Thorton. Even the now-dead murderer has made his presence known to her. Fortunately, she has a burgeoning friendship starting with her handsome doctor to help her through the confusion and hallucinations supposedly caused by a bruised brain.You'll be ripping through the pages with the energy of thunder. This novel is suspenseful to the end where all of the elements unexpectedly fall into perfect place. I had no idea how this novel would end, but I sure was loosing sleep to find out! Highly recommended for anyone who has ever doubted their sanity... or just enjoys a great mystery."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is another incredible book by Koontz which I found very difficult to put down.The story revolves around Susan Thorton, waking in a hospital bed after a car accident, having been in a coma and suffering now from amnesia. The terror starts when she slowly encounters dead men from a horrifying incident 13 years earlier.Each time Susan feels like she's starting to understand things, the rug gets pulled out from under her feet, and you're right there with her, baffled at each new turn, and feeling her terror with each encounter with the dead men. As she slowly questions whether she's slipping over the edge into insanity, you also question her sanity, and what is real and what is illusion.Koontz's prose is excellent, truly putting us inside of Susan's head, making you wonder how YOU would react if put in the same situation.An excellent read and a definite recommendation."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I was given this book by someone who was cleaning out their surplus stock of books, and I am glad I decided to take this one home with me. It is an original, enjoyable book that manages to keep you guessing from the beginning right up to the end.The House of Thunder tells the story of Susan Thornton, a 32-year old who awakens from a 3-week long coma after a car accident while travelling near Oregon. As she remembers who she is and details of her life, she discovers a major black-hole in her memory: she can't remember her job, nothing whatsoever. Nothing seems to be able to prompt a recovery of this information, not even after talking to colleagues and friends. However much she would like to obtain this lost memory, she cannot escape another memory: \`The House of Thunder', which she is reliving with what everyone one can describe as horrifying hallucinations... but she is not quite sure.This book is quite a tale, and Koontz did a great job putting it on paper. It's ending is unique and surreal - but Koontz manages to keep it believable and ties up all the loose endings, rarely accomplished with endings this imaginative. The only thing that slightly annoyed me during the book was that at times it could be a bit repetitive in the beginning. The author feels the need to re-iterate that Susan is logically minded and in control of her self all too much, which is brought up every time she questions her sanity, feelings and mental wellbeing. Other than that, the book is easy to read and fast enough that you won't want to put it down.I was not aware the book was written by Dean Koontz (who I have heard of recently but never read any of his books), I thought it was written by someone of the name Leigh Nichols. Hence as an unbiased reader, I would recommend this book to anyone after a great thriller."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book moved very fast. Very scary in parts and the main character is very multi-dimensional. Great surprise climax and satisfying ending. I don't like all of Koontz's books, but this one I truly enjoyed. I read so many books that sometimes it is hard to remember if I read a certain book or if it had the same plot as another I read. This one stands out in my mind still, and I read it over a year ago."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"Good writing until the end. The book builds the reader up to the climatic event then resolves it in summary. He must have been very rushed to finish it because you get 70 pages about a regular day, then the last week is all in just 70 pages. The abrupt ending really made me dislike the book. He should be embarrassed about this worst than amateur and rushed ending and re-write it. You are supposed to show the reader what is going on, which he did successfully for a good portion of the book.....but then ended up telling the reader what was going on which is something you are NEVER SUPPOSED TO DO! He needed an easy way out of this book, he was either on a deadline or was super tired of writing it and it is evident while reading it. \\"she went into the phone booth and pulled out a quarter from her jacket that she had gotten from the Laundromat\\"----we followed her every second up to this point but never saw her going to the laundromat----it was like he realized that it made no sense for her to have a quarter in her pocket and tried to add a quick explanation of the quarter but it was VERY UNSUCCESSFUL! If you decide to read this, quit reading before the end and write your own ending in your head! Mr. Koontz you should really consider giving more time to the ending, it is insulting to have people spend time with your book only to provide such a terrible ill thought ending. I would absolutely re-read the ending if you did make it more detailed, because I enjoyed the book up until that point."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"wow the ending will leave you breathless...i read this entire book in one sitting. i couldn't put it down. i loved it."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This book was awesome, I enjoyed it and was caught in a trance from beginnig to end. I couldn't put it down. I recommened this book to any suspense, thriller, or mystery book lover."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"The House of Thunder by Dean Koontz would have to be one of the best books written by him. He takes this book is packed with a lot of different genre: suspense, thriller, drama, a little romance and some sort of science fiction. If you are thinking about purchasing this book I guarantee its worth a read so defiantly purchase. And the ending like all Koontz's book that I have read so far end with a twist that leaves you sort of shocked."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is the second best Koontz book I have read (Watchers being the best). I could not put it down. I wanted so badly to find out if things turned out ok, I wanted to cheat and look at the end; but I did not want to ruin the read for myself, so I didn't. The ending was a surprise."},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I had already read this book years ago but just ordered a ton of Dean Koontz's books to be read again. I am very happy that I did. This was an excellent book. Somewhere in the back of mind, I kept thinking that I remembered the ending but I didn't. I am thrilled that I read this book again and I can't wait to pick up another one and read it!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This is one of the scariest novels he has written!! I loved this book it gets you all comfortable and then Bang!! your scared and you are wondering if there is an answer to this !! It is so be prepared because you will not put it down until you find out!!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"House of Thunder was great. I read it a few years ago and I can still remember being entranced by all of the twists and turns and different directions that this book sent us in. Dean Koontz rules and every book he has published is worth reading!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"This was one of the scarriest books I have ever read. It is very suspensful through the very end. It will keep you guessing! I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The House of Thunder","review":"I found this to be another one of Koontz's terrific novels. I did not hate it (heavens, no!), but it was way too quiet. It wasn't as actively suspenseful as, for instance, Phantoms or Watchers, but it was definately creepy. The ending was very confusing, and I still am trying to figure it out. All in all, I was satisfied by it."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"It was obvious from the first trail we picked from this book that the author had not even viewed the trailhead from inside his car let alone set foot on the trails. Simple things like finding the trailhead were confusing, and downright wrong in some instances. Descriptions of trail landmarks and crossings were confusing, wrong, or nonexistant. This book is likely a compilation of very old trail descriptions that were not truthed now or in the first place. Best check in at the visitor center befor venturing off with ths unreliable trail guide."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"I purchased another book about hiking Mount Olympic, which was good but not really what we needed since we were doing all of our hiking as day hikes. If you don't buy this book and you plan to day hike Mount Olympic you will surely be wasting your time. You will spend most of your time on trails that were designed for backpackers. I know that you may not understand this comment but, if like us you backpack and day hike most of the time, you will understand the comment. Most of the trails in Mount Olympic are very long trails. The are not loop trails and some are 40-50 mile long through hiking trails. A day hiker cannot possibly cover 80% of these trails on a day hike. This book gives you just what you will need to make a decision on which trails to hike. It gives you a difficulty rating along with a beauty rating of 1-5 backpackers, meaning 5 is the best. I found these ratings to be very accurate discriptions of the beauty. Also it tells you each trails elevation gains. Which is very essential to this Floridian. You may have mountain goat legs but I don't. The ratings of easy to extremely difficult make for easy decisions. My son's who are late teenagers always choose the more difficult trails where my wife and I tend to choose the easier trails. This park is very diverse and without this book we could have wasted lots of times driving. Instead we spent our time just where we wanted to go. Happy hiking!!! The trip was worth it."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"Just returned from the Olympic Peninsula and found this guidebook to be less helpful than expected. Perhaps things have changed their since the 2002 publication so double check info on hikes before heading out. Had trouble finding trailheads for #61, specific distances would have been helpful in the \\"Getting There\\" section, wasted 1 hr and lots of gas trying to find #59 Big Flat,never found it. A confusing time trying to locate #35 Mount Angeles Saddle, trailhead signage doesn't include this name, located it nearly a mile in. Recommend a more current publication."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"Although well written and generally humorous, the hikes described in this book are often not day hikes, or barely on this side of being day hikes. It seems Mr. Blair doesn't include looking at flowers, trees, animals, views, etc. on hikes, but instead sprints as fast as possible from point to point. A hike estimated at a &quot;conservative&quot; 7 hours took a triathlete and a disance runner NINE HOURS to complete. One hike he describes as a day hike (High Divide) is described in EVERY OTHER book as a 2-4 day hike. Fast and light is one thing, but Seabury Blair is living in a fantasy land. Be forewarned: unless you are a VERY strong hiker who doesn't enjoy hiking for reasons other than for a good workout, this book downplays the difficulty and potential seriousness of these hikes. I strongly suggest a book such as Wood's &quot;Olympic Mountains Trail Guide.&quot; Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"Most hiking guides are pretty dry, but this one is entertaining and fun to read. It's only been on the shelf for about a week, which obviously is not enough time to take all 70 of the hikes listed in this book.But I have read about all of the hikes and the writing style of this book makes the &quot; talk&quot; almost as nice as the &quot;walk.&quot; There's a trail for just about every taste and every ability, from beginner to hardcore hiker.A real plus are the maps. They are topos, so they show the kind of terrain you'll be hiking, and the trail and direction of travel is clearly shown. There's also an elevation profile for each hike.Another feature I liked are the little capsules of each hike, right at the top of the description, so you don't have to scour through a bunch of stuff to find out whether you'll like the hike.I've got all the Olympic Peninsula hiking books, but this is the best one I've seen so far."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"Not sure what problem one of the previous reviewers had with getting herself lost on the way to a trailhead, but her criticisms are completely off base. A LOT of longtime Olympics trail veterans know the author personally, because he's spent the better part of his life on these trails, and is undoubtedly better equipped to decribe them than someone from say...oh, Kansas. Based on our own extensive local knowledge, we can attest that this book is a worthy survey of some of the nation's greatest day-hiking lands, by one of the region's acknowledged local experts."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"I consider myself a moderate hiker and had no trouble traversing the trails described in this book in the time frame stipulated. When I'm hiking I'm not studying flowers or sitting still looking for birds. I usually trot along at the average pace that rangers have told me most hikers do, two miles an hour. That includes stopping to take photos, appreciate views and grazing in the occasional blueberry patch. Mostly, however, I'm there to hike.Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula is a good, concise, easy-to-use guide that provides perfectly useable directions to trailheads. A pet peeve of mine is wasting valuable outdoors time trying to navigate my way in a car to a trailhead. I never had that problem with this book. In fact, I appreciated the tip provided for the trailhead at the end of the 8-mile gravel road accessed near the Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center. I never would have known this narrow road leads to a trail.The walks listed are a good assortment for average day hikers. I only tried a few of them (Hoh River Trail being my favorite - not least of which is because there's basically no elevation gain and I saw 25 - 30 Roosevelt elk there!) so I can't vouch for the complaints of other reviewers. However, I've kept the book for future reference, meaning I'd definitely use it again. I can't wait to get back to the Pacific Northwest to explore more of the wonderful wilderness and hiking is the best way to do it.All in all I'd recommend this book. It's not perfect but for casual day hikers it can be mighty handy."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"I had high hopes for this book but, suffice to say, it's no longer in my collection. I have no question but that the author knows his topic. However, like a previous reader, I found myself confused and even lost (at $3.00+ a gallon) trying to follow directions that are too vague and in one case really led me astray.If you want someone's opinion (and don't we all have one), this book is okay. But do yourself a favor and cross reference suggestions and particularly directions. Or, better yet, just find a better resource. Sure wish I had."},{"Title":"Day Hike! Olympic Peninsula: The Best Trails You Can Hike in a Day","review":"This is a very thorough hiking guide, no doubt about it. My only comment besides that is, the author is a VERY experienced hiker; so when he describes a hike as \\"easy\\", it might no really be the case! I am young and healthy, but the difficulty level seemed definitely more strenuous than described.On the other hand, if you are super fit, go for it, the book is good."},{"Title":"Day Hike!

I was very impressed by the North Cascades book in the DayHike! series, so I bought the Olympics one. The author does have a very good sense of humor, and understands the whining that accompinies 3,000 ft elv gains! I was a little disapointed that some of my favorite hikes were not included(oh well, then I won't have to share them!) in the Eastern Olympics and that I found a few errors-such as when bridges fell in,and some of the FS road directions could be better-with this book if you don't know the NF rd system, a FS rd map is a wise investment!. Still, it is a nice addition to your library-and it won't drag your pack down like Wood's book. And his love of hiking is very noticeable :)"},{"Title":"Beads to Buckskins, Vol. 2","review":"All of Peggy Sue's books are excellently written with clear, easy to follow instructions.

A great coffee table book, gift for anyone who collects WB Thomson's work or has a connection to San Antonio."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Petticoats","review":"Told from the perspective of a young boy, Redcoats and Petticoats makes history come alive. Young readers easily see themselves in the place of a boy puzzling over the things his mother is asking him to do and wondering if the stress of the war and his father's capture is making her crazy. Imagining themselves as such allows students to see history as real and personal experiences happening behind the anonymous dates and times and places of history texts. While this book is recommended for ages 5-9, I would encourage middle- and high-schoolers, as well as adults, to read it. The text, while simple and straightforward, is not condescending, and the story is fascinating. The laying out and building of the story maintains interest and suspense, while depicting the indomitable spirit and ingenuity of our Revolutionary patriots. I would consider this book a must-read to accompany any study of our Revolutionary period in history, or a terrific and enlightening story to read for no particular reason at all."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Petticoats","review":"When you are an ordinary person, living a peaceful life in a small town, and suddenly find that an invading army has turned your church into a fort, there is no question that your life has been changed! When those strange soldiers move into your home, arrest your father as a traitor, and your mother starts to act crazy -- doing laundry over and over -- you know that life may never be the same again!This book is the true story of a Long Island family who became part of the Setauket Spy Ring, earning the gratitude of George Washington. Illustrated beautifully with watercolors, this simply written text would be entertaining to both children and adults.Maps and historical notes are included. Redcoats and Petticoats is a wonderful achievement."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Petticoats","review":"I used this book for a 5th grade reading lesson on thinking while you read. It also tied in well with the Revolutionary War unit we were doing in Social Studies. Because the book sets the stage for a surprise ending and has characters the kids could connect with, there was a LOT of thinking going on.Great pictures, text, plot. Based on a true story about a woman who is a Patriot spy during the Revolution."},{"Title":"Redcoats and Petticoats","review":"This book was a very interesting story for children interested in the Revolutionary War.

This book also lends itself to teaching some reading skills such as inferring, predicting and asking questions."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"Whenever I teach a class for actors, I recommend Moss Hart's autobiography, ACT ONE. It is simply the finest book I know about the theatre and what it was like to work on Broadway in the 1920's thru the 1950's. It was a true tragedy that Hart died so young, robbing not only his family of husband and father, but the world of a great playwright and director and chronicler of his times.This is a funny, perceptive, first-hand account of life in the fast lane of one of the best playwrights Broadway has ever produced. An obsessive worker (it was the stress of his constant work that ultimately killed him), a perfectionist, a brilliant upstart, Hart teamed with George S. Kaufman to write some of the best and funniest plays of the first half of the 20th century...and even today. Is there really a better play about a family coping through love during the Depression than \\"You Can't Take It With You?\\" (That was a rhetorical question). And as Nathan Lane proved only two years ago, \\"The Man Who Came To Dinner\\" is very much worth reviving in a first class production even if you have already seen it in your local community or dinner theatre. The autobiography doesn't so much end as it stops and it is obvious that Hart meant to write a second and, perhaps, a third volume that would include his other writing partners, his Hollywood career, his directing, etc.Steven Bach has written a biography of Hart's entire life called DAZZLER, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MOSS HART that is a fine companion to Hart's own, unbeatable ACT ONE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"&quot;Act One,&quot; Moss Hart's timeless autobiography, is not only the story of a man's life and dreams, but of an era that feels as legendary and distant to us as Camelot. All of the theatrical giants are there, peppered in among a cast of characters that include Hart's painfully dysfunctional family as well as his colorful array of employers and cohorts as he scratches out a living in pursuit of a seemingly impossible goal: life in the legitimate theatre. More than anything, it is an inspirational tale of taking charge, of setting out to rise above oppresive beginnings and follow the soul's destiny, no matter how foolhardy that may seem. We know the outcome, but Hart's ability to spin the tale and build the tension is impeccable! Will he really make it? Of course he will, or we wouldn't be reading this wonderful book, but so involving is Hart's journey, that one can't help but get pulled along for the ride. Like the last drops of water in a scorching desert, I wanted to stretch this book out, greedily reading only a few paragraphs at a time so that tomorrow I'd have some left over. If you love the art of live theatre, or if you're an artist in need of a creative jump-start, &quot;Act One&quot; will provide the juice."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"ACT ONE is not just the engrossing story of a remarkable life -- its a precious gift from an author who captures the spirit of his past and passes it on to us. Moss Hart brings the New York of the early 20th Century to life, immersing the reader in the everyday life of that lost world. The despair of his family's poverty, the challenge of survival, the long-gone Catskill resort camps where he got his start, and the glamour of Broadway in its glory years -- all of these things Hart recalls with such vivid impact that they become tangible realities for us in ACT ONE. While Hart was justly acclaimed as a master playwright and director, ACT ONE proves that he also had a gift for superlative, irresistibly readable prose -- you feel you are listening to this man in warm, intimate conversation. Theatrical legends like Sam Harris and the inscrutible George S. Kauffman become three-dimensional and fascinating. Most importantly, this is one autobiography where the author shares a piece of his soul with the reader. Instead of just telling about his family being poor, he gives us a sense of how poverty can crush the soul -- and, conversely, how escaping from such poverty can set the soul free. The result is an autobiography that is not just interesting or entertaining, but genuinely moving. Hart's passion radiates throughout ACT ONE -- passion for success, for New York, for the theatre. And oh, how he brings you into the world of the theatre as he knew it -- the maddening and eccentric personalities, out of town tryouts, exhausting re-writes, soul-breaking failures and sky-high triumphs. If theatre or New York interest you, you canot afford to miss this book. If you simply love a great read, you also cannot afford to miss this book. We all owe ourselves a little joy, and ACT ONE is a joy from start to finish."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"A few years ago when I was doing a lot of theatrical reading I heard about Moss Hart's &quot;Act One&quot; and at the time it was out-of-print. I did not have a computer then, but a local bookseller was able to locate a used copy for me and it is a treasure. Moss Hart was truly an amazing man. He started out in a time when there was not much around in the way of financial security...to put it mildly, but he never gave up. It seems that he was always there to fix whatever problems came up in the Broadway theatre. He wrote this book because his wife, Kitty Carlyle Hart, asked him to and it is a little gem.I am so happy to see that it is now available again and I am going to give it as birthday gifts to two dear friends who share my love of the theatre. They will love it as much as I do."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"I wanted this book to go on forever!Moss Hart was a great storyteller and obviously a charming and intelligent man.

I have rearead it often since the first time I picked it up in my late teens. I love the anecdotes about the Broadway greats ans near greats and how Mr. Hart became famous, but my favorite parts of the book concern his memorable Aunt Kate, a woman whose fate in life was other than she deserved. She is very humanely portrayed, and so is the rest of Mr. Hart's family. I also enjoyed learning more about George Kaufman and his wife. This book's great!"},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"This book is amazing. In my opinion. Well, and in the opinions of other people I know - it was recommended to me by about six people before I bought it. And Hart writes with such an endearing and touching style - the book was a fast read and I was able to really picture everything he was writing about. It's also eminintly quotable - I'm especially fond of the passage where Hart describes a particular actor as having a &quot;style which would be appropriate to give as a gift to a couple on their wooden wedding anniverary.&quot; I'm looking forward to reading Stephen Bach's &quot;Dazzler&quot; to learn more about Hart."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"Moss Hart not only overcame the poverty of which he writes so painfully, but he broke into a closed-door world (Broadway) to become an enormously successful playwright. His detailed memory, combined with his ability to capture the essence of such disparate characters as his aunt and George S. Kaufman, brings his miserable childhood and seemingly endless quest for a breakthrough to life. It's not all pretty and it certainly doesn't tie up simply. It takes more than a decade of perseverance in the face of derision and failure. An important lesson for those who look for the quick rise to the top, and an enjoyable read for anyone who cares about Broadway and the creative process."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"This is a too-short book covering the begining of Moss Hart's life and career and of his long lasting collaboration with the genius of George Kaufman. It involves you in the writing and producing of his first play, and in all the quirks and charms of his friends and family."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"Moving, funny, inspirational. It is also the most informative book of theatre and what it takes to make it in theatre that I have ever read. It remarkably takes you not only into the creative mind and one man's passion for success. More importantly it takes you through the entire process of how luck and planning took him to a very specific goal. I can't recommend it enough for anybody who has ever dreamed of anything and wondered hot to achieve it. Should be required reading for everybody."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"Moss Hart's \\"Act One\\" is a literate exercise in self-examination. Hart offers a non-sentimental appraisal of himself and his family life, and the obsession with theater that lead him to a successful playwriting collaboration with George S. Kaufman. This is real writing, written by a real writer. If that previous sentence is too vague, just check out some of the pages and see for yourself: You'll know exactly what I mean.Hart's understanding of the human condition is adroit and layered. He does not hit you over the head with his insights, instead, they reveal themselves on the page and you want to cry out in recognition.Having read this book now, and having seen Woody Allen's \\"Bullets Over Broadway\\" film from the early 90s, I believe that Allen drew much inspiration for that story line from this book.Recommended highly and absolutely for theater afficianados, fans of good writing, and anyone who appreciates being in the company of someone truly talented."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"This is one of the most interesting (if not THE most interesting) autobiographies about show-biz that we've ever read; Moss Hart's life goes from theater in New York, to Hollywood, and back again.

Quick delivery too."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"Moss Hart is arguably one of the finest and most successful authors of the 20th century theater in this or any other country. Like many successful men in the theater, he came from a background of serious poverty and the true drama of Act One is his perseverence and victory in extremely trying circumstances. There are fascinating glimpses into the theater world of NYC in the 40s and 50s, excellent sketches of George Kaufmann, Beatrice Kaufmann and Max Siegel, and poignant views into the people and places that forged Moss Hart into the extremely urbane, charming and successful man he became, against the hardest possible odds. Superb book!"},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"If you read nothing else from this boffo memoir of theater/art/life, read the chapter on Hart's stint as a social director at a Poconos camp called &quot;Camp Utopia&quot;. I laughed so hard that I painfully bit my lip at his descriptions of camp guests expecting to be entertained, unattractive girls with whom the male social staff had to dance, and his horrendous experience of nine straight days of rain, complete with angry, water-drenched guests expecting him to save their vacation. It's poignant, too, but never maudlin, like some show-biz autobiographies, and it's held up so well over the decades--it rarely seems dated. And if you have the time to read the camp chapter, you have time to flip to the end and read what Hart did the day after his first big success on Broadway."},{"Title":"Act One: An Autobiography","review":"The best Non Fiction I've ever read.

I made it to p. 356, where Hart's inexplicable verbosity (sentences in which sixteen or fewer words belonged & the other sixteen or more did not) - exhausted my patience.What hastened fatal exasperation was an inadvertent discovery. In Act One, Hart's grandfather & aunt Kate died long before the Harts' summer camp disaster in Vermont & his family moved to Brooklyn.According to Hart biographer Steven Bach, both were alive when the Hart's family left the Bronx (Dazzler - The Life & Times of Moss Hart; Knopf 2001).If anyone out there can confirm which author is factually correct, let me know. I'd appreciate it.This memoir's saving grace are Hart's heartfelt recollections of Beatrice Kaufman, wife of George S. (the playwright & actor). Beatrice & Joseph Hennessey edited The Letters of Alexander Woollcott (1944), which appeared only a year prior to Beatrice's demise.For insights into the famous playwright - often, Moss Hart's co-author - & a pleasurable reading experience altogether, I recommend George S.

His output has been prodigious. Riley captures this well, at least for the first half of the book.I have two major problems with this book:1) Riley makes statements about authorial intent which simply can't be justified. When I listen to Blood on the Tracks, I don't contemplate it as a commentary on the end of the sixties. Riley makes these obtuse statements about what Dylan is 'really saying' with such fervour that you'd think he knew Dylan personally (and if he did, so what?). That other review about Visions of Johanna is right on on this point.2) With only a few exceptions, Riley hates anything Dylan has done since Desire. Now this is not an uncommon opinion. Dylan's voice does go through a serious decline. Many of his albums since Desire have been uneven and lyrically weak. Riley, however, kicks poor Bob when he's down and is downright huffy about some of Dylan's better efforts. He pans Oh Mercy in favour of Under the Red Sky and the Traveling Wilburies recordings (has he actually listened to Red Sky? It's flimsy at best, especially in comparison to Oh Mercy). In his updated chapter, he chides Dylan for playing for John Paul II, for not being Sinead O'Connor, and for being 'grumpy' on Time Out of Mind (which despite Riley's objections, is a solid album full of humour and great vocal phrasing). Riley's sermonizing gets progressively weak and unrestrained...I just get the impression that Mr. Riley loved the sixties so much he lives in paranoid denial that they're over. The Republicans may be in office, and Dylan may not be the trend-setting anti-hero that he once was, but please don't blame Dylan for the loss of your adolescent dreams, Mr. Riley."},{"Title":"Hard Rain: a Dylan Commentary","review":"Tim Riley's commentary on Dylan focuses on the music rather than the man. This focus starts fairly well, aside from Riley trying to impress us with his vocabulary. Dylan's early work (from his debut until about Highway 61 Revisited) receives a fairly thorough treatment as Riley tries to &quot;get inside&quot; the mind of Dylan (which is probably not a very wise thing to do in the first place). Even if you don't agree with Riley, his ideas are interesting...at least for awhile. After reading the book, it seems that Riley believes that Dylan hasn't written anything worth listening to since &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; Unfortunately the author all but ignores some of Dylan's most significant contributions past 1975. (Riley spends nearly 250 pages on the period from Dylan's debut until 1975. From 1975 on only gets 50 pages.) This book was a super disappointment by an author who seems to have an axe to grind. The work is saved by giving a good bibliography and an even better discography."},{"Title":"Hard Rain: a Dylan Commentary","review":"Tim Riley's book on Dylan starts fresh. He provides one of the best appreciations of Dylan's voice I have read. OK so the guy has a fresh point of view. Then he weighs into Dylan's early work with gusto. Riley appreciates Dylan's socio political protest in the image of Woodie Gutherie and also gets into what he imagines is drug fueled creativity up to 1966. He finds a drug behind every bush though which is possible but misses the multiple layering of Dylan's work. Then like the folkies who dis Dylan at Newport he starts to turn sour on Dylan during the post-66 period and gets nastier as the book moves on. Until finally in the Epilogue Riley becomes the master of mean invective against Dylan and everyone, except Wilco? Oh yeah, they are singing Woodie Gutherie songs to new tunes - right. There's the connection.My advice - borrow the book, read until Blood on the Tracks and quit. The rest will spoil your day."},{"Title":"Hard Rain: a Dylan Commentary","review":"I found Mr. Riley's &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; a very entertinaing romp through the Beatle song catalog. Big an equally big Dylan fan, I expected the same joi de vivre to inhabit &quot;Hard Rain,&quot; but throughout the book I got the sense that Riley didn't have the same passion for or understanding of Dylan's music and muse as he did with the Beatles. I suspect that he wrote it because it seemed like a natural thematic sequel to the Beatle book. You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows."},{"Title":"Hard Rain: a Dylan Commentary","review":"This book is a waste of paper. You will find dylanoligy at it worst, hidden behind a small amount of credibility. &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; is a fine book (Riley's effort about the Beatles). Riley's commentary here is trite, Vision's of Johanna is not about Heroin, it's about the time I got loaded at my friends house and was thinking about my ex-girlfriend while making out with somebody else. Of course I'm not as old as the song but you should get the point. Dylan just writes 'em. You can not possible dissect Dylan's songs and pick only songs you like calling every thing after &quot;Blood&quot; trash ( that's not his words that's paraphrasing the last half on the book). Some things can not be defended &quot;Knocked and Loaded&quot; but if anybody else put out &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;, Riley would have been singing their praises like he sings punk rocks in the last fifty pages of his book about Dylan."},{"Title":"Hard Rain: a Dylan Commentary","review":"There are so many things wrong with this book that it is not worth my time listing them all. I could rant on and on about the inaccuracies in information, especially in the second half of this piece of rubbish that just falls apart when it comes to covering Dylans eighties and nineties work. Notable albums like Infidels are boiled down to a few sentances (whereas albums like Planet Waves recieve whole chapters). Riley uses a large portion of this increadibly opinionated commentary to discuss &quot;notable&quot; non-Dylan albums that are examples of Dylans influence (ranging from albums by Neil Young to albums by Prince) with a &quot;why couldn't Dylan do this in the eighties&quot; attitude. It is very difficult connecting with Riley's understanding of Dylan because it seems as though he is simply talking to himself, pointing out &quot;good songs&quot; and &quot;bad songs&quot; and offering up cute little explanations and analyses, making this a very boring read. Does Dylan really have to be dissected in such a way? In a nutshell, the &quot;commentary&quot; in this book, like that of a similar waste of paper called &quot;Behind the Shades&quot; by Clinton Heylin, is that Dylan was once a genious and is now a hasbeen with little to offer. Why do all these very dated books end the same? Because,they were premature and, as a result very pointless, considering how much has been added to the Dylan legacy in the seven years since this book was puplished. Wait till he'd dead and then make assesments of his career."},{"Title":"Hard Rain: a Dylan Commentary","review":"ouch! i can't believe the other reviews of this brilliant book. riley is right on target with most of what he says here, and he even manages to make a few old favorites sound new again due to his bold insights.

Sawyer is not only a waste of time, it is also a waste of money. The cases were taken from the files of Ed & Lorraine Warren, but I doubt those files were as poorly written as this book has been.#1. Many of us have memories of an outer-space tv program, where the captain (with spacey sounding music in the background) telling his \\"captain's log\\" of the new adventure that would begin soon. That is the exact \\"captain's log\\" & music I remembered as I read the Introduction!#2. The Foreword, by Ed Warren, was the best part of the entire book. He had obviously written an outline, prepared his thoughts carefully, and wrote intelligently on his beliefs. I am a believer of the supernatural. I was not reading this book to de-ride his, or anyone elses' beliefs. Ed most likely had his material proofread. One may presume that a good writer would have his material proofread by another.#3. I am not sure that J.F. Sawyer was looking to do anything else, but make money off the careers of two well-respected people in their field. I personally felt that the \\"stories\\" written by J.F.Sawyer were below 6th grade essays that I've read in the past. Even a \\"case file\\" would need to be outlined, \\"beefing up the story\\" as a former professor of mine said constantly. One of the early stories consists of 4 2/3 pages. The story simply gives the reader bare bones information about a possession. There is no mention of interventions, prayers or practices to rid one of a malevolent being attempting to possess another. Zip, nada, nothing. The author says, \\"Earthbound by her violent end [...] take over her wonderful and weak cousin?\\"#4. The best story written by Sawyer is called, \\"The Voodoo Doll.\\" The story was written well and I believe the author put more work into this particular story. He \\"fleshed it out\\" & beefed it up\\", causing me to feel that he had actually put some thought and interest into the Dolls.#5. The very best story is the last chapter, written by Betty Joan Burr. Many will recognize the story. It is told well, concise, with both an introductory paragraph and an ending paragraph.#6. It is sad, that out of 143 pages, the first 5 pages include: 2 blank; The title page, title w/author's name; acknowledgement of Ed & Lorraine Warren, and printer's name; copyright and acknowledgement again of Ed & Lorraine & Ed's pictures compose the other 3!

Well it makes nice prose but it is pretty far off the mark and that really sums up much of their work. For example the Irishman Elliot O'Donnell was investigating ghosts and earning a living writing about it, just as the Warrens did, before the start of the First World War. I'd say if you're going to start throwing out the purple prose, just be sure to get your facts checked, but this really does highlight the typical fashion of the Warrens. Get the words out there first and worry long after, if ever, about the facts.Ed and Lorraine Warren made their names as ghost hunters in the 1970's by validating the infamous Amityville Horror, a 'haunting seen by many as one of the most famous hoaxes of the 20th century. They have since written many books and they can tell a good ghost story. The problem is you have to take the \`truth' elements with a big grain of salt. Their research methods are questionable and their world view is, quite literally medieval.Don't get me wrong. They can entertain and frighten, just understand that the \`truth' element should be highly suspect. As an entertaining read of spooky tales this is fun but as a serious investigation...nope. Whereas many investigators today look for evidence that can be examined, the Warrens are of the school of \`funny feelings' and a \`sense of dark presence.' While they may or may not be valid they cannot be empirically examined and are incredibly subjective. Add to this the fact they view the world as literally populated by demons waiting to tempt and pounce on virtuous human souls and you quickly have people willing to scream HAUNTED and DEMONS at the drop of a hat while other people look for and find more normal explanations.These are somewhat creepy stories and for the Halloween spooky season they can be entertaining BUT the are from the files of and are poorly presented AND if you're looking for \`true' or \`paranormal investigations' pass on by.

From what I learned in this book is they were not experts and they did not know everything they about how the supernatural world worked. This is where I'm at in my ghost hunting career.This book is not about solving every case. It's more about how the paranormal or supernatural world works. They do a great job explaining what happened and why it happen. Biggest take-away, don't play with Ouija boards.

They have co-authored 10 books. This book \\"Deliver us from Evil\\" is special because it was their first published book. It was printed by Phillips publishing company in 1973 by author J.F. Sawyer, some 25,000 hard cover copies, and an unknown amount of paperbacks. It never had a second printing to my knowledge. This book is special to me as I have wanted to read it for twenty years but cannot find a copy. Ed passed away in 2006. His wife Lorraine still enjoys lecturing and helping others. Ed and Lorraine originally began touring the country side exploring the paranormal. When they discovered that people and family's were plagued by unexplained psychic phenomena they spent the remainder of their careers helping and genuinely caring about people. They gave counseling and hope to family's who would otherwise would have faltered during difficult times, such as poltergeists, demonic infestation and possession. They worked hand in hand with the Catholic Church assisting these needy families. I never met the Warrens, but if I could I would thank them for making this world a better place."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evil: True Cases of Haunted Houses and Demonic Attacks (Taken from the Files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, Demonologist and Medium)","review":"I have followed the Warrens' stories throughout the years. So I decided to buy this book. I have heard many conflicting information as to the accuracy of the Warrens' accounts of paranormal activity. Ed Warren's foreward is a perfect example of stretching the truth to a degree that makes it a lie. In his foreward he talks about Professor Walter Amory, an Egyptologist, who was cursed by touching an idol at a dig site. Mr. Warren stated that Mr. Amory went into a coma and died right after touching this idol and that before Mr. Amory went on the dig he had been to a doctor and was in perfect health. Well I decided to check this out. The truth is: Professor Walter Emery, was an Egyptologist and yes he died on March 11, 1971 (Mr. Warren stated 03/12/71 as date of death), but Mr. Emery died in Britain after five years of illness and hadn't been to a dig site in years. The only truth in Ed Warren's story is the man's first name and that he was an Egyptologist. So, to start a book with falsehoods to make things much more dangerous and dire, only makes everything I read from then on in by Sawyer or by the Warrens, suspect. I do believe there is evil that is in this world, if you are interested then read books by Rev. Amorth, who is a real exorcist from Italy. I'm dissapointed that Ed Warren would make something up when he was supposed to be trying to make parapsychology and the paranormal something that the scientific community would and could learn and get behind. the Warrens and Sawyer only hurt the cause for the truth that is in the paranormal."},{"Title":"Deliver Us from Evil: True Cases of Haunted Houses and Demonic Attacks (Taken from the Files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, Demonologist and Medium)","review":"I bought this book for my daughter.

What I got instead was a poorly written book that read like it was written by a gushing fan of the Warrens. The only real \\"valid\\" part of this book would have to be the letter in the beginning written by Ed Warren himself.The over-use of exclamation points made it very hard to take this book seriously.

I agree that this is not the \\"best\\" book by the Warrens (or based upon the Warrens)- \\"The Demonologist\\" and \\"The Devil in Connecticut\\" were more compelling to me. But this book is quite far ahead of its time. The scurge of Satanism is exposed for what it is, curses of objects and people are discussed, and there are a number of case studies involving haunted houses and oppressed/possessed people. \\"The Incredible Case of Maria\\" stands out as a very unusual report with some revelations provided by an angel. Starting a thread that continues throughout their publishing history, the Warren's strong belief in the existence of both disembodied human spirits and demonic spirits is made clear.The foreword includes statements by Ed Warren that show that he and Lorraine knew very well that at the time this book was published, they faced a very skeptical religious as well as secular audience. I wish times had changed since then, but mainsteam Christianity continues to ignore the dark side, and most people continue to doubt the existence of the Devil or Hell.If you are interested in Christian demonology, this book is a \\"must-have\\" for your library. I purchased an electronic copy [...] and hope some day to find an affordable used copy.God bless Ed (who joined the Saints in 2006) and Lorraine Warren.

This one was defintitely the best at giving an overview of the various cities and attractions -- the descriptions are just the right length to give you a good overview, the book doesn't shy from giving recommendations and opinions, and there are many beautiful pictures to give you a better sense of each place. My wife and I both fought over this book as the one to read before our trip! NOTE: this is NOT a subsititute, but rather a complement, for a book that lists hotels, restaurants, etc. -- it does not give all the useful info. We'll probably leave it behind when we go on our trip, but will be very grateful we were able to use it in planning where to go, especially for a country as vast as China.

After spending August '05 in China, and reading both books, I must say the Nat'l Geographic book was a disappointment as a practical, on-the-ground guidebook but great as a basic guide to China for someone thinking about going. Here's a quick overview of the good and the bad:THE GOOD:It should be no surprise to hear that the photos in the guidebook are excellent, as it carries the National Geographic name. In addition the pieces it has on different aspects of Chinese culture are very interesting. The book acts as one very long National Geographic article and should not disappoint someone who wants to learn more about China without actually going there.THE BAD:As other reviewers have noted, the hotel and restaurant listings are inferior. Comparing it side-by-side with other major guidebook labels like the China books by Lonely Planet or Frommers shows that the book pales as a practical guide once you actually hit the ground there. This problem cannot be underemphasized: China is a moderately difficult place to get around for the foreign, non-speaking traveller. You need all the practical help and advice you can get and this guidebook does not offer near the level of the other brands. For the relatively novice traveller, I strongly do not recommend relying on this guide for your travels within China.After purchasing both the LP and Nat'l Geographic guidebooks last July I read them both cover-to-cover before leaving on my trip. While the Nat'l Geographic book added a few interesting angles and had many more pictures than the LP guide, I only brought the LP guidebook with my on the trip because (1) you can only bring so many books with you as you go around and (2) it was clearly the more practical guide.Best of luck and safe travelling!"},{"Title":"National Geographic Traveler China","review":"The photos and color are beautiful, as you would expect from National Geographic, but the actual guides to major sightseeing areas are fairly poor.

It is very short on practical information, no Chinese script anywhere (therefore useless if you are trying to get somewhere independently), and actually pretty brief in the descriptions of the sights, too. The only thing that may have some value are the general sections about culture, religion, traditions, etc.. My 11-year old son read them (he found them a bit shallow). I guess if you are going on an organized tour and want to get an idea of what you will be seeing without taxing your brain this may be OK. If you want how-to information for independent travel, turn to Lonely Planet. If you want good, detailed information on the sights, get the French Hachette guides (not sure if they have been translated)."},{"Title":"National Geographic Traveler China","review":"I purchased this book new and there was a crease in the cover, as if the book had been opened a few times.

In some ways, it is reminiscent of Mark Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi,\\" and almost as much fun. While centered on the Monongahela River--the relatively short river that originates in the West Virginia mountains then flows north to join the Allegheny to form the Ohio at Pittsburgh--the author's somewhat discursive approach encompasses many of the \\"western rivers\\" of the U.S., which flow into the Mississippi. He offers a fascinating account of life aboard riverboats, featuring a number of memorable characters and locales. Along the way, he discusses the rigors of coal mining in West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania; the towns of the Mon Valley; the lives of \\"big money men\\" like Andy Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick; and his own experiences as both a deckhand and a pilot on various riverboats. He has an engaging, conversational style that adds to the attractiveness of his narrative, as well as a wry sense of humor. The book is also illustrated with a number of attractive engravings of life along the Mon which add to the book's descriptive power. Highly recommended for anyone interested in American river life between 1800 and 1952, when the book was published."},{"Title":"Life with father and mother","review":"A few miscellaneous comments:--You might have to look up a few words.

The father, both of the parents, are so well-drawn in it. And the alternation of northern lore with the author's personal story works perfectly: O'Connor's voice is so specific and true, you stay with him as he swings between eskimo legends, a natural history of the northern parts of the continent, and a wildly funny drunken bar room contretemps, easily finding meaningful connections between it all. The main story is wrenching with a beautiful payoff. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Tip of the Iceberg","review":"I work with the author. So much for full disclosure. And I had been told by another colleague before I read it that his book was wonderful. I wasn't prepared, though, to be overwhelmed, and I was: by the richness of its style, the honesty of its emotion, the entertainment of its anecdote, the relief of its humor amid pain and personal discovery. O'Connor travels two paths in search of answers about the emotional chill in his childhood home in Canada and the strange allure of cold climes. This yields on one side beautifully drawn pictures of smalltown life in which O'Connor's growing self-awareness and his tracking of family history coalesce. On the other, its offers perfectly rendered vignettes and lore about famous explorers, plain life and survival in the frigid north. Sometimes the juxtaposition seems impossibly apt, yet never forced. Along each trail run themes in varying proportions of love and hurt, sacrifice and estrangement, distance and intimacy, ambition and constraint. Through it all runs a classically balanced voice, blunt and eloquent and wry in confronting simple or hard truths. There is finally and happily about the book a physical irony in which I regretted its ending so soon but relished the knowledge that I could always find time to return time and again to a book as modest in size as it is grand in reward."},{"Title":"Tip of the Iceberg","review":"O'Connor's beautiful language is as smooth as ice, as clean as fresh snow. This is a haunting, mysterious story of family secrets, which the author tells partly through direct memoir narrative and partly through metaphorical history and legend of the far north. I found the scenes of O'Connor's boyhood to be particularly well drawn: the ways in which he conjures child logic and perception are magical. Touching, strange, cathartic."},{"Title":"Tip of the Iceberg","review":"In its social contours, its family drama, and its rare, sweet honesty, this book makes an enveloping read for anyone, woman or man. But in its insistent unfolding of a son's search to understand his father, it speaks to men and their lives in an unusually heartful way."},{"Title":"Tip of the Iceberg","review":"What a beautiful memoir! The setting, a small town in central Canada, was almost exotic to me. The writing is poem-like, clean and meditative. With his gentle voice, Mr. O'Connor takes you to the world of the sensitive boy whose longing and wonder towards his mysterious father is so vividly felt. The beautiful images in the book will remain with me for a long time. I highly recommend this special work."},{"Title":"Tip of the Iceberg","review":"What a fascinating story! And so well written.

I was gripped from the first page by the elegant prose, the humor and sense of timing, and then by the father/son story and the mystery it entails. I loved all the details of cold - the disease of blindness, the thickness of parkas, what happened to early explorers. And I loved the scenes of Oconnor, watching his father flood the rink.

I found this a bit disappointing...That said, the models are, as one has come to expect from Tomoko Fuse, lovely and interesting variations on traditional patterns and amazing innovations, and I recommend this book enthusiastically!

However, there are several that hold together using Fuse-san's tab-and-pocket designs. (While we're on the subject, I can recommend using paperclips to hold some of the units together during assembly.)These unit and assembly instructions are VERY easy to follow.

At first glance, the book's instruction pages are rather boring, with all the pictures done in a single plain colour. However, the clarity of the instructions more than makes up for this.The book also includes several glossy pages of colour photographs of 'finished products', so that you can see what your origami is going to turn out like. This also helps to give you an idea about what coloured papers might look good.As well as the instructions for a large number of origami designs, the book also includes quite a few small variations on each design, so that you can customise your origami to your liking. These variations are also well explained, and are summarised in a useful table towards the end of the book, so that you can scan all the variations at once, and pick and choose which ones you like.This is a great book, and I've found it to be very addictive - I want to try out all the different designs, and all the variations on those designs as well."},{"Title":"Kusudama Origami","review":"I bought this book very recently and found that the instructions are easy to follow and the patterns / designs are really pretty.

Understandable, considering the founder and president of NAMW is Linda Joy Myers, who is also the author the book. I suppose a little self-promotion never hurt anyone. But I also thought it was a bit narcissistic to use your own book as the one that \\"defines\\" memoir writing and the \\"image\\" of NAMW. Call me a skeptic. I'm used to it.Yet, after reading the book, the cockiness was well deserved! At the age of four, Myers was abandoned by her mother who was seduced by the shimmering lights and wild life of Chicago. Myers and her grandmother (her mom's mom) stand on the station platform to watch the train take her mother away. The train becomes an integral part of the story as it represents those important in Myers life always getting on the train to be taken away from her. For the rest of Myers life, her mother will always be an occasional and troubled visitor.Her father is a prince charming that only visits when convenient, which to say is hardly at all. Myers sees him as her knight in shining armor, placed on a pedestal and can do no wrong, until he tarnishes her image as she gets older. Amazingly, as all resilient kids seem to do, she still loves her father (and her mother) despite his wrongdoings and conjures up excuses for his behavior. As a matter of fact, Myers makes up excuses for everyone's behavior, believing she is to blame for their abusive ways and mistreatment of her. It's not only until Myers is an adult and writes this memoir, that she comes to a true and healing understanding of her tumultuous childhood.It is a poetic and lyrical telling of her life story that is written as a series of vignettes that reveal a multi-generational pattern of abandonment and eventual healing. Myers, a marriage and family therapist, writes in the voice of the first person speaking in the present tense. From the author's perspective, Myers says the choice \\"forced me to integrate the self that I was with the witness I have become.\\"Powerful, insightful without being indulgent, emotional without being manipulative, and richly layered. Its depiction of Ms Myers' incarnations as a child struggling to withstand the tempestuous damage of mental illness; a young woman seeking the truth buried amidst family secrets; and of a strong-willed mother and grandmother fighting to reshape the future out of the past, this is a book that touches all of us, whether or not we have suffered the same."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"I was hooked into this book from page one. Who was this little girl? Why was her life so difficult? Who was making her life a living hell?The answers to these questions are given to us by a child using her five senses. We see, hear, feel, smell, and taste exactly what she is sensing in this beautifully written book to the point where I feel I know this little girl personally. At times, I even feel as though I am standing right there beside her feeling her gut-wrenching sadness as the train takes her mother away to Chicago--again.With every turn of the page, we hope the little girl will finally be rescued by her mother or her father who will love her, and take care of her. But, this never happens.There are very few books where I have actually stopped reading, and said to myself, \\"This is so good.\\" Some lines in this book are written so poetically that I read them twice just to take in their beauty.Linda Joy has written a memoir of a well-examined life full of vivid memories. The journey she takes us on spans from her desperate childhood to her life today that she enjoys with her children and grandchild. No child should ever be abandoned by a parent. Maybe this book will prevent it from happening again."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"As a women's memoir writing teacher and coach, I read memoirs to find exemplars for my classes. I recently read the excellent Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment by Linda Joy Myers. Her compelling life story is written as a series of vignettes that reveal a multi-generational pattern of abandonment and eventual healing. Myers, a marriage and family therapist, writes in the voice of the first person speaking in the present tense. If you are writing, or interested in writing, your memoir, consult this book to understand the dramatic impact on the reader of this voice and tense combination. From the author's perspective, Myers says the choice \\"forced me to integrate the self that I was with the witness I have become.\\" You'll also notice the importance of trains in her life, representing separations and reunions, new ventures and returning home. If you are working on your memoir, consider if there has been a thread running through your life that could be woven into your memoir. Myers, also an artist, creates vitality and vividness in the people and places she shares with us through the use of color descriptors. What passions do you have - gardening, sports, cooking, art, music - that might enhance the telling of your story?I strongly recommend this book as a \\"good read\\" if you struggle with the mother-daughter relationship in your life.

Linda painstakingly uncovers the multifaceted secret of the story of that abandonment and in doing so, takes her readers along on an intensely personal life journey the originates in a home shattered by more than a half-century of dysfunctional family history. Indeed, she found that abandonment was part of a generations-long tradition. But Don't Call Me Mother is also the story of Linda's personal struggle for a peaceful and loving family, breaking the patterns of neglect, achieving an ability for forgiveness. A candid, unflinching, personal memoir of discovery and recovery, Don't Call Me Mother is compelling, and at times inspiring, reading which is especially appropriate for Women's Studies and Family Studies library collections, as well as strongly recommended reading for anyone who were themselves rejected as children by their own mothers."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment is a poignant story on several different levels. It's such a compelling memoir, you have to keep reminding yourself that it isn't fiction. The raw emotions and the bare truth of the story pull you into a drama that no child should experience. It's a testimonial to Linda Joy's strength of character that she could survive such an experience let alone re-live it again to tell her story.Her prose is so poetic, at times you think you're reading poetry. In addition to being a fine author, Linda Joy is a therapist illuminating the spiritual growth that comes from compassion, forgiveness, perseverance, and the courage that can be born of such a tragic childhood.The driving force behind the book is the hope that the chain of abandonment cycling through the generations can finally be broken. Don't Call Me Mother should be read by anyone who has experienced abandonment, divorce, or living with mental illness; however, the book stands on its own as an unforgettable story."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"This was not quite what I thought it was but it was enjoyable, if that is the appropriate term for a book that causes one to cry or reflect on familial relationships. I have been surprised to learn how many women end up in circumstances in which they have effectively, if not actually, been abandoned by their mothers. I gave a copy to my daughter and loaned mine to a friend who I learned had been placed for adoption because her mother didn't want more children."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"I had the privilige of hearing Ms Myers speak recently and was touched by her incredible empathy and understanding for people who have suffered abandonment and abuse in their childhood. Though the memoir genre is overpopulated by stories of Hollywood stars and the like, regaling us with their secrets, Ms Myers' account of three generations of mother-daughter abandonment and her quest to heal the rupture in her family reads more like a lyrical and sensitive novel than a true-life story. Poetic and evocative in its depiction of Ms Myers' incarnations as a child struggling to withstand the tempestous damage of mental illness; a young woman seeking the truth buried amidst family secrets; and of a strong-willed mother and grandmother fighting to reshape the future out of the past, this is a book that touches all of us, whether or not we have suffered the same. Healing and powerful in its message while never being self-indulgent, \\"Don't Call Me Mother\\" is a testament to the resiliency and courage of those who seek to make peace with themselves and discover truth through their losses."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"Whether or not you were abandoned as a child or have mental illness in your family, you will find insight and inspiration in this well-crafted memoir. Therapist Linda Joy Meyers' story is ultimately one of healing and forgiveness, and her journey to wholeness can help fuel your own. The language is rich and layered, the characters compelling. Don't miss this great read!"},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"When someone tells the truth about their life, it can inspire us to be more bold about facing the stories buried in our own past. Linda bravely reveals the heartbreaking moments of a little girl who kept her hope alive even though love arrived only on rare occasions. But when it did, it was warm and meaningful. The shared featherbed, the rose garden, and the baked pies remain symbols to me of how we can be nourised even in the midst of our painful circumstances."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"I am a fan of memoirs and a picky reader. Don't Call Me Mother is a well-written and poignant story-another book that I couldn't put down. If you liked Pelzer, you'll like Myers. If you study family dynamics, womens' issues, psychology, and sociology, you'll get something from the book. When one reads about survivors of abuse, no matter how cliche that may sound, the determination of the human spirit always shines through. Nobody really knows what goes on behind closed doors. Children end up having to make sense out of the often crazy adult world when they are not given the tools to do so. This is a tribute to a determined child who blossoms into an adult, a woman of accomplishment and sensitivity. It also a tribute to a caring teacher - in this case, a music teacher and violinist, who sparks the imagination and devotion of Myers and her peers. One teacher, one loving person can alter the course of a child's life. The book is also a tribute to supportive relatives, Iowa farm families who are the saving grace in the piercing story of a neglected child. I'm so glad Myers took the time to share the story of her life."},{"Title":"Don't Call Me Mother: Breaking the Chain of Mother-Daughter Abandonment","review":"I purchased this book after serching for resources on mother - daughter abandonment. I was researching this subject to see if others has experiences such as mine. By reading this book I have come to understand it and grow. It made me feel as though I was not alone in my childhood experiences. I would highly recommened this book to anyone!!!"},{"Title":"The Clue of the Black Keys : Nancy Drew Mystery Stories : Volume 28","review":"This book was good because when I got into the book, I coudn't put the book down.

The villians , a tricky gang of thieves,will do anything to get the key.They will harrase,kidnap, and fight to get the key.

Because the original series was rewritten and updated in the 60's, some of the plots are suspiciously similar. The Clue of the Black Keys is one of several in the series where the villians are a married couple with sinister plans working for another person that Nancy's father put in jail...et cetera. The story itself is intriguing but because it's so similar to some of the other stories, it's not one of the best."},{"Title":"The Clue of the Black Keys : Nancy Drew Mystery Stories : Volume 28","review":"This review concerns the original 1951 edition. Nancy is approached by a young college professor who tells her about a treasure that he and some other professors were searching for in Mexico. They had found a stone tablet which they believed would help them locate the treasure, but before they could translate it, the tablet vanished along with one of the professors. Did he steal the tablet or was he kidnapped? Nancy is asked to help find the missing professor and the tablet and to guard a valuable, black, half key which together with another 2 1/2 similar keys would unlock the treasure. This is probably one of the 10 best Nancy Drew books. The mystery, though a little implausible, is quite interesting. The book has a lot of action and suspence and was well-written. I was hooked from beginning to end. This is a very good book and every Nancy Drew fan should have this one in their collection."},{"Title":"The Clue of the Black Keys : Nancy Drew Mystery Stories : Volume 28","review":"I'm a 9-year-old in fourth grade named Britany. This book was a challenge for me because it made me predict what might happen in the next chapter. When I was at school I couldn't wait to read this book. I was so interested in the story that when I got home from school I read way over the limit I am allowed to read. Nancy Drew has a life I would like because I like doing mysterious types of things. When I was sleeping at night I had dreams about the book. I mean when I was asleep I'd see the characters move, talk, and do the scenes I had read. In this book there are three black keys and this guy named Jurez Tino who wants all three of the keys to get the treasure. The problem is he only has two and a-half-keys because Nancy Drew had the other half of the key. He is looking for it so he could get to the treasure. There was a house that Nancy and her friends found and they went up to the front and knocked on the door, but no one answered so they knocked again and still no one answered. Then one of her friend's found a window that was open and her friend went inside but she didn't. I don't want to tell you the whole story, but you should get this book and read it. If you like mysteries you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Clue of the Black Keys : Nancy Drew Mystery Stories : Volume 28","review":"This was a gift to a Nancy Drew fan, and a fun find.

At first, I couldn't make head or tail of what was happening, but after buying this book all the meanings and symbolism came to me. I began to enjoy King Henry IV, and enjoyed it so much that I even went on to read The Merchant of Venice!This book provides the play script in Shakespearean english, but provides a running dictionary beside the text in order to provide the meanings of all those old words and phrases. At the end of each scene, a summary of the plot, its importance, and a general commentary is provided. The easy to read text is a bonus."},{"Title":"CliffsComplete King Henry IV (Pt.1)","review":"This Cliffs Complete product is not nearly as comprehensive a review and summary as the original Cliffs Notes book.

The material in this book was originally published by Kirkham in 1937, and revised and expanded several times since then (in 1960, for this edition).Here are some quotations from the book:\\"It will be conceded that historical evidence cannot be entirely complete. No one can know the things of God except by the spirit of God. The purpose of earth life would be destroyed if immortal persons lived among us as proof of immortality.\\" (Pg. 14)\\"As sure as Paul saw the master and heard His voice, so it was possible for the modern Prophet to see and hear Him. Its mere denial because it is beyond ordinary experience may some day appear as inconsistent as the denial of the radio and television a generation ago.\\" (Pg. 51-52)\\"During his long separation from the Prophet and the Church (Oliver Cowdery) was constantly urged to repudiate his published testimony in the Book of Mormon. This he never did.\\" (Pg. 74)\\"The (Hurlburt) affidavits were to prejudice the reader against Joseph Smith... (but) They give the same persons, the same facts, and the same dates as were later written by Joseph Smith. They did not anticipate that their declarations concerning the origin of the Book of Mormon would thus be important, corroborative evidence, of the declarations of Joseph Smith concerning its divine origin.\\" (Pg. 137)\\"...the evidence seems complete that Martin Harris took ancient characters to Prof. Anthon and others in New York City. What he was told confirmed his belief in the Prophet's statement. He thereafter did not hesitate to give his time and means to assist him in the translation of the record.\\" (Pg. 171)\\"Is the Book of Mormon exactly what it is purported to be? If so, then it is evidence of immortality, of the power of God among men and that Jesus is the Christ. If it is not, then the restored Church is like other religions, a plan for better living. It is worth only the good that comes from it.\\" (Pg. 189)\\"If (Sidney Rigdon) were the prime deceiver who had connived with Joseph Smith to lead honest though deluded followers... why did not Obediah Dogberry and Alexander Campbell who knew intimately the lives of Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon so well make the accusation at the time and at the place of the printing of the book?\\" (Pg. 310)\\"Throughout (Fawn Brodie's)No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, a careful reader finds many claimed inconsistencies regarding the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. First, the book gives practically no positive information from Latter-day Saint sources concerning the origin of the Book of Mormon. Second, the few excerpts selected from the history of the Church are not quoted fully and are interpreted to support the thesis which she has already agreed upon... Third... she does not give all the facts that the reader is entitled to possess to reach an honest conclusion... The author constantly puts into the mind of Joseph Smith the conclusions which are essential for the development of her thesis. She embellishes these ideas with the imagination of a novelist and conjures out of the gossip of the time incidents without any historical basis.\\" (Pg. 363-364)"},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"This book focuses on facing the winds of change and challenge in the commitment to fostering artistic creativity. I would have preferred a *Table of Contents* in the beginning of the book which I think would be beneficial to the reader. Cameron is self revelatory in the book, honest enough, shares some deep encouragement for drought and waiting times in the creative day to day process. It is obvious that this author practices what she preaches and is writing from the heart of her own experience.The middle section of the book between P. 97 and 195 had the most personal meaning for me. Cameron's assertions encourage blooming artists to adhere to practices of discipline and wade out the rough adversarial waters which inevitably rise during the day to day artistic awakening process.The chapter on \\"Remembering Who We Are\\" contains a profound essential truth. On p. 182, Cameron is right on the mark when she addresses the self-sabotaging cruel voice within each human life that completely erects blocks from within and without. She states, \\"Some of the finest painting gets done on the days when we just show up at the easel because that is our job. In other words, when we practice self acceptance of where we are and who we are instead of striving, always to be better. We are enough, exactly as we are.\\" From this essential truth, the artist is encouraged to take heart and not lose hope.Most of the writing activities at the end of each chapter are \\"keep in your hip pocket\\" types. You may wish to make photo copies of them and tuck them in the inside pocket of your journal to use later. I recommend just reading the book straight through. You'll have a pretty fair idea after reading the entire piece where you want to focus your time and energies. At that time, you can make copies of the *end of chapter activities* which seem most appropriate for where you are in your creative journey.On p. 213, she clearly has a handle on the essence of art, that it is a process of soul bearing and to engage this process \\"requires great humility.\\" Art weaving and art making is a quite vulnerable endeavor. When a project is finished it is subject to receptivity, rejection or both. Commitment to the process remains the goal for budding artists whether any project received or rejected. This is often a profound challenge each artist faces. Cameron offers examples of those who remained faithful to writing, to \\"art making\\" while day in and day out sifting through reams of very mediocre material before the \\"ah ha\\" creative wonder emerged. She offers sound guidance in how to keep one's commitment on steady grounding.The chapter on \\"Drama\\" I found rather humorous and insightful. Cameron absolutely nails the deadly effects of \\"letting the (...)\\" of drama get you down. I appreciated reading how absolutely distracting this is to living the life of an artist. The beauty of her solution is to create art straight at the energy flagging dramas that run through the mind. In meditation art we learn to detach from dramas and this is helpful. In the conscious life and in work, I find it important as well to watch becoming entangled in dramatic plays and ploys that occur in any relationship. Awareness of drama magnets assists in the wise practice of detachment and getting on with the art.There is fine wisdom in \\"The Sound of Paper\\" for journal work and delving more deeply to one's daily artistic endeavors."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"I make a point of telling anyone searching for their inner voice or a sense of self about Julia Cameron. Her work, The Artist's Way changed my life. I was diligent and worked through Ms. Cameron's twelve week program several times over from beginning to end. The book, the exercises, and Ms. Cameron's method worked for me.As I talk to people about that book there were two recurring themes among those who had also discovered her work. Either they, like me, found it immensely helpful, or they started in and quickly lost interest. The second group is much larger.There are varied reasons the second group gives, but at the top of their list is the required discipline to make your way through The Artist's Way. Ms. Cameron addresses this problem in The Sound of Paper.The Sound of Paper is different. The chapters are short and the method and process aren't at the fore. This time, Ms. Cameron writes short essays from a biographical focus telling stories of her life, her failures, her fears and her successes. These short essays are lyrical snapshots of an artist's life. At the end of each essay is an exercise. For those who've skimmed, scanned or experienced her previous book, you'll notice many of the same exercises come up again. There isn't that sense of urgency about the process. Instead, the exercises are gentler and have a random feeling in their placement.While I will always recommend The Artist's Way as the life changing book that it is, The Sound of Paper is another excellent experience for those interested in discovering their artist within and letting that artist out into the world. Having choices and options is always a good thing and Ms. Cameron has delivered us choice in her latest work."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"This is a book of essays on life and being a writer. There are interesting and helpful excercises at the end of each essay. Alot of the essays stem from her 'Artist Date' experiences, and her reflections and observations. She does write about the 'Morning Pages' that she has become so well known for. Besides the Artist Dates and Morning Pages, she also highly recommends taking a 20 minute walk everyday and an hour walk at least once a week.I have revisited this several times and, although I don't think it made a big difference for me with my writing, I do enjoy and benefit from many of the essays. Mostly according to what I'm going through at the time I read or reread this book.One thing is for sure. This woman knows about the pains of life, and writing. -And she knows how to keep on living in the most creative way she can. In many parts, I found myself consoled because I could tell that she wasn't merely speculating, you can feel that it comes from her heart.This is not just for writers, but any artists. Honestly, it didn't knock my socks off, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. Do we always need for a book to be out of this world to get something valuable from it? I don't think so. This woman has already made a huge contribution to the world with her \\"Artists Way.\\" She doesn't need to prove anything to anyone. I think it's great that she chooses to continue to share what she's learned and observed."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"I read this book one chapter a day to get me focused on my own writing and reading for my dissertation. This book brings my soul to where I am. Without this book, I don't know how to get rid of my other worries in life and concentrate on my study. So I strongly recommend this book to others who need some comfort concentrating on what they are doing."},{"Title":"The Sound of Paper: Starting from Scratch","review":"Julia Cameron is probably best known as the author of \\"The Artist's Way,\\" a course she developed to help others (as well as herself) get over writer's block, although she discovered that the plan worked for painters, sculptors, anyone whose job or life's passion requires creativity. In \\"The Sound of Paper,\\" Cameron has expanded this vision, offering more exercises and examples, as well as a more personal look at her own struggles as a writer.Cameron practices what she preaches: She is an accomplished author and playwright, and the book itself is testament to her talent. Her writing appears so effortless, mere musings. Try and copy that! It's no easy task. Even after I was long done reading the book, her descriptions of the New Mexico landscape have stayed with me, inspiring me to create a little of that magic. At the very least, it makes me long for a trip to the Southwest, again a testament to the power of words so carefully crafted.What Cameron demonstrates so effectively is that to be aware of your surroundings is to make your life your art, and that is the key to it all. Of course, another part of that equation is simply doing art, without the expectation of perfection. And that perfection is a tricky thing, a common trap for artists of all stripes. In the end, what \\"The Sound of Paper\\" conveys is much the same as \\"The Artist's Way.\\" However, this book moves one step closer to illustrating the lessons so clearly delineated in both books, and that is something fine indeed."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],G={key:0},W={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",P,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",G,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const R=u(M,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-4298e5d2"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/1.md","filePath":"library/1.md"}'),N={name:"library/1.md"},D=Object.assign(N,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{q as __pageData,D as default};
