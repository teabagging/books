Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I picked up this book in an attempt to balance my world view and give a fair chance to both sides. I had recently completed 'The O'Reilly Factor' and I believed that Mr. Hart would provide a compelling and insightful commentary to challenge my perceptions of Mr. O'Reilly. What I got was something quite different.As other reviewers have commented, Mr. Hart's &quot;analysis&quot; of Mr. O'Reilly leaves much to be desired. The book is filled with quotes from Mr. O'Reilly which are juxtaposed with other &quot;contradictory&quot; quotes with the intention of showing the true slant of Mr. O'Reilly's political views. The problem is that these supposedly contradictory quotes often (perhaps 50% of the time) have little or nothing to do with the previous statement and can presumably only be twisted that way if the reader already has a substantially different world view from Mr. O'Reilly. Mr. Hart doesn't even once take the time to explain the alleged contradiction for the readers that may not happen to agree with his politics. And in any event, any educated person can already see Mr. O'Reilly's conservative nature in his TV and radio shows and his written work.I can see what Mr. Hart wanted to do with this project, but in my opinion he has failed miserably. Either Mr. Hart lacks the competence to illustrate his point, or the evidence to support his conclusion eludes him. The overall impression I have is that Mr. Hart is extremely jealous of Mr. O'Reilly's popularity and has sought a vehicle to simultaneously raise his own profile and to disparage Mr. O'Reilly. Mr. Hart does considerably more damage to his own credibility with this lackluster effort."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Sensationalism sells. No two ways about this. Mr. Hart realized this, and cashed in on Bill O'Reilly's popularity.Apparently, those who hate O'Reilly have neither watched his show, nor read his books, for those paint a very different story than this book.If you want a manual on how to hate Bill O'Reilly, you've got the right book.If you actually want some substantiated arguments without sensationalism, look elsewhere.Only in the far-left's world would a pro-gun control, anti-death penalty, pro-choice, anti-&quot;corporate weasel&quot;, bipartisan basher be considered a &quot;far-right conservative.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

O'Reilly wasn't quoted as saying \\"more tax money per capita\\".More goofy reasoning by someone who ought to know better."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I was unfortunate enough to endure FAIR's &quot;The Way Things Aren't&quot;, a book of 100 of Rush Limbaugh's mistakes. The fact that ANY radio personality has made a mere 100 notable mistakes should be cause for celebration; most aren't that accurate. Most of these errors, in addition, are tiny mistakes, or mere areas where FAIR disagrees with the commentator.But I'm getting off topic. This new book latches onto a few errors of Bill O'Reilly. For instance, he confused two radio awards for a short period. These awards were about equivalent, but were latched onto by the media as evidence of a lying streak.If you want to read this kind of junk, go right ahead. FAIR.org stands with Al Franken, Ann Coulter, and others as vicious fact-omitting mudslingers with little room for pity."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"This is a fun book, thin, but amusing in its own way. Bill O'Reilly is someone that is easily hated by the left. He is popular, well-educated, well-exposed to the public and lets the clowns out there have it. Are most of the clowns liberal Democrats? Well, &quot;liberal Democrat&quot; and &quot;clown&quot; is a tautology, and so the answer would be 'yes', but deciding that Bill O'Reilly is in the same camp as Rush Limbaugh is off the mark, as he really doesn't seem to like either Anne Coulter Donald Rumsfeld or several other conservative marks. I would consider him to be strongly conservative, however much Bill denies this. The crux of the book is that conservative-bad, liberal-good and with that in mind, the sky is the limit here.Read it with expectations of hearing what Al Franken has to say, but expect less of it and fewer smiles along the way (but for roughly the same price)."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I recently heard Bill O'Reilly on Terry Gross's FRESH AIR on NPR, and his behavior convinced me that he is either mentally ill or calculatingly manipulative. I tend to the latter. O'Reilly suddenly pretended to be outraged at what he alleged was unfair, biased questioning, but it was interesting that he allowed the interview to go on for 50 minutes, knowing that he was scheduled for a 55 minute time slot. It was obvious that he planned from the outset to blow up and get outraged, in order to have fodder for his own show. That was my impression at the time of the show, but my conviction has been consolidated by this book.Bill O'Reilly depresses me, partly because who he is-a loutish, aggressive, rude, combative, uninformed bully-but partly about what he says about contemporary American politics. Several former high level Republican leaders-a former speaker of the house and a former senate majority leader(Bob Michel and Bob Dole)-have stated and lamented that a new aggressive, take-no-prisoners style began to emerge with the 1984 Congressional class, led by raucous, unpleasant individuals typified by Newt Gingrich. With Lee Atwater's leading the GOP, the Republicans took on a new hyper-aggressive, win-at-all-costs approach to politics. And with the emergence of pundits like Rush Limbaugh and billionaires like Richard Mellon Scaife funding hordes of ultra Right Wing organizations and projects, any semblance of gentility disappeared, with Right Wingers accusing Democrats of every conceivable crime, knowingly manufacturing untruths (such as multiple accusations against Dukakis in 1988), and then-during the Clinton years-unleashing an unrelenting deluge of absurd charges and innuendos. Bill O'Reilly is another piece of this Right wing strategy to slant and mold political thinking in America. O'Reilly's contribution is unique in that he pretends to being unbiased and independent, and by taking the outrageous step of calling his show the \\"No Spin Zone,\\" whereas it is \\"All Spin, All the Time.\\"I am tremendously upset that a book like this is needed. It hasn't been a good year for O'Reilly. First, he made a fool of himself at a table discussion featuring Molly Ivins (who managed to stay above the fray) and Al Franken (who I normally like, but who did, I'm afraid, did bait O'Reilly some, with tremendous success, and O'Reilly, who was unable to control the situation like he does on his show when he shouts people down, was made to look rather absurd). Then he attempted to engineer a lawsuit to prevent the publication of Franken's LIES AND THE LYING LIARS WHO TELL THEM, only to lose when the judge laughed the lawsuit out of court, all of which caused Franken's book to skyrocket to the top of the NY Times Bestseller List. He then made a fool of himself on the Terry Gross interview (though I'm sure his followers will not take the time to hear the entire interview, and will buy his own \\"spin\\" on what happened, which is a travesty of what actually occurred-anyone doubting me should go to www.npr.org, look up the Fresh Air link, and listen to the whole interview). Finally, Peter Hart brings out this book, which competently documents O'Reilly's tactics, ploys, and struggles with the truth.I don't enjoy books like this, though they are needed. The book does a more complete job than Franken or Joe Conason in his book BIG LIES of documenting O'Reilly's claims. I was already aware of the nature of his strategy, of attempting to portray himself as an independent, whereas he is, in fact, solidly to the Right (though not as far as Rush Limbaugh). Hart quotes Bishop John Spong (a writer I normally dislike enormously), who tells O'Reilly quite accurately on his show, \\"You're Rush Limbaugh with perfume.\\" It is helpful to have an extensive list of O'Reilly's factual errors. It become pretty obvious that O'Reilly in general just doesn't have a very good grasp of the facts, but tends instead, despite his claims to being a journalist, has the political grasp of a guy arguing politics in a barbershop. In fact, I became impressed with the overall resemblance of his style of \\"debating\\" with that of Ronald Reagan. Reagan's strategy was, when trying to prove a point, to spout statistics or \\"facts\\" that tended to bolster his position, statistics or facts that no one would be likely to be able to challenge on the spot, but which turned out to be untrue upon a reexamination. Basically, O'Reilly \\"spouts\\" pseudo facts to prove his point, but does not later correct himself on any of his errors. One thing that disturbs me about the Right these days is how comfortable many of its supporters are with factual inaccuracy. How can O'Reilly maintain such a large audience when he has such a weak grasp of the truth?At any rate, this book is valuable for calling O'Reilly to the carpet for his lamentable weaknesses as a journalist. But to me, these faults pale in comparison to his unpleasantness as a debater, his aggressiveness towards those he considers his enemies, and his rudeness."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"It was everything Franken's book should have been: thoroughly researched, smart, sly, and even with a subtle, edgy humor to it. I particularly like the structure of this book: first he presents a quote from O'Reilly, and then he amplifies on it. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.You won't come away from this book believing you are supposed to now hate Bill O'Reilly (which, by comparison, seems to be a theme in Franken's) but you'll likely become a more discerning viewer, taking broad statements and statistics with a greater degree of skepticism. The facts are there. To quote Fox, &quot;YOU decide.&quot; You can't get any more 'fair and balanced' than that!"},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I first heard of O'Reilly's show from my father-in-law who's one of the world's greater prudes. He showed me a few of O'Reilly's moralisms in one of the books the alleged unspinner markets. I read them then ignored them as I do most of what my father in law recommends.But to hear O'Reilly on the tube! What is it about loudmouth windbags that appeals to people? Because that's all O'Reilly is.To be honest, when I first saw this book advertised before it became available, I thought it would be thicker, a more &quot;scholarly&quot; documentary of what's wrong with O'Reilly. When I got it, I saw it wasn't that thick. It reminded me of some of those comedy manuals that made jokes of the inept rhetoric of Dan Quayle and George W. for example. So I opened it expecting to be disappointed. I wasn't.The author does a pretty good job of refuting just about everything O'Reilly says. Billy boy claims he's not a conservative. But he says nothing positive about anyone remotely connected with the Democratic party, and nothing negative about right wing Republicans, not matter how outrageous the statement or act.Yet O'Reilly still has the audacity to call his stands &quot;unspin,&quot; where that's all he does but spin, spin, and spin some more for anything he chooses to believe in, any stand he chooses to make.There's a lengthy section in which scores of O'Reilly's statements are listed, followed by an &quot;Oh, Really?&quot; in which the statement is always challenged, usually refuted.There's an entire chapter dedicated to the many times O'Reilly has contradicted himself. And the section on the person on O'Reilly's show who had a relative die on 9/11, yet was opposed to the war is a gem! What O'Reilly said after the microphone was off is something that clearly contradicts any of the little moral platitudes Billy is forever shooting off.By the way, what might be the antonym to &quot;pinhead?&quot; Because that's what the scholarly O'Reilly refers to anyone who might be audacious enough to disagree with him. And he, like a well-known and equally windy--and insubstantial--daytime radio &quot;conservative&quot;, who, in fact, may be O'Reilly's political mentor, has mastered the art of simply tuning out those who disagree with him. When someone disputes him with simple things like FACTS, O'Reilly dismisses them all with, &quot;Well, that's your opinion,&quot; and moves on.Al Franken does a more amusing job of refuting O'Reilly but if you know anyone, father in law or other, who pays attention to this loudmouth, you might want to give them this book to put the guy in perspective.Frankly, it's beyond me what appeals to anyone about the guy. I hope the people O'Reilly has on his show and whom he thinks he's defeating (because he has control over the show!) just refuse to appear with him any more. Then we'll be rid of O'Reilly's self praise (e.g., of awards he never received) and opinions based on nothing more than the fact that O'Reilly still has a breath."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Not being American myself, I was pointed towards Bill O'Reilly by a friend in a chatroom, who claimed him to be the saviour of all people with a free mind.Reading some of his columns, and checking out his website, though, made me feel different. The articles I read supported a heavy conservative point of view, and his whole site seemed to have but one purpose: &quot;Make me rich!&quot;. Member-secluded areas (access can be gained by whipping out the credit card), merchandise with his 'logo' on it, banners, etc. Hisvery articles seemed like nothing more than bantering from someone who is plainly biased, and afraid to admit it.While I am NOT someone to dismiss another point of view upfront, the turning point for me came after watching O'Reilly rip into a kid whose dad got killed at 9/11. When the kid tried (VERY Reasonably) arguing with O'Reilly, the latter responded by &quot;SHUT UP!&quot; eventually followed by &quot;CUT HIS MIKE!&quot;. (Which apparantly is a favourite tactic of him).After reading the summary to this book, I decided to buy it, just to see what the big scoop was really all about.I was expecting the author to clearly show the times O'Reilly contradicted himself, did a 180 on certain points of view, etc. Unfortunatly, that's not exactly the case. Rather, the author starts off by what is (in my opinion) a nitpicking sort of way to address shortcomings in O'Reilly's articles.While this makes an interesting read, that was not exactly what I was hoping for. I was hoping for the &quot;Bias, contradiction&quot; stuff that was promised.Thankfully, the chapter labeled &quot;O'Reilly Vs. O'Reilly&quot; does just that. The chapter plainly shows O'Reilly's opinions switch completely, depending on how he can gain some points against his adversaries:On Boycotting - He first claims Boycotting is &quot;Un-american&quot; (12/29/00). Yet, O'Reilly's very own website sports &quot;Do you want to boycott French products?&quot; on the mainpage.On killing civilians - O'Reilly initially claims bombing civilians is something no civilized society would do. Yet, he quickly changes his point of view, and suddenly doesn't mind Serbian civilians, nor does he feel pity for the German civilians who were bombed in WW2. And when asked who will suffer when his plan to wipe out the complete infrastructure of Afghanistan, he pretty much shrugs it off and says it doesn't really matter.The moment where he most plainly shows his conservatist point of view (even though he tries everything to debunk that by disagreeing with other little conservatist points of view) is when he starts whining about the 10 commandments being posted in a public place by the governor of Indiana. He feels he has every right to read those fine rules his society was built on, and that his rights are being violated.Yet, when a female muslim police officer wears a scarf under her hat, he feels that religion and state should be seperated.Add to that his constant backlashing towards the Clinton administration (Come on. They guy's been out of office for nearly three years now), while supporting blindly whatever decision Dubya makes (Although when he DOES disagree with little things that the administration does, he starts by disagreeing, and then turning it into yet another backlash at the Democrats, preferably the Clintons again), and I can't help but form a picture of a man will twist and turn his very own words just to fit his believes, while never looking back to see if he's arguing against his own statements.&quot;Judge Scheindlin has to go&quot; (6/6/02)&quot;Just want to have an investigation into this. I'm not saying remove her yet.&quot; (6/7/02)The book was highly enjoyable. I read it almost without a pause. I am left, however, with a slight feeling of dissappointment because of the (in my opinion) weak few first chapters. But since it was a humorous read, and the author ended up making sure O'Reilly's very own statements were proven to go against earlier arguments, I'll keep it at 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"In his confrontation with Al Franken on C-SPAN earlier this year, Bill O'Reilly tried to dismiss Franken by saying &quot;Is that all you've got?&quot;Peter Hart shows in great detail that there is no end to the distortions, contradictions, and outright lies emanating from the &quot;No Spin Zone.&quot; From O'Reilly's ridiculous claim, &quot;I'm not a conservative.&quot; (5/4/01)(p. 20), to his thuggish off camera comment to an anti-war guest whose father died in the World Trade Center (&quot;Get out, get out of my studio before I tear you to f***ing pieces!&quot; [2/06/03] [p.145]), Hart lays bare O'Reilly's brand of &quot;journalism.&quot;The point by point refutations of O'Reilly's misstatements are the heart of the book and can't be waved away. But for those who will continue to insist, &quot;Is that all you've got?&quot;, perhaps Mr. Hart can be persuaded to start compiling volume two!"},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"This book is like a scouting report for a baseball pitcher--in this case a righthander(read politically conservative) who claims to be ambidextrous (unbiased). It is not a penetrating study of Bill O'Reilly's inner psychology or motivation, and the author, Peter Hart says so. It simply tells viewers/batters what to expect each night when they face him.The late great lefty, Warren Spahn, said &quot;the art of hitting is timing; and the art of pitching is disrupting timing.&quot; That is the first thing that our scout, Peter Hart, tells his readers. O&quot;Reilly claims to be &quot;no spin;&quot; he is, in fact, &quot;all spin.&quot; When you face him you are going to get a lot of off speed junk, curves. He is not going to put any fastballs where you can hit them. He does not have much of an arm (read facts) to go all with his pitch (read spin). To beat you--and I am talking about &quot;the folks,&quot; his target audience of working people who vote conservative and against their own self interest--he has to make you believe him about being &quot;no spin.&quot; You must buy his deception. Hart adds, do not waste your time preparing to hit (read listen critically) a guy that throws with both hands. This guy never really has pitched with his left hand (read seriously espoused progressive positions). He just says he does to throw you off. He is just a righty (conservative) spinning tales.That is Bill O'Reilly in a nutshell. And though it might be fun, I promise not to belabor this metaphor anymore. As a teacher of speech, I know that one of the first rules of rhetoric or persuasion is for the speaker to ethically tell people where he stands. To say that he is no spin does a disservice to his audience; they are not hitters he is trying to trick; they are people he should be trying to help and illuminate.This handbook then is a manual on how he does not help and illuminate.The first thing Hart does is give O'Reilly's positions on a bevy of social, economic, and political issues. Each position is deeply conservative. On the few issues that he claims a liberalposition, Hart shows that his position is either weakly held or a dissemblance. So now the reader knows how to listen to O'Reilly. Now Hart tells us what to listen for.In a section called &quot;The O'Reilly Fact-Check,&quot; Hart offers &quot;at least&quot; 100 lies and distortions--mostly lies that O'Reilly has told, mostly on the &quot;Factor&quot; TV show. The section runs 66 pages pp.53-118. It is filled with statements O'Reilly has made on the show, then Hart provides an &quot;Oh Really&quot; response. O&quot;Reilly says &quot;dozens of police officers were injured&quot; by protestors in Sna Francisco and Chicago during anti-war demonstration in those cities; The Oh Really response: &quot;the facts&quot; are that only two officers were injured in Frisco and none in Chicago. O'Reilly claims that the US never supplied the Iraqis with chemical and biological weapons and that Donald Rumsfeld never meant with Hussein to close the deal. He tells a radio caller that is a &quot;crazy thing that goes out on the Internet...and you guys think its true.&quot; The Oh Really response is that the account came from Newsweek and quotes the particualrs at length. And on it goes--plenty of O'Reilly's lies to enjoy.Plus you must know that if O'Reilly wants 2+2=5, he will swing it so it does. His logic lacks internal consistency. He tells a high school student who supports Satanism in October 2002 that he &quot;has no freedom of speech once he walks in San Mateo High.&quot; In November 2001 he applaudes a young man expelled for hanging pro-war in his high school for defending his &quot;freedom of speech.&quot; He tells people who want to boycott Dr. Laura and Rush Limbaugh that boycotts are &quot;unAmerican.&quot; &quot;This is blatant censorship&quot;...&quot;You are against freedom of speech.&quot; He then turns around and calls for a boycott of Pepsi because the company hired the rapper Ludacris as a pitchman. He also calls for boycotts of France and many of those pesky countries who would not support our invasion of Iraq.Like the lies, the inconsistencies go on and on. What's really good about this scouting report is that it teaches you how to face O'Reilly in the future. Since Hart's report came out a few months ago, O&quot;Reilly has further dissembled. He defended Mel Gibson's forthcoming movie &quot;The Passion&quot; which depicts the Cruxifiction of Christ from charges of Anti-Semetism. He urges free expression and letting &quot;the folks&quot; make up their own minds. Then a TV movie about Ronald Reagan is scheduled to air this fall, and he tells CBS to pull it because &quot;the folks&quot; might take out their anger on the network. He abused Jeremy Glick brutally on his TV show; and he cries foul when Terry Gross asks him a few tough questions on NPR's &quot;Fresh Air.&quot;And he continues to lie. Remember the fiasco with Al Franken over the alleged two Peabody Awards he won while hosting Inside Edition. The book covers the incident before it became a major media bruhaha. O'Reilly got caught lying about something that could be easily checked and then compounded the situation by lying about the lie. Well, he has done it again. He claims his latest book &quot;Who's Looking Out for You&quot; is vying for number one nonfiction book of the year in sales with Hillary Clinton's book &quot;Living History.&quot; Bookscan, USA Today and Neilssen all list it lagging badly behind both Hillary's book, and (this has to hurt big time) Al Franken's &quot;Lies and the Lying Liars.&quot; Bookscan has Hillary's book at 1.1 million; Franken's at 674 thousand; and OReilly's at 430 thousand. Yet he continually insists otherwise. And if Hart's scouting report is a good indicator, he will continue to do so."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"If the endless stream of inaccuracies, distortions, and self-contradictory statements aren't enough to wreck O'Reilly's credibility, I don't know what is.The picture painted here is one of a man who is beyond paranoid and convinced that anyone attempting to correct his inaccuracies is a threat that must be eliminated. He rarely corrects his distortions and inaccuracies, and when he does it's in a very combatative, I'm-still-right-despite-pulling-my-\\"facts\\"-out-of-the-air attitude.Bill O'Reilly probably believes all the myths he's concocted about himself. If he doesn't, it would be very difficult to explain why he is so defensive about them. For instance, despite claiming that he was not a member of any political party, he had been a registered Republican until 2000. When he was informed of this, he said, \\"There was no box for an independent. I left all the boxes empty. Somehow, I was assigned Republican status.\\" Then, when confronted with a copy of his actual form, which clearly shows that there was a box labelled \\"I do not wish to enroll in a political party\\" and a nice, big check next to \\"Republican,\\" he said that there must have been some mistake and that perhaps he was filling out the form too fast or something.With O'Reilly, you have to ask just how much disregard for the truth someone who fancies himself as a journalist can have before you can call him a liar."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Is Peter Hart, the author of &quot;The Oh Really? Factor&quot;, pursuing a fool's errand? As he so amply documents, anyone who has watched much of Bill O'Reilly's work has already heard him bullying guests, suppressing opposing viewpoints, and engaging in blatant self-contradiction often enough to raise suspicions that all is not well in O'Reilly land. Viewers who, in the face of this evidence, go on believing that O'Reilly presides over a &quot;no-spin zone&quot; may have already demonstrated their imperviousness to the kind of debunking undertaken in this book.On the other hand, casual viewers (as opposed to die-hard fans) may still be reachable, and if they are, &quot;The Oh Really? Factor&quot; is just the tool to do it. O'Reilly's misstatements and self-contradictions are legion, and his bias incontrovertible. And though anyone can make mistakes, Bill O'Reilly is often not just wrong, but flamboyantly, defiantly wrong. He speaks with the utmost assurance about things that he evidently knows nothing about. He pulls statistics out of thin air and then defends them doggedly. Sometimes, when challenged, he goes on the offensive: &quot;You're either lying or can't read&quot;; &quot;You are basically calling every District Attorney in New York a liar&quot;.A couple of the vignettes in this book are priceless, such as the exchange in which New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman tries, repeatedly and without success, to explain to O'Reilly why some legislation he's filed doesn't contain a provision O'Reilly really, really wants it to contain: it doesn't have to be there, since it's already &quot;the law of the land.&quot; O'Reilly simply refuses to listen. In interview with a representative of Qatar TV, O'Reilly admits to never having seen its broadcasts, then insists that though Qatar TV is &quot;reporting the facts straight now&quot;, there's &quot;no way&quot;, despite his guest's protestations, that this has always been true.Are there, as the one-star reviewers claim, cases of purported O'Reilly mistakes that may actually be matters of interpretation? Yes, but not many of them. And, in particular, not the only one that's been cited. This is the question of the size of U.S. foreign aid spending relative to that of the EU countries. Reviewers who haven't really read the book, but are just relying on the publisher's blurb, may be forgiven for thinking that Hart and O'Reilly are just dueling with statistics, with Hart preferring the per capita figure and O'Reilly the total dollar amount. In fact the figures for U.S. and European per capita foreign aid were cited by a guest, Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies, and O'Reilly responded by saying, &quot;That's not true.&quot; Note: O'Reilly was not arguing that the total dollar figure was a better measure of U.S. giving than the per capita number, but rather that Bennis was wrong when she claimed that U.S. per capita foreign aid was lower than that of any country in the European Union. And she wasn't.(That these critics don't deserve to be taken seriously is demonstrated not only by their misunderstanding of this episode but also by their contention that &quot;of course the per capita number is small, because the U.S. is such a large country.&quot; To the contrary, per capita figures are calculated specifically because they are useful in comparing populations of different sizes. Besides, it is odd to suggest that being a large country would drive down our per capita foreign aid drastically when it seems to have no corresponding effect on, say, our per capita GDP (second in the world) or CO2 emissions (third).)If you have friends or family who are in danger of falling under O'Reilly's spell, or if you're entertaining doubts yourself and want to know more, this is the book to have. If, on the other hand, you're a confirmed O'Reillyite, at least please read the book before you bash it."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

That's sexy in a way we were never told about.\\" Um, well that's actually quite icky and NOT a good example.But how about this: \\"I think you have to drug test everybody on welfare.\\" On the 2000 Florida recount: \\"The process is being abused and manipulated by people who will not accept the verdict in the state of Florida as it was put forth by machines.\\" On homosexuals in America: \\"That's my advice to all homosexuals, whether they're in the Boy Scouts, or in the Army, or in high schools: Shut up, don't tell anybody what you do, your life will be a lot easier.\\"Here's a long quote, but I fell off my chair laughing, as O'Reilly was actually trying to say something positive: \\"Now, the greatest misconception, in my opinion, that black people have about whites is that some whites don't like them because of the color of their skin. I don't know anybody who thinks that way, because somebody's black or somebody's red or somebody's brown, I immediately don't like them.....I'll tell you what they don't like. I'll tell you what whites-and I'm taking this from my grandmother....My grandmother didn't like black people because she was afraid of them.....All my grandmother saw were young black males on television getting arrested, right, she-when she rode the bus.....in New York, she saw some black people being rowdy or whatever....She was afraid. And because she was afraid, she didn't like them. So it's not the color of the skin that my grandmother didn't like, it was \\"I'm afraid\\"....It had nothing to do with skin color.\\" Hot darn....that is simply otherworldy funny.There is a chapter on how this guy bungles his facts. Not quite as funny, but still amusing: \\"Thirty-seven percent of Americans pay no federal income tax at all because of the Earned Income Tax Credit.\\" 37% of 300m would be 111m. 111m take the EIC? Um....no. He's a little off: the 37% is the % of Americans who pay no tax, which includes a large number of non-filers, like Tony Soprano, and only 1/2 of filers who owe 0 tax get the EIC. The exact number is a minute % of total Americans.\\"More than one hundred thousand abductions of children by strangers every year in the U.S. So that's not that rare....I mean, if you, if you-there's 365 days in a year, more than a hundred thousand, OK? So we're talking thirty a day? I mean, that's a big number.\\" 100,000? Are you freakin' kidding me? According to the Justice Dept., the number is actually around 100. In an attempt to correct himself, O'Reilly later claimed that \\"approximately 725,000 are reported missing each year, and many of those cases are not solved.\\" 725,000? What is he on? That's more casualties than the U.S. suffered in all the wars since WWII.I'll end my little review with this one: \\"I've done this program for four and a half years, and I have never attacked anybody personally on this program ever.\\" (3/13/01). Whew, made it to the end without ever mentioning the word \\"falafel\\"....damn, no I didn't!"},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

He lies so much that its hard to tell if what he is &quot;reporting&quot; is truth or lies. He lies so much even he can't keep up with them. O'Reilly is a classic case of hating in others what he doesn't like in himself. Thus the accusations of &quot;liar&quot; flow freely from him. The man needs psychological help."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Of the many things that irks me about O'Reilly is the way he keeps describing himself as a serious journalist. If this bizarre claim hadn't already self-refuted itself, this book helps. Watching O'Reilly on TV is an enormously frustrating experience. I think you respond to him like you would a cheerleader. If he pulls for your side, you like him; if he pulls for the opposition, you find him insufferable. I was always irritated because when I heard him I heard no content. This book validates that impression."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

If someone is critical of Limbaugh, Hannity, or Billy Boy, they must be a &quot;Liberal.&quot; As if that alone refutes all arguments.Should liberals dismiss all of the crap written over the years about Bill Clinton simply because his attackers are &quot;Neo-cons?&quot; Or to put it mildly, right wing whackos?FAIR, the publishers of this book, bash politicians on both sides of the isle. As we speak there is a critical article from FIAR on their web site about Wesley Clark.

Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"A timely book, well worth your time no matter where you are on the political spectrum.All I really needed to discern about Bill O's true colors I heard in a exchange on his radio show. Bill O was going nuts, telling his listeners to write, email, phone a well known book retailer in the hopes of them taking some rapper's records off the shelf. Decent enough point as the rapper was overly violent and misogynist. But Bill O lost all intellectual leverage in his point when an intelligent caller said '...uh, Bill if you feel so strongly about this, why don't you tell that same retailer to quit selling your book on their site - after all do you want to be associated with such a company?\\". O' Reilly went nuts and sanpped back : \\" THATS DIFFERENT AND YOU KNOW IT IS\\". End of dialogue, next caller. I'm right and you, Mr. Public, are an idiot.Its really worn thin from Bill O and all the talk radio self proclaimed experts on everything. Objectively criticze them and they go nuts screaming about liberal media elite blah, blah, blah.I'm no liberal and I'm sure no elite but I've come to the conclusion this act got tired long ago. The subject book by Hart is clearly a step in the right direction."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"I would just like to point out the author's own &quot;spin&quot; in the Book Description. First, he lambastes O'Reilly for saying that the US &quot;gives far and away more tax money to foreign countries than anyone else&quot; and counters with a seemingly disparate statistic that states the US is near the bottom of the list for developed countries when measured per capita. Has Hart considered that both statistics may be true, since O'Reilly was most likely speaking of total dollars, which is what really matters / counts, than average dollars? The reason the average is so low is that the US is a really big country with lots of people. Second, I cannot comment to the veracity of the quotes regarding Libya but there is a trick with language that Hart has employed here that I find to be especially &quot;inflammatory.&quot; He links up the Libya quote with another quote from O'Reilly regarding something completely different. &quot;If you're not providing controversy and excitement, people won't listen or watch,&quot; is O'Reilly's commentary on the state of the media, of which he is a part, but has nothing to do with the Libya comment. Therefore, if one is not paying attention to the text, one might make the accidential conclusion that O'Reilly makes sensational comments so people will watch and listen, which incidentially is not true. I cannot believe that such a piece of tripe would come from an organization that would call itself &quot;FAIR&quot;."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Folks, I will be graduating in a month with a degree in journalism. It was by watching Bill O'Reilly that I became inspired to become a journalist. There is so much liberal bias in the media and liberals feel threatened by people like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity that want to unspin it. Liberals who claim to be all for diversity are the most intolerant people of all: they accept the free speech of anybody (as long as they say what the liberals want them to say). If they deviat from the liberal rhetoric in anyway, the liberals use their common tactic.They smear the image of the reporter and call him a liar. This book is a perfect example of that, the author simply cannot stand the fact that a conservative reporter is on the television. Mr. Hart is porbably more angry at the fact that Bill is so popular. When he makes a brief passing mention of how popular O'Reilly is he states that this book is not intent on explaining his popularity. Nice try, Mr. Hart, but you can't weasel your way out of it so fast. Let me explain why Bill and Fox News in general is so much more popualr than any other news station. They are the only ones that show things from a different perspective!! Did that ever occur to you? Tey state facts that other left-wing stations conveniently forget to mention. As for Bill being bias, well, I can't deny that he is. But a journalist is not always one who states facts without prejudice there are many type of reporters, and news analysts (unlike straight forward eporters) have the job of giving opinion to the news. If Mr. Hart were really fair and honored the title of his organization, e would also make a book about the bias of Michael Moore, AL Franken, and any other news channel. There is a lot more ammunition there."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Bill O'Reilly has to be the best journalist ever to be seen on television. This book with it's stupid &quot;Bill O Reilly Looks So Stupid&quot; cover should be burned on fire. The authors are obviously liberals so you know what THAT means...spin!"},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"This book serves up poetic justice to Bill O'Reilly. Mr. Hart calmly and usually persuasively shows how often Mr. O'Reilly puts the shuck on his viewers, listeners, or readers. By the end of the book one must conclude that, if Mr. O'Reilly had a guest on &quot;The Factor&quot; who equivocated, prevaricated, or obfuscated as much and as often as Mr. O'Reilly does, the host would throw one of his tantrums.On the other hand, Mr. O'Reilly broadcasts so much and writes so much that finding his mistakes is not very challenging and not revealing. What is revealing are Mr. O'Reilly's attempts to escape from his own errors, inconsistencies, and hypocrisies. O'Reilly wants to play the Tribune of the American People each night, but he also wants to be smarter than the average guy. As a result, Mr. O'Reilly too often agrees with positions that ordinary folk who have not thought matters through accept but invents novel reasons or factoids to bolster those popular positions. And, like any pundit, Mr. O'Reilly knows so much that is not true.An advantage to Mr. Hart's compendium is that the author does not feel compelled to call O'Reilly a liar. Mr. Hart does better than Mr. Franken (although Mr. Franken is funnier) because he does not call every misstep or misinterpretation a lie. I have seldom caught Mr. O'Reilly in a flat-out lie, and I watch him regularly and listen to his &quot;Radio Factor.&quot; Mr. O'Reilly instead looses blather and bombast on his listeners and viewers. That is, he is frequently dead wrong but almost always quite sincere.The author does a bit too little analysis, or else I'd give the volume five stars. I would like to have seen more attention to the rhetorical techniques and logic-chopping in which Mr. O'Reilly engages. Mr. Hart could do many readers and viewers a service by showing how a little knowledge of a few fallacies or intellectual bad habits would explain Mr. O'Reilly's antics.I thought that Mr. Hart might have devoted more space to Mr. O'Reilly's hypocrisy as well. When he is bullying a guest or shouting over a speaker, Mr. O'Reilly reeks of the incivility and ill-breeding that he piously laments. He rails about the excesses of Teddy Kennedy or others (and rightly so!) and how they are spoiling American politics. Then he behaves boorishly and intimidates those who come on his show. He profits from his perch on Fox News while ignoring much of the shock journalism and shlock that passes for content on Fox and other cable channels.Mostly, however, this book is terrific at showing how often Bill O'Reilly is talking through his hat. Mr. O'Reilly is often the populist whom he plays on TV. He has the vices of his virtues. He wants viewers and listeners to believe that he knows much more than he knows (and occasionally much more than anyone could know)-- just like the loudmouth two barstools down. He clings to whatever he has long believed despite all evidence to the contrary -- just like ordinary true believers do. He denounces ideas new to him as ideological nonsense -- which saves him from admitting how mindlessly conservative he all too often is and how far he is from those conservatives who inspire admiration and belief for their learning and wisdom.Taking the spin and the skin off O'Reilly is a public service!"},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"Peter Hart has done the people a great service. He has exposed the spin in O'Reilly. I have noticed that conservatives on the various talk shows interrupt and won't let their guests or callers talk, they interrupt them, are rude, distract the listeners, etc. O'Reilly did it on C-span when a caller phoned and was talking instead of letting the caller make his point and then rebutting it, he stopped the caller from finishing his point and brushed him off. I have seen this happen with Rush Limbaugh, O'Reilly, Tucker, Russiff and others and usually the person they are rude to has much better manners, lets them make their point and then will get lamblasted when he or she tries to make her point. They don't have the winning argument so they try to stop their opponent from voicing his. Anyway, Hart, shows O'Reilly for the conservatively biased person that he is over and over. I have listened to O'Reilly and his counterparts for so long (after 8+ years of Clinton bashing) and found the facts just weren't adding up, so I went and did a little research myself. I found the Clintons were pretty good people and when I looked at the Bush family background found a horror story. So what I hear from O'Reilly I take with a grain of salt and listen to what his spin is and then discern what he really means. Hart has done a great service in showing up O'Reilly's spin for what it is. Hopefully, more people will not be as gullible to what they hear on the news as they have been. Don't believe everything you hear, it just may be a spin."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

Most of all, I like this little book because it is handy and portable for those moments that you feel like winning an argument with someone who thinks the media is way too liberal and that Bill O'Reilly is a legitimate, serious journalist. It is written like an index card for quick leafing thru. Just facts after facts and words after words directly quoted from Bill O'Reilly's own orifice. This book wrote itself. So, In Honour of Mr. O'Reilly, these Bumper Stickers were created:-A mind is like a Parachute, It only works when you open it.-Wished closed minds came with Closed Mouths.-evildoerO'Reilly would be more interesting if he was at least well-read, scholarly and admit the truth about himself. Why can't he just say, &quot;I am trying to steal the lead cheerleader position from Rush for the Republican Right, and yes, I grew up upper-middle and Darn it, I am proud.&quot; I am sure a lot of his main audience can relate to this. You know the ones who blame the bleading heart liberals for their own miserable lives.If you already own or read a few Franken, Moore or Hightower, this booklet will add to your amusement, if not you will read this book in disbelief, shake your head and then it will dawn on you &quot;This is what's wrong with America.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

I've sent it to my sister in hope of helping her see the truth."},{"Title":"The Oh Really? Factor: Unspinning Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly","review":"FAIR quotes O'Reilly's citation of a Heritage Foundation study which claimed to show that the average poor family receives $40,000 a year in government subsidies. They note that this study from that great intellectual organization calculated into their $40,000 figure, government programs like Medicare, Pell Grants and reduced school lunches which go to non-poor families. In a show shortly after, O'Reilly would further go off from reality, changing the statistic from $40,000 per family to $40,000 \\"per person.\\"O'Reilly claimed in 1999 that the average American was paying twice as much taxes as back in 1985, but his figures cited from the Census Bureau did not include adjustments for inflation which the Bureau provided in a nearby table that O'Reilly ignored. The latter figure made the average figures 1985 at $7,335 and 10,388 in 2001. Of course, incomes, at least of the rich, went up during that time, so taxes inevitably did too. Average incomes figures are skewed upwards because of inclusion of incomes of the rich minority. The average tax payments of the middle fifth of income earners have been relatively stable since 1977, according to Congressional Budget office numbers.O'reilly claimed that according to the Federal Government 58 percent-then a little later, he lowered it to 52%-of single mother homes are on welfare. He was later forced to admit that the figure was actually about 14 percent, but claimed it should be about 33 percent when single mother food stamp recipients, which should be considered welfare according to him, would be computed into the stat.During one show, O'Reilly stated that according to a study at Columbia University, 20 percent of welfare recipients were using drugs, 15 percent according estimates of the U.S. dept. of Health and Human Services. Some shows later he was saying that every study, including Columbia's, showed that \\"anywhere from 30 to 50 percent\\" of welfare recipients were on drugs.O'Reilly denounced a black Florida state representative for attacking Jeb Bush on the ground that the latter's policies had resulted in blacks being 37 percent of students at Florida's colleges. FAIR quotes the Jacksonville Sun Times that the 37 percent figure actually accounted for all minorities at Florida colleges.O'Reilly complained that concern over the tens of millions who lack health insurance was nonsense because he claimed one could receive free care in any emergency room. FAIR quotes an analyses by David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler of a 1987 National Health Expenditure Survey which found that that year, when the number of people w/o health insurance was smaller, that 945,000 were unable to receive care in emergency rooms that year, two thirds of those 945,000 citing high costs of the care or lack of insurance.O'reilly predictably enjoys bashing the wicked and cowardly French whom he said opposed the Kosovo war but Clinton ignored their objections, \\"to his credit.\\" Of course, FAIR notes, the French actually supported that war and provided the NATO alliance's second largest air force.O'Reilly announced on one show that he had a dossier detailing how Al Jazeera didn't report Saddam's slaughter of Kurds in the 80's or in 1991.. His guest pointed out to him that Al Jazeera didn't exist until 1996. Regarding O'Reilly's denial that Rumsfeld's visit to Iraq in 1983, set the stage for U.S. support of Saddam, including giving him materials to make WMD, FAIR quotes a Newsweek article detailing that U.S. support for SaddamO'Reilly declared that he had never heard at any time whatsoever a pro-life, a skeptic on global warming or any conservative generally on NPR. FAIR points out that David Brooks and Joe Laconte of the Heritage foundation are regular commentators both by themselves and interviewed as sources for news stories. Global warming skeptic Myron Ebell was on NPR three times in 2001 and an official of National Right to Life Committee was used as a source eleven times on NPR's national broadcasts' news stories in 2001.On one show O'reilly claimed that Judith Levine's book on children and sexuality contained a phrase that declared adults should \\"relish\\" sexual attractions towards children. One of his guests on that show investigated and found that phrase in the book but it was actually Levine quoting someone else to the effect that adults \\"relish\\" sexual attraction towards children as demonstrated by child beauty pageants like those Jon Benet Ramsey was in, but are horrified by the sexualization of those pageants at the same time.He claimed on his February 24th, 1999 show that the Los Angeles Times had never mentioned anything about Juanita Broaderick. FAIR points out that the Times had actually run a short story about her four days earlier, though they couldn't do much in depth about her until the NBC interview with her about Clinton's alleged rape ran a few days later. In a 2001 interview in \\"Mediaweek\\" O'reilly was again claiming that the LA Times, \\"never mentioned Juantia Broaderick's name, ever.\\" Up to the latter point, a seach of the archives of the Times yielded 21 citations of Broaderick.O'Reilly makes many amusing claims such as that the Nixon-Kissinger bombing of Cambodia was only confined to the Ho Chi Minh trail, that the War Powers Act of 1973 gives the president the power to seize illegal immigrants and deport them, that drug users merely posessing drugs are not thrown in prison, that the Constitution doesn't say anything about treason. He claimed that the Ecstasy trade is run out of Holland by Arab Muslim terrorists , then read a government report to back himself up which stated in contrast that Israeli Mafioso run the ecstasy trade in Holland in conjunction with Russian and Georgian (the Central Asian republic)dealers out of Holland and that the Slav gangsters merely have \\"Middle Eastern ties.\\"O'reilly said that putting U.S. troops to guard the Mexican border would save lives \\"because Mexican wetbacks, whatever you want to call them, the coyotes,\\" aren't going to die anymore trying to get into this country. According to a journalist of an Allentown Pennsylvania paper he also at a particular speech denounced the INS for not keeping out \\"the wetbacks.\\" Regarding Chicano immigrants, FAIR notes, during one interview he let Dan Stein of the Center for Immigration Reform talk about the Ford Foundation's funding of pro-immigration groups but did not mention that Stein's group receives money from the Pioneer Fund which advocates eugenics."},{"Title":"The Oh Really?

The goal is to help everyone master 3 skills given in the subtitle: how to learn faster, make good decisions and think creatively.

Here they are, I have saved my treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.\\"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is a wonderful quick read about a man (family) over coming adversities in life, yet continuing to hold on to and cherish what is important in life. Dr. Primrose never becomes jaded after all that is thrown at him. Just when you think he can take no more, more is piled onto him. In the end, of course, all is well. While I wouldn't call the book exciting itself, there are exciting elements...kidnappings, death, cheating, and more. I enjoyed it so much because Dr. Primrose is truly a stand up guy and one we can all learn lessons from."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"I have, in a way, two completely separate reviews for this novel, with two completely different rankings. As a serious novel it gets one star; as a comic novel it gets four. I have gone with the four-star ranking because I have very little doubt of which it is.If this book was in fact written as a serious panegyric upon the glories and virtues of the simple, holy life, and the blessings that come to those who persevere in the face of adversity, it is the most consummate tripe. The characters are caricatures, the emotions farcical, the plot lines banal. Primrose (the narrator) is a fool, and a particularly pretentious and self-righteous one. The women in the novel should make any self-respecting woman cringe. The tireless soliloquies on economics, politics and religion make you unwittingly begin to skim. I will take Wittgenstein's advice and just pass over the ending in silence. Think Danielle Steele in a more obscure vernacular, but worse. (Yes, that's right, worse.)Thankfully, it's not serious (or, at least, I am almost certain that it isn't). As a comic novel it comes off kind of like a Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker movie about a Jane Austen novel. The beauty of it is, however, is that it's so deadpan, it's so subtle in its irony, that for the first eighty pages I really thought it was sincere - albeit terrible. I won't go into the plot details as most of you probably don't want someone to spoil the plot for you, and the rest can easily find it succinctly traced out by my fellow reviewers. I will say that it's a Book-of-Job-style parable, and one of the most complete and believable satires I've ever read.(I will add, just to give my review some perspective, that I love 18th century British literature, Fielding and Sterne in particular. In other words, my opinion has not been overtly colored by an ignorance of either the genre or the writing styles of the period. At least, I hope not.)"},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"A delightful tale of the calamities that beset an 18th century English vicar.

And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations.This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...&quot;hate&quot; is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead.

Just lay off the Goldsmith."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's 1766 novel, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot; offers the trials and tribulations of Primrose, an ecclesiastic living in the English countryside. Primrose is content in his life, with a faithful wife, and lovely, if somewhat distracted children. Hearing that his banker has gotten into trouble and fled the country, Primrose and his family begin a series of adventures which test the strength of Primrose's convictions.Among the issues which Goldsmith addresses in the novel are social ambition in a rigid class system, the drawbacks and benefits of a relatively liberal household, and the admittedly imperfect nature of the British legal system. Sprinkled throughout the novel are various discourses on the notion of liberty, the primacy of the monarchy, and a wealth of interesting references to British imperialism and colonial slavery.Regarding the class system, Primrose seems throughout the novel, to eschew the idea that social or economic mobility is possible, or even desirable. He posits, in a way that follows Aristotle and Edmund Burke, that people are fit for certain stations by their very nature; and that such social partitioning is right and should be maintained. Primrose also appears as a latter day Horace, championing the virtues of simple, rustic life. This pastoral life is directly associated in the novel with the laboring classes, who, not without faults themselves, manage to avoid the intrigues and excesses of the consistently vilified city folk.Goldsmith's writing style is fast-paced, with clear, direct language, wonderfully rendered characters, and a surprising number of plot twists for so short a work. Primrose and his eldest son George are the two finest characters in the novel. Both exhibit a picaresque tendency to wander and interact - Primrose with the intellectual/philosophical elements, and George with the material/experiential elements in the world. This is altogether a wonderful, spirited novel, and Stephen Coote's introduction to this Penguin edition is excellent in its explication of the novel's major themes and concerns."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"\\"Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to accuse.\\" So ends chapter 13 in this delightful novel by Oliver Goldsmith, his only novel by the way.Oliver creates a pious character in the form of the vicar, Dr Primrose, that suffers from that most deadly of the 7 deadly sins, Pride. The problem is he doesn't know it. As a result he is brought down peg by peg, and made a thorough fool of in the process, in a way that is comical and warm to the reader. The vicar becomes a most beloved character by way of his suffering and in the end I'm sure will have earned from even the most hard hearted reader that most cherished gift a reader can bestow upon any flawed character, redemption.Oliver also creates villiany, more like evil incarnate, in the form of Mr. Thornhill. Thornhill is central to the most severe of the hardships suffered by the vicar and his family. A very meddlesome and self-centered character indeed!!Written in the 1750's, it has it all. Greed,envy,lust,unjust imprisonment, even prostitution. Yes, It's hard to believe a novel written in the 1750's could even touch on the subject, but nevertheless it is central to the plot.Combine all this with some of the finest wit in English literature and you've got a great way to spend a weekend. The book is less than 200 pages and moves along at nice pace from page one. Well worth everyone's time."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"I agree with the reviewers who've described this as a slow read. No argument there. But it's also a very important 18th Century work and one essential to anyone interested in the literature of the period. If you read the book with an ironical slant it's much easier to see that there is actual humor in the often improbable situations. Granted, it may not be laugh out loud humor, but it is there. The poor vicar is modeled on the biblical Job, to a very exaggerated extent. It's so exaggerated that the modern reader will likely be rolling his eyes, I know. If you're looking for tight plot and fast pace this won't be your book, but those reading 18th Century literature will realize the novel was much different at the beginning that it is now. You don't read THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD for the plot. You read it for the study.

In fine, a book to be read over &amp; over without a dimunition of pleasure at each reading."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Told with a great deal of tongue-in-cheek humor and wit, The Vicar of Wakefield, published in 1766, features the delightfully innocent Dr. Primrose, a cleric who believes that kindness and virtue will always be rewarded. Surrounded by his wife and six children, Dr. Primrose lives a comfortable life, but he becomes the victim of theft when his broker runs off with all his investments, leaving him penniless, just as his son George is about to be married. When George's marriage is canceled due to his lack of prospects, the family moves to the country, where Dr. Primrose becomes vicar of a rural church.One disaster follows another, involving Dr. Primrose and his family. The poor but kind Mr. Burchell, who saved daughter Sophia from drowning and befriended the family, later shocks Dr. Primrose by slandering the daughters and ruining their chances to become companions to two women in London. The sale of the family's only horses to a trickster leaves them virtually penniless. His older daughter Olivia is abducted and \\"ruined.\\" The house catches fire, and their landlord demands his rent, knowing that the family has nothing. No matter how outrageous the calamities (and those mentioned above are only a sample), Dr. Primrose insists on seeing the bright side, even when there is no bright side. Virtue and goodness, he is convinced, will always be rewarded.Owing as much to eighteenth century satiric comedy as to the developing novel, the story of Dr. Primrose and his family satirizes the sentimentality of early novels, such as Pamela, while it makes use of sentimental devices to further its plot. Poking gentle fun at Dr. Primrose for his innocence, Goldsmith never mocks or belittles him. Coincidence, mistaken identities, the humiliation of all the villains, innumerable surprises, and the restoration of Dr. Primrose's fortunes lead to the \\"deserved\\" happiness of Dr. Primrose and his family in the conclusion. Virtue is indeed rewarded, and evil is indeed punished. A gentle novel filled with charm, The Vicar of Wakefield feels like a \\"lady's novel,\\" one which lacks the bawdy excess of Fielding and the unique humor of Sterne, while never taking itself too seriously. n Mary WhippleShe Stoops to Conquer and Other Comedies (Oxford World's Classics)Oliver Goldsmith; a biography.

He was always misunderstood, as geniuses often are. This book has assured Goldsmith a place high up in the literature food chain.

It is a story about the family Primrose and its fall from it's a place of comfort and security. The family consists of a mother and father and six children.

It is funny and at times very witty. Even though the language is a bit old fashioned, the book is still fun to read."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Regarded by some as a sentimental novel, Oliver Goldsmith's \\"The Vicar of Wakefield\\" (1766) describes the fortunes and misfortunes of the first-person narrator, Dr. Primrose, along with his wife and six children. The narrative is chiefly concerned with a description of Primrose's increasing adversity and the final restoration and elevation of his condition, in a story-line reminiscent of the Biblical book of Job. First the Primrose family loses their fortune, their home is engulfed by a fire, and eventually Primrose himself finds himself in prison, one daughter reportedly dead, another abducted, and a son jailed. But all is in the end restored as the narrative returns to the idyllic life of the Primrose home and its inhabitants as described at the end of the first chapter: \\"In short, a family likeness prevailed through all, and properly speaking, they had but one character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and inoffensive.\\" The circle is completed with the closing words of the final chapter: \\"As soon as dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my family assembled once more by a cheerful fireside. My two little ones sat upon each knee, the rest of the company by their partners. I had nothing now on this side of the grave to wish for, all my cares were over, my pleasure was unspeakable. It now only remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former submission in adversity.\\" Although Primrose is a vicar, his congregational and pastoral charge rarely comes into the picture, and it is more the events in this family circle that are the focus of his story.In the face of more than abundant adversity, Primrose remains the eternal optimist, a sweet and nave vicar who portrays himself unaffected by the worldliness and faults he sees in the lives of those around him. Nowhere is his naivete more evident than when he falls prey to the same deceptive character he has previously chastized his son for falling victim to. Yet Primrose remains blind to his own flawed character with its intellectual and spiritual pride. For example, when his half-dead son makes his entrance in the closing stages, Primrose affirms his own freedom from vanity, although the statement in which he makes this bold assertion suggests the opposite: \\"He now therefore entered, handsomely dressed in his regimentals; and without vanity (for I am above it), he appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.\\"While one must at times roll one's eyes at his excessive parade of virtue, the reader cannot help feel a strong measure of sympathy for his overly sweet character and good intentions. When his house burns down, rather than mourn the loss of his worldly possessions, he rejoices in the safety of his children: \\"'Now,' cried I, holding up my children, 'now let the flames burn on, and all my possessions perish. Here they are, I have saved my, treasure. Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall yet be happy.'\\" When misfortune results in his incarceration, he sees prison as an opportunity to convert the ungodly: \\"I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here; for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer could but take a proper aim.\\" Even his most malicious oppressors are reason for optimism: \\"... as my oppressor has been once my parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal.\\" And upon discovering that Jenkinson's account about the death of his daughter is false, he chooses to be overjoyed at her return rather than angered by the deception: \\"'How could you,' cried I, turning to Mr Jenkinson, 'how could you add to my miseries by the story of her death! But it matters not, my pleasure at finding her again, is more than a recompence for the pain.' \\"While Primrose's strength of spiritual character, moral fortitude and steadfastness in the face of crisis is exaggerated to the point of humor and wild improbability, it is nonetheless admirable in what it suggests about the human spirit. He sleeps untroubled while in prison and having suffered the most grave misfortune and being deprived of all that is dear to him: \\"After my usual meditations, and having praised my heavenly corrector, I laid myself down and slept with the utmost tranquility till morning.\\" And rather than grieve over his misfortune after his house has been engulfed with flames, he sees it as a positive benefit, for it humbles his wife's pride and makes her more receptive to the return of his daughter from prostitution: \\"I proceeded to prepare them for the reception of our lost one, and tho' we had nothing but wretchedness now to impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome to what we had. This task would have been more difficult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride, and blunted it by more poignant afflictions.\\" And when too much laughter and merriness displeases Primrose in preparation for the solemn ceremony of marriage, he makes it the occasion for spiritual correction: \\"I told them of the grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this Mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own composing, in order to prepare them.\\" And even some of the other characters share this virtuous approach, for rather than commiserate with Wilmot upon the loss of his fortune to deception, the senior squire remarks: \\"your present disappointment does not entirely displease me. Your immoderate passion for wealth is now justly punished.\\"Like Job, Primrose suffers at the hand of increasing disasters, but unlike his Biblical counterpart, he doesn't go to the ash-heap to mourn or struggle with his condition or grief. He remains constant in hope and optimism, sees in the greatest disasters opportunities for spiritual correction and growth, and always retains the prospect of improving his fortunes, if not in this life then in the hereafter. Despite his overly optimistic character, this nave and simple man who wants to serve God and his family presents a somewhat charming figure. We are curious what will be the outcome of his life, and our sense of expectation is heightened by the twists and turns of the plot, which for an 18th century work is reasonably fast paced and quite accessible for modern readers. While improbable, Primrose's journey from fortune to misfortune and back again might prove morally instructive not just to its protagonist, but to us all. - GODLY GADFLY"},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Goldsmith's only novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, is, as another reviewer pointed out, a modern (1766) version of the book of Job. In the book of Job, Satan attempts to make a fool of God and at the same time attack Job. Satan accomplishes this by arguing that the godliness of Job, who is God's beloved, is motivated by self-interest alone. God allows Satan to test Job in order that God and Job be vindicated.In Goldsmith's story, Dr. Primrose is a priest with a loving wife and 6 wonderful children. They have an elegant house, the respect of their neighbors and the means to help others less fortunate. We are barely introduced to Dr. Primrose and his family when they are beset by misfortune. Their wealth is stolen and they must give up their family home and move to a distant village. From this point on, a series of ever increasing calamities occur.Through it all we know that Dr. Primrose and family will persevere even if we can't anticipate all the twists and turns in the story. With that said, Dr. Primrose is not perfect. The introduction makes clear that he is possessed of intellectual pride. This measure of sin lends the story an air of authenticity that would be missing if Dr. Primrose was perfection personified. As a side note, the Penguin edition of this book does have a useful introduction which helps to frame the issues Goldsmith was trying to communicate as well as providing context for the times. The end notes are also of tremendous help.The ending may be unlikely but the message of faith and family love endures. Don't let the age of this classic novel prevent you from enjoying its wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Wakefield (Signet classics)","review":"Oliver Goldsmith's The Vicar of Wakefield is one of those books you told yourself in college to read but never quite got around to it. It is Goldsmith's only novel and includes several of his poems. The book might be termed \\"The Book of Job as written by Jane Austen,\\" in that it tells of the toils and troubles that beset an English vicar and his family, while at the same time being concerned with the love affairs of young people. The family Wakefield consists of the vicar, his wife and six children, two older boys, two girls of marriageable age and two small boys. The family is forced by circumstances to leave their good, middle class life in Wakefield and move to a lesser, but still tolerable existence in the countryside. There they encounter a variety of characters, some good and some bad and some seemingly good, but bad and some seemingly bad, but good--it all gets sorted out in the end.Much of what happens in the book is improbable, but the idea is not to present a factual account as much as a story about morality. As time goes by we see the foibles of the vicar and his family, but at the same time we see their natural goodness as well. But their problems mount and the book descends into what seems like unrelieved misery. We keep waiting for the negatives to turn into positives--after all this is not Thomas Hardy--but they are slow in coming and then are crammed into an implausible ending. One advantage of the book is that it is relatively short (less than 200 pages), thus we are not forced to wade through 500 pages of drudgery to find an alls well that ends well ending.I rate it at four stars because it is an excellent example of classical English writing with a story line that gives some insights into the life and values of English people at a time when England was growing in influence and power in the world."},{"Title":"Out of the Trap: Selected Lectures of Alan W.

Not to mention the measuring guide (8 x 12 inches), the scorer and folding tool in one, and the 12 pieces of 8 1/2 x 12 cardstock and 10 pieces of paper. The card ideas alone are wonderful (easy and pretty), but the templates put this set over the top. The only improvement I can suggest is that the plastic is really flexible. I wouldn't have minded paying a little more for slightly sturdier plastic, since I plan on using the templates a lot!"},{"Title":"Handmade Cards: Simple Designs for Beautiful Cards (Klutz S.)","review":"Simply a delightful way to create cards for all occasions. The templates are sturdy and the instructions are so user-friendly. This has become my standard birthday present for children (mostly girls), 9 years and older, although my teenage son often joins his sister in the creative process. A special treat is to accompany this set with a collection of interesting papers from a craft store and you have a gift filled with endless possibilities and love.

Although the book is slightly oversized and a little difficult to handle, it is an excellent reference source and worth the extra effort."},{"Title":"Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Needlework (Leisure Arts #15861)(Donna Kooler's Series)","review":"It seems to me that an encyclopedia of needlework is one of those things which sounds like a great idea, but ends up being not very useful in reality -- sort of like a home repair manual when your drain is clogged. But Donna Kooler's brand new book (just appearing on-line and in shops now) is certainly the exception which proves this rule.I am so excited by this book I hardly know where to begin. Donna and the staff at her design studio are wizards of design and stitching and they have brought their love of needlework and their depth of knowledge onto every page of the book.Instead of being comprehensive, the book deals with only the three major groupings of needlework: needlepoint, embroidery, and counted thread. Each section is identified by a color and small tabs on the side of every page let you know the major section you are in.Each of the major sections is dived up into three parts. The first part provides introductory information, history, a breakdown of materials and basic information on the technique. Even if you are an experienced stitcher, don't skip these sections, they are full of great information, wonderful tips and the best and biggest material pictures I've ever seen.The bulk of each section is given over to a Stitch Gallery, which is wonderful. Each stitch is pictured and has a large chart (two stitches per page). The name and alternate names are given along with a description,stitching instructions and suggested uses. In places where seeing the back is important (for example in the three types of tent stitches) the back is shown. On every diagram a red dot indicates where to being stitching. In addition the stitches are broken up into families so related stitches are found together.The final part of each section has a small selection of lovely projects to introduce you to the technique. For needlepoint there is a traditional floral, a charming Bargello kimono, and a textured stitch sampler in white.You have probably heard that many embroidery and counted thread stitches also work for needlepoint, but you may have felt uncertain about stitching them. With this book, especially with the counted thread section you will find lots of exciting ideas you can apply to your needlepoint. The stitches for pulled work, is particularly good.Not only is this book full of great information, it is beautiful as well. The entire book is designed to be visually appealing as well as very useful. Each page has the section name along the edge of the page as well as the printed tab. Throughout the stitch galleries, a heading at the top of the page tells you the particular technique (bargello, hardanger, edgings, etc.). All the stitched examples are done in a single range of pastel shades and in the pictures the threads are color-coordinated and the accessories are artfully arranged. This makes it a book which will draw new stitchers into our art, largely because it is beautiful and makes needlework look easy and fun.I am so happy with this book that I'm going to recommend it to everyone in my beginning needlepoint class I'm teaching soon. It may be required reading for the class after that!"},{"Title":"Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Needlework (Leisure Arts #15861)(Donna Kooler's Series)","review":"This book is well stocked with information!

The problem with that is these books are stand alone units and one can spend a large amount of time scanning through these various publications for the answer to a query.That's where this new publication comes into play. Donna Kooler's Encyclopedia of Needlework is a fantastic reference for all crafters. It is THE book to have in your craft library that will answer just about any query you may have for many many genres of needlework. Not only does this publication offer extensive information on history and materials, but a very fine stitch gallery in each of the genres of needlepoint, embroidery and counted thread.I am in awe of the research that has gone into putting such a ultimate publication together. There must have been many man hours spent finding the information and then many hours spent in getting that information into such easy to understand form.

I looked at a lot of stitch guides (trying to find some new ideas to add to my continental/basketweave habit), and the ones in this book were really the best I've seen, by far.

In fact, after I was two-thirds through the book, I just skimmed it to get the gist of main events, and was very glad when I finished that book."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"This is an allegorical tale that provides food for thought, as the reader accompanies one man on his journey to redemption. The man is question is a deeply flawed one, driven by many of the seven sins. When he kills his girl friend and flees in his car, he has what would appear to be a fatal accident. Instead, he mysteriously finds himself in the land of Ata. Thus, begins this fantastical Utopian tale.The book is simply written and chronicles one man's entry into a world where the dream state is reality. It is a world where unconditional acceptance of others prevails, and symbolically all are spokes in the circular wheel of life. Much of the book is redolent of Christian ideals. How much of Ata is in this man's mind and how much of it is truly real, I leave to the individual reader to discern. It is comforting to think, however, that the kin of Ata just may be waiting for you."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"It is a lovely book... somewhat surreal and definitely Utopian in theme but Bryant takes you so gently and slowly to her thesis that it's ultimately easy-to-swallow. Reflection over time, however, yields a few problems.As another reviewer has pointed out, Bryant uses a dispicable character to explain and augment the premise for the culture of Ata; many readers will find it hard to sympathize with his supposed enlightenment. Also, the id is completely glossed over in this book, the idea being that proper socialization within such a Utopian culture would erase or negate animalistic urges down to permanently manageable magnitude; many readers will question her conclusion in that regard and doubts will emerge on the entire premise. Lastly, the protagonists obtuse nature makes the book plod a bit; many readers will \\"get it\\" right away and be annoyed with how long it takes the main character to catch up (which in some respects he never really does)Then there's the attitude of the Kin of Ata themselves. While beautiful and loving and empathic and yadda yadda, they can easily come across as lackadaisical or just plain apathetic. While much is made of their near-telepathic \\"oneness\\" and reliance upon their spiritual nature, their repeated indulgence of the main character becomes tiresome.... have they no self-preservation? No passion? No overriding discipline? These questions are best exemplified by the fact that the Ata see no benefit from the notion of the written word. Much is made of their connection to one another; their oral history that becomes the art of storytelling etc. Apparently, historical fact-keeping is anathema to Utopia. I found that notion to be impossible to accept. Within the framework of a people absolutely cut-off from \\"modern\\" societies influence perhaps that could MAYBE be true, but one does not simply dismiss an obstacle to spiritual awakening by pushing it out of view. This comes across as a basic ostrich manuever to avoid facing the difficult realities of human natures: heirarchical thinking, competiveness and basic surivival needs that when unmet turn to aggression and antagonistic behavior. Those may not be pleasant realities but they are realities.For a more interesting (and possibly more intellectual) take on the same notion, try out Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Although her victorian attitudes about female sexuality date the piece, all other aspects of her Utopia seem more plausible to me. Which is saying something, really.Actually, I'd be more enthusiastic to recommend The Dispossessed (or nearly anything by Ursula K LeGuin) or Wild Seed (or nearly anything by Octavia Butler) as both (the books and the writers) explore the notion of a Utopian ideal by handing it to humanity via an alien race who are well aware of the not-so-nice aspects of human nature. Both writers understand that some unsavory elements are iron-clad stuck in us, not just taught to us.By keeping the Utopianists as human as anyone else, we beg the question \\"why do those humans never fight, never hurt each other and how would they deal with a natural disaster?\\" which never seems to be answered by Utopian writers adequately. By beginning enlightenment with an outside species/race, we change the question to \\"can humanity resist its negative tendancies in order to accept this Utopia?\\" which is imminently more interesting and quite possibly answerable on some level.The Kin of Ata... neither addresses nor firmly answers these questions, which is it's only flaw. For fantasy, however, it sure is a wonderful read."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I read this book over a year ago and still think about it almost every day.

It's more than the story, it's the concept of incorporating our dreams into our living. I have come to understand that there are really cultures who do this. Imagine! Imagine taking our dreams seriously enough to be able to use them to solve the myriad of problems facing us in this world. Imagine believing that dreams are more than individualized unconscious activity, that they have the potential to be utilized collectively to make decisions that as a society can move us forward, from Armageddon to Hope!

In The Kin of Ata Are Waiting For You, Dorothy Bryant succeeds in creating both a compelling alternate reality and a challenging vision of the possibilities of our own reality. From a horrific car wreck to a paradise of spiritual quest and harmony, Bryant skillfully takes the reader on the journey exploring the power of vision and the transformational possibilities of a truly authentic spiritual life. The book stands with Starhawk's The Fifth Sacred Thing and Elizabeth Moon's Paladin trilogy as a refuge to which I return again and again. I am never dissapointed. Nagdeo"},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I wonder if utopian fiction appeals to us because in our hearts we know that we, humans, are capable of being so very much more than we have been able to manifest so far during out stay on earth. Obviously one of the problems with 'being so much more' is knowing what that &quot;much more&quot; would look like and how we could find our way there if we did know where we wanted to go. Well Dorothy Bryant has some ideas about that. First she gives us a character that obviously doesn't have a clue what a life worth living might look like. He is a mess...possibly a 'success' by some cultural standards, but a failure as a worthwhile person. And, for most of the book he goes on doing ugly outrageous things.Meanwhile we are introduced to another way that is tied to dreaming, sharing dreams, living in accordance with dreams. Behavior that leads to success is tied to respect, to concern but not judgment, to honesty: and maybe most important even to acceptance of a jerk like our protagonist as having a purpose. This may all sound simple. It is...but it's not. That is part of the beauty of this book. It folds layer upon layer of complexity into the pages. It gives you plenty to think about. It is not an action packed book. It is an idea book. But it is also a mystery. Then again it is science fiction and it is philosophy. It is certainly worth reading. It stays with you.Has Bryant got good ideas or not? Probably she does -- but in line with her thinking you would have to consider it yourself and then talk it over with others to answer that question. In part, she seems to believe the everyone has something that s/he is suppose to do with his/her life and finding that will give a person's life the meaning it is meant to have--and that if each of us, working together, could get that piece in place we would discover a social order that might be said to be better than any we've created so far. But then, in the end, you are left to ask how much of the story --and how many of her ideas-- are a dream."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I was very psyched to read this book and was thrilled to have been given it as a gift. I thought the idea of the Atan culture and the people of Ata were amazing- so many good ideas about how to create a happy, well-run society with value and love for every diverse person.I agree with the many reviewers who urge people to read this book for a life-changing, or at least a perspective-broadening experience. I think we can all learn valuable lessons from the wonderful people of Ata. For a similar type of story, I also recommend Marlo Morgan's Mutant Message Down Under.My main critique of the story is that it is told through the eyes of a lying, thieving, raping, sexist, murdering, privileged, white man, and though he supposedly was changed by his experience on Ata, I never could grow to like him or develop any empathy for him. He later forms a &quot;relationship&quot; with a woman, Augustine, on Ata and I could not bring myself to believe that the characters really shared any love. It seemed like Augustine just went along with whatever the raping, thieving, slime-bucket guy wanted. I wondered about that aspect of Augustine's character and what the author intended to convey by portraying her that way.Perhaps I need to read it again and ponder that, as well as the question of why Ms. Bryant chose such a reprehensible main character to tell her fascinating story. Read it for yourself and see if you find the answers."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"A book of hope and inspiration, THE KIN OF ATA ARE WAITING FOR YOU carries the reader along as gently and as inexorably as a mountain stream.The anti-hero we meet in the first pages is unlikeable in many ways; despite this (or perhaps because of it) one has a stake in the outcome of his spiritual journey on the island of Ata and his final test back in the material world.Life on Ata is what one imagines pre-lapserian Eden was like. As he experiences more of the community of Ata; as he learns to understand more than just the spoken language of the Kin, and as he bonds emotionally with the stately Augustine, a woman like none other he has known, his soul evolves and blossoms like a desert flower after the first drops of life giving rain.There are many insights and thought-provoking scenes throughout this story, all the more remarkable when one remembers that this story was written in 1971! It's all too easy to miss the far-sighted vision of Bryant when one reads this book in the second decade of the 21st century, when the search for individual spiritual enlightenment has been mainstream for the last twenty years or more. When it was first published, THE KIN OF ATA must surely have been both ground-breaking and deeply illuminating.THE KIN OF ATA is a story that must be read with an open mind and patience, for its message is subtle, layered and important.However, I had personal issue with the projection of a universal human condition (racial prejudice) onto the convenient scapegoat that is South Africa. In addition, there were times when the narrative was too lengthy. Mostly, the writing was so lyrical and so dream-like it only added to the otherworldly ambience of the anti-hero's soul journey. There were occasions, though, when some dialogue, or shorter descriptions may have been more effective in holding the reader. The current title, too, is obscure; I prefer the original title \\"The Comforter.\\"The final strength of this story lies in the lingering effect it has on a reader. Ultimately, this is a book for all ages and all seasons: the truths it contains are truths of an ancient wisdom spoken in the language of our time. We may, as the anti-hero did when he first arrived on Ata, take some time to fully understand what we've experienced but, when we reach that moment of enlightenment, we'll find ourselves forever changed."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"This is the book I've been longing to find: A gem of a story that's been waiting for rediscovery as new age fiction. Dorothy Bryant's 1971 novel, originally promoted as science fiction, is described as \\"part love story, part science fiction, and at once Jungian myth and utopian allegory.\\" But by today's standards, it's a straightforward exploration of connecting to the highest and best parts of ourselves and living according to that guidance.Story: The kin of Ata live only for the dream. Their work, their art, their love are designed in and by their dreams, and their only aim is to dream higher dreams. Into the world of Ata comes a desparate man, who is first subdued and then led on the spiritual journey that, sooner or later, all of us must make (back cover).Spiritual/metaphysical content: Very high. Berkley Monthly called the novel \\"a beautiful, symbolic journey of the soul,\\" but there's very little about it that's symbolic when read as new age fiction. Here's my description of the story: When a famous writer hits bottom, he wakes up in what appears to be a simple commune from the Sixties that practices all the fundamental truths of most religious, spiritual, and self-help philosophies: Life in the moment. Connect with your higher self/guide/God for guidance. You cannot judge good or bad, right or wrong, true or false; truth is relative. You cannot heal the mind without also addressing the body and spirit, and much more. In addition, the book is compatible with Christian beliefs (at least the more modern interpretations of the Bible). As the man learns more about the kin of Ata, he realizes what a complex, spiritually advanced group they are despite-or perhaps because of-their seeming simplicity. The people of Ata live in a way that is free of sin, guilt, exclusion, worry, and pain, and yet is joyful, productive, and satisfying both in body and spirit.My take: This is a well-written, lyrical novel that exemplifies new age fiction at perhaps its finest. Although the book is quite short, the plot is strong and compelling, and we come to love the characters and yearn for their success. Although clearly utopian, the story proposes an integrated vision of a future that is both functional and inspirational.I loved this book. Part of its allure is its depth; it can be read at multiple levels: as an intriguing trifle of sci-fi/fantasy, an introduction to broader spiritual principles, or an insightful analysis of some of modern society's ills and how new age/metaphysical thought can not only ease the many sufferings of our world but also provide a model of sustainable growth and development. Please don't get me wrong-at heart, this is a relatively simple book, but it contains profound insights for spiritual growth. And best of all, it's an easy, entertaining read. Entertain and educate-the perfect combination for new age fiction.The title confounds me a bit because it sheds very little light on what the book is actually about; the back cover description suffers from this shortcoming as well. I suspect that it was a marketing decision in 1971 to promote a book that so clearly had literary value but fell into no recognizable genre (again, a case for the genre for new age fiction). In today's market, the title does the reader a disservice by not indicating the spiritual depth of the novel. As with Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, that may have been the price for getting published nearly forty years ago. Interestingly, the book was originally published in 1971 under the title The Comforter, which again seems unrelated to what the book is actually about. I am researching Dorothy Bryant's other novels for similar themes; Confessions of Madame Psyche looks interesting."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"\\"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You \\"is a great book which I first read in a college mythology class. It is one of those gripping books that keep you up til late at night, when you know you should have been asleep hours ago. Dorthy Bryant does a great job of illustrating how the illusion of a rock stars fame and fotune, have little place in the world of home and the heart. His understanding of what is important about the principles of life will change like it or not. The characters are simple, and the writing is nothing poetic, but this one day read has a great concept we can all learn from.The book was ordered a week before the christmas holidays, and arrived with in 2 days. It was right on time to wrap and put under the tree. The condition was perfect. I have had nothing but great experinences from Amazon. 20 out of 20."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"This is an allegorical tale that provides food for thought, as the reader accompanies one man on his journey to redemption. The man is question is a deeply flawed one, driven by many of the seven sins. When he kills his girl friend and flees in his car, he has what would appear to be a fatal accident. Instead, he mysteriously finds himself in the land of Ata. Thus, begins this fantastical Utopian tale.The book is simply written and chronicles one man's entry into a world where the dream state is reality. It is a world where unconditional acceptance of others prevails, and symbolically all are spokes in the circular wheel of life. Much of the book is redolent of Christian ideals. How much of Ata is in this man's mind and how much of it is truly real, I leave to the individual reader to discern. It is comforting to think, however, that the kin of Ata just may be waiting for you."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I read this book in my &quot;mysticism, meditation, and madness&quot; class.

Following an anti-hero's growth from immature materialism to his final destination of complete &quot;individuation&quot; is exhilarating fun.

Every 5 years or so I reread it and surprise! it hits me on even more and different levels. Some people might think it is a simple story- but sadly, they are not yet able to read between the lines. Like any poignant spiritual writing, Bryant's words merely point to the deeper meanings- the ones that can only be touched within the readers themselves as they read. If everybody read this book, and took away even part of it's meaning, the world would be a different, happier place."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I think this book is amazing.

This book should be taught in schools so that children can learn its beautiful message at an early age."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I am really impressed with this book and it's author, Dorothy Bryant. I believe she is still among the living, a 1930 model. Here's what SHE says about her book on her website!\\"Kin of Ata is often mistakenly labeled a \\"utopian\\" novel. The mythic island community of Ata is not a social/economic model for a perfect society; it is a psycho/spiritual metaphor drawn from many belief systems. The people on the island of Ata follow a non-materialistic, austere, and strenuous spiritual discipline, through which, moment by moment, they try to remain conscious of who we really are.\\"Lest the story turn into a lecture or a sermon, I made the protagonist and narrator an opportunistic, materialistic \\"success,\\" blind to the values prized on Ata. His resistance creates some dramatic tension. Plummeted into the world of Ata by his own subconscious need, he is slowly and reluctantly pushed and dragged, step by step, insight by insight, to his own salvation. These steps resemble those of almost every spiritual tradition. (See The Perennial Philosophy, by Aldous Huxley, 1944.)\\"Published by Random House in 1976, it remains my most popular book, selling by word of mouth. It has been used in high school classes for \\"troubled students with poor reading skills\\"and in seminars at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, where professors recognize its veiled sources.\\"This is my 4th reading of this 1971 fine visionary novel. I love it. I hadn't grokked until this reading that it is considered (according to the back cover) an \\"interface between mysticism and feminism,\\" \\"a woman's fantasy fiction,\\" \\"a love story, science fiction, Jungian myth and utopian allegory.\\"For me it is gripping and intriguing; this time, because I am writing my first novel and one with a male main character and narrator. We never know the name of her main character. He is clearly a bad man from the beginning. Perhaps his experience in another dimension helped him to do the right thing; so that he does not die a bad man. My character's name is Keith York and he's a bad man. His story is also about his transformation into a good man.I look forward to reading this book over and over the rest of my life, like the Chronicles of Narnia. Each time will surely be a different rewarding trip."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I found this book inspiring as it seemed to connect with a deep part of me. I need not say much more about it as many of the other positive reviewers have already expressed what I feel. What I do want to do, however, is give a heads-up on another book which recently came out that presents scientific evidence that humans in prehistoric times actually lived in harmony with Nature and with each other like in Ata. The book isSex at Dawn: The Prehistoric Origins of Modern Sexualityby Chritopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha. Sharing, no ownership and a deep sense of community were probably why these early cultures survived. See my review of SEX AT DAWN."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"Dorothy Bryant, who hales from the planet Berkeley, has written several novels that are so startlingly different from each other than it makes you wonder how one person could have achieved this feat.I don't like fantasy genre books, not at all. But just because Bryant had written this, I swallowed hard and read it. Oh boy. It's wonderful. It's the tale of a wretched man who seems to have killed not only his girlfriend but also himself. But he rouses from his \`swoon' in a strange world where there are no signs of ugliness or violence - and the rest of the novel plays with the question of how he will fare in such an unfamiliar environment.I strongly recommend three of her other books. The Garden of Eros (a personal favorite; I'm a midwife, and there's a fantastic description of an unattended birth in this book), Miss Giardino, and Ella Price's Journal. Dorothy Bryant created her own publishing company, Ata Books, in Berkeley because of her desire to help local writers get published and to keep their books in print and on local bookstore shelves indefinitely."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"Hi There Everyone,I have just been blown away by The Kin of Ata.

And more.I am not easily swayed by words.I am a Marine,a Harvard MBA, a CPA, a spouse of some years, a parent of four children, an awesome dude.I have ... never written a review. But this time it is different.The Kin of Ata shows us another way. A way free of sin, guilt, exclusion, boring TV, AND yet full of fun, joyful work, ways to lift ourselves up, ways to fulfill our human lives.I enjoyed \\"The Celestine Prophesy\\". That book was distributed at first in off Main Street \\"New Age\\" bookstores and leapt off the shelves.

The images of Ata bring me great comfort (The Comforter was it's original title); the &quot;holkas&quot; for healing, the sleeping wheels, the spiraling wall with shells for collecting drinking water, the great cone shaped gathering hall, the bowls of food for feeding one another...For anyone interested in social responsibility, spiritual growth, the power of dreams or even parapsychology, I highly recommend that you buy this book, read it and pass it on to your best friend."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"This is my favorite dream-inspired work of fiction, and it has been a major influence on my own approach to dreaming, as explained in my books CONSCIOUS DREAMING and DREAMGATES. Dorothy Bryant shows us that the first key to creating a dreaming culture is to open a safe space between people every day in which dreams can be shared and honored. If we can bring this about in our families, our schools, our work environments and our communities, we will take a tremendous step towards manifesting a more generous, spirited and compassionate society where we can move decisively beyond barriers of prejudice and misunderstanding. We will also bring gifts of storytelling and sponteneous healing into our everyday lives.The second aspect of Dorothy Bryant's vision of compelling interest today is that she beautifully portrays the possibility that the dreamworld is the REAL world, and that &quot;big&quot; dreams are real experiences in which we enter other dimensions, encounter other beings, and recollect our spiritual purpose. A sensitive movie version of this book would be a much-needed counterpoint to the film &quot;The Matrix&quot;, where the reality behind physical appearances is depicted as nightmarish, and an antidote to the consensual hallucination that dreams are &quot;only&quot; dreams."},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"One reading of this book is a modern Utopia. It's a place built on peace: happy, pastoral, multiracial, communal, and sexually liberated. The people are so viscerally in tune with their environment that they very nearly hibernate through the cold season and usually bear their young in the spring. The whole populace is dedicated to their dreams, to sharing their dreams, and to living more deeply in their dreams.A man from our outer world appears in that place, not the kind you'd want as your representative. He can not see into their depths, and violates one of the women who tends him. These peaceful people still accept him, though, and envelop him in their way. After many years, he finds his place among them. He also finds the true meaning of this Eden, a power and an ongoing place in the world that he never imagined.I'm still not quite sure what to make of this book. It comes from the hippy/commune era around 1970, and carries the indelible mark of its time. It's a bit simplistic at times, and only the first-person character is developed in any depth. This is a bit more than the common Utopia story, a bit more optimistic and a bit more magical.The very worst you can say about this is that it's light and readable, even enjoyable if you let yourself enjoy it. The story of personal transformation has been told before and is told well here. I guess real point is that this little land of loving dreamers is itself a dream worth having.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Kin of Ata are Waiting for You","review":"I have to second the words of ahpost3: magical, fascinating, enlightening, can't-put-it down; didn't want it to end.

Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Living With Contradiction (Rhythm of Life)","review":"The first word of the Rule of St. Benedict is 'Listen'. This rule, composed centuries ago for Benedict's community, and continued by communities across the world to this day, is a powerful way of living into the fullness of God's grace and love. However, as the title of this text by Esther de Waal indicates, it is not always an easy rule, nor one that is immediately grasped and completely understood.The monastics and oblates of Benedict's orders take vows, typically being poverty, obedience, chastity and conversion of life (the oblate's vows are modified to reflect the reality of living outside the enclosed monastic community, but the vows are derivative of the same root). It is the last vow, conversion of life, that perhaps at the heart of this book. Conversion in this context is not a once-for-all, 'road to Damascus' kind of experience, but rather a daily decision to continue working toward a new kind of life.De Waal's first chapter deals with healing - we live broken lives in a broken world, and not just in the physical well-being sense. Using images from the biblical texts such as the Garden of Eden and the Cross, prayers from St. Anselm and the text of St. Benedict, she weaves ideas of healing, wholeness, and fullness even as we recognise our short-comings and brokenness. God accepts us for who we are at each point, but calls us to a perfection that we can never really attain. If this seems like a paradox, you're on to something.The next chapter is entitled 'The Power of Paradox'. The monastic movement has always had at its heart a paradoxical call to be individual (the Latin root of the word monastic is mono, meaning 'one' or 'singular') in the context of community. The Christian call to be in the world but not of the world, to resist the world yet work within the world, is another such paradox. De Waal illuminates several such paradoxes, including the primary Christian paradox of the Cross, both an image of death and life, of defeat and of victory.'Paradox' is sometimes considered a fancy word for contradiction. Benedict's Rule seems full of contradiction, just as life seems many times. Benedict looks to today as the primary focus of activity and energy, but also looks forward to the future as the most important. Benedict requires a life of service to others and the practice of hospitality, but also emphasises the need for solitude and withdraw from the world.De Waal explores through the Rule of Benedict what it means to live with oneself, living with others in community, living in the world, and being both together and apart. Each person is endowed with gifts and graces, and has the potential for us to see Christ in them, if we will be attentive ('listen') and lose ourselves that we might also be Christ-like for the sake of others.Contradictions that de Waal highlights include the difference between desert and marketplace (the early Desert Fathers were never quite as removed from the world as they might have wanted; the marketplace is not an 'unholy' or 'ungodly' place necessarily, for St. Paul often did his teaching while plying his trade as a tent-maker in the marketplace). Whichever avenue is taken, desert or marketplace, de Waal emphasises the necessity of prayer as an anchor - de Waal uses the example of Thomas Merton, a man in solitary prayer also completely involved with the world at large.Saying 'yes' to the call of Benedict, to live a spiritual life, to live a life in the tensions of the contradictions, is never a simple intellectual assent, but rather one that has to come with the complete person, body and soul. It has to do with recognising the paschal mystery as both folly and wisdom, and recognising ourselves as having to always repeat the yes. According to de Waal, echoing the idea of conversion of life being an ongoing task, one must say 'yes' every day, repeating the'yes' and asking for blessing each night, and passing on the task to oneself and to others on a constant basis.De Waal's reflections are not simple and easy. A small-format book, if one were reading for the words alone, the text could be completed in a matter of an hour or two, but this would be to lose the richness of Benedict's (and de Waal's) insights and images. This is a book for longer-term meditation, to be read as lectio divina, to be read for inspirational guidance, to be taken in small pieces like rich chocolates, to be savoured and appreciated slowly for the full experience."},{"Title":"Joan Haste","review":"Anyone who reads H. Rider Haggard's 19th novel, \\"Joan Haste,\\" will likely be struck with one overwhelming thought: Times sure have changed for women in the last 100 years or so. Today, nothing much is thought of a woman who bears a child out of wedlock, and that illegitimate child will likely bear no stigma on his or her name in adulthood. But back in 1894, when Haggard sat down to write (or, to be strictly accurate, dictate) \\"Joan Haste,\\" boy, were things different! Either one of those \\"transgressions\\" could just about ruin a person's life. But what if a woman happened to be a \\"bastard\\" herself AND a single mother? What then? Well, it is just that double whammy that is explored in this very moving tale. Unlike most of Haggard's 57 other works of fiction, this one contains no lost races, no historical setting and hardly a bit of \\"action\\" to speak of. In it, Captain Henry Graves is called home to his family's estate in rural England, after the death of his spendthrift elder brother. This ancestral estate is well-nigh bankrupt, and it appears that the only hope for its continued existence is for Henry to marry Emma Levinger, the daughter of their landlord. But after a chance meeting with Joan Haste--the beautiful, illegitimate woman who works in the local tavern--and after breaking his leg while helping her capture some baby jackdaws, Henry begins to realize that the family fortunes are not uppermost in his mind. As might be expected, Henry and Joan fall in love, and that is just the setup of what turns out to be one of Haggard's most poignant love stories. The author takes his time in this longish novel, letting us really get to know his characters. There are many wonderfully dramatic scenes, with consistently sterling dialogue (if only people expressed themselves so well in real-life discourse!). The book contains many memorable characters, and is almost Dickensian in its description of the Bird family (with whom Joan stays in London) and in the secret agenda of Mr. Levinger. Perhaps the most memorable character of all, though, is Samuel Rock, a long-bearded Dissenter who is jealously in love with Joan himself. Indeed, Rock becomes so insanely amorous that he must automatically be placed in the pantheon of Haggard's other great love-crazed maniacs, a pantheon that includes Frank Muller in \\"Jess\\" (1887), Owen Davies in \\"Beatrice\\" (1890), Swart Piet in \\"Swallow\\" (1899) and Hernando Pereira in \\"Marie\\" (1912). Rock's crazed conduct leads to the only real \\"action\\" in the novel's 400+-page length, and makes for one superb cliffhanger of a final chapter. I advise all Harlequin romance readers to throw out those cheap paperbacks and try a REAL romance instead. This tale of the self-sacrificing Joan Haste (a \\"fast\\" woman?), and what she gladly suffers for the love of a man \\"above her station,\\" will surely prove a moving experience for just about any reader. So, does Haggard manage to work in a happy ending for Joan and Henry, you may want to know? Well, I'd never think of telling, but anyone who has read a number of the author's other works will probably be able to deduce the answer to that one! Actually, I feel that I must reveal ONE of the book's other surprises, as it constitutes my only quibble with the entire work. (Stop reading HERE if you don't want to know.) When Joan runs away to London, and realizes that she is pregnant (oops...excuse me; I meant \\"with child\\"), the reader is left thinking, \\"How the hell did that happen?\\" Henry had been laid up with a busted leg, in Joan's aunt's house, for several months, and had been close to death for much of that time with complications. How he ever managed to get Joan knocked up (I mean, \\"in the family way\\") is quite inconceivable, especially since all Haggard had previously shown us is Joan nursing him, cleaning his room and reading him poetry. Graves could hardly move himself during this time, much less put the moves on her! I guess this is a case of yet another British gent keeping a stiff upper, um, hip! But besides this bit of what I suppose was constrained propriety on the part of the author, \\"Joan Haste\\" turns out to be still another wonderful novel from H. Rider Haggard, and I do highly recommend it. The 1895 Longmans, Green edition, which I am fortunate enough to have acquired, also contains 20 marvelous illustrations by T.S. Wilson that only add to the pleasure..."},{"Title":"Autocad 2007 for Architecture","review":"Dissapointed! the book does not cover 3D commands, which are actually the main strength of Autocad 2007 version!.."},{"Title":"Canoe trails of southern Wisconsin,","review":"This book provides a reasonably thorough list of rivers with quality canoeing in southern Wisconsin and a few tips regarding likely river conditions and scenery to watch for.

I didn't even keep my copy, I gave it to a used book store."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"This was one of those books that is totally effortless to read. I attribute this to Kim Vicente's obvious passion for what he does, and his interesting ideas, research, and teaching, but most of all to his extraordinary ability to express himself.I've read many similar books, like Normal Accidents, Human Error, and most of Donald A. Norman's books, and enjoyed them all, but this one was probably the most enjoyable. It's very logical and well-designed, and does a great job of clearly explaining past disasters like Chernobyl and TMI. I was especially enthralled, as well as appalled, by the description of the Walkerton Ontario public water disaster as an example of a system failure. This was the first I heard of that one.His recommendations and predictions for the way forward are eminently sensible and practical. I especially liked the possibility of instituting anonymous incident reporting systems like the Aviation Safety Reporting System in medicine and industry.But most of all I'm very glad that such an excellent thinker, author, and teacher is following up and developing the groundbreaking and critically important work of Jens Rasmussen."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"With an open, friendly style, Vicente manages to explore the use - and misuse - of technology all around us, from our day-to-day life to critical systems like health care and nuclear plants. Vicente has a gift for weaving a web and linking elements from seemingly unrelated fields and linking them together in a thoroughly convincing manner. As he himself advocates here, the author has not written this book to assign blame for the current &quot;bad fit&quot; between technology-for-its-own-sake and people, but instead focuses on laying a groundwork towards a more balanced, manageable and safe design and application of technology.This fascinating, engaging book is a must-read for anyone whose car has grown too complicated, whose VCR keeps blinking 12:00, or who feels that technology has got out of hand. It's probably not the best book for someone about to undergo a stay in hospital..."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"Ever since Charlie Chaplin parodied automation in Modern Times, we have known what happens when we ignore the human factor in technology, but we continue to produce dangerous and unusable devices.Dr Vicente, a professor of human factors engineering, claims that we need to define technology in much broader terms than we usually do in order to avoid a \\"Cyclopean fixation on either mechanistic or humanistic world views.\\" We need, in fact, to consider the entire legal, psychological, organizational and political environment in which technology is embedded. The author calls this approach Human-tech.Consider that one of the reasons that hospitals continue to kill patients, even after badly designed equipment is identified, is that medical personnel dare not openly admit error, because of the severe career and legal consequences. This type of problem goes beyond traditional technical design issues of usability or ergonomics.Ultimately, Dr Vicente is optimistic that we can and will resolve these problems. He offers the commercial airline industry as an example. In 2001, despite the horrendous murders on September 11th, the total number of major airline crashes was fewer than in any year since World War II. What the aviation industry did for commercial flights, we can do for our healthcare system, airport security, or anything we want to turn our hand to."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"Dr. Vicente presents the interaction of technology and people in a clear, concise, and easy to read way. As a manager and engineer in the manufacturing world, The Human Factor gave me ample case studies of complex issues (some of which, like 3-Mile Island, are explored in other texts I have read as well) in context with practical issues in either everyday life or with specific application. How we interact with our stove burners or make sure a Ziploc bag is closed both were used to explore the human approach to technology and how to improve it.The Human Factor was recommended to me by our corporate safety officer and I think that is probably the real value of this text. It is perfect for safety and human factors professionals to either recommend or use in a book study with those who are involved but are not dedicated to reading original research in the area. For the majority of people, technical, leaders, or both, who need to deal with the human interaction with technology, this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"This book describes all the frustrations I've ever had with technology that is supposed to improve my work and my life. Vicente examines the problem not only with an engineer's understanding of design but also with a sharp eye on human nature. From photocopiers to nuclear power plants, he presents an intelligent, engaging and entertaining argument for changing our view of the world. However, unlike most general books in this area, he does more than raise questions-he offers a way forward, a framework for making humans the centre of design-a revolutionary concept! This is a book everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"Modern technology may ably supply the equipment and new convenience features people desire, but lacks the ability to consider or correct human error in using it. Kim Vicente argues for the need for technology that works easily for its users in his The Human Factor: Revolutionizing The Way People Live With Technology, which goes beyond argument to pint out how to bridge the widening gap between people and technology. From hand-eye coordination to matching complex human systems to easier consumer products, this provides both a scientific and social assessment of modern technology."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"I bought this book for my college class, but this book is very interesting.

This book is extremely relevant today and attacks the issue of techology throwing our lives into chaos with common sense. I thought the book was a great read - like having a conversation with the author and you learn something without feeling like the message is being shoved down your throat. The examples given to outline good designs versus bad designs were well thought out. I think Vicente's idea of designing products with a user in mind is revolutionary. It is only a matter of time before engineers and designers catch on to this idea.. and just think of the consequences - we (the consumers) would no longer feel like &quot;technological idiots&quot;."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"Probably a good book in the abstract but for those of us in the real world, not very useful.The book is out-of-touch with reality and seems to take on a niave, inexperienced approach that resonates with Ivory Tower insecurities and paternalism.A much better book in this same genre is Steven Casey's \\"Set Phasers on Stun.\\"It gets the point across succinctly in an entertaining manner and without all the patronizing preaching from the podium."},{"Title":"The Human Factor: Revolutionizing the Way People Live with Technology","review":"Human-tech is a phrase Vicente supposedly coined...however, it is a phrase found throughout the human factors profession and is even the name of a human factors company. This example is a metaphor for the entire book - a restatement of other people's ideas, much of which has been published in countless other domains - absolutely no new thinking here. The idea that systems should be designed from a legal, sociological, psychological, engineering, etc. approach has been in practice for some time and Vicente seems to ignore an entire field of research that has taken place in the science, technology, and society (STS) domain."},{"Title":"Source material for the social and ceremonial life of the Choctaw Indians","review":"This is an excellent book on the Choctaw culture. It has given me many insights into my family dynamics. I Also gained some tips for continued research."},{"Title":"Le Lotus Bleu (French Edition)","review":"\\"The Blue Lotus\\" is the richest in substance of all Tintin books. It is based on real-life political events: The Japanese occupation of Manchuria in the 1930s and later invasion of China. Continuing from \\"Cigars of the Pharaoh,\\" Tintin combats the opium trade. \\"The Blue Lotus\\" presents one of the most intricate plots of the series.Herge's artwork here is also intricate - it is excellent. In addition to providing a great scenic backdrop, he captures so well all that is Chinese: people, clothing, buildings and residences, and Chinese designs and artwork. Herge had been introduced to a young Chinese sculpture student in Brussels who helped him portray Chinese culture and artwork. This is in stark contrast to the simple and stereotypical portrayals of things in \\"Tintin in the Congo\\" and \\"Tintin in America.\\"The consummately corrupt and evil Japanese operative Mitsuhirato is perhaps Herge's most compelling villain. Tintin measured against Mitsuhirato is the apotheosis of representations of good and evil in the Tintin series. Herge's portrayal of the Japanese was not well-received by them, but before Pearl Harbor he compensated for this to some degree in \\"The Crab with the Golden Claws.\\" Note that Herge, the occasional social commentator, also takes a shot at Western arrogance in \\"The Blue Lotus.\\"Tintin's relationship with his friend Chang Chong-Chen and the other Chinese people in the secret society that combats the opium trade is very poignant. Within the series, it represents the most compelling display of teamwork: Tintin is heroic as always, but he also receives considerable heroic help. China is a huge country, as was its struggle against the occupying Japanese. Tintin's nobleness, courage, persistence, and emergence as a hero are uniquely grandiose and melodramatic in this story, clearly one of the best in the series. Quite interestingly, it is No. 18 on Le Monde's list of 100 Best Books of the Twentieth Century."},{"Title":"Le Lotus Bleu (French Edition)","review":"I grow up reading French Tintin and I want my kids to enjoy it as well. it is easy French reading"},{"Title":"Le Lotus Bleu (French Edition)","review":"had to buy this for my french class and actually enjoyed it, the quality of the used book was EXCELLENT!!"},{"Title":"Le Lotus Bleu (French Edition)","review":"Got exactly what I wanted.

This book lists many facts about the past such as the rules and regulations for women in the past and how women had to dress as guys to be able to fight. The also discuss the many changes in the military for women threw history such as the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA).this act allowed women to be able to be promoted into higher offices then before and was one of the first acts past that opened up opportunities for women.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in joining any branch of the military. Also anyone who is interested in the changes for women in the military. This book was very interesting but some parts of the books seemed boring and hard to get threw because they list fact after fact. But I did like the interviews with the women in the military today and the ones from the past. this book relates to English because some soldiers questioned if the should go to war or not and leave there family and in the book Inherit the Wind the character Rachel was wondering if she should leave her father or not .Over all I felt like this was an interesting book and helped me a lot because I want to join the marines and it showed me the opportunities women have now compared to the past."},{"Title":"High Towers","review":"Many historical novels of today seem to fall into a seemy romance, or an action packed documentary. The High Towers was written well before this trend. It uses a real sounding story to bring to the reader a plausable and enjoyable adventure.Costain is known for his Bible related novels and that purity of language and plot content translates to this novel.If you want to learn more about early Montreal and New Orleans in a clean historical novel, then this is what you are looking for."},{"Title":"High Towers","review":"I've been enjoying myself as I work through the entire Thomas B. Costain set. I've read Below the Salt, The Moneyman, The Black Rose, For My Great Folley, and The Last Love. By and large I've enjoyed each book (well not The Last Love so much). I enjoy the way Mr. Costain takes characters from history and puts together a story that brings the past to life. Typically I enjoy the pace of the stories and find the characters beleivable.With High Towers however I found that I just could not force myself to care about the characters at all. I thought the story moved along at a snail's pace. Also frustrating was two of the characters I liked the most went away ... one left the story line just after her introduction and the other was killed off.Well, like I said in the title of this review not every book can be a winner. This one is the worst I've read of Mr. Costain's works. It was bad enough that I was forcing - literally FORCING myself to sit and read the book and finally just gave up around page 150. I can't even remember the last time I put down a book without finishing it ... yes for me this book was that bad."},{"Title":"High Towers","review":"I love Thomas Costain's historical novels.

I'm not a professional gardener, just a homeowner with a passion for gardening, and an interest in more sustainable and environmentally inclined gardening ideas and techniques. I believe this book has information that would be of benefit to almost any level of gardener. The author covers every aspect of gardening and landscape design in a very in thorough manner that is as informative as it is easy to read. For those who want to delve into related subjects she makes suggestions for additional reading that I found very helpful. Her encyclopedia of plants is extensive. The astounding list of plant and seed suppliers she has compiled is a great benefit. If there be any fault in the book, it is that it is somewhat dated with the most recent edition being 1982. Her coverage of drip irrigation reflects this. Otherwise it is superb book!"},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Edible Landscaping: Home Landscaping with Food-Bearing Plants and Resource-Saving Techniques","review":"I have a couple of minor criticisms about this book, so let me begin with those. Firstly, it is showing its age. It makes frequent reference in the early chapters to the water shortages and environmental disasters that were widely expected to occur by the end of the century. As you know by now, those never really materialised. There is still plenty of reason to be concerned about the way American society (mis)uses resources, but the threat is neither as immediate or as dire as the author makes out.Secondly, in the suggestions on building planters, and retaining walls, the author fails to note the potential dangers of CCA treated lumber (now being phased out) and railroad ties treated with creosote.Lastly, more color illustrations would have been nice. Those that are there are very good. The b&w; drawings are nice, but not as good as photos.Those criticisms out of the way, the book is excellent. The first few chapters provide the rationale for edible landscaping, then introduces the principles of landscaping, giving numerous examples of applying different themes to different climates. The chapters on techniques, especially in relation to trees (the basics of pruning, and plenty of advice on espaliering) are particularly good. An entire chapter is devoted to identifying insects and dealing with the undesirables.The second half of the book is a plant encylopedia. Handy to have in one volume, but if you already have a good plant encyclopedia, it is probably redundant."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Edible Landscaping: Home Landscaping with Food-Bearing Plants and Resource-Saving Techniques","review":"I grew up in a garden designed using this book, and now I am working on designing my own.

True, it is an older book but the information is still good. The thumbnail info on size of plants, what they can be used for, how to grow them, certain things they need and so forth enables planning for even plants not previously grown. The photographs as well as artists sketchings gives a visual idea of what combining fruit/nut trees, flowers and vegetables looks like in various ways. The use of containers both large and small, raised beds and other methods of planting gives a variety of looks and possibility. Love the idea of a floating deck around trees! The warnings of some plants, such as bamboo, spreading as well as suggestions on using the plants grown are a starting point, but a good one. Possible miss on some things, such as the availability of bush cherries for those not wanting cherry trees; but those are few. There's enough information to adequately plan, to fit plants into the budget and allow for adding more later and to plant and make use of \\"wasted space\\" for the average person capable of reading, comprehending and following suggestions.

A bit overstated, perhaps, but not by much if Bullen is to be believed. I enjoyed the writing about, if not the fact of killing, whales which evan Bullen regreted occassionally between recounting with enthusiasm the joy of killing and surviving danger and harsh conditions. Life on the ocean, hard work, adventure, loyalty, courage, man's right to dominate nature and Anglo-Saxon man's right to dominate all others is the gist of this life and book, as far as I can tell. Small wonder that it was included in the Boy Scout Edition (1913) of Every Boy's Library, eh? Some things have changed and most readers today might disavow the racism, chauvanism, species-ism call it what you will of Bullen's views but it is a good read on the times and the nature of man, humankind and the political correctness of the late 19th. century. At least that's my view for what it's worth. Dated, but still readable especially for it's candid picture of life in the last century.

Is this a ponderous joke dressed up in academically correct language? I think it is -- and I applaud the editor's humour, if such is intended.

Everyone who sees the Hell's Angels has an opinion about what is going on, yet few have had a first hand relationship with a member. This book gives you a behind-the-scenes look at what it was like for Oakland's leader of the pack, one of the first branches of the Hell's Angels.I grew up in San Bernardino (Berdoo in the book) which was an even earlier branch of the Hell's Angels than was Oakland. Some people I went to high school with joined the Hell's Angels. We all heard many stories about the group, and what went on. We treated these people with extreme caution and gave them a wide berth.The book brings out an ethos of freedom (the open road) combined with a masculine emphasis on being respected and being loyal to friends. At the same time, there is an underlying sense of the frontier marshall, wanting to clean up those who were challenging law and order. Behind that there is a disregard for the rules most of us follow, whether in speed, drugs, theft, or violence.This book is filled with deaths, injuries, and destruction. The Hell's Angels live in a dangerous world, and that doesn't bother them. What would bother them is not following their code of ethics.Having read about all of the things the Hell's Angels are supposed to have done in the last 50 or so years, it is interesting to hear it from the other side.Although you probably won't want to emulate Sonny Barger in too many ways, you'll certainly never forget him. If you love motorcycles (as many of us do), you'll be moved by his loving descriptions of various bikes. He was truly the wild one at the head of the bike pack."},{"Title":"Semimartingale Theory and Stochastic Calculus","review":"The main contents of this book can be found in other more famous monographs: Probabilities and Potential, Vol. 1 and 2, by Dellacherie/Meyer; Limit Theorems for Stochastic Processes, by Jacod/Shiryaev. Unfortunately, these monographs are very hard to read. So the main merit of He-Wang-Yan can be said: it's suitable for self-study and accessible to any persistent graduate student with certain mathematical maturity.1. It contains the essence of Dellacherie/Meyer, but debugs/simplifies many proofs.2. It gives a quick and clear presentation of Dellacherie's capacity theory, with application to section theorems.3. This book is supplemented and further developed in the form ofproblems. Some of the problems are useful results and some of them are difficult.Contents: 1. Preliminaries. 2. Classical martingale theory. 3. Processes and stopping times. 4. Section theorems and their applications. 5. Projections of processes. 6. Martingales with integrable variation and square integrable martingales. 7. Local martingales. 8. Semimartingales and quasimartingales. 9. Stochastic integrals. 10. Martingale spaces H1 and BMO. 11. The characteristics of semimartingales. 12. Changes of measures. 13. Predictable representation property. 14. Absolute continuity and contiguity of measures. 15.Weak convergence for cadlag processes. 16.Weak convergence for semimartingales.The first ten chapters (about 400 pages) are pretty easy to read. From Chapter 11 on, things get dramatically complicated as the authors try to work under the most general framework. For Girsanov's theorem, local absolute continuity is considered, and Jacod's random measures become the common language. These stuffs seem too complicated to a beginner. Other books should be consulted to see the most useful forms of these theorems. For example, I'm more happy with Protter's presentation of PRP (predictable presentation property), in the second edition of his book on SDE.As to the last three chapters, I didn't really read them, but chapter 15 seems very nice and quite self-contained.For the follow-up reading of He-Wang-Yan, I would recommend Revuz/Yor: Continuous Martingales and Brownian Motion, and Vol.2 of Rogers/Williams: Diffusions, Martingales and Markov Processes. They will show the applications, as well as intuitions, which are often obscured by the heavy machineries invented to takcle the most general cases.A final remark: Frank Knight gave an interesting review of the book by Revuz/Yor, which is worth of looking. The review can be accessed at MathSciNet."},{"Title":"Semimartingale Theory and Stochastic Calculus","review":"I read the previous review and borrowed this book from library. I am not from math/statistics, but I followed the construction of the stochastic integrals with respect to continuous semimartingales (from 'Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales') without difficult (well, somewhat, but not major). The thing is I found this book is not that easy to read, especially the part for general processes, i.e. predictable times, accessible times, predictable projections, etc. By browsing the book, I can only grasp the results they derive, but can't follow the details because of the heavy machinery. Nevertheless, this books contains full details, compared to 'Limit Theorems for Stochastic Processes' (I haven't read all, neither have I read C. Dellacherie and P. A. Meyer), and it suffices to be a good reference book."},{"Title":"A Visit to the Post Office (Field Trip Books)","review":"It is a good book about a class visiting a post office, I go to my local post office quite frequently."},{"Title":"The Development of the Sonnet: An Introduction","review":"This is a very fine book indeed, although with a somewhat misleading title: it should have been added (in a subtitle, perhaps) that it follows the development of the sonnet only in Italy and England: After a full discussion of its Italian origins and the devolopment to its &quot;classical&quot; form and its variants, and after a passing remark on its spreading through other European countries, it follows its way to England where it stays for the rest of the book (making some two thirds of its bulk), to examine, in detail, its devolopment from the first imitations of Petrarch to its English form, the sonnets of Sir Philip Sydney, the Elisabethan sequence-vogue, Spenser's sonnet, its highlight in the work of Shakespeare, to end with sonnets of Herbert, Drummond, and Milton. On it's way, Mr. Spiller more than fully justifies the subtitle of &quot;An Introduction&quot; he did give to its book - and, by the way, not much in the development of the form has been left out: as the Author notices, the only other variations in the form were the French rhyming scheme, of much less consequence than the English, and, again French, twelve-syllable line. Moreover, the book sports a fair amount of examples, and copious notes. No chance of regretting your investment: after three years of perusal, it's still among the chosen band by my writing desk, from where it only sometimes wonders off to my night-table."},{"Title":"Tennessee Birds: An Introduction to Familiar Species (State Nature Guides)","review":"I have found this chart very helpful, because I have only lived in Tennessee ten weeks. My backyard is so thick with trees that often I'll only see a flash of color--I can see a bird's approximate size and its colors, but not its shape or any details. This chart narrows down what kind of bird it might be, and I can then look up the bird in my bird books and look to see if I have the correct bird once I get another glimpse of it. It can't really be used alone, as it doesn't give much detail or even a very good picture, and I've seen one or two birds already that aren't in it because they aren't common in the state, but it is very helpful for what it does do."},{"Title":"Tennessee Birds: An Introduction to Familiar Species (State Nature Guides)","review":"This is a useful guide for identifying common birds in Tennessee. However, it includes only the drawings and sizes. I use mind to hand to friends when I am birding; it keeps them out of my Peterson's and Audubon guides."},{"Title":"Tennessee Birds: An Introduction to Familiar Species (State Nature Guides)","review":"This little pamphlet is great for leaving by a window as a quick reference when you see a bird. The pictures are clear and the pamphlet includes a good representation of birds of each category. We also purchased a larger bird book for detailed information. The two complement each other nicely."},{"Title":"James Madison and the Future of Limited Government","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a libertarian, firmly committed to most of the ideas represented in this book. In a way, then, it feels strange to have come away from this book with the dry feeling that I did. Here's why I did.First, on television and radio, I am always skeptical of endorsement deals. &quot;Hi, I'm [insert hot-shot sports star] and I use [insert hot-shot product]. You should too.&quot; Well, this book is what i call a 'political endorsement' book of the type where the endorser, Madison, is conveniently dead. &quot;Madison believed [insert policy]. Therefore you should too.&quot;Now, I guess that the title of the book alone should've indicated to me that this was what to expect,and i guess in some sense I did. With essay titles like, &quot;Madison and Multi-culturalism,&quot; one expects that the goal is to take Madison's writings and apply them to contemporary situations. Maybe i just didn't expect so much of the, &quot;...since Madison said x, x must be right,&quot; bit.Before I go into my one MAJOR problem with the book, I did give it 3 out of 5 stars. Here's why. Whereas about half of the essays are 'endorsement deal' essays, about half are legitimately not. Of course, as the book is on Madison, they might mention him in passing, but most of the 'non-endorsement deal' essays do something like this: &quot;Madison thought x to be a problem. I think x is a problem too. I will argue my own case and I might mention Madison only in passing.&quot; The best essays in the book (about a good half of them) do exactly this. They argue on their, not Madison's, merits.The only thing funny about that is that for all practical purposes, those essays needn't be in a book on Madison at all. In fact, if one took the 'endorsement deal' essays out of the book and left only the others, one could safely take Madison's name from the title. In fairness, my simultaneous criticism of 'endorsement deal' essays relying too much, and other essays relying not enough, on Madison, seem to have me wanting it both ways. I guess I wanted (a) a book that was more about history and less about polemical advocacy; and (b) just a little bit more substance than &quot;Madison believed it, therefore, so should we.&quot;Now for my big criticism. A few authors claim for Madison views seemingly more extreme than Madison seemed to hold. Some authors say that Madison was a big defender of laissez-faire. I've read much Madison and i've yet to see the essay he wrote on private economic activity. Sure, he writes on strictly limiting the NATIONAL govt.'s powers, but he, as Jefferson, believed in things like public education, wrote nasty words about the unequal relationship of creditors and debtors, and generally did not write against states ability to regulate economic behavior. Was Madison a federalist? Yes. Did he believe in limited government? On the NATIONAL level, yes. Does that mean he supported laiseez-faire economics? Not exactly. And the CATO writers did a poor job showing he did. They do things like point to Madison's position on contracts BETWEEN THE STATES or his non-interventionist approach to dealing with other nations and jump to the conclusion that he supported free-market economics. They must do better than that.Lest I get on too much of a diatribe, I have to say that, for all that, the book was decent. I gave it three stars for the 'non-endorsement deal' essays, and as they are about half of the book, the book is worth getting. I simply expected better for the other half."},{"Title":"James Madison and the Future of Limited Government","review":"As a classical liberal my beliefs have become an anachronism in America. I belong to a philosophical social club so small that when books like this come along we are given hope that the masses will wake up to the tyranny. Alas, hope is quickly dashed upon the realization that the Fabian socialists have dumbed down the masses over the last forty years to the point that the arguments presented in this book are far beyond most Americans' comprehension, let alone their ability to affect change.Nonetheless, this is an outstanding group of expertly written essays that are well presented by editor John Samples. Samples also writes one of the essays and an excellent introduction. Some of the topics presented are: Federalism, abuse of the general welfare clause, multiculturalism, democracy, and the essence of representative government, pure democracy, rule of law, and foreign policy. Using historical documents each author is able to help us understand the brilliant mind of Madison and that the abuses of government we are experiencing were foreseen not just by the Anti-Federalists but by Madison as well. These brave men gave us a system that, while less then perfect, is the most advanced in human history.However, as the editor notes, there is an implicit understanding for this design to work. That understanding is that there is virtue among us. Madison once asked, 'is there no virtue among us? If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks -no form of government can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people is a chimerical idea.' Do Americans possess enough virtue to maintain a limited government? To do so we need to be well educated, remain skeptical of government, and act on that skepticism. We must reject statements from family and friends like \\"they should do something about that.\\" No they shouldn't, we should. Keep the government out of it.I, like one of the contributing authors James Buchanan, am less optimistic about our future. I think the socialists are winning and have created a society where individual liberty has been cast aside as an old conservative idea and replaced with an environment \\"where everyone seeks to take wealth from someone else.\\" Sadly I have tended to give up on the dream that liberty, free thought, speech, and economic markets can once again be a reality in America. I vote now for total gridlock so as to hopefully stop all new legislation, taxes, and pork.This wonderful book renews my love of our experiment even if it has gone awry. It offers me solace in these tough times of ever increasing government abuse. This book has renewed my vigor to keep up the fight for what is right and not just settle for government gridlock."},{"Title":"James Madison and the Future of Limited Government","review":"This is a must read for anyone that believes that taking our rights away is \\"good for the common good\\" and \\"protects\\" us from terrorism.This is a good read for all the second admendment haters that believe that it was a \\"different time\\" and tyranny could never come to the U.S."},{"Title":"James Madison and the Future of Limited Government","review":"Being retired and a reader, I thought I knew enough about American history and political theory. But reading this book taught me a lot more. Published by the Cato Institute, this collection of essays tries to make Madison out as a libertarian (which I am not...libertarians lack moral heart, just as liberals lack common sense).The two main things I learned were these: Madison indeed believed that federal government should not endorse any religion, BUT HE BELIEVED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL STATES INDEED COULD!The last chapter describes a 1949 book by Carl Van Doren. He apparently believed that as the individual states of the Confederation required a constitution and a federal (mixed) form of government, that now, with globalization and increased communication, all the states of the world require a world government and a written Madisonian constitution.In our information technology world and globalization, the lingua franca would obviously be English, and the constitution copied on our own.Quite a bit to think about!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a stark and harrowing tale of survival under the worst of unimaginable circumstances. Unfortunaltely a true account of a halocaust survivor who will be forever traumatized by these experiences of his youth. An important book for all to read since it is sometimes hard to comprehend the extent of man's inhumaity to his fellow man. The author who endured these experiences in his adolescence describes totally losing his faith in God for allowing this to happen. One can certainly understand the response when one reads his terrible eye witness account of his father's cruel death just before liberation. One is struck by the tragic lost chances for escape: the disregarded warnings from a fellow villager's eyewitness account of his own deportation and narrrow escape from death, the uncompleted warning knock on the window, and finally the lost chance for liberation for both father and son had they chosen the road not taken, and made a decision to remain in the camp hospital. I would strongly recommmend Viktor Frankel's book Man's Search for Meaning for readers of this book. The victim's sufferings are similar. The author is an adult and a psychiatrist whose contrasting focus is in overcoming his awful circumstances and maintaining his human integrity and faith."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is one of the most amazing pieces of literature I have ever read. It has the ability to reach off the page and slap you in the face. It is honest, gruesome, gory abut at the same time, wonderful. It is true to life and I love that Eli Weisal isn't afraid to hold anything back. He allows the readers to experience everything he did, whether they want to or not. It is a book that should be required reading for every student all over the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel exceptionally places his thoughts and feelings on paper as he details his horrific journey through the Holocaust. He captures the tragedy of the end result of anti-Semitism with his entire book but especially with his description of one experience at Auschwitz. &quot;Not far from us flames were leaping up from a ditch, gigantic flames. They were burning something. A lorry drew up at the pit and delivered its load - little children. Babies!&quot; While people say a picture is worth a thousand words, those four sentences paint one powerful picture. Wiesel's book is filled with powerful pictures of horror that make me glad to be born a free American. I believe this should be required reading for every college student or even every high school student."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Masterfully written, life-changingly read. The true story of a teenage boy caught in the darkness of the Holocaust, and powerfully shared in his own words. Thank you, Elie Wiesel, for telling your story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book in the late 80's. Someone had left it behind in a coffee shop so I grabbed it after reading the first chapter. It was a very compelling journey, it reminds you both how loving and caring people can be as well as how cruel and vile people can be as well. The story is about 120 pages and its an easy read that locks you in. I purchased it to read it again as well as recommending it to my wife. I highly recommend it, it will not let you down."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This novel while depressing and hard to read at times is truly a moving piece of literature. Elie Wiesel has much strength to be able to even survive not only one concentration camp but three. I can't imagine not just his physical strength to live on with almost no food and have to work all day but his mental strength to carry him for so long. He has the strength and will power to live on for himself and for his father. He has some weaknesses when he contemplates just giving up and letting go. Also he had a weakness of wanting to get rid of his father who in reality was his support system. His ultimate weakness was loosing his faith because it was a loss of hope and chance for redemption. He never lets his weaknesses get the best of him and his strengths overcome his doubts and carry him to freedom.This novel is defiantly effective by its hard hitting descriptions and true accounts of the terrible things that took place in the camps. It's hard to swallow some of the things mentioned and it opens your eyes to a world that seems unimaginable. Elie writes the book basically by explaining step by step what happens which wouldn't seem so bad or interesting. But every step is so intense and riveting that you almost can't comprehend what you are reading. His message is loud and clear that what happened was horrendous and should never take place again under any circumstances."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NightNight was an extremely detailed book. It taught me many things about the Holocaust concentration camps that I didn't know before.Night is about the life that a young boy went through while World War II was taking place. His father and him were transferred from camp to camp and had many rough times.During this time, the boy's father was practically dying and when they were so close to freedom he finally passed away. The boy tried so hard to keep his father alive and couldn't do anything about it.Night explains how horrible the concentration camps were and also explained what went on at these camps. This book is definitely a book to read if you want to learn about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have been interested in the literary works concerning the Holocaust for years, ever since I read the Diary of Anne Frank. The things that went on disgust me and tear at my heart, but for some reason I'm also very intrigued by what occurred in all of those concentration and extermination camps. I first read Night a couple months ago- I didn't realize just how horrible the events that Elie described were, until I read the book a couple weeks ago for a second time. The traumatic experiences that Elie describes are enough to make your heart ache, but at the same time, he does not go overboard in detailing the more gruesome cruelties. That is one reason why I like this book. I also like it because of the informal manner in which it's written- they are just Elie's words, his memories- he doesn't need to spell everything out or spend time recapping who the characters are, because they are not characters- the people were real. If you are a fan of Holocaust books, I would definitely recommend that you read Night at least once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, though a very short book, is one of the most moving accounts of the Holocaust that I have ever read. As Eliezar struggles through life in a concentration camp, every reader struggles with him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book changed my life.It made me understand that every Jew has the duty to help keep the Jewish people alive. It gave me a deeper understanding of the suffering of the Jews in the Shoah( Holocaust) than any other book I had read on the subject. It is powerfully, poetically and painfully written. It in telling the story of one person, and one family seems to speak for millions murdered by the Nazis. It tells how the innocent, dreaming youth lost in the spiritual world of a small Eastern European shtetl is confronted with absolute Evil and Cruelty. It tells the story of his passage through death camps and on the death march. It tells of his relation to his family, and his especially painful parting from his beloved father. And it raises questions about the Nature of Man, of Evil, of Human Suffering. And it is an address to G-d in questioning in the deepest way. Like Job and like the Psalmist the young narrator dares to speak to G-d and reveal his own most powerful doubts and questions. The story is one which too portrays the victims with a kind of love, sympathy and understanding.My summary does not even begin to do justice to this very great work.I have only one warning word to the reader. To read this work is painful and difficult, and it raises questions for which some may have no answer but ultimate despair. And this when the voice of the narrator the survivor somehow gives in spite of all an impression of one determined not to forget the victims, and to keep their memory and the Jewish people alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" Elie Wiesel is a sad book, but worth reading. The story is about Elie and his father. It takes place in Germany during World War 2 and the Holocaust. Elie and his family get sent to a concentration camp. He gets split from his mom and sisters, but he stayed with his father. The story is about how Elie and his father survive together. In the end only Elie survives. I thought the book was great! I like it because the whole book is very interesting. And because I enjoy history and it is a true story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel clearly and articulately brings the pain and horror of the holocaust to a personal level on which any reader can empathize. A Hungarian Jew living in Romania, Wiesel manages to avoid the holocaust until the final years of the war, at which time he and his family are sent to the camps. Wiesel has the uncanny ability to recreate the unimaginable daily genocide so that the reader is placed in his shoes, seeing the carnage through his eyes. The book is written at a very accessable level, and given the gravity of the subject matter is very short. However its impact is similar to that of being punched in the solarplexis. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's book, Night, revealed parts of the Holocaust that only someone who had gone through this horror could describe. He created an atmosphere that was mysterious and new to me. It drew me in to want a more conscious understanding and realization of what really happened. Elie described each camps treatment with great visuality so I could identify what was going on, but did not disgust me to the point to stop reading. This book showed how people act when they are in an extreme situation and that you need to be independent to survive. His words brought out emotions of sadness and helplessness and the question of why it took the world so long to acknowledge and respond to this great massacre of people. The book Night had an enormous impact on me which has made me curious to know more about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had to read Night By: Elie Wiesel in my High School English Class. At first I did not want to read this book. I wasen't interested, nor did I have time. But once I got passed the first 25 pages, I got into the book. It has a great story, even though it isn't a joyful topic. The Holocaust was an awful event that killed millions of people, Jewish included. This book is a great illustration of this event in history. It has an unforgettable message that will make you think about what happened. Through the book, you get to travel into a death camp with a young boy who is present for a lot of horrible things. I am happy that my English teacher made us read this book, it has put a new perspective into my life. Thank You Mr. VanVickle!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Dear Reader,Night by Elie Wiesel was the best book about the Holocuast. I would rate this book a \\"five\\" because it was very dramatic the way he wrote the book. I think it was the way the Nazi's used to treat the Jews that got me crying. I think that he is a very good writer and he did a good thing by writing this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel and it really touched me. This book was written in the perspective of a survivor of the Holocaust and this is what makes this a strong book . The author goes into to detail about the horrors of the concentration camps; this of course, sets a melancholy mood. But, I recommend this to anyone and everyone who wish to catch the truth of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found this book very enlightening. I really appreciated the personal and emotional impact of what the author was experiencing. Part of what makes this book so captivating, is that Wiesel doesn't just list all of the attrocities that he experienced. Rather, he focuses mainly on the physical and emotional impact of living in a concetration camp. Wiesel takes the reader through a journey that starts with his steadfast belief, then through his loss of faith and lastly to his eventual dispair. Finally, his inner struggle concerning his father is very revealing of the human condition when pushed beyond all limits."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read a number of Holocaust books and most all of them are poinant and moving. There are some works that seem more of an exploitive nature but mostly each work is another opportunity to try and understand the incomprehendable. Numbers tend to numb but first person accounts bring to life the insanity that was and is the Holocaust. In &quot;Night&quot;, Elie Wiesel does as good a job as anyone in giving us a glimpse of life in a death camp. What stands out is how well he is able to say so much with such brevity. Every sentence has its' purpose and every character his as well. There are many unforgetable passages. One I recall tells of a fellow prisoner who spoke of loading corpses and discovering he was loading his own father. That and many other images will stay with me forever. This book should be read by all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is absolutely breath taking and will leave you speechless! You must give it five stars alone knowing that this is a true story and someone actually lived this life. At first, I found the writing style chopping, but before I knew it, I was flying through the pages like it was nothing! It's an incredibly fast read, but it will leave an impression deep within you. If you're learning about the Holocaust, or are interested in this time in history, then read this book! I recommend."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In Night, Elie Wiesel shows life in a Nazi concentration camp from a very personal perspective. This perspective gives the reader a special insight that the typical mundane fact-laden history book just can't give. This is probably about as close as you can get to having an idea of what concentration camp life (there's an oxymoron for you) was like without having to actually go through it yourself."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book takes us through the experiences of a young boy of fifteen during one of the most horrific and inhuman times in history: the Holocaust. Night follows the story of Elie Weisel as he fights to survive during the imprisonment of the jews in WWII germany. Night graphicly describes the torment and deaths of various people, innocent and guilt-ridden during the imprisonment of the jews, and therefore, I would not reccomend this to younger readers. I would however, highly reccomend this book to other, older readers. Night is, in my oppinion, a stunning journey into one man,s pshyche. A modern day epic, and a tale that will both haunt, you and leave you in awe at just how powerful it is. Elie Weisel has blended the best elements of literature and his own personal experiences to create a book which will, undeniably, have a profound effect on you, and leave you forever changed."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a good book if you are interested to learn more about life in concentration camps under the Nazis. Elie Wiesel gave a thorough account if his life in concentration camp with his father and how the survived the &quot;selection&quot; process - whereby, unfit, invalid, incapable men were chosen to be exterminated. It is very startling as how such cruelty, evilness can exist in this world. Which was why, the author lost his faith in God as he could not believe that God allowed such things to happen to him and his family. The book did not say whether he regain his trust in God but I wish he would.It is important now for us, and our future generation to learn about this &quot;nightmare&quot; and for us to never repeat this tragedy ever.This is a short book but the memory will last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I recieved this book to read for English class I thought that I would be able to read it easily in one night. I was shocked to find out that I had to move inch by inch, line by line through this stark account to even attempt to comprehend the experiences of this young boy. In sparse, savage prose Elie Wiesel tears out your heart and you watch your idealism about the human race burn in the blood-stained atmosphere of the death camps. If you want to understand life and human nature, read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Death, the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about the Holocaust. Night is a very descriptive autobiography about a fifteen-year-old boy and his father who are taken to a concentration camp in 1943, where they saw death and hatred produced from a single man who was convinced that wiping out a single race was the answer to the world's problems. In the book the author, Elie Weisel, creates a vivid description of the town that he grows up in. Describing sights, sounds, and develops the characters in the book gracefully. In describing himself Weisel gives a good description of his interests in Judaism and how he involves his religion in every day life. Here is a good description of how he describes his father and the town's outlook upon him: \\"My father was a cultured, rather unsentimental man. There was never any display of emotion, even at home. He was more concerned with others than his own family. The Jewish community in Sighet held him in the greatest esteem. They often used to consult him about public matters and private ones.\\" Throughout the book he gives these types of descriptive explanations of important characters, places, and things. The Holocaust, easy to say, hard to consume. The topic of the book is a hard one and is at some parts vividly described. But because he was unaware of most of the horrors that went on behind the curtain he does not get into details. Many of the things that were done to the Jews the prisoners did not know about. The book is well paced and clearly explained. But because of their experiences and the pace at which they happened some things do move quickly. Vocabulary wise it's easy to read and you won't be reading over and over. The world's problems were thought to be fixed by wiping out a race. And forged by hatred concentration camps and human cattle cars were made and Elie Weisel and his family were taken to a place of pain and suffering, where men were not men but savages filled with hatred and anger."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book takes the reader on a fascinating and heartbreaking journey from the safety of the author's childhood home where rumors circulated of horrific death camps (and were dismissed as rantings of a madman) to the camps themselves and the fight for survival under the most extreme circumstances. The book is short but extremely powerful and has a profound affect on the reader long after the book is finished."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's memoir of his trip through Auschwitz as a young teenager is an incredibly gripping, emotional read that gets at the blackness of the Holocaust. It is a short book, (109 pages) but one must wonder if one could read much more before being forced to put it down. It is Elie's personal story, but resonates with the testimony of what hundreds, thousands of Jews were forced to go through. A must read for anyone seeking an insight into the heart of darkness and its effects on man."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was an excellent one and one of the best I have read all year. Wiesel uses simple language and sentece structure, making this story even more moving. He just comes out and says what many go in circles trying to express.When Mrs. Monguillon, my English teacher, gave us this book, I looked at the title and thickness and thought, &quot;Oh great, a children's book!&quot; Boy, was I in for a surprise!I heard that Elie did actually met one of his sisters again after the war. If he did, that's great. I think I will check out some more of Elie Wiesel's books!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"i thought this was an excellent book and I would really encourage that everybody read it. it inspired me and now i look atlife in a different way. i dont know what Elie went through and i have know idea how it must of felt but im sure that it was probably a living hell."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was very heart warming but at the same time cruel and unusual. It taught me the meaning of love in a way I didn't think was possible. It told a story of a boy and his father and how they struggled to live together through impossible odds. Overall I thought the book was exellent."},{"Title":"Night","review":"POWERFUL book about the author's experiences in various concentration camps during WW2. Very descriptive, graphic, tells all about the horrific treatment he, his father and many others endured. What surprised me most about this book is the human qualities of denial (in the beginning), and optimism (throughout imprisonment) these people had, and strong faith, such as debating about whether to fast on holy days, since they are literally starving to death on the few morsals they are given. Night will have an effect on your life, the images the author describes are hard to erase. Made a BIGGER IMPRESSION than DIARY OF ANNE FRANK and SCHINDLER'S LIST. READ NIGHT!!!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was an entertaining book. It was very easy, short reading that I would recommend to everyone. The feelings put in this book gave me more of an understanding on the Holocaust. This nonfiction book kept my attention from beginning to end. This graphic book should be read among all generations."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a very good book. It held my attention and the fact that it was non-fiction made it even more captivating. It gives great detail about the holocaust and brings you a step closer to the expirience. This is a living account of what took place. It has a strong plot with a very good resolution. I liked the ending and the way it resolves. I recomend this book to anyone studying the holocaust or just wanting a good book to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book had its good points and its bad points. The novel was very informative, however it was depressing. The book told of the true hatred the Nazi party had for the Jews. They were treated as less than animals, beaten, starved, and slaughtered. Unless they were able to work, they were left for dead. The novel, Night expresses the tragedy and real life horror that the Jews experienced."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a very touching book. He held ones attention up until the end. Elie gave you a realistic feeling of how it must have felt to be in the scariest place ever. He stayed strong and gave hope when hope could not be found. He made it easy to read and not so gross that we all became sick when we read it.The only part of the book I would do over would be the ending. I did not feel it gave out as much feeling and depth as the rest of the book. It left the reader hanging because you just do not know what happened next. The rest of the book told you where he was at and how he felt and the end did not. It made the book incomplete."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting how he told his story about what he went through. Even though it was about the past, it kept my attention. Reading books about history through someone who lived through it made it more interesting. I would of rather read this book then sat through a history class and not know what these people went through emotionally. I would of gave this book four stars but the ending disapointed me. I felt like there should of been more. The ending of the book should of been the climax. You finally figure out he survives but I wanted to know what happened after he looked in the mirror at himself. I recommend this book to anyone because all types of people I think would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"my thoughts on night are that the book was an extremely, sometimes painfully realistic story depicting the Holocaust. i felt that the book was very well written with a clear explanation of the truth about what really happened. i believe that this book is completely deserving of any praises it has recieved. This book was not only informative, but it also evoked dorment emotions and compasion out of anyone who reads it. Anyone who reads this book can only be bettered by it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" was a scary and real story of how it really was in the concentration camps. Before reading this book, I had no clue that the conditions at the camps were as bad as they were. Elie Wiesel gave a frightening and yet touching account of his experiences during the Jewish holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a good book. It had a good plot to it and it really got the emphasis of what really went on during Holocaust and World War 2. I think it went into great detail about what the Jews had to go through and how the Germans treated them. I think it was a good book for students to read. It was a true story and it taught us about the history of the Holocaust. Elie, also, relayed his emotions to his readers and really got the reader consumed in his life story. It was a sad, yet extremely good story to read. I'm glad I got the chance to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found the book Night was a very interesting book to read. I did not know much about what happened during the Holocaust, but this book allowed me to gain knowledge about this sad time. It was very upsetting to read about the things that the Jews experienced. The Jews did nothing to deserve what they went through, but unfortunately they were forced to do whatever the Germans wanted. Even though I read about the terrible things that the Jews went through, I will never have to experience anything of that sort. I think this book is a great choice for students to read because it allows them to learn about an important event in history."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a good book with very good facts about the Jewish Holocaust. However,it was not boring to were you felt like you were reading a page out of the encyclopedia. It kept you wanting to read and see what was going to happen to the author. Also, a reason it was a type of book i like to read is because it was not long and drawn out. they didnt leave out information but didnt just add in little bits to make it longer. If you dont have the time to sit and read a book you should not start this one because it is one that once you pick it up it is hard to be put down."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found this book to be extremely interesting and gave great insight to a subject that is often overlooked. The book has amazing details that are so vivid and so real. The book puts a whole new perspective on the entire events that took place. I really enjoyed the book and there is really nothing that I would change. Elie Wiesel did an outstanding job of truly capturing the events that occured. I think Wiesel's purpose of writing the book, to inform people that the Holocaust was real, was accomplished. Many parts from the book stick out in my mind, but not one particular. The thing that sticks out most in my mind would have to be the loss of their loved ones and the emotions and feelings they had throughout."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the story of the book. It put the Holocaust into perspective a little bit, and really made you think about the suffering that the Jews went through during World War II. There are also things about the book that I did not particularly like. I dislike how his dad died at the end, after all of that suffering he didn't even survive; I was perturbed. I would change nothing about the book. The book is a true story, he is telling the facts. When you start lying, the book becomes fiction. Elie wrote and published the book so that people would have an idea of what kind of suffering was happening to innocent people during WWII. And to make some money i'm sure. The most memorable part is probably the end when he said he looked at himself in the mirror for the first time since the ghetto, that kind of stuck with me because I look in the mirror everyday and I would find it very odd to not look at myself for years. It would be like meeting a new person, and at the same time it would be one of the most frightening things to see as well."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really liked reading this book. The book was written well. You were always interested in what was going on and wondering what was going to happen next. I didn't like reading in detail about the awfull things that were done to the Jews. However, the book wouldn't be the same without the details that were included.The book is very informative about all of the things the Germans did during the Holocaust. I think that it is important for people to be aware of of botht the good and bad things that happened in history. I can't really think of much that i would change about the book. However, I would have liked for the bool to have some pictures and maybe talk some about what happened when the Holocaust was over."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book, Night. The book was interesting from beginning to end, and it kept me in suspense. The detail of the book was astounding. There wasn't much about the book that i didn't like about Night. The book was very well written so there is truly nothing I would change about it. Elie wrote this book so he could tell his of his experiences during the Holocaust and to straighten the mindset of those with false stories. The most memorable part of the book for me was when a boy had to push his living father into the furnace where bodies were cremated."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the book Night because it gave great detail about what happened during the Holocaust from someone's point of view that actually experienced it firsthand. The only thing I disliked about the book was that there were some things that may have seemed a little outstretched. I wouldn't change anything about the book though. Elie's main purpose for writing this book was to teach people about what he experienced, and also there are people that do not believe the Holocaust ever happened, so he tried to prove a point that it really did happen.The part of the book I remember the best is the part where they hung the boy and ahd to look in his eyes."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked how the book was an autobiography about the Holocaust. When you read the book, you really begin to understand what actually happened in the concentration camps. I did not like how all of the people were treated and killed for no reason, but that had to stay in the book because its true that those things really happened. I thought the book was well-written and I wouldn't change a thing about it. Elie's purpose for publishing this book is to make people all around the world aware of what really happened at the concentration camps. Many people do not understand the magnitude of what happened and how many lives were lost. My most memorable part in the book was when they used a rusty spoon to dig out gold crowns. -Nick Shaw"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Eddie FiscusI liked the way they described the graphic details, because it gives you a sense of what went on there. I did not like that his dad made it all that time just to die right before they were liberated. I would probably leave it the way it was. I think Elie published this book so people could have a better understanding of what happened at these concentration camps. The part I remember the most is when the little boy is hung but he does not die right away."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked this book because it shows the reality of violence and hate and how it affects people. There was nothing in this book that I really disliked, or anything that I would change. Elie's purpose for writing this book is to tell the world his story from the Holocaust, and open people's to the suffering that went on. The most memorable part for me was when Elie's father died, and because of all the pain he went through he had no more tears to cry. This is an excellent book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked how Elie Wiesel told his true life story in his own book. I didn't like his story as much compared to what I saw in the movie Schindler's List. This book just wasn't as interesting as the movie. I wouldn't change anything about this book considering Elie actually lived through this. It's his story. Elie's purpose for publishing this book is to prove how horrible the holocaust really was. My most memorable part of Night was when Elie's father died. Elie did not cry. He had no more tears."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I enjoyed this book because it really kept my interest the entire time. I'm really not much of a reader, but this book was well written and it really put you in the narrators shoes and kept my nose right in the book.I liked the book because it kept my attention. It wasn't action packed but it really was very graphic and painted quite a picture in my head of the holocaust.There really wasn't anything i didn't like about this book exept the fact that it was really sad.I couldn't say I would change any thing from this book, I couldn't do better myself.I think the purpose for Elie writing this book is to share his story and let people khow how it was for the Jews in Europe and what they had to go through.The part I will remember the most is the boy who got hung and didn't die right away and everyone had to look him in the face. Overall, this was quite a good, but very sad book"},{"Title":"Night","review":"My thoughts on the book are wow, it had so many realistic parts in it. Its very sad to hear all these horable things that happen to the Jews. And it all started with a sick individual that was prejudice against Jewish people. But if I was writting this book I would of added some pitures to make it more realistic. But that is if I was writting this festive book. But other than that I would suggest this book to others"},{"Title":"Night","review":"When you read this book, you end up loving it for all the wrong reasons. In the end, you'll hate it for all the right ones.Take your time with this one and try to absorb it all.My heart goes out to any and all who had to go through that hateful period of human history."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book &quot;Night&quot; was a good book. It was good because its a true story and the author knew what to write about, because he was there. I liked the ways the author used his words. he used a lot details and descriptions. I also thought thse book was sad because there was a lot of pains suffering. the book taught a lot of stuff I didn't know."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a horrible action that took place in History. To think that this is only a glimpse to what happens, make me sick, but the book is well written, and very easy to imagine what is occuring. I think this is a great book to read, especially for people interested in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book is quick to read and gets to the point, but at the same time it is very touching. After reading it you will be pondering about his experience at the concentration camp and the death march for days. A book you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"Night","review":"night is a horrible book to read. i don't mean horrible in a way that is not good to read, i mean its not suitable for everyone like people who do not like reading about murder and mistreatment about human life. Elie wrote noght to show us how the Jews were mistreated by the german soldiers."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a really great book to read. I've read it twice and I would love to read it again. (Now I'm doing a report on it)The first time I read it made me cry. Reading his book made me feel like I was there, witnessing everything. And I wished I was there to help on whatever. So, if you like to read a lot, or you're interested in the Holocaust, you should read this book. You just learn a lot from this book and what you learn from this book, you'll never forget it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A good read-- Mr. Wiesel has you there beside him as he goes through a virtual hell on earth. It gives a &quot;bit&quot; of what it must have been like then."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In this powerful book the author, Elie Wiesel takes you through his survival of one of histories most horrific events, the Holocaust. He brings to life many of the unthinkable actions of Nazi Germany. In this, he uses such vivid imagery that he makes you feel as if you were right there beside him experiencing it for yourself. This is the most incredible book I have ever read, and it has inspired me to learn more about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel Night is more-or-less an autobiography of Wiesel's horrifying experience in a Nazi concentration camp. The book deals with the unbelievable sense of guilt that a young boy feels after surviving the camp when the rest of his family did not. It also deals with the Wiesels loss of faith after being abandond by a God that he trusted in."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a good book to understand what someone went though during the Holocaust. It told facts that really happened. I think the people went though lots of pain."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Ellie Wiesel presents an autobiography which tells a story in graphic horrifying details on how it was during the holocaust. The book gives a deep understanding of how terrifying it was at each camp the Eiesel went to. The book shows how fragile life really is, and how things all around us could be taken away.This book conveys knowledge of what really went on in the concentration camps. Everyone will get take away much from this powerful book. &quot;Night&quot; makes one really think that when times get hard, they can always get harder."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I throughly enjoyed Night. I appericate the fact that not all Holocaust victims are cheerful and happy they were left to live. He shows how such a horrible thing can affect us all. Elise Wiesel is a very brave man to write such personal thoughts and angers to the public. The book itself is well written, surprisingly so, since it was an autobiography and I doubt he thought he was going to be a writer when he was young. I recommend this book, but be warned, it isn't flowery at all. And Mr.Wiesel makes no attempt to hide just how bad it affected him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I can't say enough about this book. I read this book when I was in 7th grade and believe it or not, it helped me through high school and now into the real world. I have relized that the human spirit is fragile and priceless..I respect all of my fellow man."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was so good I could not put it down. Elie Wiesel, in a very thought provoking and emotional book, portrays his experiences in a Nazi concentration camp. His separation from his family and suffering he endures calls for sympathy, and at times tears."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am an 8th grader from Pennsylvania and we are required to read this book for our Language class. This book really touchs your heart and opens your mind to what the Nazi's did to those poor people. It is just terrible that human beings could do that to other humans. I think everyone should read this book. Elie did a great job of writing this book about murder and the will to survive!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Amazing book. I felt as though I was in the holocaust. At first when my teachers assingned the book to us i loathed it. Now i am reading it the 3rd time!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'm in 8th grade and our teachers wanted us to read this book to get the feel of how the holocaust was. I think some of the book is really sad but overall it was very good!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is the most amazing, captivating book I have EVER read. I have read it countless times, since seventh grade when I first studied the Holocaust in school. Since that time I have read the book three other times, for classes in high school and college. I have also read the book by my own choice many other times. I do believe that this book should be required for any and all high school students. Once you finish reading this book, you will never look at life, the human race or history in the same light again. I recommend this book the most for those people who claim that the Holocaust never happened. This book will change your mind."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is my favorite book. I read this in my senior year and it was excellent. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is very well written."},{"Title":"Night","review":"One of the more influential books in my lifetime.Combine this book with books by Richard L. Rubenstein and the question of who God is becomes all the more perplexing and frightening."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie is an extraordinary writer. HIghly recommend"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that the book was good in showing how the Jews had to go through a lot but they should have said more stuff about people in the book after they left the camps."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The process of reading \\"Night\\" was almost difficult. It is a document of the world's history that we need not forget, but it a very sad part of history and hope is a rarity of such documents. I thought that the book was written very honestly and simply. I don't think I can say I \\"enjoyed\\" it, but I am glad I read it. The ending was a bit anti-climatic and I would have liked to feel a bit more resolved. Many people do not understand the serverity of the Holocaust and by publishing \\"Night\\" Wiesel had his say in those dark times during World War II. The last line of the book, as unresolved as it may be, is quite memorable. I can not do justice to line without quoting it, however, I do not have a book with me. But it has to do with Elie looking in the mirror for the first time after being in the concentration camps and the face in the mirror seemed to be a stranger to him. Elie said that he would never forget that look on the stranger's face."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This testimony and witness to human suffering transcends discussion or commentary. This book is a wonderful introduction into Elie Wiesel's body of work. He is a truly remarkable survivor, witness, author and activist."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that the book was very interesting.I also thought that the book tryed to put you right in the action so you would realy get a fill for it and under stand what he realy had to go throw. There's one more thing I would like to say is that the book night is one book that you'll read and won't forget. so if you haven't had the plesure to read it then you better go get your self a copy today"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read some preliminary reviews of this book, and I disagree with these reviews. I was not impressed with this book at all. I have read many many books on the subject of the Holocaust, including some by eyewitnesses and survivors, and I have to say that this is the first time I would not recommend a particular book on this subject. The narrator did not hold my attention at all, I found myself skipping pages, looking for more substance. I finished reading it, and frankly, I found it lacking in historic and personal meaning. Excellent authors on the subject of the Holocaust are Simon Wiesenthal and William Styron (Sophie's Choice)."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recommend this book to mature teens who will take this book very seriousely. The book was very graphic yet descriptive. The book is very complex so everytime you read it you understand more. over all it was excellent"},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHTElie Wiesel wrote this book in 1986 and won the noble peace prize. This book was very sad for Elie to write. It was sad because Elie was in the Holocaust. In this essay I will explain what went on in the Holocaust.In the story a boy and his family get taken away to the ghetto. His mother and sisters get separated from him and his father. His mother and younger sister where cremated. The older sisters got sent to a camp.After the men got separated from the women they got rid of the men that where too old and too young to work (they got cremated). Then they went to the concentration camp called bunah. The Germans where very brutal. They shot anybody that stepped out of line. Many people died and some went crazy and stopped trying. Will they ever get out of the camp alive?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Babeys hetting burned to death. Thrown into the flames of the fire filled trenches. There is a lot of different things and horrible things that happened to the Jews. The things they had to ho through. Being killed, scared, and having no hope and even worse. Wht and how the germans ded this . This is what the Night explained.The main chaaracters name ws Eli a 15 year old boy. I'm almost 16 so I could relate what a shock he went through. He explained every detail that what went on and how every day went. All the tradgys he witnessed and experienced made me want to close the book, but I kept reading. This is the book taht mades you think how lucky the Jews are today.I liked this book in a way and then in another way I didnt. Just the way people were killed for the dumbest reasons. It lefted me up set and not happy . I wasnt lide I ever thought it was like. It was unfair and cuel. Im still left in the \\"why\\" stage because why the jews. Hardheaded fules.In the way I lide it was how they never gave up. There were times that he acted as thaough he was hoing to give up , but something made him keep going. I know if that where me I wouldnt of had the sterength to ho on. I would have fell and just laid and let them kell me . But the courage and strength they had , impressed me much.The bood suprised, impressed ,and even upset me throughtout the whole tragedy. The things they did. The way they lived throug the whoe thing and the guts they were determined the to stop. Burning children I would never except. That is the worst thing in the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel is a very talented writer. He relays his experiences in the concentration camps in great detail. I was captivated by the story, and was moved to tears. This is a wonderful book, and should be read by anyone and everyone who has any interest in learning of the horrible unjustives done to the Jewish population. I highly reccommend it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought this book was a very inspiring book. Elie though the whole thing all ways thought positive. His courage really surpised me. Because I don't think I would of been able to be that strong though that horrible experience he went though. Although it was very sad in parts I though it was a VERY GOOD BOOK! I think everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was great. There is only a few books you have to read in your life and this is one of them. It is very sad at times. You learn how a father and a son value each other. They look after each other in my opinon that what makes this book so good."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was interesting, but they could have done without some of the parts. I thought it was neat how they ended the book. It didn't put to much closure to it, but it put some. I don't like how the book started though it was slow and at the same time boring, however I liked how they explained everything."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that this book was very boring. I think that it had to much gorry illistrations and that it was not approiate for my eyes. The book it's self was a ok book but it rambled on about nothing at times. thankyou"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I didn't really like the book too much. One part of the book that I really liked was the way it was written. The way he (Ellie) told the story of his life. The only thing that could have been was the end, I think his dad should have lived or he should have saved him by getting him some water."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was interesting because it had a lot of action and told about what the boy and his father had to go through. It explains how the boy and his father stayed together through thick and thin. It talked about, how strength is what gets you through life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked it because it talked a lot about the holocaust which I didn't know very much about. The things they did were pretty bad. They treated the people like animals. The author gave good details about what was happening through out the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that this book was very good. Other than the start of the book, it held my interest thruoghout the book. The book was interesting and at the same time sickening. It was awful to find out everything that the Germans did to the Jews. Some of the camps they were sent too werent that bad, but when Hitler found out that the camp was being to humane he would have the guy that was the head of the camp killed. Then the camps that were descent would become inhumane and the Jews would get hardly any food, and would get beaten all of the time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was pretty good corcerning all the death and despare. I thought that Elieand his father were going to die in the beggining. I think the Germans should have gave them more than bread, coffee, and soup. Overall the book was pretty good. In the end it all tirned out for Elie except for his father, mother and his siblings died."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked this book quite a bit. It was fun to read. I learned a lot about the camps that they made Jews go to. I didn't like how people got treated back then, why would someone torture someone else of the same race as much as Hitler did. I would change as much as I could but back then I couldn't really do a thing, or else I would have been killed for not listening. Elie wanted people to know what happened in these camps and he wanted people to know what type of torture Jews had to go through. The part that I most remember about is when Elie was whipped over a box because he found the guard and the little girl in the ware house, what they went through was terrible but over all I&#65533;m glad Elie survived to write this book, I very much liked it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really liked the way that Elie used his child eyes to write this book. It showed the times and trials of children of the Holocaust. The things I did not like about the book are not really what I did not like, they are things that are impossible to imagine any human going through. The book was very gory and described in detail every incident. Since this is a true story I would not change anyhing, everyone should know how terrible tyrants can be, and what goes on in our world that we think cannot happen. In my opinion, Elie's purpose for publishing this book was to educate everyone about the terrors of the Holocaust. How strong the human spirit is, and how far the will to live extends. My most memorable part of the book was when Elie's father died. This was a very emotional time and Elie was ready for it to come, he wanted his father to move on to a better place, and Elie had no tears left."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the detailing and the real experiences in this book. I like how factual everything was even though it made me realize how horrid the Holocaust really was. It took hearing one person's real life experience to make me realize how much bad stuff really happened. I disliked the truth in a way I guess. I didn't like the fact that what I was reading was true. It was a well written book but such a sad story. I wouldn't change anything about this book.I think Elie's purpose for writing this book was to educate everyone about the Holocaust. I think he wanted people to know the true experiences of the Jews. The most memorable part of the book for me was when Elie's father died, and Elie didn't cry. It really made me sad for him. It's not that his father's death didn't make him want to cry, but that he had no tears left to cry for him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the way the book was written. Elie told his personal story making it all very real and intriguing. It was easy to read and the story kept my attention. Elie used details to keep the readers interested. Everybody knows something about the Holocaust, but to read a personal story with all the discription that Elie used pulls at the readers emotions and makes it all the more real. There really wasn't much I disliked about the book. And I definately wouldn't change anything about it, because it was written the way Elie saw things, and you can't change the way someone feels about something. I think Elie published this book to help people understand the Holocaust. I never really understood how much these people went throught until I read his book. The thing I will remember most about this book isn't really a certain part of the book, but just in general how unhuman these people were treated. No human being should ever be treated the way they were, they were treated worse than animals. I really can't even imagine the kind of person that could have no feelings or emotions to be able to treat a person so awful. \\"Night\\" was a good book that everyone should read to try and come closer to an understanding of what the Jews endured."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was one of the best books I have read. I enjoyed reading about the Holocaust. The book was very descriptive and it painted a mental picture in my mind. As I was reading the book, I felt like i was right there by Ellie. It was horrifying to read some the the things that went on during the Holocaust,but I was very interested in knowing what when on. I liked learning of Ellie's many struggles between life and death. I felt like i was right there struggling for life with Ellie. This true account of the Holocaust was very interesting and definetly left me wanting to read more. I don't think I would change anything in the book. If anything I think I would of elaborated more on the book, and told of anything that happened after the liberation. The writer made the book very interesting, and i would be delighted to read any other books by Ellie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was an okay book. There were many things I liked about the book. One was when Elie just always wanted to be with her dad and really never wanted to leave him. I thought that was good because it showed that family came first and that is how is should always be. Another one was all of the gory content in the book which made the book get interested and made me want to continue to read it.Things I disliked about the book weren't really the books fault. I didn't really enjoy hearing the many rude and crude things the Nazi people did. They could have been a little nice to them and gave them some fried chicken from KFC every now and then or something like that.If I had to change anything I would have wanted Elie's dad to live or for Elie to find his mom and sister. I just wish it would have been a little happy ending with all the family meeting up and giving hugs and kisses.I think Elie's purpose for publishing the book is to give everybody a little feel for what happened to all the Jews during Holocaust. Also, all of these people are trying to say that the Holocaust didn't ever really happen. Elie is just trying to give everybody a feel for what did happen and give some facts and stories about living the life of a Jewish prisoner.The most memorable part for me was when Elie's father passed away and Elie couldn't even cry because he didn't have any tears left. That just shows how bad Holocaust really was. I think many things could have changed if everything went as planned, but the fact that there weren't any tears left just shows something about how bad the Holocaust really was."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK MORE THAN OEDIPUS. WHEN READING THIS BOOK I REALLY FELT SORRY FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE HOLOCAUST. THE AUTHOR WAS REALLY GOOD AT DESCRIBING THE EVENTS THAT HAD TO GO THRU AND THINGS THEY SURVIVED. THE MOST MEMORABLE PART FOR ME WAS WHEN THEY WERE ALL STUFFED INTO THE BARRACKS AND ELIE HAD TO CLAW AND SCRAP HIS WAY TO THE TOP TO GET SOME FRESH AIR. I THINK ELIES PURPOSE FOR PUBLISHING THIS BOOK IS TO EDUCATED OTHERS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND TO HELP PROVE THAT THE HOLOCAUST DID HAPPEN AND IS NOT A MYTH. I HATED THE BEGINING OF THE BOOK. IT WENT BY SLOW AND WAS VERY BORING. I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WAS TRYING TO GIVE BACKGROUND LEADING UP TO WHAT THE BOOK WAS MAINLY ABOUT, BUT IT REALLY DULLED THE BOOK DOWN IN THE BEGINNING. SO I WOULD DEFINITELY CHANGE THE WAY THE BOOK WAS WRITTEN IN THE BEGINNING. MAYBE SHORTEN IT UP A LITTLE BIT OR DOWNSIZE IT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE! IT WAS WORTH IT...THE BEGINING DOES GO BY SLOW BUT IF YOU CAN MAKE IT THRU IT THEN YOU'LL BE IN FOR A GREAT READING EXPERIENCE!!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a very interesting book. I like how it is a true story told through someone who was actually there and experienced the whole thing. I didn't like the graphic parts, but I feel they were necessary to get the point across. I wish he would have said more about his mother and sisters, because you never find out if he was ever reunited with them or if they didn't make it out. I think Elie wrote this book to prove to people that there really was a Holokaust and that it wasn't just something that was made up. My most memorable moment of the book was when the little boy was hanged. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to have to see that. You would get use to seeing the thousands of deaths, but watching one young child die slowly would just be too much."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked this book, because it was a true story of one's experience as a Jew during WWII, unlike the other silly books I have read in English during my high school career. Before I read the book I had high expectations, because of what I had heard; it was good, but it didn't meet the expectations I had. That's the only thing I didn't like about it. I wouldn't really change anything since it is a man's real life experiences. Elie's purpose for writing the book, is too inform others of what is was really like in concentration camps, etc. The most memorable part for me was just hearing of all the struggle's Elie made it through. Another memorable part was the part about the young boy that was hanged."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked how the book gave detail on what happen at the concentration camps. I didn't like that the book didn't have more things about what happen to people that died in the book. There is nothing i would really change in this book. His purpose for writing the book is to prove to people that the Holocaust really did happen. The most memorable part is when Elie was freed at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A wonderful novel, this epic is an important read for everyone ready to handle this sort of topic."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night was a very good novel. It relly goes into detail about what the Jewish people had to go through during that time period.I would recommend this novel to people beause not only is it a interesting book you also learn about what these people went through to survive. Not only do you learn about their lifestyle , you learn about the pain these people were put through everyday."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's book Night is amazing.Everything in this book will make you think and sympathize for the millions of people who went through all of this.When reading this book you will not believe that this is hisortical nonfiction and this happened to real people. Elie, a young Jewish boy is growing up in a society filled with hatred; who is trying to survive in a concentration camp. As him and his father are fighting to live they have to go without food, see untolerable acts done onto their people, and witness dying everyday. Elie is doing everything to stay with his dad to keep the only part of their family together now. Elie's character is strong and makes you wish that their was something you could do to help this little boy going through these horrible things. The language is strong and powerful and keeps all your attention focused on the book. Anyone will have their attention locked on the intense parts in this book.The writing style will keep your attention let alone the little boys courage to survive.You will learn alot of life lessons in the book and once you read this book you will never forget it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I like the book because it tells us what kind of a man that hitler was and how the jews had to live for 6 years. The jews didn't needed to be treated like that because they were humans just like everyone else. Hitler was a cruel and sick man for his doings. This is a book that everyone should read. The part that i remember the most is when IDEK moved all the jews out of the warehouse so he could have sex with a girl."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The thing I liked about the book the most, was the way Elie brought the Holacaust to life. It was like you were actually there. I thought it was very well said and told. Their wasn't much I disliked about the book, overall it was very good, however the ending could of been better. The main thing I would change about the whole book would be the ending. I didn't approve of how the father just died and how Elie and his father's relationship was when he passed. I would say Elie's purpose for publishing the book would be to let people know that weren't around at the time or who did not have to go through the camp, actually how it felt, their feelings, thoughts, pain and suffering and to visialize what was going on with Elie's situation. My most memorable part in the book Night, was towards the beginning of the book when Elie and his family were forced out of their house and each family memeber(boy and girl) were separated. Just thinking about being seperated from any of my family would terrify me, I can't imagine how Elie, his sister and parents felt."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Book night by Elie Wiesel is very powerful. I liked how it really gave a true around about his life being a Jew during the Second World War. You can really feel emotion from reading his accounts while he was living in a Concentration camp. What I did not like about the book, it was very short, it could of given more detail to his accounts. The details it does give are a lot of times important of the issue. If I would change the book in anyway, I would give more detail on how he felt on a daily basis. The book would be longer giving a lot more detail on how things look, felt, and his full emotions.I think Elie published this book to let people know about the horrible thing called the Holocaust really was. Just an innocent little boy was put through something so hellish, more people could never imagine.My most memorable part of the book was when they were riding on the cattle trains to the death camp. People had no idea what was to come. The women screaming out the fire! She knew it what was to come.Over all, it's not a bad book. Before you read it, be ready for true accounts of this horrible time in World history and set your emotions."},{"Title":"Night","review":"1.The book was interesting.It made me realize how badly they were treated.2.I didn't dislike anything.The book was very detailed.3.I wouldn't change anything about it.It was a great book.4.To let people know what happened.To show people it really happened.5.My most memorable part was when Juliek was being hung.It was a horable thing to make the Jews walk by and look him in the eye."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was very informative and realistic to what had happened during the Holocaust.What I did not like about the book was that it was way to short and I wanted to read more on that subject.If I were to write the book I would of made it longer.I think that Elie's purpose for writing the book was to inform the public on what went on, as far as the abuse and killing that the Germans did.My most memorable part of the book was when they were first at the camp and he and his father were seperated from his mother and sister and he said that was the last time I would've ever seen them that was very sad to me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"the thing i that i like about this book is that it is told form a person that was really their, and that all of these things that happen is true.the thing that i dislike about this book is that all of the people that died in this book, how his dad died in front of him, some of the words in this book was german and we did not know what it ment.i would not change anything.to show people what really happen during this time period.that all these people died"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I liked how Elie Weisel was so descriptive with his true story about the Holocaust. This book gave me a realistic image of what the Jews went through in their struggle for survival. This book changed my perspective on this cruel period in time.Elie dragged out some of the stories in this book. I understand he was trying to paint a mental picture in his readers heads but some parts were quit lengthy. There were parts that got a little boring.I would minimize some of his stories if it were up to me. The thing that really disturbed me was that he said he would sleep while he was running. I do not like that at all. There is no way that could happen.Elie was trying to let the public know that this awful event did indeed happen. He was letting everyone know what he lived through. I believe this book was some kind of tribute to those who lost their lives there.My most memorable part is when Elie was in the Hospital bed. It is amazing that he felt blessed to be laying there with those white sheets. He was more then happy to be in the hospital with a gimp foot because there was no role call. It really makes you think how bad it must have been."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was an okay book, and is more interesting than some others,but it can still put a person to sleep. The nice thing about it is that you can learn more about the Holocaust.

This was NOT a school required book. During my 8th grade year, my English teacher made us read The Diary of Anne Frank. He knew, I had already read it twice. So for extra credit, and totally of my own free will, I read this. Then, I had to write a paper comparing and contrasting both of these books. I really must say, that this was a much better book.Anne Frank was good for people who want to know what happened to people in hiding.Eliezer Weisel is good for people who want to know about what went on in the concentration camps.Anyone who believes that the Holocaust never happened... you've got another think coming. Open your eyes, ears, and heart, and listen to the stories.They are true!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book took me by total surprise. I had to read this book as an assignment in 10th grade. I thought, &quot;Yawn, another freakin' boring book..&quot; But, as always, I'd at least *try* to read the books she gave us, so.... I opened the book. First page, I was hooked. I've always had an interest in the Holocaust and I've read The Diary of Anne Frank, but I'd say Night tops that! It's a first-hand look at life in the concentration camps. Wiesel is SO descriptive. This book captures and captivates you. I was completely enthralled until the last page, where I heaved a huge sigh of... of... relief?? Of dispair?? I'm not sure. I just know I wanted to know more. And more. And more. And you know history has a tendency to repeat itself, so I suggest you pick this one up before &quot;Night&quot; falls again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book tells you about all the horrible thing that the Jews went through in the war.

Leaves you with some images that will stay with you after you have finished the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Why is it that most of the poorly rated reviews seem to be written by illiterate people with the maturity level of a junior high student? Reading things like \\"I didn't like the part where they killed babies and burned people so I'm giving this book a 1\\" make me question why we read books in the first place. Obviously some books are written for entertainment purposes, but there are others whose purpose is to educate the reader; \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel is the latter. Yes, there are many things in this book that are unpleasant and horrible to read and think about but if that reaction is evoked then the book has fulfilled its purpose. If you are reading this of your own free will (not in a classroom) for entertainment and are disgusted by it, may I ask what you are doing reading a book that is clearly about the Holocaust. Books that deal with the bad side of human nature are just as important as those that deal with the good because they force us to think about these things and ingrain in us the belief that we as a society can never let these atrocities be committed again. This book does an outstanding job of that and I give it 5 stars.P.S. If you want your review to be taken seriously, at least use proper grammar and spelling and don't resort to saying things like \\"i don't like this book because it's stupid\\". Grow up. If you want to be perceived as being intelligent, present yourself and your opinions that way."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was forced to read this book in my sophomore english class, and I'm glad I was. Night is a very emotional book. It's based on a true story and is written by the man who experienced the Holocaust first hand. I was hooked on it. It explains the Holocaust from a teenager's experience. I would definately recommend this book to people who are interested in history and who like a real tear jerker."},{"Title":"Night","review":"i liked some parts of this book but others i could of done with out, also i did not really understand some tings in the book. i liked how the book was very detailed and the story it told. The book it self was really good, once you got passed the frist ten to fiften pages you get more in to and understand the book more.If you did not really want to read a book like this then those frist ten to fifteen pages would be really hard for you.there is also so hard fact in the book. Some of he books facts were a little hard to swollow, like all of the killing in the book of women and childern. In the book the would take the babys and thought them up aganced a wall to kill the faster. i would also did not like how the bured people. The end of the book was to plan for me i am not going to give it way but i wish it would of been more detailed and told what happened to him more after all of it. The things that i did not understant was all of the metafors in the book. Like when they hung a man and the Elie ( the main charitor) decribed soup acoreding to the soup. that just confused me. I recomened this book for all of the people who like to read this kind of stuff, but if you like me then you might want to pass one the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"We read 2 books for our book project in our English class in Sandy Spring Friends School. We compared Night and Friedrich by Hans Peter Richter. We tried to show how a book that was written by a survivor differed from a book written by someone else. Overall, we liked Night better than Friedrich because of it's genuine outlook, it was more realistic."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have to admit, before I'd read this book, my feelinga on the Holocaust were really pretty numb. I would hear about it year after yuear after year, but tune it out. After all horrible things happen to all kinds of people- why cry over all of it. Because it si important to understand the pain, so never to repeat it.I have heard this all the time- but never believed it- until I have read this. The first book to really break THROUGH my NUMBNESS- was this. I never doubted the Holocaust happened- but I really did not care about it. But this could have been me. I am not Jewish- or Christian, or German, or Hungarian. I am simply a young Asian-American living in New York. Eli Wiesel was very damaged by his experiences- and I really do not know how he could find the strength to write this book- and confront those painful memories AGAIN. (IF THE AUTHOR IS READING, I WANT HIM TO KNOW I TRULY ADMIRE THIS.)To relive all this pain- is something I am not sure I would have the strength to do. But I want everyone who never believed in a Holocaust to know that I understand them: THEY ARE SIMPLY GOOD, TRUSTING PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WANT TO BELIEVE SUCH HORROR, AND DEHUMANIZATION EVER HAPPENED. But it did- and does- AND NOTHING ANYONE SAYS CAN CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE. The sentance I think really broke the front was: '' The father and son lay side by side, in the boxcar with bits of bread scattered around. I was fifteen.'' It was the latter sentance that really helped me understand- because I am close to that age. I cannot imagine seeing such horrible things, or feeling the despair he felt. In contrast I read the book: The Hiding Place, by Corrie Ten Boom,who suffered, and yet managed to use the Lord Jesus as an intact power. Although I am a believer in Christ, I am not sure even He would be able to help me keep my humanity in the face of such absoloute evil. What is probably worse- is that a Holocause happened here in America- YES AMERICA- as well. The black people (not to mention any other non-whites) were segregated, and mistreated even AFTER THE HOLOCAUST. I read John Howard Griffin's ''Black like me'', and must say that both accounts of pain are startling. I think this book needs to be read- and commend the author for writing such an engrossing autobiography."},{"Title":"Night","review":"it was definitely a good book; very well written.im just not into hollocaust stuff... it was a horrible,terrifying event that caused pain and suffering to somany innocent people. it makes me sad and gives menightmares to think about it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read \\"Night\\" because my son was reading it, for school I think. With so much written now about the Holocaust, few remember that survivors didn't want to talk about their experience in the early years. Elie Wiesel waited a decade in silence, and then wrote \\"Night\\" for the wider public. It is short, terse, factual. A good and well-known introduction to the Holocaust. If you want to know what happened, as experienced by one average European Jewish teenager, start with Night. If you want to know how it could happen, though, you'll have to read much more, for example Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaustby Daniel Jonah Goldhagen."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I ordered a book for Christmas. I was kept updated on the progress. I really didn't understand media mail shipping and when I asked the seller, he didn't really explain it.

Enjoyed this book and shared it with others"},{"Title":"Night","review":"A true account of a teenager's experience in the horrors of concentration camps, Night is both vivid and apalling. Elie Weisel isn't very wordy, instead, he uses base imagery to describe the nightmare of the Holocaust. In the beginning of the book, the Jews cling to optimism, even after being forewarned by one of their own. But as the story progresses, Elie loses his hope, his faith, almost his will to live. Only th presence of his father keeps Elie fighting for life. The most remarkable thing about Night is the way it shows everyones' different reactions to the concentration camps. This book exposes raw human nature, when humans are forced to face a horrifying ordeal. Night, despite its depressing topic, is a book that's hard to put down."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Jewish family lived in a Jewish community in Sighet in Transylvania. Because they lived in Jewish praise, the Germans wanted to exterminate them. They were sent to Ghettos in their own towns. They were sent to concentration camps and had horrible commands or death. When they were sent to ghettos, they had goods taken away; and if they had a home on the outskirts of the ghetto, their windows were blocked up. The main family got to stay in their own home, and several others did too. However there were only two ghettos held in the town and several families had to share homes with others. They got moved to the last ghetto and then to a train. There were about 80 people on board a cart. They were sent to Auschwitz-a concentration camp. They separated families by women, young and old, and the weak. The main family goes like this: Hilda, the eldest, then Bea, Eliezer, and then Tzipora. Eliezer was the only male sibling of his family. He was 15 and lied to be 18 so that he wouldn't be creamed. His father was 50 and lied to be 40 for the same reason. They stayed together throughout the whole book. The men had to go through showers, new barracks, and running several times a day. There was an actual human with encouraging words, a young Pole in charge of block 17 at Auschwitz, he said \\"good night\\". They reached their new camp: Buna, the iron gate. They were sent to a warehouse for electrical equipment, the Kapo was actually a nice one, and allowed Eliezer and his father together. The American planes were bombing Buna, and every prisoner was happy, even if they did get bombed. Even though Eliezer's foot was pussed up and he was in the hospital, he managed to go on the journey to Gleiwitz to run from the Russians. Many had died, and in Gleiwitz another selection occurred. Then in a train of ten days and ten nights sent them to Buchenwald, his father's close death scared him. His father was still alive, but breaths were very shallow. He was struck with dysentery and died with the last words \\"Eliezer\\". The liberation happened on April 11th at six o' clock-the American's tank stood at the gates of Buchenwald. I think Eliezer had a very strong personality, he was told to stay standing up by a German officer and did exactly that. He was A-7713, and was known only by that when he received that by needle from the Veterans. He had his number added to a list because he had a gold crown on his tooth; any goods should be given over. But he managed to pull off something stealthy-being sick. Eliezer once wondered in the studies of cabbala, was a strong believer of God, cried when he prayed, and prayed for everything. By the beginning of the New Year, he did not believe in God, Yom Kippur, or in fasting. If he did fast it would be a quicker and swifter way to death. Elie Wiesel's book Night is one of many vile books ever written about the Holocaust. The tragedies and suffering the Jewish people endured during the Holocaust is unbelievable. I would definitely recommend this book. Eliezer Wiesel is the narrator and was really in the war. He lasted the whole thing, and gave great description of the war. Only because the bloody, horrific happenings that took place would never leave one's mind. If you don't want to know about how apprehensive life was in the 1940's, don't read this book; however, it would give you great knowledge of one mind of one different race."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book i read was Night by Elie Wiesel. Night is a horrifying book about the Nazi Death Camps and the Ghettos. It is hard to realize that this is a true story.The book is Non-Fiction and the events that happen in the book happened in to the author, Elie Wiesel. The author grimly describes how he and other prisoners were treated at the campsThis is one of the best books I have ever read. After reading it, i found myself wanting the book to be longer. I like it because the main character, Elie, never loses faith or stops thinking of his father."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I like the book Night because it is a great way to learn about the Holocaust. I have three reasons why I like this book.My first reason is that it explains a life of a child in the Holocaust. The author tells about his life in the concentration camps. He also tells you about the selections, where you are seportated by gender, age, occupation, and health.The second reason is they give an idea of how most people died in the Holocaust. Most of the people died in gas chambers, which looked just like showers. They also chould have bean shot, burned, or hanged.My third reason is the book states that in the begining most of the people did not belive that the Germans werenot going to do harm to the people in the ghetto.In conclusion, I would recommend this book because it teaches people about life in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I believe that Night is an O.K. book. It is not a good book, and it is not a bad book. The reason why I think the book is bad is because it talks about killing, shooting, hitting, and burning. It is also bad when it talks about people who were burned, and how they stunk in so much detail. It seems like someone was obsessed. I probably wouldn't have lived through the Holocaust. The book Night is good in my opinion because it does not lie about any facts. It talks about how the Jews starved to death, and how they were burned. It also talks about how the babies were thrown up in the air and used for targets by the Germans. The Germans should be put in place of the Jews so that the Germans would figure out that the Jews have feelings just like every other human being. I would recommend this book to people who wonder about the history of the Jews."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the book Night. This book was full of reality and what really happened during the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel never hid any of his troubles he had during this time like being whipped 25 times and when he would give up his rations and give them to his father or when he had to march for miles and miles to go to another concentration camp. Another reason I liked this book is because it helped me to picture what Auschwitz was like during the Holocaust. When thay were on the train riding to Auschiwtz I could picture how close together the people were and when Madame Schachter was screaming, &quot;Fire,fire,fire&quot;, and they shoved a cloth in her mouth and hit her. I could picture all of this happening. I would recommend this book to teenagers especially those who would like to know wat really happened during the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a very interesting book. I liked it because it was not only a part of our history, but it also is proof of the brutal things flesh and blood can do. The Jews in the book Night weren't treated like humans. They were stripped of all their valuable belongings and their clothes. To find out in the camps like Buna and Auschwitz, their remainings that they had left were stripped by the other prisoners. The Nazis didn't only treat the Jews like pigs but they also benefited from them as much as they could. Theybenefited from their work and the gold out of their mouths as well. Some of the ways they treated and took advantage of them wasn't right. For instance &quot;There are 80 of you in here if there is any missing you will all be shot like hogs.&quot;, words from a S.S. officer. There are somany things from Night that the Nazi's did to the Jews: The hangings, the disinfections, burnings, and the way they talked to them. Night was great but hard to follow with all the irony, foreshadowing, and use of words. I would recommend this book to all readers. It has a little of everything, all around it is a great book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the book. The book gave me a good idea of what happend during the haulacaoust.it also gave me a look into what the Jews were felling about there situation. I did not like all the irony in the book. It got very hard to follow. All the selectons got confusing. The part when the lady yelled about the fire. It told what was going to happen next. I did not like the gruesome facts. like when they threw the babes in the air and used them as mashine gun target practace. I liked most of the forshadowing in the book. Esppesily the part with motie beatle. Iliked the violence and grim truth about the tings the jews went thrue. Like the burning pits, and the hangings. I found it ironic that they turned right before they were going to go into the fire. In conclusion the book gave me a good overveiw of what happend during the halacaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My opinion of the Night was very different. I liked it because it was always kept me interested. when i started reading it I realy didn't think it was going to be very good. By the way our teacher gave us a summery of it, it really didn't sound very good to me. I am not good in history. When I heard that it was sort of about history I atomatically did not want to read it. But then after i started to read it, it became more interesting to me. So in a way i like ed it and in a way i did't . I only like it when there was action going on. Like when they had to get taken to the camps and get all there stuff taken away.In conclusion I would Not recomend this book for children. From my opinion it is only a book for adults. Not for kids."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book the night in my opinion was a good book. I liked it a lot. It was about a boy named Elie Wiesel. He was jewish and he lived in germany. About the time that Hitler was there. That means that he went to a lot of consontration camps. He did a good job i thought at explaning and teling about all of his expereances in the consontration camps. It sonds like he had a very hard life compared to ours. Some of the things that he told about where. When they had to go to the gheto and then he had to go to the first camp and ride on the train. and at the first camp he got split up from his mom but he got to stay with his dad with was good. Then they moved again to a different camp and there they had to work a lot. Also at that camp he lost his gold crown. Then in the winter the good guys were coming so they had to move camps by running in the night in the snow then in that camp his dad dies And he gets to live and be saved. I think that this book is good because it was interesting and had a lot of facts."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book moved me to tears. It was an eye opening account as to how the Holocaust affected even the youngest members of the Jewish community. It makes me sad to think that people had to endure such hardships just because of their religious beliefs. An interesting question brought up in my literature class was about his faith. How did it grow, or diminish as the time went on? This makes me think of my own beliefs, and if I would be willing to die for them. Even middle school children should read and understand this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's NIGHT, is an incredibly realistic account of the experience of the holocaust. Despite criticisms of its gruesome and realistic content, the deeply involved reader may find that the story is not about that at all. Wiesel portrayts the incredibly frightening and emotionally draining experience for what it was, and does not attempt to downplay the event with any sort of &quot;editorial sugar&quot;. his account is Raw and we see within Wiesel the human reaction and emotion that the Holocaust provoked in many. His experiences changed him as a person for the rest of his life, and Wiesel allows us to witness this change, and let it change us as well. It is a well written memoir. Wiesel should not only consider himself the &quot;messenger&quot; who retells the event, but a messenger who also lets us in on the personal side and teaches us all a lesson about fatih, fear, strength, and humanity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is NOT a novel as Amazon implies. This is a true account of the life of Elie Weisel in the concentration camps. Weisel waited ten years to write it because he thought nobody would believe his account. See the excellent article on Weisel which appears in Biography magazine in the September 1999 issue. Weisel claims he should not be given the honored title of a &quot;tzaddik,&quot; or righteous person. But I think living through hell on earth gives you the right to be honored with the title, not because he lived through it, but because he made something positive out of his experience. Fighting against hate makes him a &quot;tzaddik.&quot; Thank you Dr. Weisel. I plan to include &quot;Night&quot; in our Lutheran Church Library."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The daughter of a World WAr II veteran, I read NIGHT on the recommendation of a college professor. I then offered the book to my father, who had served as an infantryman in the Normanday Invasion and was an eye-witness to the Holocaust in Germany. My father was unable to read the book. I will never forget the sadness in his voice and face as he gently returned the book to me. An excellent companion book to NIGHT is Corrie Ten Boom's A PRISONER AND YET, which served as the foundation for the movie THE HIDING PLACE some years back. When teaching World War II at the high school level, I always recommend the two books in tandem. I never require students to read NIGHT, because there are some teenagers who are not equipped to handle the book's graphic cruelty. A PRISONER AND YET is a good companion book because Corrie Ten Boom's faith was victorious even through the horrors of Ravensbruck. Yes - Wiesel, Ten Boom, my father and millions of other soldiers and resisters truly were - &quot;the greatest generation.&quot;"},{"Title":"Night","review":"&quot;Night&quot; is a chilling account of the horrors of the holocaust and slow murder of the human spirit. Elie Wiesel takes the reader with him into the barracks, into the crowded trains, making the reader see through Wiesel's eyes, and feel with Wiesel's heart the terror, the pain, the emptiness , strength, hopelessness, and the inhumanity suffered by the Jews in Auschwitz. This work is a testimony of man's capacity for evil, and the strength of the human will."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was the first book I have ever read written in first person regarding the terrible holocaust. I had read and seen the movies on Anne Frank and The Hiding Place and always wondered what happened next. I realize now that I was really afraid to know what happened next! My entire family went to see Schinlder's List and we all were completely stunned to silence after the movie. Several times I had to put Mr. Wiesel's book down and catch my breathe. Once I was talking to a friend about Schindler's List and asked her what her reaction was and she said, &quot;Oh, the power of the human spirit is so great!&quot; I had to keep telling myself that while I was reading Night. This book was actually required reading for my daughter's sophomore English class is high school so I also had the Cliff Notes - even those took my breathe away! Mr Weisel is a wonderful man and I pray he is enjoying the life he has continued here in the United States. We are so lucky to have him! God bless him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What more can be said which already hasn't of this extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man of courage? With 900+ reviews, I will not make this an overly elaborate review, as the book simply does not require it. Elie Wiesel's story is one of one man's courage, will and fortitude to push on when all around him was lost; friends, family, belongings, even basic human dignity.What struck me more than anything else from his personal story was the retelling of the hanging of the three men (well, two men and one boy) while he was in one of the concentration camps. Millions perished, but the way the boy who suffered during the hanging stayed with me. His story is the story of millions who perished and who never got to tell their tale, and one of the few books I would call a must read.Different instances in the book I am quite sure will strike readers differently. One of the things which struck me and stayed with me was how he kept on looking for God, even amidst the enormity man sometimes will carry out on his fellow man. What also struck me was the woman on the train who was saw the flames at the camps even before they arrived. And the times he scolded and questioned himself and his ethics for even thinking selfish thoughts even though he was dying. I still think would I (could I?) do the same if I was in his terrible position?This book shows the worst of mankind, and sadly this terrible event known as the holocaust is not entirely unique in man's history since the freeing of Elie Wiesel. We have witnessed Rwanda firsthand in the 1990's, and have been told by world authorities that \\"this will never happen again.\\" Yet in modern day Sudan(and North Korea, and Tibet.....), we see much of the same.....the world turning its back on millions of people. There may not be furnaces involved, but the crime of complicity through inaction is little different than a world which allowed human beings to be fed into furnaces. I guess the final question I come away asking from his book is \\"Will mankind ever learn?\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had not thought to find a book about the Holocaust that could move me as much as \\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.\\" I bought \\"Night\\" to read on a flight from Texas to Maryland, and devoured it in 2 hours. I was oblivious to turbulence, snacks, and chatter around me. But \\"Night\\" moved me in a very different way than \\"Anne Frank.\\"Written in spare prose, the story needs no garnishing to invoke a deep reaction on the part of the reader. Elie Wiesel's brutal self-honesty and unsparing eye give the reader an account of this teenager's experience in the notorious Auschwitz and Birkenau that is like no other. Wiesel does not find much heroism to applaud in his fellow-sufferers. His uncompromising honesty on every page leaves the reader with the certain knowledge that, on the basest level, man's first instinct is survival. That transcends love for humanity, love for family, and even common decency. No one should have to learn these lessons at 16. And that was why Wiesel was so determined that we should never forget.I believe this is an important book that should be taught in the classroom and that every book club should read. No, it isn't a pretty story. But it's the truth."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is perhaps one of the most influential books produced in the 20th century.Written by somebody who witnessed the destruction of the Jews in the Holocaust, this book forced confrontation with the issue that many people preferred not to talk about. You might think you knew enough about the Holocaust, but if you haven't read this book (or personally witnessed it first-hand), then you don't know much.This should be a book that is required for EVERYone in society to read. Let us never forget the lessons that can be learned from this dark period in history.One of the first startling tragedies exposed in this book is that despite one man's dire warnings, a town completely ignored all the signs and waited for the looming destruction. They had enough time to escape with all the advanced warnings, but they chose to ignore it. Can this be a lesson for us to learn as well?The book also shows how a young man who was devout in his religion struggles with how a good God could possibly allow the large-scale massacre of innocent human life. How could he praise a God that allows this kind of suffering? He asks, &quot;Why should I bless him? ...Because He had had thousands of children burned in His pits?&quot; Yet, when he doubts the existence of God, he suddenly feels alone in a cold, unloving world.The author also describes how a once devout Rabbi loses his faith in God. The Rabbi tells him, &quot;It's the end. God is no longer with us... Where is the divine Mercy? Where is God? How can I believe, how could anyone believe, in this merciful God?&quot;Yet the spiritual breakthrough comes when Elie watches Rabbi Eliahou looking for his son who gave up on him. The Rabbi could not keep up in a long march, and his son, kept on pressing forward farther ahead of him, leaving his father behind. Elie realizes that the son had &quot;sought this separation in order to get rid of the burden, to free himself from an encumbrance which could lessen his own chances of survival.&quot; Yet, Elie is &quot;glad that Rabbi Eliahou should continue to look for his beloved son.&quot; And he prays that he will never be like the son. He saw God as continuing to look for him, even when Elie had given Him up for dead."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel is by far one of the best Holocaust books ever written. It is very short, but what it lacks in number of pages, it makes up for in content and message. The book gives a look at details from the ghetto and concentration camps that are often overlooked or widely unknown. It not only goes through a young man's struggle through concentration camps, but also his struggles with losing his family and everyone close to him, as well as his struggle with faith in God, hunger, and other issues.

It is such a dramatic story of one 15 year old boy's will to survive in a concentration camp. He lost his mother and his sister but he would not give up. This young boy holds on to his father and tries to not lose him. All through the story the young boy survived with little food and water. All around him people were dying and beaten. The boy himself was beaten many times, but that did not stop him. I recommend this book to everyone.

The book is very touching and shows a boys strength to keep himself and his father alive even though he knows that his mother and sister are gone. He goes through so many horrible things that it is amazing that he survived. At the age of fifteen he had been treated as an adult and was as tattered if not more worn then his elders.

It brings you through a life of a Jewish boy who watches his family picked apart in front of his eyes. At first I was going to read this book so that I could read a 109 page book and get a good grade in library. Expecting to have to choke this book down I began to read. I ended up putting myself in a state so that I could not put it down. It is very powerful. It is a eyeopener to a subject that some didn't really want to accept such as I felt. It gives you a step by step life of a Jew going through the Nazi death camps at the near end of the world war. Yet as I read on I became to realize what the horrible things really happened while I wasn't alive. At my age this was a true wake up call to what really happened so long ago."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is the most powerful book I've ever read about anything; especially the Holocaust. I have read many other books and historical accounts, visited the Holocaust museum in Washington DC, and seen many movies such as Schindler's List that attempt to convey the atrocities of Hitler's Germany; but none of them had an impact on me comparable to that of Wiesel's Night. The book absorbs you and creates the most realistic images of the horrors experienced by the Jews. I firmly believe that every high school student in America should be required to read this book. I was, and it had a profound impact on my life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's account is a powerful exploration of the Holocaust. A young Transylvanian ... lives a sheltered life. His family is wealthy and he is into religious dogma. Then comes the Nazi Wehrmacht to crush everything he assumes or believes in. First forced into a ghetto then into several concentration camps, his experiences grow more and more dark and depressing. His sister and mother are seperated from his dad and him, and are probably killed. Grueling work and no food are small problems, but the prisoners become monsters equivalent to the Nazis guarding them. Several passages, such as the son abandoning his father during a run so as not to be shot, and another son killing his father for a crust of bread, are among the most poignant in the book. Eventually the young boy forsakes God, becomes bitter and withdrawn, and, after many Jews are killed as examples and his father dies, he tries only to survive. This is a must for everyone to read, because if people are educated about hate and what it does to people, this might not happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Weisel did an excellent job in writing this book. It may not seem to be a difficult read, but if you only read it once you haven't even scratched the surface of the book's meaning. I've read this book several times over the past few years and every time I read it I find new meaning in the words. Mr. Weisel wrote with book with a lot of care and I encourage anyone who hasn't read it to do so and for those who own it, read it again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book, at school in English class, in the 10th grade. (I am now going into the 11th, as of 6/15/01). I did not think it was going to be a good book. The key to get into the book is to get past the first 3 pages or so. If you can do that you can read the rest. The first 3 pages are kind of dull. After that the drama starts. I love this book so much. It gives a first person account on what happen. I would recommend this to anybody. This book needs to be taught in all high school English classes. I like this book so much, the first day out of school, I brought this book. Read it, you will enjoy it. Also, this book is so good it needs to be a movie, it is that good."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In Elie's time at the concentration camp he questions many things. He is constantly questioning why his people still praise and glofiy the same God who has betrayed them. Elie demands to know why God is punishing his people? But there is no end to the questioning of God's reasons, and there are only silent answers. Elies belief in his God waivers throughout the whole novel and eventually is destroyed. The Nazis not only murder his whole family but also his God. This was an insightful book full of pain, but extremely realistic. It makes you question the little things we take for granted, like our freedom."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is an incredible book. This is the story of a boy's life in a concentration camp. He survives, but as an orphan and without any kind of family. It's a graphic description of what his life was like there. The two most touching moments for me were when the prisoners all recite the Jewish prayer for the dead for themselves, and when the narrator (Wiesel himself, I believe) discovers his mother and sisters are dead when he is sorting clothing of dead prisoners and recognizes their clothes. Prior to that he had been separated from them and assumed that they were simply in a different part of the camp, when in fact, as was standard operating procedure most of the time for prisoners who the Nazis didn't consider valuable, they were sent to the gas chambers. It's the poignant personal moments like this that make this book so gripping. We must never forget, and it must never happen again.Wiesel has written two other books chronicaling what happened next, after the camps, but I haven't read them yet."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel titled Night by Elie Wiesel is a phenominal autobiography. This novel about Elie gave us the full experience on what it was like to be in the Holocaust. To read about the struggle and survival of these innocent people, made us realize how fortunate we really are. The Jewish community went through a period of torture, pain and starvation. Being put into the cattle cars, witnessing people getting out into cremetories, running for many miles, working from dusk until dawn and not having the proper nutrition are only some of the things they went through.We like this book because it shows how people had a strong will to survive. Their future goals kept them going and they tried to stay alive. Many people strived to keep alive and wouldn't let a small obsticle overcome their goals. Others couldn't adapt to the terrible conditions at the concentration camps. They were very strong inside because they witnessed their loved ones being killed. The book Night was a very emotional novel explaining the horrors of the Holocaust. This will make you think twice before you complain about what you don't or can't have and make you appreciate life itself."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a book that really needs no review on how great it is. I have read the book several times over to fully understand what the author is trying to explain to the reader.This book stars off with a boy (Elie) who wants to learn more about his religion, which is, of course, Judaism. He wants to study and find out a much as he can. He lives in a house with a mother, father and, sister. They all have heard about the war and are ignorant to the fact that they have heard stories that the Nazi are placing Jew into a camp, called a concentration camp (death camp). He and his family one-day find out what the cost of being ignorant is. The Nazi's come to his town and quickly starts placing all the Jews who live there into ghettos. Elie and his family go through unspeakable torture. They are sent to Auschwitz. Auschwitz is infamous for being one of the most unbelievable death and work camp in the Nazi history.This book helped me to see the real horrors of the holocaust.

I feel that this is a great book to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Jewish writer and historian Elie Wisel was cut off from his childhood learning of his faith when the Nazis took him and his family away from home. Wiesel encountered a new home and new world view in which bigotry, theft, murder, and genocide existed. Wiesel's account of his experience while in the concentration camp leaves the reader on the brink of despair, which is where Wiesel had been. But perseverance and love for his father, respect and faith in his people led him away from the camp to the days of freedom only to be left with the tragic memory. That tragedy led to this compelling story of his life. Highly reccomended!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The editor and most other reviewers have done a great job in reviewing this book, and I can only add a few things from my viewpoint. I thought that I was past tears, and I wasn't. I thought that I could forget, and I couldn't. But the lessons of history should not be repeated over and over again by generations that forget. The first steps to Auschwitz are the steps of blaming the innocent and glorifying the guilty. Some even do it in the name of God or Country or Policing the World or Rescuing the World. Let us begin by rescuing ourselves and living our lives as examples, not rescuing the past or the future or God or Country. When we have proven our own worthiness and freedom from evil beyond all doubt, then we may avoid the Auschwitzs in our own country.

The Holocaust has long since ended, but still the memories continue in the minds of survivors across the planet. This touching book tells the story of a man who was only a teen when he, and his family, are taken away. The tale is sad but true, and gives an excellent account of this man's life during the Holocaust.

Elie brings it all out in Night, each harrowing detailed account, from being forced to view countless numbers of hangings to seeing babies and children cremated while they were still alive.

Once I finished, I just sat there thinking about the book and realizing that it wasn't a work of fiction, but a true story. I had to read this book in my high school English class and it blew me away. The way he and his father try and beat the odds to stay together, the horrors of a concentration camp, what its like to go for days without food, etc. The sheer simplicity of it makes it seem so real, yet so fake. The metaphors and personification that he uses to describe events are beautiful. There are so many underlying meanings in the book, so many great lines (That night the soup tasted of corpses) that make you sit back and wonder how this sort of thing could have happened. I recommend this book to anyone (probably 9th grade and up, its pretty gruesome) and have nothing but good things to say about it, definitely one of the best books I have ever read. If you forget everything about this book, NEVER, EVER forget that it was a true story, and the last line........."},{"Title":"Night","review":"&quot;Night&quot;, by Ellie Wiesel, explains his real life in the Concentration Camps during World War II. His family and friends who were originally from Hungary were Jewish and were forced into starving, suffering, and mistreatment by the German leader, Adolph Hitler. The Nazi death camp's horror turns this young boy into the agonized witness to his family's murder, and the destroys his faith in God. This book awakens the shocking memory of evil at its absolute worst and carries with it the unforgettable message that this horror must never be allowed to happen again. The autobiographical nature of this book helps the readers identify with all the suffering and mistreatment that many innocent people had to witness and go through. Ellie Wiesel makes the scenes so real that any reader can feel like they were living in the horrible and terrifying events. The scenes are so vivid that the words can picture the Jews during the mistreatment of the Holocaust. Wiesel has described a painful journey through the darkness, through the false dawns and false days, until there are hints that tiny shafts of light can pierce the seemingly unending nights."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" may be one of the hardest books you will ever read.Nobody can top reality. The dreadfulness, terror and shock that originate in the imagination of horror novelists can never begin to compare to the real events that happened during World War II, in a time that is widely referred to as the Holocaust.\\"Night\\" is about the true and terrifying events that Eli Wiesel has gone through during those days.Inside, you are going to meet the young Elie Wiesel, born in the town of Sighet, Romania, presumably into a good life. Then you'll meet the phenomenon of denial among the Jewish people; so many had never believed the reports about the horrible activities of the Germans and of the other European nations during the War - until it became their fate as well.This pitiful and destructive denial continues even while being transferred like cattle to concentration camps, through the first revelations of brutal and barbaric behavior amid the Jews themselves in the face of inhumane conditions. Their eyes are finally opened only in front of the gates of hell - the crematoriums of Auschwitz.Having survived the selections there, Wiesel continues to live on and witnesses atrocities, loss, immense pain and sadness in different concentration and death camps, and comes to questioning everything he has ever learned in his short life to that point.=============================================================Why would you want to spend your time reading something that horrible?You probably have general information about the atrocities that took place in those cursed days; having seen films like \\"The Schindler's List\\" you have an idea about how it was like. Having seen documentaries with interviews of survivors might add some more knowledge to your overall concept about what it was like.Reading books about it is the next step.There is always something new that a person hasn't heard of, probably would never have imagined and that cannot be conveyed via the visual media. Furthermore, reading a book is quite different from seeing a film in the sense that one gets the chance to crawl into the mind of a person that has been through this unprecedented ordeal. What one may discover about human nature - both of the murderers and their victims - may be extremely upsetting and difficult to grasp.Why is it important to read this book and others like it?To remember that it happened and to do as much as anyone can do to never let it happen again.=============================================================In the end of the last paragraph I almost added, \\"to pray to God it would never happen again\\", but then again I remembered how God was awfully quite as it was all taking place. I don't know where God was during those times, but Wiesel gives his answer that comes from within, while witnessing the hanging of a young boy: \\"Where is He? Here He is - He is hanging here on the gallows...\\"Yes, in the aftermath of the Holocaust there was a sweeping faith crisis; the concept of God and the belief in mighty powers became a problem among the Jewish people, and as I've learned during my latest trip, among many Europeans as well. How could He let it happen? Why? Where was He? And ultimately, should the people that suffered to an unparalleled extent forgive Him? Can they? Who should they blame?=============================================================In this shocking account you will not find the answers for these questions.The conclusion you may draw in the end of the day is that it's up to us to protect ourselves. We can trust ourselves - and ourselves only - in the fight against the forces that wish to destroy us."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night,\\" by Elie Wiesel, has been translated from French by Stella Rodway. The copyright page notes that the book was originally published in French in 1958. The author bio at the end of the book informs us that the Hungarian-born Wiesel was deported to Auschwitz and Buchenwald and eventually received the Nobel Peace Prize.\\"Night\\" is a first-person account of surviving the Nazi Holocaust. The narrative spans the years 1941-45 and recounts the atrocities committed against the European Jews by Hitler's regime. At 109 pages, the narrative is slim, but it is powerful.Wiesel vividly depicts the dehumanization of concentration camp inmates. He effectively recounts the details of life in the shadow of Hitler; the Holocaust experience is depicted as a nightmarish mix of absurdity and horror. Some key questions raised by the narrative are theological; for example, how can anyone continue to have faith in a deity in light of these horrors?Wiesel's prose, as translated by Rodway, is stark and grim--very effective for his subject matter. The well-written text leads up to a truly haunting final image. I recommend this book not only to those interested in the Holocaust, but to anyone interested in human cruelty and the human will to survive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the most complete account of Nazi Germany ever written. Unlike so many of the books on this subject, Elie Wiesel brings forth a very personal story.Born in Hungary, Wiesel is deported with his family to the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz. His story is terrifying, shocking, and extremely graphic. He is very candid, and his incredible descriptions truly paint the vivid picture of the Nazi death camp.It is hard to get through this book without feeling for Wiesel and his family, especially his father. Reading about the horrors that the two of them went through was an eye-opening experience. There are a lot of painful memories brought out in his excellent writing, and as a reader, I became part of the scene. I truly felt myself running and working with the prisoners, starving on bread and soup, and feeling their anguish and utmost terror. This book is by far, the most graphic account of Nazi Germany that I have ever read. I was mesmorized by the story, and glued to the book.There are so many hidden messages in the book, as well as some blatant ones right there on the pages in front of you. Wiesel's descriptive language makes you want to keep turning the pages, as you struggle with him and his father for survival. This book is one that needs to be read more, by people from all races, creeds, and religions, so that this horror can never ever happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I wish that my seventh grade English teacher had skipped Anne Frank and gone straight for this one. Wiesel's account reflects the horror and reality of the Holocaust, and if it is to never happen again, every child in every seventh grade in every country of the world should be required to read it. I read this book over six months ago and the images created by the author's words are still burned permanently into my brain. The description of the forced march of concentration camp inmates as the Russians and Americans only began to arrive and liberate the oppressed will break your heart. I hope Elie Wiesel has found more in this life than the endless night that he describes...wow, words fail me. How do you describe the feelings that something so horrible stirs in your mind, body, and soul?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am a ninth grade English teacher and I have recently completed the teaching of this novel to my students, who were enthraled with this book. Wiesel is a courageous man who overcame the bounds and chains that evil placed on him and his will to survive. I don't know how, but he survived mentally and physically. The students had the same passion concerning this book as I. They found it easy to read and understand-some students even finished it within the first few evenings that it was assigned. This is a phenomenal story, one that everyone should experience."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Reading Night by Elie Wiesel began as a simple two-day assignment for my freshman English class. At first glance, I expected this quick read to be simply one more trite account to the terrible atrocities committed during wwii Germany. But after getting only 15 pages into the storyline, I found myself immersed in the detail, precision, and striking ability with which Wiesel describes his own adolescent struggle. At the age of only 15, he was faced with the daunting task of realizing that not everyone is good deep down inside. As his family is herded from its town of Sighet into trains, and then unkonwingly into concentration camps, the universal good in man which young Eliezer had once believed was stripped from his soul. This emotional weekend read is capable of being devoured all in one sitting. However, while reading this book in our living rooms or at the beach, we must remember what our fellow men and women around the world have been through. As readers, we should take time to celebrate the courage and hope that men like Elie Wiesel have possessed. Without this strong passion for life our world would be so much different than it is today. The few hours we spend reading this book are special. But they are nothing compared to the days, months, and years that thousands of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, and slavs spent in concentration camps. If you have ever felt low or alone, read Night, and you will see just how lucky you are to be able to breathe, to eat, to love, to feel, to even be alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"While I'm glad to see so many high schools are making this required reading (or maybe its just Harbor City, CA's requirement - a book review on Amazon.com for extra credits?), I'm appalled to see there are Cliff Notes to Night. (Are there Cliff Notes to life somewhere that would help me?)In my humble opinion, this book should be on adult reader's bookshelves for periodic refresher readings through-out life, as we encounter more of the ups and downs of life.For highschoolers OR adults, I'd put this book as required reading AFTER the Diary of Anne Frank, as a reading companion for Viktor Frankl's &quot;Man's Search for Meaning,&quot; and as a viewer's aide for the wonderful movie, &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot; The book raises questions about the meaning of life, and This is a book to be read and re-read periodically.This book is short, but incredibly deep. Wiesel did not expect to win any kind of reward, he was trying to alleviate some of the horrors he'd experienced while in the camps.When reading this book, a youthful reader could ask themselves (I do this everytime I read this), what kind of a person would I have been, stripped to the core emotionally and physically.Would I have given up, turned others in, hoarded my bread crumbs? If I survived, what would I have done with my life after? Wiesel has dedicated his life to reminding us what happened -I'd also encourage high school students to read &quot;It Can't Happen Here&quot; by Sinclair Lewis - if the object of reading this book is to learn about discrimination and intolerance, that book is an excellent book for the young."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel tells the story of his life, a devout Jewish young man who survives the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. The story is stark, harsh truth and while this is a difficult story to read and bear, it is worth each moment. While it details the killing of babies, children and women in horrifying truth, Mr. Wiesel does not stop there. He addresses the question of why and how this occured in his town when there were ample warnings about the future,.. that no one believed it would actually happen to them, there.... His openess about the experience of having your faith shattered and yet still believing enough to be mad at God was brilliantly done. While I have read several books about the Holocaust this one was the most vivid and real to me. The details of life in the camps,and the extremes to which some would go to &quot;merely&quot; to survive were heart and soul wrenching. Seeing this through his eyes was an amazing experience. I have had this book for nearly a year before I read it. I knew the story of the concentration camps and wasn't sure I wanted to learn anymore than I already had.

In the beginnning there is a quote that i feel sums it up best: &quot;As a human document, Night is almost unbearably painful, and certainly beyond criticism.&quot;"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is one of the few truely incredible documentaries of the Holocaust. Told by survior Elie Wiesel, it is a true account of his experiences that had me so stricken with the pain that he, and the 11 million others must have gone through I cannot begin to describe. I highly recommend. &quot;Never, as long as I live, will I forget [this book], even if I am condemned to live as long as God himself.&quot;"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a book about one young man's experience of Auschwtz. Elie Wiesel tells us his own experience during that horrific time period. The book shows readers the cruelties of Nazis army and the sufferings of Jewish people. Before Holocaust, Elie and his family lives were secure and comfortable. They lived in a Jewish community happily. Elie&iacute;s father was the leader of their community. They were very religious. Praying and searching for God were Elie&iacute;s main interests. However, this peaceful life didn&iacute;t last too long. Nazi executed many strict policies for Jews. They were forcibly moved to ghetto where they could not go out after 8pm. The ghettoes were becoming more crowded and smaller. Many Jews were told that Nazis were burning and torturing Jews in their concentration camp among other unbelievable Nazis cruelties. However, people were skeptic and nobody believed this rumor. When Elie was fifteen years old, the entire community where Elie was living was sent to concentration camp by cattle trains. Once they arrived at the concentration camp, they were selected according to their physical conditions and abilities to work. Healthy men were kept alive to work in the camp, while women, children and the weaks would be gassed and tossed into fire. They were facing death everyday. After Elie witnessed all these killings and torturing, he finally lost his faith. Night is a very powerful book. It brought to a journey of hell and an endless night. I recommend it ot evryone who wants to know the truth and horror of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book by Elie Wiesel, was amazing. He make the reader feel, taste , hear and see what all the victims of the holocaust experienced. He made the reader out themselves in the place of these prisoners. I think that it was a great idea for an author to out down on paper what he went through as a child and as he grew up. It makes up think aboout the furture and whats ahead. He makes you realize that this can not ever happen again. By reading about his experience, we learn how to prevent these things from occuring in the near future. THIS TYPE OF EVENT SHALL NOT OCCUR IF WE LEARN HOW TO PREVENT IT!!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was part of my required reading for Grade11 Religion. After reading the first few pages I could not put it down, I read the book in 3 nights. It changed my perspective of the horrors of war because the book was written so honestly and with such a realistic view that I my heart felt cold to know that people could do this to one another, I knew about the holocaust before reading the book but I could not grasp the situation in a realistic manner, this book helped me do that."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book for the book club I am in and I found it to be a very emotional and moving book.

And that the author is a very good writer, and it is amazing just how much he can remember after all this time. I think it is good though that he is telling the world about how tough it was so maybe history will not repeat itself. He had a lot of guts to survive such a horrorible exprience. It is not every day you run across such a strong person or read such a strong book. I think everyone should read this book somtime in their life so that the Holocaust will not repeat itself, and no more people will have to suffer such a horrorible exprience, but I think this is one of the best books I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really enjoyed the book Night. I think that everyone should read this book to understand some of the cruel actions of the Holocaust. This book is a true story. It is a autobiography.

I really enjoyed this book and I believe that everyone should take the time to read this breath taking novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"'Night' is a valuable resource in terms of being a first hand account of the Nazi concentration camp system. But as far a literary works go, this book certainly is nothing special. Weisel's attempts to inject the story with emotional descriptions (I am not suggesting his experiences were not gut-wrenching) turn out a bit lame, and it doesn't make for great reading. In a book so insubstantial (about 100 pages) something more needed to be done with the story to make it more captivating. Good for a history student, of little value to a bookworm."},{"Title":"Night","review":"An amazing, honest tale of a horrible chapter in a young boys life. A must read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a hard review to write. On one hand, Night is a touching story of strength and maintaining hope against terrible odds. On the other hand, it seems to bolster the argument that there were no gas chambers or gassing of people at Auschwitz. If there were gas chambers there, why were Mr. Wiesel and everyone he came in contact with unaware of them? There is not one mention of gassing or gas chambers anywhere in the book. Mr. Wiesel claims that the method of killing was burning, forcing people to walk alive into burning pits. There are many other discrepancies in the book: describing Dr. Mengele as wearing a monocle (he did not wear one, but this was the sterotypical image of German officers during and for a while after the war), claiming that flames shot out of the top of the crematory chimneys (cremation experts seem to think this is not possible), etc. But what really bothers me is NO GAS CHAMBERS. I see that some people dismiss these discrepancies by claiming that this book is a work of fiction. That is nonsense. This book was not written, advertised, or in any way presented as fiction and the notion that anyone who had been through such horror, and who was as qualified as anyone to write a true account, would instead write a fictious story that ventured so far from their actual experiences is so ludicrous that it is pathetic to even sugget it..I am very confused and feel that if the most celebrated survivor does not support the gassing story, maybe I should start reading some of the books written by the people who challenge some elements of the holocaust story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Eli Wiesel, is the story of a fifteen-year old Jew imprisoned in the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II. Wiesel wrote this book about fifteen years after the event in order to distance himself from it somewhat (obviously, the experience left too much of an impact to ever be forgotten.)Through his direct prose and straight language, Wiesel informs the reader of the horrors of the Holocaust. SS guards, barracks, showers, transportation, death marches, rations ... nothing escapes without Wiesel's observations. However, the book lacked description, perhaps because the experience was still too painful for Wiesel to recall-or perhaps because words do not exist to describe the trial.If only one book is read about the people behind the Holocaust, it should be Anne Frank's Diary. However, if one book is read about the Holocaust itself, Eli Wiesel's Night is compelling, shocking, and enlightening."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had to read this book for school.

This book was very different though, I could not put it down, I definitely reccommend this book to any one, even if you dont enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is not a bad book. It is a good book, but it is not that good. The story or plot of the book is fine. It is a story that needs to be told, but I think it could be told better. Mr. Wiesel takes one idea from the beginning of the book and just uses that up through the entire book. You get his whole idea in the first 50+ pages. That makes the rest of his journey through the concentration camps less intristing and insightful, and it dilutes the power of the story. The problem with the book is that Elie Wiesel doesn't expand the ideas he laid out in the beginning. Yes, this is an important story. But it could be told a lot better."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read this book for my Literature class but I remembered that I read it before. This book is a middle school level.

It relates the experiences of a young Jew who survived a year in Nazi concentration camps during WW11. He grew up in Hungary and was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 even though less than 10 years old. There he somehow got through the notorious selection and spent most of his time in hospital after that. Nowhere in the book is there any mention of gas chambers although he does witness burning heaps of bodies just after arriving at the camp. When the Germans retreated in 1945 he and his father chose to go with them rather than be liberated by the Soviets. His father died later in a western camp, just as the young diarist Ann Frank did after leaving Auschwitz with the Germans. She died of typhus. Elie Weisel survived and has made it his life's work to commemorate those who died at the hands of the Nazis. As such his narrative has political significance although it is strangely lacking in details and fails to explain how a Jewish child could escape being killed by a genocidal regime. Others in his family were not so lucky."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought this book was writen poorly. I felt that Elie Wiesel did not give us enough information on the Holocaust.

At different points, this book made me sick to my stomache.In this book a Jewish boy named Elie Wiesle and his family got sent to a concertation camp because Germans took over their country. The Germans did not like the Jewish religon so they sent them to the camps to work until they died. Elie and his family where put in a cattle car with a total of 80 people for 4 days. There was not enough room to lay down so the had to stand up the entire time When he got to the camp he was seperated from his mother and sister but he got to stay with his father. While they where there, they watched people get hung, burned, and beaten. They described this by saying \\"He baegan to beat him with an iron bar.\\" Elie's father died before they got released and Elie survived.At the end of this book Elie's father died but elie lived.

As the ghettoes and concentration camps stripped away personal belongings, physical fortitude, and finally dignity, the victims were confronting, layer by layer, their instinct for survival and their will to live. If you have seen the &quot;Holocaust&quot; mini-series, the movie &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; any of the countless documentaries on the subject, and read &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank,&quot; you will not find much that is new in the physical description of the conditions of the concentration camps. But remember that this book was one of the first accounts published of the inside story.What is most surprising is that Elie Wiesel was able to lose his faith in God and survive the horrific conditions of the camps and a death march. How he accomplished this with no assistance from a higher being I do not know, but I suspect that in some sense his father took the spiritual place of his God and that is why Elie was so vacant when his father died.

From the point of view of one who lived through death, survived horrors that many did not, Night will make real to you all the pain and suffering of concentration camp prisoners.

In fact, I started reading this book on Monday afternoon, and finished it that night without putting it down! It does not seem feasible to me that someone would, or could, make up such events. This story was far too detailed and graphic for it to come from anyone other than someone who went through this hell himself. I can certainly see why the Holocaust \\"deniers\\" do not like Wiesel's book. It was a gripping masterpiece, which I believe everyone should read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The title of this book says it all. In one night after reading this book, my whole out look has changed. I am forever grateful to the honorable Elie Wiesel for having the courage and strength to relive and narrarate his experience, not only as a witness but as a participant of the Holocaust, providing his readers his indelible message through the masterpiece of his manuscript. In this somber and haunting tale, Mr. Wiesel captured my attention, for better or worse. As he described his heart pounding in moments of great terror, I too felt my heart pounding. I could feel his suspense, his anguish, his pain, his confusion, his contempt, and his fear. As an adult and a mother, I felt nauseous with his descriptions of the victims, the children, and ached and hoped for the longing of a reunification with his family members, hoping some miracle would stop this nightmare of reality. Oh, I so longed for him to reunify with his mother and his sister, so that he could go home and live a life that so many of us take for granted, nowadays. As I kept reading, I would find myself wondering and asking God, Why? Why? Why? I felt relieved to know that Mr. Wiesel too questioned God, felt anger towards God, but at the same time showed his respect towards God. Such ambivalence...such a real person...who experienced a myriad of emotions, feelings, and a whirlwind of despair in a surreal circumstance. I kept asking myself if what I was reading was &quot;real&quot; or &quot;surreal&quot; questioning myself, how could this happen? Why did this happen? Why didn't anyone stop it from happening? I felt heart-sick for Mr. Wiesel and all of the other prisoners. Mr. Wiesel's story is terrifying but a constant reminder that if we don't learn our history, we are bound to repeat it. I personally believe this book should be in every person's bookcase and taught everywhere, so that this vile display of what humans can do to each other is not forgotten and not repeated or ignored. By Mr. Wiesel surviving this torment, he is a living testament that the human spirit is strong, courageous and can triumph even with only a glimmer of hope in the midst of such horrific darkness. There is no excuse to be a victim. We are all capable of being survivors. The human mind is a terrible thing to waste. Because of Mr. Wiesel's account, I will never look at my life in the same spoiled and complacement way that I once did a night ago. I have changed. I now have respect for the breath that I breathe. I now have respect for the opportunites bestowed upon me. Living in this lifetime is a gift. Things that were so-called important to me yesterday are no longer. The definition of life is love, breathing, and the art of literacy. God bless Mr. Wiesel for giving his readers the gift of his life through his words...Thank you God for using Mr. Wiesel as an instrument to spread the word of the importance of life and for giving us his testimony of his Holocaust experience...Mr. Wiesel's book will leave an indelible mark on the human soul and should be read and shared with as many who are open to hear his important and significant message of life...Leticia Araujo Perez, author"},{"Title":"Night","review":"i would recomend this book to anybodie who likes a story of the holocoastit was haert touching"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This gripping story of one man's experience in the Holocaust gets right at the heart of the issue of the existence of God for many people.As Wiesel recalls the moving and shocking story of his families' and his personal story at the hands of Nazis in WW2, this boy who once loved the God of his Jewish religion, sees his God die at the hands of these Jewish exterminators. A God in this case who would allow such a brutal, unhuman event to occur to His people, the Jews, is no God to them.Seen through this tragic happening in man's history, a God who stands by idly and permits such cruelties has no claim to be their God. His abandonment of His own people when they were so unjustly and brutally murdered and tortured brings about a complete stoppage of any attempts at further communion with God.One cannot but feel pain and embarassment for the terrible inhumanities that the Jews endured at the hands of the Nazis. Wiesel powerfully brings these emotions out of the reader through his short,tight, intense writing style. Interspersed is this penetration recollection is Wiesel's reactions to what was occuring, and most importantly to the issue of God's existence is his reaction to God as the ordeal progresses.He but gives brief glimpses of what God has meant to him, e.g. his interest in the Jewish mystical book of the cabbala. This is key for understanding his sentiments now concerning God. He states: &quot;Man raises himself toward God by the questions he asks Him . . . that is true dialogue. Man questions God and God answers.&quot; Further, he shows the belief that the Messiah would be a political Christ who would free the Jews and return them to a worldly power.Thus, when the reality of the concentration camp and the deaths occuring around him appear, Elie is quick to see God as letting down His part of the deal. Wiesel's concept of God is a &quot;this world&quot; God, to deliver Israel only from any harm. Further, he equates evil that man precipitates upon man as God's fault and responsibility.To be sure, Wiesel rejects (if aware) of the Christian view that differs with his concept. God is not source and fault of sin and has accomplished victory in dealing with all injustice and will publicly display this victory and rid saved humanity once and for all. All this God did through a Jew, Jesus the Christ (Messiah).This book is valuable in that it not only powerfully describes the full rage of man's sinful nature expressed through the Nazi regime but it points out one man's changing views of a God which to a great extent is limited to his own questioning/reasoning ability. Left to our abilities, we do create gods which will not stand the test of time, nor do they provide what we really need, salvation for eternity, not from a cruel Roman government in the first century or from a cruel government in the twentieth, to save us from ourselves. We have met the enemy, and the enemy is sinful humanity. The Messiah came to be the vicarious atonement for this sinful mess."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am a Teenager, 16 yrs old...

His relationship with his father and God was the key to his survival in the concentration camps. Before the Nazi Hungarians came to his town, he lived for God. In the concentration camps, he lost faith and lived for his dad. But through all of the trials and tribulation he lived to tell about it. Nothing any of us teenagers go through really compares to what Elie Wiesel went through. His will and determination made him a hero in many student's hearts."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was assigned to read this book for school... I wasn't too happy about having more work to do, but i am so glad i read this book. it has graphic details of the terrifying experiences of Mr. Weisel. You must read this book ion order to even come close to understanding something about the horrors of teh holocaust. we must be informed about this so we don't make the same mistake. maybe if we know about past cruelties, we can prevent history from repeating itself."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Powerful yet draining, this petite piece of literature will blow you away. Weisel's account of his horrific experiences during a time of pure hell are graphic and sustaining. The 109 pages of absolute insanctity will alter your view of life forever. Anybody and everybody should read this book. It should be an obligation so we remember not to forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that this novel was brilliantly explicit. Wiesel did not leave out any details from his experience. I loved the fact that this book was done from a child's persective. From cover to cover, it was disturbing throughout. It is very interesting to compare this novel to Roberto Benigni's movie, Life is Beautiful. The excruciating details were possibly too graphic for me. I would prefer a more subdued form of looking at such a serious topic as the Holocaust. Yet, I believe that Wiesel did an extraordinary job of telling it the way it is."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a very creative book. Its detail and characterization was easily defined within the first few chapters. Its graphic material was hard to swallow, but it brought out the holocausts horror and realization. This novel was written well and hopefully everyone can experience this novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Have you ever been in a concentration camp? If you haven't been, reading this book is the closest you will come. The book Night , written by Ellie Wiesel is both informative and suspenseful. In this book I found the characters to be very strong and resilient people. They faced many problems with strength and courage.Some very suspenseful and unbelievable scenes are described in gruesome detail, which helped me understand the struggles of the characters much better. Elizer and his father, who are the main characters, tell of their story in various concentration camps. Although they were separated from their families and virtually alone, far worse things were to be endured. \\"I had felt death\\" (Wiesel, 82). This quote from Elizer shows that each and everyday the occupants in the concentration camp battled to stay alive. At this point in the story, I realized the fear and brutality that the Jewish people encountered. Some could take the hardships and some could not. Although, Elizers father loved Elizer dearly, there were several times when he wanted to rid himself of all of the pain and suffering he was forced to endure. As Elizers father muttered the words \\" I can't go on\\" (Wiesel, 100) I could not imagine what was going through Elizers head. Sadness, anger, pain, despair? As I read those words I felt nothing but compassion for each and every person who had to go through such an awful experience. I think the characters in this story really help enhance the story. This book was heartbreaking and at the same time made you smile through the course of the book. It's the best book of its kind that I have read so far. It made me feel like I was feeling the pain, sadness, fear, and hunger right along with Elizer and his father.This story focuses on every aspect of the camps. However, some stuck in my mind more than others. \\"We were tormented with hunger\\" (Weisel, 39) the struggle of starvation contributed to a large portion of the plot in this story. When Elizer sacrificed his own food ration to give to his ill father, he became my favorite character. Because his ability to block out his own needs and be completely unselfish was inspiring to me. Being tormented by hunger is a hard concept to grasp for people of today. Night did a great job of weaving that into the plot. Starvation was a large portion of the story because of the number of people that perished because of lack of food. In fact, thousands, if not more, Jewish people died while being held in concentration camps. I had a very hard time relating to Night. I could not imagine being killed because of the color of my hair, or simply because of something I believe in. Although this is a sad and horrific reality that theses events happened in our past, I would recommend anyone above the age of 14 and up to read this book. It can, and will, prevent us from making these same mistakes in our future.Night was a very real, true, and eye-opening book. It was suspenseful, action packed, and informative. I thought this book was well written and very detailed. It shows the true struggle of two people's journey through the concentration camps and their battles to stay alive. It's a great book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a must read for humanity! Wiesel's description of the concentration camps, the stories and the struggle, all the while dealing with his faith, his God and his family are disturbingly compelling. The truth and horror of the Holocaust is captured without the potential gore, but the devastation and the description of what young Elie witnessed is not water-down in order to be palatable. There is a lot of power packed into this little book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Never forget\\" is a catch phrase when it comes to the Holocaust, but it was sixty years ago, and some people are forgetting or never knew how horrible the event was. Night by Elie Wiesel is a brief but powerful recollection of this era.Like Dante's Inferno, Night is about a descent into Hell. At first, things didn't seem so bad for Wiesel (at that time, a teenager) and his family. Despite tales of horror, the Jewish community he lived in couldn't accept that the suffering would come to them. With every restriction, they would think the worst was over. But eventually, things went beyond confiscations and being confined to ghettos. There would be the \\"evacuations\\" to concentration camps, and even then, many didn't realize what would be coming.Night shows how the devastation of the Holocaust when beyond the murders. Even the survivors wound up severely damaged, not just physically but emotionally as well. Many would be driven to viciousness in an often futile attempt to endure another few days. For Wiesel, a young adult of faith, he would be driven not to atheism but an angry hatred of God.In certain ways, Wiesel would get his humanity back, becoming an esteemed writer and eventual winner of the Nobel Prize. In his Nobel acceptance speech (included in the Night volume I have), he discusses other oppressions that were occurring at the time (the mid-1980s). And indeed, although Night is about Jews and Nazis specifically, it is more generally about the horrors of genocide and the ways people react to it.In a way, it is a good thing that this book is barely over one hundred pages, because the intensity of the book would probably diminish if it was longer. Night has a message that is universal. Because of its material, it is not an easy read, but it is a must-read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read \\"Night\\" in High School, not as a requirement, but as a suggestion. I was one of the very few people in my english class actually interested in reading and my english teacher saw that, she gave me a book that was billed as a trilogy with \\"Night\\", \\"Dawn\\", and \\"The Accident\\", all stories about the hardships Jewish people have dealt with at one time or another throughout history.I was very moved by all three stories, and they inspired me to learn much more about World War II."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is a slim autobiographical novel that chills the reader to the core. It is literature at its finest as it still resonates so powerfully today and, I'm sure, will continue to do so in the future.\\"Night\\" covers the experiences of Elie Wiesel during the second world war when, in 1944, he and his family are rounded up as Jews and sent to Birkenau where he is separated from his mother and sisters before going on to Auschwitz and Buchenwald with his father. It is the story of misery heaped upon misery as he fights for survival. The remainder of his family fall by the wayside as they slowly succumb to indiscriminate brutality. For Elie, questions about the human condition are raised as he tries to rationalise events. He eventually concludes that there is no god in such a world. He resorts to increasingly desperate means to survive. Self interest and, thus, life are paramount. All else is irrelevant.This is a book that should be read. It is a slim volume that can be easily read in one sitting. It is a book that will leave the reader stunned by the depravity into which some humans can sink when given the opportunity to inflict harm upon others."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel left me heartbroken at the inhumane ways Jewish people were treated as told from a Jew himself. No other book has left me as emotional as Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was an extraordinary story. Just the thought of being sent to a concentration camp is horrifing. I actually cried while I read this book.Babies being thrown and shot, people being burned,whipped,starved...terrible. This a tremendous book. I loved that Elie Wiesel wrote about his expeirience. It's truely moving."},{"Title":"Night","review":"He is a complete genius! I felt I understood the heart of evil more after reading this story. How historic hatreds can flare and motivate the mass of society to act is fearful as a historical reality. It makes you stand back in silence and see the implications of human experiences in history in all of its evil ... and its potential good."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A terrifying experience in the eyes of a Jewish boy, as he is forced beyond his limits. Witness the inhumane life in the concentration camps. Night portrays the despair and desperation the prisoners faced while fearing for their lives every waking moment.Night gives account of how one loses the will to live, and relieves oneself of all emotions and family. The young Jewish boy faces the terrors of selection, the crematories and of death. Witness the death of God in the hearts of tens of thousands of prisoners. Night portrays the darkest hours of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What marks this book from so many on the annihilation of the jews in death camps is its brevity. The book is so spare that it is hard to understand the horror without reading it so slowly that you are practically reading it aloud. There are really vivid characters in it, who evolve in just a few paragraphs, a truly masterful encapsulation. While there is nothing particularly remarkable about his writing style, Wiesel has created a classic here that will stand the test of time. It is so scary and devastating that I will never forget it.Highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I received this item in a timely matter in great condition! Would do business with again!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"As an English teacher, I have my ninth graders read this memoir every year. And every year, I am moved to tears. Not only does Mr. Wiesel tell of his devastating experience of dehumanization in the Holocaust, but he tells it with such eloquence and mastery of the English language, that one would wonder if he was always a writer. This is his first book and it reads like a story written by some of the greatest writers of the literary canon. Be forewarned that his story will change your perspective on life and will most likely you move you to tears as well. If it doesn't, than as my Pastor would say, \\"your wood is wet.\\"You may be asking yourself, \\"why would I want to read something that will just get me upset?\\" My answer to that is that if we don't get upset, how can we facilitate change? Ignorance leads to bliss? No way--it leads to destruction. Furthermore, antisemitism hasn't gone away. And in the midst of the violence and hatred exploding in the middle east 63 years after Hitler was defeated, there are millions of people who once again want to annihilate the Jews and are devising plans to do just that. So this memoir must be read. Mr. Wiesels' story must be heard."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a must-read. I would recommend the version with \\"Connections\\", which fleshes out the experience of the holocaust camps. We must never forget..........."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I always wonder what makes a book a good story to nominate for a Pulitzer prize? Even though I knew NIGHT was about the holocaust I still wondered what would make this book a winner.My son had a copy of the book and loaned it to me. I read it in one sitting and not because it is only about 100 pages long, but because I was able to get under the skin of a man who endured unspeakable experiences and survived and found some humanity in all the horror. I love the last line of the book...priceless."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, a tearjerker, but very good reading. I would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is one of the best non-fiction books I've read. The author does not bore you with dates and useless information. He relates to the common reader and either doesn't use terms that the common reader wouldn't know or explains them in a simple manner. It is a story about his life but he doesn't put to much emotion into it, letting the reader have his or her own emotions towards it. It is the type of story that makes you sad but you have to keep reading it.He is a very graphic writer because he wants to make sure something like the holocaust never happens again. He uses images that are not meant to scare the reader, but to give him or her the reality of this horror. He took a ten year vow of silence before writing this book and when you read it, you actually feel like you were there. It is an excellent story and historically accurate for those wanting to learn more about the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel, Night, details the horrors of Elie Wiesel's childhood in the concentration camps. It reveals the struggles he faces in his religious beliefs and the fight for his own survival during the Holocaust. The book sends out disturbing images that haunt your minds forever. For example, Eli talks about seeing live born babies being burned to death right in front of his eyes.I like the way Wiesel is very upfront and personal about his experiences, and it makes the book more real and interesting. It is the type of story that you can't put down. I Believe it must have been difficult for Wiesel to write this deep novel. He had to recall times that he did not want to ever bring up again and share it with many others. Night has opened my eyes to this tragic historic time, leaving me with a clearer understanding on the Holocaust. It is one of many books about World War II, although it is honored and specified from the others by the vivid details and reality that Elie portrays to the reader. His words seem to place you right there with him throughout his entire encounters at these camps. Night is a novel that should be read by all who wish to learn about a real life in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As hard as it is to hear about the unthinkable evil that existed during the Holocaust, we must remember that it did, indeed, happen. Elie Wiesel's Night is a brutally honest report of the torture that occurred in the concentration camps, and how it not only destroyed the prisoners physically but emotionally as well. Night reminds us to never forget the evil and the inhuman actions that were taken upon these innocent people-for if we forget, it may happen again. Wiesel writes the novel as an account of his personal experience, but it explains how everyone was treated and how everyone was affected. Wiesel portrays very honestly and very clearly that the [...] destroyed these people. The [...] treated their prisoners as animals, and due to this treatment the prisoners lost their faith, their families, and themselves.It is hard to believe that such an incredible portrayal of an evil of this measure could fit into roughly one hundred pages. Wiesel did not go into great detail on his personal emotions and thoughts about everything that was happening. He simply gave a frank explanation of what occurred there. The way he wrote it, however, was more eye-opening than any documentary could be. Night captures the horror, the torture, and the sadness of the Holocaust. It is important to read books like Night so that we may begin to understand what happened, and so that we can do everything in our power to prevent it from happening again. It mustn't have been easy for Wiesel to revisit these events while writing Night, but he wrote it to open our eyes to the evil that must never be repeated."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHT is a book so honest that you may not want to know about some of its evil truths, but can not force your eyes away from the page on which they are described. This novel is moving and disturbing, ugly and beautiful. It depicts evil and suffering in such a way that, though so difficult to believe, makes it an absolute treasure to read.The blatancy and plain truthfulness of the novel allow for it to be heart-wrenching, but not to an exaggerated extent. The fact that it is strictly an account of happenings, not a diary filled with feelings, gives the reader an appropriate amount of emotions without being too emotionally draining. Wiesel leaves it up to the reader to form his or her own opinions and feelings about the events. I believe that a story with this much gravity cannot be written in any other way. The way that this entire book is configured and stylized is absolutely perfect and I wouldn't change a single thing. It takes a hold on you, such a hold that it will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\", written by Elie Wiesel, was and incredible story of the journey of a young boy and his father throughout the Holocaust. This book helped me to further understand the brutal treatment of the Jews during World War II. The author did a great job emphasizing the horrible conditions the Jews had to live through such as the referral to the freezing temperatures and the lack of clothing. This book gave me a clear understanding that the Holocaust was a horrible time for all. The Germans had such a large affect on the Jews that author Elie Wiesel described how the Jews changed quickly in order to survive or make things better for themselves. Many young boys disowned their fathers if it meant an extra portion of food. This was an incredible book and should be read by all. To me, the last sentence of the story was excellent; the book couldn't have ended any better."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is deservedly a modern classic work, recently brought to the public eye by being an Oprah book selection.From his own experience, Elie Wiesel takes us into one of the most nightmarish places of all time - a W W II era concentration camp. We see and sense the brutality and despair there, and at one particular moment, we also learn the answer to the question, \\"Where is God?\\"Wiesel answers the question the way that millions of believers answer it: God is here, suffering.Yet, you must read this book to put the profound and memorable answer in the proper context. Know that when you do, it will stay with you forever, not as a note of despair, but as a note of hope amid sorrow.This is a book that transecends differences and speaks to the human condition in a way that uplifts the spirit.If you find this review helpful you might want to read some of my other reviews, including those on subjects ranging from biography to architecture, as well as religion and fiction"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think it would be safe to say that everyone, in their lives have said a jew joke or race related joke. Hell, I know that in my 16 years I certainly have. Recently, we read this book in my 10th grage English class, and did a two week unit on the Holocaust. Let me tell every single person reading this review that it COMPLETELY changed my views on racism and hate in our world. First \\"American History X\\", and now this.This book is written by a real holocaust survivor named Eli Wiesel. Elie does a fantastic job of painting the true life horrors of the holocaust into this book. In fact, this book disturbed me on many different levels. It is a fantastic journey into the tragic history of our world, of the cruelty that man can commit on fellow man, and how one prophecy of hate can go a long way without anyone peeping a word of rebellion.I would recommend all and any 15 and 16 year olds read this book. You will see that one little joke, can mean so much more than you really think. It's unbelievable how one two week unit can change a young mans perception on life, but I strongly suggest, to all teachers, or parents reading this review, GET THE HOLOCAUST TAUGHT IN YOUR CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS! We cannot have this happen again, and we can't say \\"Oh it wont, it can't\\". IT CAN, if we let it. Stop spreading hate, no race is better than any other, and we all need to respect each others beliefs and culture. The holocaust must be remembered, and in the words of a 13 year old girl preaching hate on ABC a few weeks ago, \\"I think the slaughter of 6 million Jews is a little bit of an exaggeration, I mean, there weren't even 6 million Jews back then\\".... All I have to say is Bull, get your kids to read this, let them know the truth.Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the horrific tale of a young religious Jew who is transported from Ghetto to Internment Camp. He watches the people he loves get torn apart from him and questions his faith in a God who could allow such violence within human nature.The violinist playing Beethoven (which was forbidden for Jews to play) as he dies is one of the most moving stories that I've ever read.Wiesel has captured his pain without weighing down the reader with the depth of his personal tragedy, simply telling the story. The author earns your respect but never asks for your pity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As a tenth grader, I read many books whether it be for academic reasons or my own pleasure. NIGHT has made a substantial impact on me unlike any other book I have read. Elie Wiesel does a wondeful job of portraying actual events from an adults point of view while sustaining his childlike innocence. This book may also be enjoyable to readers who seek books with historical accuracy and depth. I recommend this book to any reader who is emotionally stable and mature enough to handle the graphic words of Elie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It goes without saying that this is a depressing book since it deals with the Holocaust, and it has every right to be. And it's not just depressing in the personal, individual sense, but in the existensial, nihilistic, \\"THERE IS NO GOD\\" sense. Again, if any one of us went through what Weisel did, I can't say we'd draw different conclusions.Weisel writes in this way in order to force humanity to deal with the horror of the Holocaust, and again, I can't fault him for doing this. But while Night deals with the total absence of good in the world, it needed a companion to show the restoration of faith, not just in religion, but also in the human spirit. \\"The Gates of the Forest\\" is that necessary companion.Although \\"Gates of the Forest\\" is fiction, it is a very profound and moving story about the restoration of faith after the Holocaust. I would in no way discourage anyone from reading Night, but I believe the two books should go together to make the components of a single story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"l am a Christian and was absolutely stunned by this book. To read -and more importantly to re-read and reflect - about the trials and tribulations of a devoted Jewish family as they went from a loving, religious/spiritual home to a ghetto, then to the railroad yards, then to a Concentration Camp...is to be transported to a nightmarish journey and world that must never be taken for granted, that must be understood deeply, and which must be respected with our hearts more than with our minds.To criticize any victim of the Holocaust for doubting or questioning their G-d is to live in a fantasy world. Unless one has lived through the horror and degradations of the Holocaust, he should be quiet. As for me, whenever l see or think of the child-victims and their parents of those terrible days, l think of me and my own children in their place...and it keeps me very humble."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHT is the true story of what Elie Wiesel went through during the Holocaust, written by the man who, as a teenage boy, witnessed the atrocities first-hand and somehow survived. This is his story; it is also the story of the millions who experienced the horrors of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, by far the biggest and most notorious of its kind. It is a short read (only about 110 pages for the paperback version, which I have had for the past 15 years); however, it tells you pretty much everything you would need to know, at least on a *basic level*, about what happened to ordinary, innocent people in Europe between 1939 and 1945---people whose only crime was to be born in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It is the story of young Eliezer, a studious and faithful Orthodox Jewish boy living in Hungary, who, along with his family and everyone else he knows, is taken by the Nazis and transported to Auschwitz. The horrors that befell him as a victim of the evils of hate and intolerance tried him physically, emotionally and spiritually---causing him to question his faith, and the God in which he had so fervently put his faith.NIGHT offers a harrowing journey through what is still the most misunderstood period in 20th Century world history. It provides no easy answers, but provokes plenty of thought and discussion. It needs to be required reading for all American public school students entering Middle/Intermediate/Junior High School---if only to ensure a basic understanding among the future generations of what the Holocaust was, so that one day, we may all learn to prevent such travesties. Unfortunately, we're not there yet, but one day, God-willing, maybe we will be.MOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 11 & UP"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book for my Honors English class last month, this book is a serious read that I had to finish it in one sitting. The authors story is very tragic, he knows how to definatly tell a story while still providing us with an unbiaest discription of life in the concentration camps. Even though this is a very short book, you quickly pick up on the characters personalities, strenghts and weaknesses. By the end of the book when his father dies, you come to realise Night is more than just a book, its a history of millions of people who died because of their beliefs."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read some chapters of this book when I was in Hebrew school. I was not even 12 then. I am forever haunted by the portion of how Mr. Wiesel described how he saw his sister being lead away with their mother and how he never saw her again.I come here to find marvolous reviews that this book deserves. But my heart breaks at the how many of these reviews complain about this story, discredit this story. People have reviewed this book saying that what happened to 11,000,000 people (Jews, Catholics, homosexuals, invalids, men, women, children, and infants) never exited. That it was a lie.11,000,000 people were murdered.11,000,000 innocent lives.Try to explain to me how 11,000,000 people upped and vanished.Try to explain what Mr. Wiesel saw when he was just a young boy.This book is gruesome and graphic because what happened to him and to the rest of the 11,000,000 lives that were snuffed out was gruesome.People say that Anne Frank's story is better. But we only hear of her life in hiding. We never hear of the torture she went through in that concentration camp. How she died, a mere month before freedom came.Elie Wiesel survived and he tells this story so we cannot forget. So we cannot deny. That man can be a hideous and wretched creature. That people will throw babies into the air and shoot them.

It is a book about a jewish boy who was sent to many diferent concentration camps. He went day by day not knowing if he would survive to see the next. I think that people should read this book because unlike other books Night, made me want to keep on reading. I thought it was a thrilling and yet horrifying story because it talked about how the German soldiers in reality treated the jews and what this young boy experienced having to see his friends and family get thier rights ripped off and being separation from their families. I suggest anyone who wants to think that this crime against jews never happened to look into this book and see how these people's life got turned upside down and will never get to be themselves again because I know this book has changed my opinions towards jews."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found Elie's autobiography superb. His eye-opening reality was an excellent comeback to the skeptics. To use the words \\"boring stuff\\" would be an ignorant and ridiculous look at the novel. For those who haven't thoroughly looked at the events of Auschwitz, Ravensbruck, and the other sites of Hitlar's evil. To find this horrific history mild would be ignorant. This book shows the dehumanization and inhumane treatment of the prisoners beat around like livestock by the Kapos (German officers).

I found this book difficult to read because Elie Wiesel graphically describes the horrors of the holocaust. He gives a graphic description of people , especially children being thrown into the furnace at Auschwitz. The cruelity of the Nazis were purely barbaric. In the book Elie Wiesel describes his conflict with God amonst the suffering of his people. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to fully understand one of humanities darkest period. Six million people were murdered because of blind hatred."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Obviously, I agree with most of the things said by the other reviewers. What grabbed me, though, is this: the importance of hunger. How when you are starved enough, it really stops mattering how many people are being killed around you or even whether people are beating you up. Reading this reminded me that, even in the midst of all the terrorism and other terrible things that are going on in our world, material abundance (or at least a full stomach) is really nothing to sneeze at."},{"Title":"Night","review":"&quot;Night&quot; is Elie Wiesel's autobiographical short novel of life and death in a concentration camp. There is little plot and character development. Part of the terrible treatment of Jews by the Nazi thugs is denial of identity. The men become nameless, almost faceless, walking corpses. Each prisoner has their number tattooed into the flesh. Elie is A-7713. Death is postponed by ingesting food rations and remaining silent. As Elie's father lay dying, a tough-minded fellow prisoner admonishes Elie to eat the food he saved. Giving it to the dying man is futile. Elie's first duty is to save his own life by whatever means necessary. Survival transcends family relationships. The cost of survival combined with the death of innocence is the theme. The injustice suffered by the Jews is horribly real, but not a revelation. Enduring Auschwitz and Buchenwald scars the mind forever. Survival does not mean victory. After liberation by the American Army, the daylight of Elie's life changed into perpetual night. Elie loses his faith after he suffers mind-numbing horrors in tandem. Elie rages against the seeming indifference of Heaven. His dedication to the Eternal disappears as the black smoke curls above the ovens of Auschwitz. How can a just God seem to stay idle before such godless acts? This is not light reading, and &quot;Lest we forget&quot; is hardly original. However, as new generations drift frivolously along, a reminder of basic truth is appropriate. Read and ponder. ;-)"},{"Title":"Night","review":"In form like a novella that rises at points to the level of poetry, this book's content comes, however, straight from Hell. A good first book for someone learning about the Holocaust, and also good for scholars of the period to reread occasionally to be reminded of the fundamentals of their subject. Superb."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It's hard to imagine something as awful as being a Jew during the holocaust. That's what this book is about. Night, by Elie Wiesel, was a moving story about Wiesel's personal experience of life in a concentration camp. Night had a very interesting plot. Something was always happening in the story, so there were no boring moments. It used such good details that it made you feel more connected to the story, like you were there. \\"At the place of assembly, surrounded by the electrified barbed wire, thousands of Jews gathered, their faces stricken.\\" Wiesel paints a clear picture of what this scene looked like. The book also had good character development. Wiesel described himself well, without saying directly what he was like. \\"I continued to devote myself to my studies.\\" Wiesel chose these words rather than just saying that he liked to study. That helped make a better idea of how he was. I think the most important thing about Night is it's meaning. The holocaust is a very sensitive topic but I think it's important for people to know about it and try to understand what these people had to go through. I think that this book shows it better than any other book that I have ever read. This book really made me think about how actual people had to go through this. Sometimes when I was reading, it would seem like fiction and I would all of a sudden realize that everything I was reading was true. Night showed how horrible it was for the millions of people that suffered through the holocaust. It was especially detailed because it was from someone that had been through it all. This made this book even more touching. Night was incredibly powerful to me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A long dissertation-like review of this book is not necessary. Buy this book and read it. Your outlook on life will never be the same. Your views toward human-kind will never be the same. You will never be the same."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had this book recommended to me by my pastor and I am glad that I read it. At only 109 pages it goes very quickly. But this book is so wonderful. Because the Holocaust was such a dastardly event in human history, any book will capture its brutish and disgusting nature, but this small book somehow goes one step further. I honestly felt as though I was observing the Holocaust take place because of the vivid details and vocabulary Wiesel uses. My soul ached (and still aches) for the suffering of the Jews, and more specifically, the Wiesel family. Wiesel takes us from his home in Transylvania to the Nazi death camps and explains in agonizing detail how he got there and what it was like once he arrived.I consider this book to be in the &quot;Must Have&quot; section of anyone building a personal library. I was crushed and humbled while reading this book and it made me appreciate so much the freedom that we have today in this country.If you are looking for a book that will really help you to understand what the Holocaust was about, read this. And if you want a book that will make you content with your life, again, read this. It seems like most anyone who reads this book is amazed by the personal strength of Wiesel, who really symbolizes all Jews who made it through that awful time in mankind's history. This book will make the Holocaust so real to anyone who would read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I've tried to think about how I wanted to review this account of a fifteen year old boy's suffering in several concentration camps during the last six months of WWII. I was shocked as I have always been since I first learned about the holocaust when I was about ten years of age. No matter how many articles, books, or movies that have revealed this experience, I find it impossible to comprehend the behavior of the the German Gestapo, SS, and so many soldiers, doctors, and others. In this volume, Mr. Weisel tells the reader that after months and months of near starvation, some of the guards throw pieces of bread into one of the &quot;cattle&quot; cars that holds people that are dying from the cold, starvation, dysentary, etc. The guards were entertained, and laughed as if watching a slap stick comedy, while these tortured people were fighting each other, some to the death, for a piece of bread to chew. Some of the previous reviewers commented that they could not fight other prisoners for food, let alone a &quot;loved&quot; one. I am grateful I've never had to find out what I would be like if I had been so brutually exploited. I hope that I could &quot;rise&quot; above it, but there is no way I could ever begin to know without the experience. It isn't something I want to think about. But I can think about the importance of the people who survived and the importance of their writings, the survivors who have chosen to do so. I have read some reviews of this book which &quot;compare&quot; this account with others. &quot;This one&quot; was better because of... That one was more....&quot; I don't know how a reader can compare one person's suffering in a concentration camp with another. My belief is it is another story that needs to be shared. They all suffered; they were all brutalized. I personally don't think one is better than the other. Just true. This account is extremely vivid. As a mother, I am most grateful that I have never had to experience such horrors with my child. But brutality is happening to mothers' children everyday, right now, as I write."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I personaly thought that the book Night was a very good book.

Elie Wiesel definately, and magnificentally captures the horrors faced by him, and millions of others each and ever day of &quot;Hell.&quot; What Elie feared most was when the German Soldiers came in to spot check them. They would pick out the scrawniest jews. They would unfortunately be sent to the creamatory. This process it what almost sent Elie to insanity. One day, at Auschwitz, Elie had lost all faith in getting out of the camp. He even questioned if there was a God anymore. On Elie's last day of faith, the day that he was going to give up, something wonderful happened."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked this book. It was heartwrenching, very detailed, and graphic.He told about what is was like to be a Jew during the Holocaust.I gathered that it was nothing but a living hell.

I would reccomend this book to anyone wanting to lean about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book definately demonstrates Elie Wiesels excellence in literature. This magnificent book captures the horrors that Elie, and millions of others faced during the Holocaust every day. Once in a while, officers came in to the camps to pick out the scrawny jews.

It was a long but enjoyable book. Mostly i liked how the author new when to use details of his experience, but towards the end of the book, it seemed that he had forgotten the rest of the story. Parts of this book are extremely violent (i.e. burning bodies and the dumping of children's camatose bodies into large mass graves). Most of the carachters are likeable and you can really get into this book, for me it was hard to put down and i easilly got lost in it. When something bad or good happened you could really picture it in your mind. this is a great book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought this book was realy good. One thing about it was that it was very detailed. One of the very detailed parts of this book was when elie was telling us about the little boy that was hung and still wasnt dead he just hung there dieing slowly.That part of the book was one of the most detailed parts. I rated this book four stars because of the detail of it and it told what realy happend during the holocost by one of its survivors. I thought it was realy cool how elie and his father stuck together for so long and never go seperated during the whole ordeal. This was a realy good all around book.Matt curtis"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is an pretty good book and it had a lot of good parts on it so the aurther is a pretty good wrighter.

I didn't like the fact that they are just to young or to old they kill them it made me sick when they were walking through the allie they seen thease people impaild with the long poles.

It doesnt matter if you are into the nonfiction or fiction this should be read for information on what people had to go threw in the halocaust.\\"Night\\" is about Elie, a normal jewish boy living in a small town with his family, who gets sent to a concentration camp. While at the camp Elie, his father and thousands of other jews have to learn how to coup with there new life in the camp.

They give us many false hope when reading. The hope of beeing set free and that doesnt happen, that they could be treated better, or that they would be rescued.There was a bombing of the concentration camp wich gave them a big sign of false hope. There was only one casulity in this rescue attempt. The attempt was not a sucess.Another Rescue attempt was made be the Russians. All the Jews were woken up in the middle of the night a forced to make a long journey to another camp. The Germans were afraid to loose control of the Jews to the Russians.There was a lot of religon use in this book. \\"Where is God now?\\" is a quote that really touched me in this book. The reason that I touched me is because they say that God is the contorler of everything. If God cared so much about all these people and let them die for beliving in him what is going to happen to the rest of us. What I mean by this is the people that dont go to chuch everyday and are not total devoted to god but still believe in him?Elie used very descriptive language throughout almost all of the book until his father died. The way he spoke in the book towards the end of the book became short and abrupt. Just gining details and not descriptions of emotions and scenes. Even with the abruptness you coulld still feel the pain of Elie and know what he was going through.In conclusion i feel that this beek was very interesting. It made me feel for the prisoners. I dont think that the Jews should havebeen treated like that just because of their religion. I do recoment this book because to me it was very touching. I also think that this book is very realistic in the way Elis described his thoughts and feeling which made it very more intersting."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Where is god\\" Was a contravoersy of the book itself, and people reading it.This book was about a 15 yr old boy named Elie, that was deported to a concentration camp, his family was seperated, he was under pressure. He was holding on to life for his father sake, he didnt want to leave him all alone.This book had some very good points and some very disapointing points. It was almost to graphic for anyone under 18 to read, and its not because there is undesirable language, which there is, but there is parts in the book where they are talking about throwing infants into the air and shooting them.Now, we were told to read this book as a greade, so that was ok, but HAVING to read it and WANTING to read it are two very diffrent things.It was a good book because it showed and told what the holocaust was really all about. The book was tightly based on the holocaust, and it was relevently good that he told about the shootings and the violence to give us a panaramic view of everything that was going on.It was almost to descriptive in the volent parts, it could have been toned down. This book is good for historians and actually is good as a teaching tool.So, i recomend that you read this book if you already know about the violence that happened in the holocaust, that way it wont make you sick to your stomach, which it will if your not prone to stuff like this."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I read this book it made to think that how grateful each of us should be for all the blessings that we have.The world is such a better place to live after the end of those brutality and hopefully the world is never going to see those dark days again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is defintely one of the most powerful books I have ever read.

This book really made me think about things like genocide and how we should try to stop it completely."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book, Night, made me think a lot about life. In it, Elie described his feelings and emotions of what was happening when he was in those camps. He shared his feelings with the world for all to know. That was a lot to share, since so many terrible things happened. I almost cried when I read of Elie and his father being seperated from his mother and sister and then being shown the burning pit, hoping with all his might that he wouldn't have to end his life there. So many many times did he face death. When he was starving for the 100th time, and he felt he couldn't go on. Then he thought of his father and he knew he had to survive. He thought a lot in those camps, and he reasoned that God was not on his side, that he was not there for him. I felt that this was an exceptional book. It gave us a glimer into what life was like for all those innocent people, and it showed us that we should hate those Germans for what they did, for they are without a dought, some of the most evilest people to ever walk the earth. They would do terrible things to those people, just for fun!

The questions that I require them to ponder are thought provoking, and they must really examine human nature (often for the very first time). Elie was the age of my students during his period of imprisonment. Through the course of the work they examine their own relationships with their parents, their faith, their fear and pain, people who hate, and the inevitability of death. I am willing to bet that they will remember Elie Weisel for years to come. I thank him for his poignant honesty. Children need that."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that this book was very good. It seemed like it was a very accurate description of what life was like in the concentration camps. NIGHT showed the true and absolute horror that everyday life brought the prisoners. It told how some of the prisoners still showed courage and compassion towards others while most of the other prisoners were greedy, selfish pigs. I think that it should be a required reading book for High School classes and that everyone should read it at least once in their life to know the horror that the Holocaust brought. This book is very quick reading and has a nice, flowing plot and story line."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really enjoyed reading Night. It helped me to understand what really happened during the Holocaust, and what it was like to see it from an inside view.

I will always remember Elie's experiences and the impact that it had upon me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'm in the 8th grade, and had to do a book report on the Holocaust and compare it to the Diary of Anne Frank. I thought that Night was a much more powerful and moving book.

He lives in the camp for many years and finally he is let out when thousands of people got out of it.This is a very good story I liked the way it was in first person and you really never discovered the young boys name. It had a lot of surprises in it like when the boy's family died and they got to celebrate the two holidays (Christmas and New Years). It taught me a lot of things I didn't know about the holocaust and I thought I knew a lot because we studied it very much of last year. I liked the climax usage as they made it more exciting through the book. The one thing I didn't like was that it had a lot of things that weren't needed like the part about the homosexuals and what not. That just didn't interest me and I wanted to throw the book away.I would most diffidently would recommend this book.

And altough it was a sad moment, it added a little atmosphere to the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Has anyone ever felt upset and confused just by reading a book? I have after reading the book night. I didn't like the book Night because I didn't like the concept of the story, it was a little blunt about something's, the mood was upsetting, and the plot was confusing. I never new what was going to happen.\\"Where is god, where is he, where is he? Here he is hanging from the gallows... that night the soup tasted like corpses\\". In this part of the story a little boy had just been hung. It was hard to get the image of the little boy being hanged so when Elle was eating his soup he couldn't really concentrate on the food it was more of what has just happened. It's like it was almost sickening. It was hard to just go on eating like nothing had happened when a little boy was hung and was forced to struggle for his life instead of dieing a quicker death.\\"She continued to scream, breathless, her voice broken by sobs\\". \\"Jews, listen to me! I can see a fire! There are huge Flames! It's a furnace!\\" In this part of the book the Jews has discovered that there was a furnace and that they were all probably going to die. They put to and to together and got that they were more than likely going to burn. To me this is just horrible I don't understand how man can turn on man... or mothers and children. The part that grossed me out the most was when they would take little children and bash there heads in so that they can die. The age of no death was 18 or older and if you were hurt or sick then they would be killed... in the furnace. It's not human like.\\"In the name of Himmler...prisoner number...stole during alert...According to the law...paragraph prisoner number... is condemned to death\\". I actually don't really no what this means. It was to confusing for me. I kind of understand just by reading the nest text but the point was that I didn't understand it which is another reason why I don't like the book night. It was confusing to me. It wasn't very clear on what It was meaning towards.So basically I didn't really enjoy reading the book night it wasn't something that I would ever want to read again. I liked it a little just for the fact of the history but it was just inhuman to me of what a person could do to another person. It's not a book that I would highly recommend but is some one wanted to read something like this then I would. It was historical but also sad and upsetting."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was ok, I like the way it was getting into the way things were back then. It made me think about how hard it would have been to live. I don't think I would have been able to do it. I would have had a different but that is about it. The ending was not as realistic as the the first part.I would change the end to make it more heartfelt. The purpose of publishing the book was to inform people how he way life was and the way people was being treated.My most memorable part of the whole book is how mean the people were and the feelings that people had for each other. There was no really big part that I liked liked but I can assure you that I will never forget this book and all the details."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was alright, but i've read better.

Will he try to do it? People die every day but not like this, this is the holocaust. I like the book because how there was strong violence in his imagery, how he had good irony in his story and the plot that raps it all up.He used good imagery, like in the quote on page. 52 \\"at first my father crouched under the blows, and then he broke in two like a tree struck by lightning and collapsed. I felt like I had to do something about stopping the abuser, when his dad was getting hurt, hearing the blows as the enemy's fist got closer to his face, I felt his pain.He used good irony like on page. 31 \\"Father,\\" I said,\\" if that is so, I don't want to wait here. I', going to run to the electric wire.\\" continued on page. 31.\\" Two steps for the pit we were ordered to turn to the left and made him go into the barracks.\\" I felt relieved to know that his dad was going to die because he meant so much to elowes, but he was going to go through the electric wire and go into the fiery pit before they were ordered to change direction. I could see the flames as they got closer, getting hotter and hotter and finally just turns.His plot makes it easy to know what's happening. Elowes was a boy; during Germany's rise he was token to a concentration. Camp, there he was poisoned but they always had to move the prisoners, then they were set tree he went to a camp site, and these were its left off.After reading night I was inspired to conclude the conclusion. Weasels use of irony was great, detailed descriptions, and the flow of the story line just rapt it up. It amazes me that humans could treat humans like trash, and keep them prisoner like dogs, it could really get to you, you know like not having any good, working all the time to survive, moving from on e place to another, it would destroy your brain! Night made me imaging what they went through like, being experiment on, not getting what you want, not having choices, and most of all they token away there freedom, night made me realized that you should be thankful for what you have, because people back then were tortured in ways that you could even think about. So just remember be thankful because you could have been one of those prisoners."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book was gory and it stank like my brothers socks.

I do have lone friend that is would recommend this to because she liek to read about true storys and what has happend in our past history in amarica. The reason i did not like this book was because I am a hores freak. My friends say that I eat, dream, and sleep horses. Which in most cases is true. Most the time when i read a book it has to do somthing with horse or i just not intrested in reading the book. Most my friends say that I will grow out of this thing I have with horses but they told me that four years ago and i still love horses. I will always be a horse freak.

That they killed babies that barely got to live. Throwing them in the air and shooting them, the old people got killed instantly for their age. It was also aginst the religon. I think religon should be treated the same and not treated badly. The people were treated badly and even killed. They were given very little food, never ran out of water, and were stripped down to nothing, but their belts. Most bad things about the book was that they were seperated. The people didn't know if their family lived or not. Some people were sent directly to gas chambers, they were killed instantly. The people had to se people hanged, burned, and gased. I totally think that was one thing that they should not have done, for the people who survied had those memories of the hanging, burning, and gassing. I hated Night. I do not recomend this book for young children. It has to much violence. This book would also be very sacreligous. That is what I think of the book Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book The Night was a very boring book, I really didn't like anything about it at all. If I where to be able to add on to the book, I would, because it was to short of a book for me. The chapters were kind of short, if they were to be a little bit longer that would of been better, because it would of made the book longer and better.I believe Elie's purpose of publishing the book The Night was to let people realize and believe the things that really went on in the 1940's. My most memorable part about the book was that Elie learned to sleep when he was running. I believe that would be kind of an interesting thing to do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think this book was alright because it kept dragging on about crazy people saying fire hen there is no fire. If I didnt know this was a true stroy I would say it was fake. I highly recomend that you read it for you slef. Theonly part I liked about the book is when the german officer beat his dads head in. The sickest part about the story is when one of the german officers raped one of the jewish chicks.

Like when he meats the girl and then he meats her when they were out of the camps and they talk that part lost me. That was mostly when i didn't like the book. I wouldn't recamend this to any person that likes action or to a person, that likes to be interested in the story the hole time.

The book Night written by Elie Wiesel, is a real story. I didn't like it. It is just not my kind of book.The book is not good at all. I didn't like the autobiography in this book. It was not very interesting. There were a few, but not much. Like when the instructor was mad at Elie. He yelled, \\"listen to me you bastard.\\" Just look at the bad language (Wiesel, page 56).I also didn't like his mood. He was too much about the nazi and stuff. It got boring after a while. Like \\"a-7713\\" (Wiesel, 49) that is my number. Its got no enthusiasm and is depressing.The setting is just one more of the problems with the piece. It is the same setting through the piece. Some bad guys/good guys, kill all the good guys of the planet. Like when he was getting whipped. The German officer counted \\"twenty four...twenty-five!\\" (Wiesel, 55). I could get that all I want on the TV and it would be better.The book Night is a real story. On the Nazi and Jews in world war 2. This book is real egicational about World War 2. Though if some one wants to read something good. Don't read this. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In a way I liked the book for the most part. I liked it because it was interesting and it kept my attention. But the way that the Jews were treated is enough to make anyone dislike this book. I don't understand how anyone could be so cruel. I can't imagine watching people get burned, or having my father die and not even have tears to cry for him. It is just so unhuman. What I did like about this bood is that it was very realistic. Everything that happened you could follow. It was in very good detail, almost too good It was at the point where you kind of felt like what was happening in the book, was happening around you. So I guess overall I would have to say I liked the book, but I hope I never have to read another one like it. If something like this ever happens again, I don't want to be around for it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel definitely has an agenda, and it doesn't make for entertaining, light-hearted reading. It's all Holocaust material. This one is technically a novel, but it so closely follows the author's concentration camp experiences that it's best to read it as if it's autobiography. Like Wiesel, his main character in Night is a piously religious teenager who, having survived the genocide that obliterated his family, suffers survivor guilt.There are no easy answers in this hard-to-read book, but it marks Wiesel's first step in his lifelong goal of bearing witness for those who died."},{"Title":"Night","review":"1 : The stars were only sparks of the fire which devoured us. Should that fire die out one day, there would be nothing left in the sky but dead stars, dead eyes.2 : I do not know if it has ever happened before, in the long history of the Jews, that people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves...3 : We had to throw our clothes at one end of the barracks. There was already a great heap there. New suits and old, torn coats, rags. For us, this was the true equality: nakedness."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHT I read the book Night by Elie Wiesel. This book was absolutely terrific. It is the intense true story about how Mr. Wiesel survived the holocaust and the many concentration camps he was in. In the beginning of the book Elie lives with his parents and his sister. They allow the German Nazi's to come onto there city without even questioning them. They befriend all the people in this camp and nobody even seems to notice anything different. Then one day all of this changes. The Nazi's begin to ship all of the Jews including Elie and his family out of there homes. They are packed onto trains and they continue there horrific train ride. They arrive at a concentration camp without knowing how long they have been gone. Elie's mom and sister are taken directly to the gas chambers while Elie and his father are placed into the camp where they remained for quite a while. I definately recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the holocaust or someone just looking for a good story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, Elie WieselElie Wiesel was born in Hungary in 1928. In 1944 his entire family was sent to Auschwitz. Wiesel survived until the Americans arrived at Buchenwald in 1945. Hours earlier the resistance movement attacked the SS guards with arms and grenades; the SS fled. After the war he moved to Paris and worked as a journalist for ten years. He moved to Israel and then to the United States where he became a Professor in the Humanities at Boston University. This book was first published in 1960.The first chapter tells of life in Sighet, a little town in Transylvania. One day the foreign Jews were expelled. Months later Moshe returned, he survived the slaughter and told them about it. But people refused to believe this warning in 1942. Life went on in 1943. In 1944 the Fascist party gained power in Hungary; German troops occupied Hungary. Then German soldiers arrived in town. Synagogues were closed, Jews had to turn in their valuables. Two ghettoes were created. Then the Jews were deported in cattle wagons to Aushwitz / Birkenau. Elie and his father were separated from his mother and sister, forever. Elie saw babies being dumped into a flaming pit1 \\"It was a nightmare.\\"The prisoners were stripped of their own clothes and given prison uniforms. The rest of the book describes the maltreatment and torture suffered by the prisoners. Each got a serial number on their left arm. Later some were transported to a new camp, Buna. Elie worked in a warehouse. He met a French girl who was deported as forced labor. There was an air raid and a bombing. He saw his first hanging. There was sabotage at Buna, an Oberkapo was taken away. A young boy and two prisoners found with arms were all hanged. Things got worse with winter. The Red Army was rumored to be advancing. Then they were evacuated. They marched in an icy wind for miles, snow fell. They reached Gleiwitz but received no food or drink. They ate snow. Cattle wagons brought them to Buchenwald. Elie's father died there. The Germans started to evacuate Buchenwald. But this ended before the Americans arrived on April 10, 1945. Prisoners wanted food, not revenge."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel takes place in Sighet, Transylvania, a Jewish community. The main character, Elie, lives with his father, mother, two older sisters and one younger sister. The year the story takes place is 1941, and Germany is starting the holocaust. Elie is 12 years old, and him and his father take a journey through the holocaust as victims.The main theme in the story is individual versus society. Elie is constantly battling with himself against the German society, and he nor anyone who was a victim of the holocaust can understand why the Jewish population was exterminated. Another common theme is living with death. In the book, 10 people that Elie knew are killed over 10 different nights.This was a very good book, and I would recommend it to almost anyone. It is a short book, yet packs a good amount of information, and is an excellent portrayal of the worst of human society. The book flows very well, and is very easy to understand as well. So pick up this book, it is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After honoring his vow of silence for ten years, Elie Wiesel first published a Yiddish version of his Holocaust story in 1956. An English translation of the shortened French version of Night appeared in 1960. Night is a series of memories, there are many cases where either \\"forgetting\\" or \\"remembering\\" plays a significant role in the narrative:At Buna, Elie is beaten by Idek the Kapo and a young French girl comes to his aid and tells him to keep his anger and hatred for another day. Years later, Elie Wiesel recalls running into her in Paris. They reminisce about the days in the concentration camp. Such memories are hard to forget.Elie cannot forget the smile his father shows him even in the midst of his suffering. \\"I shall always remember that smile. From which world did it come?\\"\\"Yet another last night. The last night at home, the last night in the ghetto, the last night in the train, and, now, the last night in Buna.

After reading a short summary, I really didn't think she would like this book. To dark and full of history that I was sure she couldn't handle (my wife unfortunately doesn't know much about history). I ordered it anyway (the audio version, we both drive a lot) and figured if she doesn't like it that's ok, she can move on to another book. Myself, I love history. And I truly remember everything we learned in school about the holocaust, as well as watching shows on the history channel. Of course, when I was young I read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\". It had been a very long time since I re-visited this topic. She loved it. I loved it. She learned. I learned. She cried. I cried. Elie Wiesel did a great job with this book.

Share it with others..."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A captivating story right from the first word of the book. It truly is \\"a slim volume of terrifying power\\". Appropriately, it's written in a very straight forward way. The reader will just flow along with every word, every sentence, every paragraph, and every chapter.In the book, people made \\"optimistic speeches\\" and devised reasons for their being evacuated from their homes into ghettoes - a type of denial not uncommon in oppressed populations. \\"Night\\" should teach every single person that genocide can occur anywhere, and at any time, in any given unstable society. But above all, the book allows us to see the insecurity, hopelessness, uncertainty, and vulnerability of the Jewish people at such a tumultuous time in their history.\\"Night\\" moves fast. Its sentences are simple - without any embellishments - but the reader gets the complete message. As one reads on, the same question (which the author asks explicitly several times) resounds: Why does \\"He\\" let people suffer? Well...wouldn't we all want to know?As Elie and his father bravely go through the holocaust, we see not only its horrors, but a love that grows - the love between father and son, or even friends. It is a touching story that shows hope manifest itself at a time of despair. Every one must read this book. It has a voice; a voice that speaks volumes. It has a message - a message for every soul."},{"Title":"Night","review":"1. The book did a really nice job of explaining in detail how horrible the torture was for the Jews all throughout the Holocaust. I enjoyed how Elie did not hold anything back in his novel, and was very descriptive.2. I thought at some points he dragged out some ideas that he was trying to get at that never meant anything later on in the novel.3. I doubt I would want to change anything about the book.4. Elie published this book because at the time there were a lot of people who doubted the torture camps and concentration camps, and so he wrote it because he survived the horrible death camps and he wanted everyone to read about them and know the truth.5. The most memorable part was when they were leaving the ghetto and Elie's family was split apart. I can't imagine being split from my family, especially in a time of war and when I wouldn't know what was going to happen to any of us."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's Night is a recounting of the horrific effects of the Holocaust, not just on the Jewish community but on all mankind. The acts of atrocity committed in the death camps devastated people the world over and the suffering continues to this day.One example of the heinous acts committed occurs at the end of the war, when Wiesel and the rest of the camp of Buna were being forced to transfer to Gleiwitz. The transfer was a long, arduous journey for all. The weather was bitterly cold and there was a heavy snowfall. The distance the prisoners were made to walk was much farther than most people would ever dream of walking today, yet these people, human beings who were already in a weakened condition, were often made to run, and, if one collapsed or was injured or simply could no longer bear the pain, he was shot or trampled without pity or a second thought.One image of many that Wiesel will never forget is that of Rabbi Eliahou's son leaving the Rabbi for dead, pretending not to see how tired his father was growing and how far he was lagging behind the others. At that moment, Wiesel made the decision to never abandon his own father, even if staying with him meant certain death for them both.So adept were the German forces at breaking the spirits of the Jews that even Wiesel's faith in God, above all other things, so strong at the outset of the book, grows weaker as time goes on. When his father is knocked to the floor for politely inquiring as to the location of the lavatories, Wiesel does not strike back; he knows the punishment would be too great.The incident that had the most effect on the young Wiesel was the suffering prior to the death of a young boy. No one who could help cared to do so. Wiesel looked on, helpless and forlorn, questioning God about the reason for such atrocities. Then, as now, there appeared to be no reason, save for man's unbearable inhumanity to man. If the Jews ever saw even a ray of hope, they also saw that ray of hope destroyed. Fighting for everything they had, from their possessions to their dignity to their very lives, the result was always the same.At the end of the war, Wiesel looked into a mirror and saw &quot;a corpse.&quot; His body was, somehow, still alive, but he felt robbed of his very soul. It is feeling he shared with all Holocaust survivors, as well as with many Jews and non-Jews who felt, even indirectly, the effects of such naked brutality.The world was forever changed by the atrocities of the Holocaust and no one recounts the atrocities of those days with more emotion than Wiesel. Night is a horrific book, but it is also a tribute to the unbreakable spirit of man."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I read the book Night, I was so impressed because I was impacted by the things that the Jewish population suffered in the Holocaust. As I was reading Night, I was more interested in the book because I was learning different things that Elie suffered in the Holocaust during World War II. I can image how the Jews were suffering by the things that they believe and other people tried to exterminate them for the different background that they had. Some things that the Nazis didn't understand about the Jews were that they were very religious and they believed in only in one God. Some other things that I like about the book Night, was that this book was written by Elie that was in a real concentration camp with other Jews. Elie knows how the experience in real life, and how they were treated.

It is about his experience during the holocaust. Everything in this book will make you think and sympathize for the millions of people who went through all of this.

Elie, a young Jewish boy is growing up in a society filled with hatred; who is trying to survive in a concentration camp. As him and his father are fighting to live they have to go without food, see horrific acts done to their people, and witness people dying everyday. Elie is doing everything to stay with his dad to keep the only part of his family together now.

His image was changed drastically through the hardships of the concentration camps. He went from camp to camp with hope that they will be liberated, the days got long and there was no liberation for years.This story will captivate you and make you feel as if you were along this journey with him.

But how long will his fifty-year-old starving father last in Auschwitz?A short but powerful book, \\"Night,\\" puts the audience in Elie Wiesel's place, shows you what he sees, and even makes you feel what he feels. A quick read that will stay with you longer then most other books."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's autobiographical account of his life in the Nazi concentration camps, titled \\"Night,\\" is wonderfully written. Wiesel's use of imagery among other literary techniques is used adeptly, and in general, I was able to easily comprehend what he was trying to convey. There were few exceptions to this, though with a little brain power, most anyone could realize what he meant.The book's mood is quite sad and depressing, but how else would you be able to tell about life in a Nazi concentration camp? The Holocaust was a sad and depressing event, and Wiesel's emphasis on that is to show the realism of the events. Of course there was to be death. There were 6 million deaths, so if you are one to want to remain ignorant to these facts, then I do not suggest you read this. However, if you want to see how terrible these events truly were, then reading this book would be a good start.Also, Wiesel's writing of this book in first-person also emphasis the hardships he and those around him endured. When he wrote about the hunger he and the others endured, I was able to feel it as well. When he wrote of the losses he experienced, both physically and emotionally, I was also able to feel that.To conclude, I must say that this book was very moving for me, and that those who decide to read it (which I would highly recommend) should be aware that there is no happy ending, and that at that point in his life, there was no happiness."},{"Title":"Night","review":"if you are considering this book (which i highly recommend), you might want to go ahead and purchase the book which contains the two following books written by mr. weisel. you'll get a better deal for your money, and you won't have to wait for the others to be delivered to finish the story!my only complaint about this book was that i didn't already have the next two."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night is a text which comments on the brutal incidents of the Holocaust.It takes you emotionally, mentally, spiritually, and visually through the trials and tribulations of Jews and other unfortunate captives during this period.In the book Night, by Elie Wiesel, you get to live out the nightmare of the holocaust through the eyes of a 13 yr old Jew boy. This book really helps the reader visualize events by giving descriptive details of every element.It takes you through the happier times and the burdens of the father and son relationship.Throughout the book you will definetly notice the disrespectful oversight the SS officers, Gestapo, and ultimetly even the Jews have for a human life. From the emancipated lives to ones of bondage in the ghetto, from children being incenerated to the lenching of a single child, to the concentration camp and finally refuge, this book unquestionably takes you through everything.Night was very enlightening.

I wandered about this after I read the book Night. I liked the book Night because Wiesel used a lot of imagery. The plot was unexpected, and the plot structure was easy to follow.To attract the reader, Wiesel used a lat of detail or imagery as in \\"but we were mo longer afraid of death, at any rate, not of that death every bomb that exploded filled us with joy and gave us new confidence in life.\\" In my mind as I read the Quote, I pictured, bombs exploded, smiles on faxes because they know that they mite have a chance to live since the Germans were being killed by the U.S. and Russians.Along with imagery, Wiesel used irony to male the plop realistic and yet unexpected. Effective irony was used in Night, in the passage, \\"the eternal, lord of the universe the All-powerful and terrible was silent what had I do than him for.\\" (Wiesel, 31) at sees ironic- why would you be thankful to someone who is powerful and terrible but ironically does not use the power to save the people that worship him.The plot structure was really easy to follow, \\"the plot structure at the beginning got me interested in the meddle it kipped my interested and at the end was sad but good\\"After reading Night, I was really impacted by Wiesel's use of irony, detailed descriptions and the flow of the story line.

During the middle of the book you start to feel that Elie's role to care for and help his father. But towards the end you see how he gradually understands that there is no more he can do for his father, and that he must use all of his strength to save himself. Also, Elie doesn't want to be like the other boy, who abandoned his father, the Rabbi, trying to make it so he doesn't have to care for him. I also enjoyed this book because it talked about a question that I had always wondered. What did the people think of god when they were in the concentration camp? The story tells that Elie gives up on god but yet, he still says the prayer for the dead, and during Yom Kippur, he prays as well. Others felt god was testing everyone just as he had done in Egypt before. Overall, I feel that this was a great book and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about a different perspective of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book for school and I think it was one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"To say that we comprehend on any level what Elie Wiesel endured seems blasphemous! We are nothing more than tourists as he guides us deep into the darkness where one might catch a passing glimpse of the Angel of Death; Someone Elie was once intimate with. We however, can merely set the book down, blow out the flame, cry in the darkness and the journey is over. For Wiesel, the burning never ends."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In Night, Elie describees the pain and suffering that he and millions of Jews experienced hunder Hitler's regime at the Auschwits and Buchenward . Elie was liberated from Buchenward on 1945. Elie not only tells his story about suffering with eloquence, but he also describes it so vivid that he makes the reader aware of all the feelings and emotions Elie experienced, his lost of innocence, his separation of his family, his separations from his father and friends and his lost of his faith. Night really impresed me and even changed me as a person. I am more sympathetic now to people that are suffering, for example, I brought flowers to a wife whose husband is having an operation in his abdomen due to his addiction. Also reading Night reaffirms that life is very precious, for instance, I work with pregnant teenagers to persuade them to keep their unborn child by helping them to realize that their baby could become a President of United States of America, a novel prize scientist, or a famous musician or writer. I am grateful for the opportunity that I had to read Night by Elie because of the impact that it had in my life. He has made me become a more compassionate person. I am a better person today than I was a year ago. Thanks Elie."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night takes readers on a journey that shows how the Nazis executed their &quot;final solution&quot; of the Jews during World War II. Elie Wiesel was a twelve years old Jewish boy when Nazi took over Sighet, Transylvania. Wiesel was a well educated boy who came from a religious family but World War II changed him into a completely different person. After what he had been through, he lost his faith, like many Jews, and doubted the existence of God. Wiesel was separated from his mother and his younger sister, but remained with his father in the concentration camp. With his own eyes, he witnessed and experienced how Nazis tormented the Jews. His heart was shattered when he saw babies burnt to death in a pit and many other horrors, which have left a permanent scar in his heart.&quot;Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed.Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of children whose bodies I saw turned into wreath of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames, which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never&quot;.Night shows us the cruelty of war and how it can ruin the lives of many souls and, most importantly, their beliefs. Night reminds us of the peace and harmonious lives that most of us take for granted."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I feel that this book, though it can be quite grusome and depressing at times is a necessary window into the horrors and attrocities of the Holocaust. What I think made this book more intresting than most other books on the Holocaust was &quot;Night&quot; wasn't just throwing facts about how many people died, but it was filled with emotion and feeling. It wasn't untill I read this book that the full impact of the Holocaust finaly hit me. The vivid descriptions of the internal conflict going on withen Elie moved me in a way no other book has. I think that everyone should read this book, as it is the first thing I have read that has shown me how horrible things truly were in the concentration camps. The world must hear of Elie's story, for if we forget, we could let it happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a comprehensive view of the holocaust, it tells in terrifying details the horrors that occurred. Elie Weisel, the author, is also the subject of the selective autobiography. It all begins in a Jewish ghetto, during the beginning of the holocaust. Elie and his family are taken to a concentration camp despite warnings by Mosh the Beadle, a mystic that was taken, and escaped and returned to warn his family and friends. At the first camp Elie and his father are sent to work. Elie and his father are sent to many different camps always worrying if they would be split up or not. Along the way they witness many horrors such as a child being hung before thousands of people and not being heavy enough to die immediately, a man giving up his life for an extra ration of soup, a child leaving his father because his father is weak, and even more. Every horror of the holocaust is told in this sad autobiography. Night is easily one of the best books I have ever read. It was very sad and some of the details used made me sick. The reason I enjoyed it so much is because it was a comprehensive view of the holocaust, not a \\"Disney version\\" of it. It allows people to see what really happened, feel their pain, and their hopes. This book is a must read for teenagers and older, but I would not recommend it for children because of the gruesome detail used in describing the German atrocities."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Don't read this book in public as you will find yourself in tears. It is powerful and moving and heartbreaking. It is also the only book I have read that prompted me to write a letter to the author about how it affected me. I will not forget these things"},{"Title":"Night","review":"In Night, Elie Wiesel brings to life his abhorrent account as a prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp in World War II. The experiences he describes are horrifying, but true. The book was well written and had excellent historical detail. Because of this, I found book was difficult to put down. The book begins during World War II in Transylvania, where the Wiesel family lived a pleasant life. One day in nineteen-forty-two the Germans invaded their city and expelled all Jews, including the Wiesel family. Eliezer and his father were separated from his mother and sisters. He and his father were sent to work in Nazi concentration camps until the end of the War. He found that life in these camps was difficult. He had to work all day just to get small portions of food. If he did not work he would be shot or burned in a furnace. The main character in this story is the author, Eliezer Wiesel. Elie was a fifteen year-old boy at the time. He frequently questioned why God would punish the Jews in this way, but never received an answer. In the concentration camps, Eliezer worked hard and tried to do the best he could so he would not be killed. Sometimes he and his work group were directed to travel to different camps because the Russians were closing in on the Germans. During these movements they would march and sometimes even run to these far away camps. Whoever could not keep up would be shot. Eliezer's ordeal ended with the liberation of his camp by the Americans in nineteen-forty-five. At the time of the liberation he was the lone survivor of his family. Like thousands of others, his mother, father, and sisters were victimized by the cruel Nazi policy. As a teenager living in Sault Ste. Marie, MI., it is difficult for me to imagine living in a concentration camp like Eliezer Wiesel. I can understand why he would question his faith in God. It is important for young people to learn about the cruelty that was inflicted against the Jewish people during World War II. Overall, this was a great book. It showed me a glimpse of what happened to Jewish and other ethnic groups during World War II. This book had excellent historical detail. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading about World War II."},{"Title":"Night","review":"by: Elie Wiesel The book I have read and review on has touched may people in many different ways. The book was called Night by Elie Wiesel. The book was a autobiography that tells a story about a family and their struggles through the holocaust. The story takes place in the camps at Auschwitz, Buna, and Burchenwald. This book hit me very hard, one of the quotes that struck me was when Elie was working in the crematory and one of the workers said, 3Look over there, that is your grave2 meaning that he was going to die and be placed there pretty soon. It made me very angry to know how these people were murdered, tortured, and mutilated. By the ending part of the book Elie and many of the other Jews are being forced into the crematory by the Nazis. The book was all about Eliezer and his family. His father was a very strong, brave man who gives up hope towards the end because of all the torture. The book1s conclusion was very sad and dramatic as many Jews died. For Eliezer he was the only one to survey from his family. At the end, many of the Jews just gave up because of all there struggles, and Eliezer thinks in his mind, 3 my mind was invaded by this realization there was no more reason to live, no more reason to struggle,2 as he sees his father lying dead on the floor. As many more of the Jews still were alive, they all waited for the worst. As they hear a prolonged whistle split the air, the wheels began to grind and they think to themselves, 3we were on our way2 to the gas chambers as others come to fill their place. This book ends sadly as all the Jews face the deaths of their loved ones. As for Elie and his family, he1s the only one that made it out alive after the Russians came and released them."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Ive read this book multiple times in the past. I couldn't find my book so I wanted another, I love it!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"From the moment we had began on this book in our classes it was truly an eye opener. Words cannot describe the misery that was felt in each and every word this book had within. The book itself had casted night over all of us, especially me as we listened intently on what could be known as the most heart striking tale. From the start of the camp to the death marchings in the snow, the story gives a full eye account of the horror that was seen in the Nazi war. No story ever has been written so amazingly nor dramaticly as this. Yes, it touched me darkly and it burned deeply but this story, this story is something everyone should read because no one should forget what happened so long ago. You cant go your whole life without reading this book, its something that you should not miss.I give it a rating of five stars and I hope you, the reader, can also find that too."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the true story of Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. A religious Jew, Wiesel was a young boy during the German invasion. He and his family were taken captive by the Nazis and put into the concentration camps where he witnessed atrocities that destroyed his family and shattered his faith.Told simply and succintly, this first person account is haunting. Wiesel speaks with a numb detachment, sensationalizing nothing. He asks for no pity. He simply describes what he saw.It is only one person's point-of-view of perhaps the most important event in modern history, but his testimony feels as big as the Holocaust itself. That this is one of millions of stories that could be told is shocking again, even if you've seen movies or read other books on the topic. You come away from this book with a better understanding of what happened, and many unanswerable questions as to why it happened.As other reviewers have suggested, this book should be required reading for all high school students."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The author is such a good writer that you'll almost hear the squeak of rusty railroad cars along with muffled sounds of hopelessness from within as they roll down the tracks to the concentration camps.You can almost smell the odors of less than humane living conditions mingled with the acrid smoke from the crematoriums upon arriving at the death camps.You'll almost be able to see the look of death in the eyes of the living who have given up as well as the emaciated bodies of those whose suffering had finally ceased.You'll almost feel the nagging hunger pains of those who sometimes must go without food for days at a time and the bone-drilling cold ache of hands and feet not protected from the sub-zero temperatures.But you'll also sense the author's strong will to persevere the inhumane cruelties inflicted upon his people to return to the land of the living one day. He did survive and tells his story in a non-fiction selection that reads like a novel.\\"Night\\" by Elie Weisel relates the atrocities of the Holocaust through the eyes of a teenage Jewish boy. As in \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" and \\"Schindler's List\\", it's an unforgettable story that should never EVER be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book in school twice, and recently read it again for my own purposes. Wiesel writes not as someone trying to sell a book, but as someone who was tortured and saw his own family, loved ones, and strangers die for their faiths, beliefs, politics, and heritages. As a young man, this tested and nearly destroyed his faith: A battle that many of us struggle with in lesser ways. Elie Wiesels 'Night' is not just a story, but an epic and a reminder of the extent of human cruelty and suffering. An excellent book, not for younger audiences (12+) but a crucial part of any education, school age or older."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is a piece of living history that should never be forgotten. It is a great piece of historical literature, and it should be made mandatory for all high schoolers to read and study. I really enjoyed this book even though it was very deep and terrifying at some parts. I think that Elie's writing style is the only way that his message could have gotten across the way it did. He wrote the story very straightforward, without fluff, and told us about this horrible tragedy exactly the way he remembered it.I think that he may have lost some readers during the more graphic images that Elie wrote about. When he talked about the babies being burned alive, and when the child was hung and it took him almost an hour of hanging on the rope to slowly die. He witnessed the death of his innocence, hi family, and his God. I think that the only way for him to truthfully portray what he experienced in a digestible novel is exactly what he has written and we can never allow it to happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel, in my opinion, is a 5 star novel. The book was written as a first person account of the horrors of Nazi Germany and portrays a terror stricken boy struggling against a supreme and evil. The book is written in a very serious, informative manner. This was probably the easiest way for Wiesel to share his experience and not become too emotional. The serious tone adds to the grim story line as it follows a young Jewish boy through the ranks of a Nazi concentration camp. One of this book's strong points is its ability to paint a vivid scene in the mind of its readers. Wiesel spares no gory detail as he describes the methods used for a mass genocide. Something I would critique would be the blurry timeline of the story. However, this is easy to forgive as you could imagine there weren't many calendars around the camps.Being someone who has read this book on several occasions, I find it more and more chilling every time I read it. Elie Wiesel very effectively captures the deep depression and anxiety of the situation by using a lot of dialogue between prisoners. I feel like Wiesel wrote the Novel not in remorse but more in remembrance of those who didn't survive the camp. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the raw truth behind one of the world's worst crimes against humanity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Elie Wiesel is one of the most heart-wrenching and real novels that one may ever have the opportunity to read. It provides us with horrific images of the concentration camps and what the Jews went through from a direct account of the holocaust. Although some of the images are much too graphic for younger readers, this book should be read by everyone at some point in one's life. If we do not have the strength to realize the mistakes of an era, how will things ever get better for generations to come?For someone to say that this novel is too graphic or too controversial is simply ludicrous. As a society, it is important for us to see things, and really see them, not just look at them and say \\"Oh, that's too bad.\\" Elie Wiesel presents us with that opportunity in his well-written and honest work, Night. The last line of the novel, in my opinion was the most meaningful. Wiesel describes his body while looking at himself in a mirror for the first time in months. He describes himself as a \\"corpse.\\" This line gave me chills. It is as straightforward as one can get, and sums up the message of the entire novel in one overwhelming line. Nobody will ever truly understand the appalling events of the holocaust, but Wiesel is willing to tell his story to the world in the most honest and authentic way possible, he achieves this in Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had to read Night for my senior english class. It was short and easy to read. It took us about 3 days to read as a group. I found it to be a very good book. It has a different perspective than other Holocaust-related books I've read. It is a true story about a Jewish boy (Elie Wiesel) who was taken from his hometown, Sighet, and was transported by train to Birkenau. From there he was separated from everyone in his family but his father. He then tells of the horrifying and depressing things him (as a teen) and his father were put through during their journies from one concentration camp to another. It is very detailed and depressing, but I believe everyone should read this book. It tells the reader what really happened in some of the concentration camps. Everyone should know that the Holocaust actually happened, and that it isn&#65533;t just made up. Reading this book made me be very thankful to be alive and that I haven&#65533;t ever had to go through such pain. If you liked Anne Frank or Alicia: My Story, you'll like this book. You won't be able to put it down till the very end."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My name is Kimberly from a senior english class at Walla Walla High School in Walla Walla, Washington and I was assigned read the book &quot;Night&quot; by Elie Wiesel.This book was very good and I would highly recommend reading it. It explains the terrible truth of WWII leaving nothing out. Although this book is very tramatic, it explains information that every person should know. The lack of food, the freezing cold weather, the constant transfers and abusive attitude shown by the Germans are only a few problems the narrator faced. Overall, this is a book about the unconditional love of a boy for his father and the terrible things they go through to stay together.This book touched me and has changed my life. I appreciate my family, my friends, possesions and even food--most of which I take for granted. It is a short book, so you don't have any excuse not to take a little time out of your day to read this incredible book called &quot;Night.&quot;"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a true account of the Holocaust--the author holds nothing back. Unlike in other books about the Holocaust I've read, Elie Wiesel's Night made me realize how horrible the Concentration Camps really were. This book tells of the injustices done by the Nazis, the loss of faith during times of hardship, and how the human spirit can live on through even the most horrible of times.Even though there aren't very many happy moments in Elie's tale, this book is necessary if you want to gain an understanding of what the Holocaust was really like. If you're looking for an uplifting story, watch Life is Beautiful, but if you are looking for a book that tells the terrible yet true story of the Holocaust, read Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that this was a great book. The book was very discriptive and explained in good detail. This book touches ones emotions and shows how much the Jews had to go through and who they had to deal with. The stories and the detail also help to prove that the Holocaust did really happen. I did not fully understand how awful the German soldiers were and how mistreated the Jews were until I read ths book. Night really makes you think and really makes you appreciate what you have and to never take it for granted because at any moment it could be gone. There is a lot of evil in this world and this book proves that. This book also makes me proud to live in the United States and it makes me proud to be free. There was not much that I disliked about the book, this was a book that I did not want to put down. There isn't anything really that you could change about this book, it came from this mans own experience and he just wrote what he saw. Ellie wants to make known of what he and his family and friends had to go through. Many people believe that the Holocaust did not happen and Ellie just wants to prove that it did. My most memorable part was the part when his father died, to know how much he loved his father in the beginning and the fact that he had been through so much that ge couldn't even cry. That showed me what he went through and how much shock he was in."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was an accurate realistic view from an actual Holocaust survivor. Elie went through each agonizing experience of the concentration camp. The only thing I disliked about the book was the way it ended. I would have liked to have known about Elie's mother and sister and what happened to him after he was freed with no family if that was the case. I would'nt change anything about the book. I think that Elie published this book to give people a first hand description of what the Holocaust was about. The part of the book that was most memorable to me was when Elie and his father finally made it to the camp after the 42 mile run and Elie's father started to die. After all that he had been through to give up at the very end, that was sad. This was a very good book and I would definitly recommend it to anyone who wants read a nonfiction novel about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I loved this book, it was sooo good.

I really found this book very moving and heart touching.

Where are my grandfather's siblings and parents? Did they all vanish into thin air? And those numbers tattooed on my grandmother's arm? Did she request that at a tattoo parlor?

Without these details the story would not have the same affect. Wiesel's story was very informative and gave great insight to the events that took place.There is really nothing that I disliked. I think that there was really nothing to dislike because it was someone telling a true story. There is nothing that I would change about the book. To me, there is no way to change a book that tells a true account of someone's life.I believe that Wiesel published this book to give insight to what really went on. There are still many people today that believe that the Holocaust did not occur, and I think that Wiesel was making a point. Wiesel pointed out how cruel and unjust the Holocaust was and what it did to all that made it out of those concentration camps.I remember the very end of the book. The concentration camp that Wiesel was at was liberated and soon after he became deathly ill. Wiesel was in the hospital and finally had the nerve to look in the mirror. What he saw was a corpse before his eyes. Wiesel wrote that the image he saw was one that he will never forget, and that is the one thing I will never forget about this story.L. Mo"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was really freaking sad. I was in a happy mood one Wednesday morning. Then second period I sat down to read Elie Wiesel's Night, and I got really sad. But I really have nothing to moan about compared to Elie who actually went through the whole mess. Elie'e account of being taken from his home, then split from his family and transported to and from Nazi concentration camps, gives a rare in-depth perspective.I can't say I enjoyed reading the book, but I thought it was well written and in depth. I didn't like how sad the book was but what can you do about that, it was the Holocaust. You can't really change anything about this book, it was somebody's firsthand true account. Elie's purpose for publishing it was to prove wrong those people who deny that the Holocaust happened...."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that this was a great book. The book was very discriptive and explained in good detail. This book touches ones emotions and shows how much the Jews had to go through and who they had to deal with. The stories and the detail also help to prove that the Holocaust did really happen. I did not fully understand how awful the German soldiers were and how mistreated the Jews were until I read ths book. Night really makes you think and really makes you appreciate what you have and to never take it for granted because at any moment, it could be gone. There is a lot of evil in this world and this book proves that. This book also makes me proud to live in the United States and it makes me proud to be free."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book will not only open your mind but it will open your heart as well. Prepare to cry as you visulize some of the unhuman sites that are put into your head. At times in this book you will find yourself angry, times where you're affraid, times when you feel helpless, and times you feel pain. This book is hard to put down. I read it for the first time a month ago, and I've read it 3 times since. It's simply remarkable."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book &quot;Night&quot;, by ellie Wiesel, was a book about a boy who became a man much to quickly. He no longer felt pain or suffering.

His first-person narrative draws the reader into his own horror as he recounts the surreal events suffered through at the hands of Nazi Germany. Young Wiesel changes from a young boy eager to learn about his Jewish faith into an empty soul--a &quot;starving stomach&quot;--angry at the God he had once so revered, his eyes dulled from the suffering and death that permeates his every waking moment."},{"Title":"Night","review":"well reading the book was the most experience thing thet ever happened to me and it also changed my feelings towards others and i would like to say that what happened through the novel will never happen again and lets hope that these events may not occur in the future"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a must read for all of humanity, so as we shall never forget the real way in which fellow human beings were treated. This is a quick read, yet emotionally draining. Be prepared to be shocked, sickened, and repulsed by the true accounts of the holocaust. Every high school student should be reading this book in history class. Educate yourself and READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This novel by the wonderful Elie Wiesel brought to life many of the horrors that had been previously hidden about the Holocaust. He tells his story of the time he spent being shipped from camp to camp and how he was able to survive although many thousands died around him. He lost his faith in God but looked to those around him for the support he needed especially to his father. Wonderfully written and a must have for anyone interested in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a great book about what happened to a family during the holocaust. I was supposed to read it with my english class and got so intreauged by what Ellie had to say that I read way ahead of my class (not relizing it) and when the class was only half way through it I was done. I think this is one of the best books ever written about the holocaust and what happend at concentration camps, along with how people were treated. I definetly recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the holocaust. Here is a little did you know-- more than one half of the original was taken out of Night and what you read is less than half of the original story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book is so sad, its horrible to belive that people could do these things to other people"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a very disturbing book. Elie Wiesel is very fortunate to have survived the horrors of Auschwitz, surviving which must have given him such a zeal to live that he now charges in excess of 10 000 dollars a talk."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It was a very good book with many great details. Probablly not recommended for younger children. Makes you feel in the action."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a very well written story. It was written by a man who was once a young teenager in a concentration in Auschwitz, Buna, and Buchenwald. It is a story that tells what really went on in those concentration camps during the holocaust. Elie and his father were both transported from the ghetto to Auschwitz, along with his mother and sisters who were never seen again after the point of split up when they got off the train. This book will really get to you, and it is a little hard to understand but, htis is a must read book. I recomend reading this book just so that people can really understand what it was like and the horrible things that went on in the concentration camps. Hitler tried to say that being a Jew was a race, something that he could not prove. He tried to prove it though. So try to get your hands on this book becasue it is a must read and it is a really good bok!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Simply put, this is the most powerful book I have ever read. I am fairly desensitized to violence and have been to the Holocaust museum, so I didn't think that this little skinny book would get to me. It did. I had to read it for English, and I finished it in one night. As much as I wanted to put it down because it was so depressing, I couldn't. The writing is not fancy, but it's content conveys the raw emotions. I recommend this book to EVERYONE."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a book everyone should read. It's an amazingly written book. Anyone who is interested in World War 2 must read this book! Like The Diary of Anne Frank, Night is another outstanding documentary of World War 2!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book as a history assignment. I started reading the book, but I was not able to put it down. I read the whole book in one night, but I won't forget the story for the rest of my life. Elie Wiesel's story is easy to follow, I found that the book had good transitions from one chapter to the next. Each chapter shows what horrible things were happening to the victims of the Holocaust. This book wasn't anything like &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, as I thought it would be. I felt that this book told a more truthful, horrible story, than the one told by Anne Frank. If you read this book, you will not be dissapointed, your emotions may try to get to you, but that should not stop you from enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The personal struggles that the Jewish population endured is brilliantly shown here. I think that this book is so amazing because Wiesel hit us from all sides: fear, anticipation, joy, grief, depression . . . to get the ulitmate emotional response. That is what makes a great book great: the author can pull you in, in the first couple of pages and keeps you turning them until the last page. I had planned to read it over a week, but ended up reading it in about 2 hours. Another thing that is shown in this novel that isnt (from what I've read) in others is how much the Jewish belief had either changed or became stronger throughout the course of the book. I read it for school. I have read it about 5 times since."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Probably the most powerfull book I've ever read. Easy to read, short, to the point.

Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel is a terrifying and tragic account of a young boy's struggle to survive a torturous Nazi death camp during the Holocaust. This penetrating autobiography provokes emotion and reveals a powerful sense of reality. It is extremely well written and reawakens memories of the unforgettable actions Hitler and his Nazi regime took upon the Jewish people of the time(1941-1945). This book is highly recommended for anyone who has the strength of heart to relive these tragic events. A phenomenal piece of writing!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"What is so incredibly fascinating about Elie Wiesel's book \\"NIGHT\\" is that even though it is a novel, it reads like an autobiography. Not many writers have ever been able to pull that off. Rikki Lee Travolta's fascinating \\"MY FRACTURED LIFE\\" captured it, but few others ever have. For \\"NIGHT\\" the canvas is the horror of the Holocaust and Wiesel's narrative character is wracked with nightmares and guilt for having survived the death camps. An amazing literary accomplishment."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I remember reading this a few years ago. It is a pretty great story. The author doesn't drag it out too long.Basically a story about concentration camp prisoners in WWII. Everyone should know about that though. About the holocaust. The thing that is great about this story is it is interesting. Elie does a really good job of making you feel sorry for them, but doesn't make it too tragic. He also writes the story and doesn't try to add fluff. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Night","review":"scary....i try to get everyone to read this book...."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading the novel, Night, I would have to give it four stars. Five being the best. I really enjoyed the book, but it didn't have me interested from the beginning. The book started off pretty slow and I really didn't get into it until after the first chapter. Once the author started to really get into detail of his life in the concentration camps, and being separated from his family is when it really caught my attention. Not a lot of books keep my attention, but this one was different. Maybe it did because this was a true story. The author did such a good job explaining the horrible things he went through as a child. I couldn't imagine going through the things he went throught. It had to be really hard writing this story but he did such a good job and I reccommend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read the book Night by Elie Wiesel. It is about a young Jewish boy who tells you about his first hand accounts of the terror of the Holocaust. Starting from the ghettos to the concentration camps. The horror that Elie went through is expressed through some emotions and even sometimes the absences of his emotions. Elie is first put through the horror of Auschwitz, seeing people around him dying. Elie starts to question his faith in God. As only a young teenager, Elie is put to the depths of hell and has all of the experience to share because he survived.This book is a must read if you have any interest at all in the Holocaust or World War II.

The book is really interesting because it talks about the life of a boy named Elie who was jewish and ended as a prisioner for several years. During the time he got separated from his family. He went to the same camp with is dad and saw a lot of his friends die, especially the most important person in his life, his dad. Elie wouldn't eat well, he had to be active all day, and would get mistreated by the German soldiers. He had to work very hard because he was treated like an adult when he was really only 16.If you would like to read a book that really describes the life in concentration camps, then I strongly recommend you read this book because it's going to make you think about jewish life, how bad it was, and what they had to do to stay alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A thought provoking book. I was assigned to read and review this book for a junior-level university course in Conflict, Violence, and Peace. Along with Tolstoy's &quot;The Kingdom of Heaven is Within You,&quot; I'm starting to reflect the rational of the of the nation-state. This was not an especially moving book for me. I have read more powerful novels on the Holocaust that stirred deeper emotions within me, though I understand how it could affect people profoundly. I do recommend it, however, as a part of a through historical account of the dangers of the nationalism and propaganda."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The beginning of this book bored me so it took me about 1 1/2 hours to read the first chapter.

Beware of the other translation."},{"Title":"Night","review":"wiesel writes a mean memoir...but his experiences, as opposed to his literary technique are his real, dare i say, \\"gift.\\" i was surprised at how straight faced and unmoved i was while reading this novella. he uses punctuation to make up for his lackluster prose (e.g., \\"dead babies!\\").it is so difficult for me to come down on wiesel because he has been such an outstanding spokesperson for human rights (bosnia, iraq, darfur). his experience during the holocaust and his unshattered will are tragic and inspiring...but as a writer? im not sure what to say. and as the title says, the theme of \\"night\\" is underdeveloped and i am still not quite sure why he chose it.you would expect such a memoir to move you, to crush your optimistic views on humanity, but really, growing up in the late 20th century and thus being exposed to the horrors of the holocaust ad nauseum, this novel was just sort of a first hand distillation of what my generation has been told/shown a hundred times over. i understand that it was originally published in 1955, but its oprah-book-club-resurgence needs to be spat upon. in the present day realm of holocaust literature, \\"night\\" does not take the cake.i gave it 4 stars because at 126 pages, everyone should read it. skip an episode of america's next top model and youre done. but i cant help but acknowledge that there is a reason wiesel was given the nobel peace prize, as opposed to the nobel prize for literature."},{"Title":"Night","review":"No matter your religion, ethnicity or basic beliefs, everyone should read this book because it is about hamanity and how it can change from mundane to total hell for no reason."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found, Night, although extremely depressing throughout, to be very interesting and thought-provoking from so many different aspects of life including dealing with the loss of your home, loved ones, practice of religion and just about everything else. The author portrayed the gory details of his experience first-hand throughout the novel, which kept me mesmerized as I read how he persevered through all of the challenges the Germans presented from beginning to end. The fact that Night was a real life experience and not fiction made me amazed at Elie's inner strength.Elie Wiesel's strengths as an author are obvious since he is writing from personal experience and presenting the graphic horror of everything that came along with the German's occupation of his homeland and the effects on his life through the concentration camps. I would strongly recommend Night based on its valuable history lesson but also based on its personal perspective of such a horrible time in the history of humanity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading the novel Night I realized there were several things I liked about it but a few however that I did not like. The best thing that I liked about this book is that the author, Elie Wiesel, was not going to sacrifice the truth of the story to make the things that happened to him sound less impossible. He made you feel like you were in that camp with him; he described all the suffering and pain in such detail that you were affected by the words on the page. Another reason why I enjoyed reading this book is that it is an important subject and everyone needs to know about the Holocaust and this book tells you what happened from someone who was actually there. So overall the novel was made excellent because of the great use of detail by the author.On the opposite side of the spectrum there are a few things I didn't really like about the book. I personally believed that the book could have been longer. I know it is hard to write about a sore subject like the Holocaust but I think he could have gotten more information out about his years in the camps. Another thing that might make the book less attractive to readers is that this is very heavy material. It is not meant for pleasure reading, if you are looking for a happy read this is not for you. Also some people may not like this book because it does not have a happy ending. The book ends after his father's death and he is liberated from concentration camp all alone in the world. Overall I believe this is a great book and most should read it to get a better understanding of what the Jewish race had to go through and how disturbing it really was."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I started it after supper and didn't put it down till I was done."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiesel was a detailed description of what happened while he was in the Nazi concentration camp, where he, his father and thousands of other jews went through the most horrifying years of their lifes.

Also I liked this book because it had a lot of details which helped me to understand it a lot better.

I love how he was always there for his family especially his father!I think that this book should be read by all the kids in highschool. It teaches them how life really was for those people.In conclusion, this book taught me more about the Holacost and Wiesel told me that if this ever happend in America we as a country would see the affects of it.

I would recomend this book to a friend that wouldn't give up on a book if it wasn't the greatest at the start. I'm not going to talk about the book at all because I don't want to give anything away.

Its an unforgettable story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When reading night, you begin to think to yourself how easy it is not being in this poor mans shoes. This is a shocking story of a mans struggle during the world war. He wasn't even technically a \\"man\\" either, but for his heroics could be. This story starts out at his home, simple and easy. Things become more difficult when his jewish teacher, is deported. When he returns to tell everyone about how his train was taken over by the gastapo and everyone was taken to the woods and killed... no one believes him. Later on, the gastapo takes control of Hungary, and soon his very own town. At this point him and his family are taken to a tiny ghetto. They are forced into a small car for days, and way later they arrive, and near death, due to starvation. They arrive at the gates... of Auschwitz, the most deadly camp.At the gates, him and his dad, are pulled apart from his mother, and sisters. They stand waiting to see if they will be killed on the spot, or put to wirk. Him and his father was \\"inspected\\" and put to work. In the camp, the jews are subject to regular beatings and humiliations. Elizer, the main character, is forced to give a soldier his golden tooth, in his mouth, with a spoon. After seeing fellow friends, and younger men Elizers age. He begins to loose hope in his faith, and people around him. Elizer and everyone else are forced to run fifty miles in a blizzard, with nothing more then a few peices of clothe, after being in the camp for a few months. This is known as the death march, because many people died during this march. The reason they were moved because the russians were advancing further north. After that, they are boarded onto a waggon and again brought on for a long trip. One hundred board, twelve survive. When ariving to this new camp his father dies from abuse. Elizer survives and is an \\"empty soul\\" until the American Army arrives at the gates to liberate the camp.That's the story in a nutshell, and man is it amazing. This story is very touching and when you read it you think, how could people do this to others? The story is a memoir of Elizer and is actually hard to read. When you read, he goes into such detail about how he did everything. When reading if you begin to become amazed at what he writes.

If some of the things Elie Wiesel talked about did not seem so cruel, unbelievable cruel, forcing you reread a sentence or a whole paragraph two or three times to try to get your mind around what this teenage boy was living, it would be. The horrific things he witnessed made me cry for him and the people involved. This man witnessed Evil, pure unadulterated Evil. How he lived, and survived with any mental stability, I will never know. Night is a great book dealing with a very ugly time in our history. Elie Wiesel is a great man. God bless him for surviving and sharing his story with us."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel wrote this memoir about his experience of the Nazis' during Hitler's temporary reign over the Jews. I decided to read this book because Mr. Zaiden suggested it and it was based in a time period when nobody's life was dull, so something important was always going on whether they knew it or not. I had never heard of Elie Wiesel before, but I trusted my teacher's judgment, and I really liked the book. I don't like what happened during that time period, but it always seems that when I read books like that, it puts my life into perspective. \\"People ARE suffering worse than I,\\" and \\"am I REALLY suffering?\\" are what goes through my head. What basically happens in this book, is that a Jewish boy is stripped from his family, everything he owns, and anything he could possibly care about, and put in various concentration camps where he is forced to work. The story shows how he struggles to survive in such a harsh environment.It starts out in his home town of Sighet, Transylvania, and they hadn't really encountered any Nazis, but then they invaded his town and set up enforced rules. The soldiers weren't mean, in fact some of them were quite nice, and the rules weren't too bad. But then one night everything changed, \\"\`I have terrible news,' said father, \`deportation'(pg. 11).\\" All Jews were to be taken to concentration camps, where they would work. Once Elie arrived at the camp, he discovered that the Jews worked until they were unable to, and then they would be cremated alive. The thought of cremation made Elie think of escaping, that probably would have been suicide. His father wouldn't consider it, and Elie wouldn't leave his father, like they had been forced to with his mother and sisters. They had been separated by the soldiers when they had first arrived at the camp.They were met by a very unlikely person, whom Elie's father didn't remember. It was his nephew-in-law, Stein, who was looking for his wife, Reizel. She was the one related to Elie's mother. Elie didn't know if Reizel was alive or not, but when Stein asked him if she was alive, he said that he had heard word from her in Belgium, and that she and the children were okay. Elie couldn't bare to tell Stein nothing at all, because Stein looked so beaten down, and Elie helped him to feel better so he could live. Later, when the group Reizel was supposed to be with passed through the camp, neither she or the kids were there. Stein knew they had died, and he was crushed. \\"\`We were never to hear from him again. He had had news. Real news.'(pg. 42)\\"Some time passed, and they were working in a light bulb factory. They were mostly hanging out until the head of the warehouse said they could \\"\`do what you like. But do something. If not, you'll here from me...'(pg. 54)\\" He basically told them, they could do whatever they wanted so long as they were moving. So, Elie decided to walk around the warehouse, and look for crumbs, or something to eat. Then, he heard a noise from a little room, where the head of the warehouse was lying on a mattress, with a half-naked Polish girl. Elie thought it was so funny that he started to laugh, and when the head of the warehouse looked up from the girl, he ran up to Elie, grabbed him by the neck and said, \\" \` you wait and see, kid... You'll soon find out what leaving your work's going to cost you... You're going to pay for this pretty soon.... And now, go back to your place.'(pg. 54)\\" He was whipped twenty-five times before he fainted, and was forced to swear not to tell anyone what he saw.A couple months had passed, and in that time, Elie began to realize that his foot had begun to swell up. He tried to just ignore it, but it started to hurt more and more. He realized that if he went to the doctor, that he could possibly be killed, for not being able to move and work. But it was a chance he had to take. He went to the doctor, where he was told that he would need an operation. They cut into his leg while he was still conscious, but it wasn't long before he was out cold for a hour. When he woke up, he asked \\"\`doctor, shall I still be able to use my leg?'He no longer smiled. I was very frightened. He said: 'Do you trust me, my boy?'\`I trust you absolutely, Doctor.'\`Well then listen to me. You'll be completely recovered in a fortnight.'(pg. 76)\\" But his leg defiantly slowed him down, because he had to march before his leg was completely healed.Elie Wiesel surprised himself by almost becoming used to being treated so horribly, and he found that he lost faith in God. Amazingly, he never had to deal with anger, even through the hard times with the Nazis, and some of the other Jews. He found that he could survive, even eating all of the things he wouldn't have eaten, when he was a picky eater. He surprised other people who have read this book, by showing that there is always something to live for, even if you've forgotten what it is. He showed the world, that sometimes the best way to live during a war, is just to wait things out. But these aren't just lessons in case Hitler arises from the dead. These guidelines will help you wherever you are in life, at school, at work, or at retirement. And even though things weren't the greatest in his childhood, he kept going, down the \\"the Long and Winding Road, that leads to your door.\\" (The Beatles, \\"The Long and Winding Road\\")"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I never really took much interest in what I have found to be one of the darkest moments in history but after reading this book of a Nobel peace prize winner it gives me the chills thinking about it. During the years of 1941 (rise of Hitler) Elie Wiesel takes you back when he was about 12 and faced the terrifying struggles of the Jewish extermination. Early on in the book Elie is taught the importance of the Jewish faith and the existence of God through his mentor and guide, Moshe the Beadle.Night is the only word to define these darkest moments in time. The only time he dreamed of is the day it would finally be over. News continues to sweep through the town of Sighet, Transylvania but the Jews don't listen and its too late! Madame Schachter moans progress to hysterical cries \\"Fire! A terrible fire! Mercy! Oh, that fire!\\" That same day of arrival at the concentration camp Elie looks in horror at the flames rising above huge ovens and the smell of burning human flesh. He is a survivor of these death camps.Elie and his father depart to Auschwitz and his mother and three sisters disappear to Birkenau. Every day Elie is deported to a different death camp. He is told to strip naked of all his clothes in the bare winter and get his head shaved. He only get shoes and clothes that are too small in return. You have to keep good health and for many it was unfair and impossible. He recalls, \\"I was a body. Perhaps less than that even: a starved stomach. The stomach alone was aware of the passage of time.\\" Not many looked and stayed healthy. Elie's questions the existence of God.Like robots, the Jews run, run, run. You run all day to the next camp that you were to face and it's cold, very cold. This was just another way to eliminate the Jews faster. Anyone whom fell behind was shot on the spot. You never get a good night's sleep and if you never awoke it's most likely because you're gone. Food is never enough. How does Elie survive with only a ration of bread every day? Where is Elie's family all this time? Are American troops going to be at the gates of the final death camp? You have to read this book to find the answers!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night ReviewThis book is entitled \\"Night\\". The author is Elie Wiesel. This novel is about the Jews and what they went through during the Holocaust. The main character is the author. It was sad.Although it was sad, it was very informative. It gave a lot of information about concetration camps. I can't give away the ending but it was a good book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What a fantastic gift that Mr. Weisel has given us. To share his experience so the world can never forget. Written so movingly and concisely. My son had to read it as his summer reading but I read it after him and feel changed forever."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"He was still alive when i passed in front of him. His tongue was still red his eyes were not yet glazed\\" (Weisel,62). This quote from the book Night affected me, along with many other disturbing words.however i still enjoyed the book, and thought that he had a very good and realistic choice of words. in the rest of my paper i will go over imegery, poin tif view, and figurative language.Weisel used a lot of imegery in the book, for example\\"father father wake up they're trying to throw you out of the carrage...\\"(Weisel,94). in this quote Elie is trying to wake his father up because the rest of the men in the carrage think hes dead and want to throw him out of the carrage.i really liked his choice of imagery to help me feel what they're going through. Weisels book was from his past experiance in the Holocost.Point of veiw was used mostly through the whole book. \\"from the depths of the mirror, a courpse glazed back at me\\"(Weisel,109). This example was used by Weisel toward the end of the book when he was liberated. Here point of veiw was also a good example of figurative language.\\"Meir, Meir, my boy! Dont you recognize me I'm your father...you're hurting me...your killing you father\\"(Weisel,96). This use of figurative language was a conversation between father and son. this paints a picture in my mind about how the men would do anything for a little bit of food. Even if its killing their own father.I really liked the book Night and thought that Weisel was a very good author. i also liked how he never held anything back. he always explained details to their fullest. Weisels words seemed more real because he had actually experianced the Holocaust. there were 6.6 million jews that wer killed in the Holocaust and Elie happend to be one that did survive. the book Night is a 109 pagged memory from Elie Weisel that goes through his horrifiying experience in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night reviewHas anyone ever heard or even gone through the holocaust? Well I just read the book Night and watched the movie The Last Days. I liked the book Night because it gave really good description and imagery throughout the book and gave you a good idea on what was going on. What else it had was good resolution in the concluding of the book. Night had a lot of foreshadowing throughout the book.Weisel used a lot of imagery and details in Night. On page 11, Weisel used imagery such as \\"Each person will be allowed to take only his own personal belongings. A bag on our backs, some food, a few clothes. Nothing else.\\" This quote to me meant that the Germans took everything away from the Jews so all that the Jews had left was the stuff that they had on their backs. It kind of meant that the Germans didn't care about anything but their selves so they took everything away from the Jews. I didn't think that was fair to do that but the Germans did it anyways.Along with imagery, Weisel used good resolution at the end of the book as in \\"Our first act as free men was to throw ourselves onto the provisions. We thought only of that. Not of revenge, not of our families. Nothing bur bread.\\" (Weisel, 109) what this quotes really meant to me was that when they finally got set free all they wanted to do was eat nothing else. They didn't care about revenge or of their families because they were so small and weak all they wanted to do was eat. So this quote was kind of sad to me after they really never got to eat much.Along with everything else that caught my attention it would have to be foreshadowing it ended up really happening later on in the book like in this quote \\"Look! Look at it! Fire! A terrible fire! Mercy! Oh, that fire! Some men pressed their faces up against the bars. There was nothing, only the darkness.\\"(Weisel, 22) to me this meant that a lady was seeing what was going on at the concentration camp and she was trying to tell everyone but nobody believed her until they got their and seen what was really going on at the camp. So she was trying to help but everyone thought she was crazy. When they got there they had seen that they were burning people. So they figured out that she was really helping them out.In conclusion after reading the book Night, I was really impacted by Weisels use of imagery and foreshadowing. It kind of meant that the Germans didn't care about anything but their selves so they took everything away from the Jews. They didn't care about revenge or of their families because they were so small and weak all they wanted to do was eat. Over 60,000 people that went to the concentration camp were killed."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Has anyone ever wondered why Elie Wiesel named his book night? Well, I have, and I came to the conclusion that it was named Night because Hitler told the Jewish people one thing, but then slowly went with doing the opposite. I didn't like the book Night because I felt that I got confused during the book when he would jump into different settings and times, then go back to present time. I did like the mood he put the reader in as they were reading the book, he made the reader feel as if they really there, and he also made the reader feel what they had felt. I like how he used symbolism with Night, showing that what was happening to them was evil and wasn't humane of Hitler to do to them.One of the main reasons that I enjoyed this book was because of the way he used symbolism referring to night, saying how Hitler promised them things so they believed that everything would be alright for them when really Hitler wanted them to trust him while he slowly killed them all off. \\"The yellow star? Oh well, what of it? You don't die of it....\\" (Wiesel, 9). I chose this particular quote because Hitler promised them a better life in the beginning of the book, telling them that everything would be better after the war got out. Then he singles them all out by making them wear yellow stars. Then at the end Hitler ends up going against his word and kills most of the Jewish population.Night skipped around a lot with the time. The changing of the setting never really confused me but when he started jumping to different times, it started getting confusing. \\"Many years later, in Paris, I was reading my paper in the Metro.\\" (Wiesel, 51). The reason I chose this quote is because a few lines before that was said Elie was in the warehouse talking to a little French girl, then it goes to a completely different time, then back to the concentration camp all within a few minutes.I like the way he used mood in this book. He really knew how to get his readers involved with how the Jewish population felt during the time he was in the camp. \\"Being so light, the child was still alive\\" (wiesel, 62). I picked this quote because even though I felt some emotion when I read about all the hangings I felt more emotions when I read about the little boy being hung because he had to suffer more. He didn't weigh enough to have the drop snap his neck, so he just hung there dying slowly. So when I read about that last hanging I felt a lot more emotion for the little boy then what I did for all the other hangings.By the time I got to the end of the book there were things that I liked and didn't like. I didn't like how he was always changing the setting. However I did like his use of symbolism referring to night, how it represents darkness and evil. One thing to think about is that out of the 9 million Jewish people 6.2 million of them were killed."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the book because, it told the truth about what the Jews had to go through, but I didn't like where they didn't say what the Jews did after the camps. My most memorable part was when Elie had that French girl talk to him and nobody else new other languages. I think Elie's reason for publishing this book is to show what the Jews had to go through."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In this bookthe auathor Elie Wiesel is a young Jewish boy who tells of his life. It first began when he was living in the ghetto. At this time the ghetto was a place where the Germans put all Jews so they could watch over their every movements. He then talks about him leaving the ghetto being forced by the Germans to concentration camps. There he was seperated from his mother and sisters. He and his father had a difficult time going through the rigourous training. You'll have to read the book to find out what actually happened in these concentration camps.I like this book because it shows of real life and how the jews were treated back in the 1940's. It was sort of like reading a history book on Jews and concentration camps. I liked the way they showed the struggle of love between the father and son.My favorite part in the book was when the father was very ill and his son struggled and struggled to keep him alive. He kept pushing his father to try to live and to think of how they would be after they were saved from the concentration camps. His father was very ill and was taken to the sickly section of the camp. He stayed there to keep his father's eyesopen so the people wouldn't take him away and presume him dead."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie wiesil was a main charicter in the book night and during the beggening of the book elies father was potimistic because he had a good view twards the futer. Elie was 15, but at the camp he was 18 and his father was 40 because any body under 18 and over 40 was killed. Elie had a chance at the camp tp kill himself by walikng into a electric frnce or by jumping into a fire pit but elie stayed alive to be with his father and that his family would survive. Eliw was told by his father that they were going to a camp because his father went to a metting and they said the were going to be deported. Once they knew they were going to be deported they were put on cattle cars and if somebody was missing every body in the cars would be shot. The dentists job at the camps were to take out peoples gold crouns amd elie was taken out witha spoon. Once they arived at the camp the were tossed clothes as the ran around in a circle to determan how good of shape ther were in. Thje book was a good book because it expllained how the treatment realy was for jews and what they went through."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I started Elie Wiesel's Night with the expectation that this was not going to be a happy book. That should be a given, considering the subject matter. What I was surprised at, however, is the total lack of optimism found within it, even at the end. I have read other Holocaust memoirs, and many end with a lesson, a light at the end of the tunnel. It was incredibly schocking not to find this here, but I understand why it was not included. The foreward makes it clear that this is novel meant to illustrate the death of faith within those interned in concentration camps, and also, the death of humanity. They are forced through their extreme deprivation to live for no one but themselves, hovering between the desire to go on living, and the need to simply disappear.It really is unfair of me, then, to not give this book five stars, but it is so hard for me to accept the bleakness found here, although it is reflective of the feelings experienced by the author. I just wish he could have left something of a message as to why this horror had to happen, but he can't, because really, there is no easy answer. This book itself then serves as his answer; a chronicle of sorrow so deep, it speaks for itself. Any explicit solace written for the reader would take away from the story, and it really isn't needed. It's all there--anyone who reads this doesn't need for the author to say, \\"I know this happened for others to learn that it is wrong, and should never occur, ever,\\" it is all there in his chilling recounting.This book is there for all of us to learn what real sorrow is. Highly recommended.Real rating: 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I wish I could say this is book is fiction, but the fact that the book is retelling the author's actual experience is sickening. The book is an easy read; I read the book in about 90 minutes. How horrible can humanity be? Read this book to see the depths of human wickedness. The only thing worse than the gruesome history of the concentration camps is the group of people who are trying to deny the existence of the holocaust. The horrifying events involving the holocaust need to be remembered so that we do not let this type of thing happen again.In the book, God becomes forgotten because of human suffering. This conclusion comes from the presupposition that God exists for human comfort on earth. Surely the Jew does not believe that God exists for their comfort, but because they go through suffering the main character in the book abandons his belief in God. This is an illogical decision made by the main character. Even if God existed for human comfort, surely that comfort should never come on this earth, but in the afterlife. Though the main character went through incredibly awful situations, he sold out on his beliefs. Too bad."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My opinion on this book is that it did not have enough drama invalved Eli could have put a littel more time in to what she was doing with the book and the drama that she used was not that good ,she could have put a littel more action into the caractters that she used. Eli could have used some pictures in the book to show the fear on the caracters faces and to show what the prisons looked like. The ather things I did not like about this book was that it did not catch my atention hardly at all and what I mean by that is that I couldent raely get into the story the way i was hopeing to."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have just currently read Night by Elie Wiesel, The book is a sterotypical WW2 novel, yet the book's imagery is quite impressive. Elie used his first person experience as an advantage in this novel. I found it hard to start the book though. It started off slow and straight forward. Later in the book I started to form an interest. One Negitive about the book is the way it starts (not to repeat my self), It starts off in the middle of the beginning, You never really got to find out anything about his past or back ground."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel was a twelve-year old Jew who was completely devoted to learning all he could about his religion. In Night Elie&#65533;s faith is shaken when he sees his people suffering, so he has to reevaluate God in his life.The God of Elie Wiesel&#65533;s Jewish belief is the same God addressed by David in Psalm 22. Feeling like God may not hear, or may not exist, even, is nothing new. It is certainly not a novel idea uniquely occurring to Mr. Wiesel as a fifteen-year old prisoner. David wrote:My God, my God! Why have you forsaken me?Why do you remain distant?Why do you ignore my cries for help?Every day I call to you, my God,but you do not answer.Every night you hear my voice, but I find no relief.(Psalm 22:1-2, New Living Translation)Elie is actually echoing his faith tradition, by honestly seeking God, and giving voice to his doubts that God hears. So it is easy to see his record of doubt as recorded in Night as a snapshot of what he is going through, not a systematic refutation of the existence of God. But that is exactly how it strikes him at the time.Elie says his God is murdered. He refers to the hanging of the &#65533;angel&#65533; boy as symbolizing this. Yet the angel boy was killed by people, just as the first murder victim, Abel, was killed by Cain. A more appropriate reference might be the killing of Jesus, since Christians (and some Jews, at the time) believe Jesus shared God&#65533;s nature. The implications of actually killing God, then, do not necessarily imply the end of God. In Elie&#65533;s view towards life, however, there is no resurrected God. He quotes the rabbi (Page 73): &#65533;It&#65533;s the end. God is no longer with us.&#65533; Wiesel then (two paragraphs later) refers to Calvary (his only Christ reference): &#65533;Poor Akiba Drumer, if he could have gone on believing in God, if he could have seen a proof of God in this Calvary&#65533;&#65533; Yet, this is Elie quoting others. Does he himself say God is no more, if God ever was? Elie may feel that his belief is drained from him, like his tears, (Page 106) which do not flow after his own father finally dies, but Elie, as a fifteen-year old, is not ready to really personally say that he believes God is dead. Yet he dwells in the same turmoil documented by David in the Psalms. He comes close to renouncing God (on pages 64 and 65), but looking at it closely, he deflects a categorical rejection of God. He simply rejects the idea of the new Jewish year of Rosh Hoshana possibly being &#65533;happy.&#65533; He also feels a void on the day of atonement (Yom Kippur) he chooses not to celebrate, as he feels a great &#65533;void&#65533; in his heart (Page 66).Elie says he feels like Job. Yet Job believed God existed. The book of Job records Jobs conversations with God. Elie&#65533;s reference to Job is just a partial thought: &#65533;How I sympathized with Job! I did not deny God&#65533;s existence, but I doubted His absolute justice.&#65533; In fact, Elie prays to the God he says exists: &#65533;I thanked God, in an improvised prayer, for having created mud in His infinite and wonderful universe.&#65533;(Page 35). This same universe confronted Job, who is told by God: &#65533;Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorant words? Brace yourself, because I have some questions for you, and you must answer them. Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you know so much.&#65533; (Job 38:2-4). Elie does not take the full measure of Job, when he refers to him. But this is understandable under the duress of concentration camp. Indeed, the first thirty-seven chapters of Job are filled with the exact same kinds of complaint against God."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"I was fifteen years old.\\" I am fifteen years old. I can never imagine going through all of the things that he went through. NIGHT by Elie Wiesel was one of the greatest books written about the Holocaust. Similar to THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, it uses description to attract attention of the reader, and sadness to help understand some of what he went through.On one hand, this book is good because the author, Elie, tells you all of his most secret of secrets about what he is feeling, and also there are some parts where the reader has to grip their chair in fear wondering what is going to happen to him. Plus, he gives good discriptions of his surrounding enviornment. Then there are grulling details of what happens to people when they die.On another hand, this book cna be very hard to get into. Elie starts the book very slowly, and gradually gets into the detail. Not something very interesting. Then, he also uses big vocabulary words, and like me, if the meaning of the words are confusing, it can get confusing in a hurry.So, if the Holocaust was interesting, and THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK was great reading, this book is a must. Although, if books are not fun, and true stories are not entertaining,then this book was made for someone else."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"i'm 15, no your are 18.\\" This is just a small thing that shows how they did not have idiuvalality. In this paper I will tell you three different things about the book night. The first one will be the mood of the story. Second I will tell you about the writing style and how it changes from the begining and the end. Last I will tell how discriptive the book really is.The mood of the book Night. Is really sad and depressing. They talk about being seperated from their families and not knowing if they would ever see them again. Another way that makes me think that the mood was sad is that they would take babies away from their moms and throw them up in the air and shoot them. The thing that makes it depressing is that they would wont people to suffer so they would hang them infount of everyone in the camp.The writing style changed. In the begining of the book he was very discriptive. Like when he was talking about the stinch and dark smoke all around the camp. in the end after his dad dies he is not as discriptive. he just says what happened.The book was very discriptive. He told us about all the babies and children crying, because they did not wont to leave their families. Another time that it was very discriptive was when he talked about how the man did not weigh enough to be hung. So they just let him hang there untill he finally died.The mood, the writing style change, and the discriptions in the book helped be able to really understand about the holocost. do you know that over 6 million jews died during the holocost time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The horrors of the Holocaust are gone, thankfully, but they cannot be forgotten, especially with the scourge of some current events. Elie has done well by writing about the horrors- the evil doctor who decided who got burned up, the fights for food, the executions that the Jews were forced to watch, and most tragically, the death of Elie's father-which he missed because they took him away. It chills you to the bone, but you must read it; the horrors of the Holocaust cannot be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really liked this book because it really taught me alot historically about The holocaust and i also found it interesting to be able to see what it was like living through something as horrible as that.

Like when he was talking about how much it was snow or how much it was raining. And the thing was is that he talked about it for a page or so. But other than that the book was very good. Because he explained everything vary well. He put things in words that we could understand and relate to. i like how he said that when something happened other things changed. like when they hung the grown man. the soup tasted good.but when they hung the little boy, and he struggled to death the soup tasted like the corpses.I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of World War II. And another reason why I liked this book was because it covered everything that happened. like when as soon as they got onto the train and up until he was rescued by the U.S. soldiders. Some things that i dident expect is when he got wipped 25 times for seeing something that the gaurds dident want him to see.

My husband has and he says that it is an interesting book. It arrived in a timely manner."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel, Night (Bantam, 1960)availability: on most high-school reading lists. willnever go out of print.The first novel in Wiesel's well-known holocausttrilogy (Night, Dawn, and The Accident) was originallypassed off by Wiesel as autobiography. While it's asincorrect to call Night complete fiction as it wouldbe to hang that tag on, say, Bukowski's novel_Hollywood_, there's still an air of duplicity aboutit. Exaggerating and playing up the details of theproduction of a Hollywood film can be seen as amusing;exaggerating and playing up the details of Auschwitzis probably best left to Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder.Wiesel himself admitted the book contains fictionalcontent decades ago, yet it's still marketed-- and,more depressingly, assigned to high school readers--as straight autobiography. We're raising a generationwho still believe the holocaust is called theholocaust because the Nazis lined up Jews in front offlaming trenches and pushed them in alive.That said, I finally got over my distaste for Wieselhimself and cracked the cover on this. As a novel,there's certainly much to be said for it. It could beargued that Wiesel's style here is the basis for muchof what's come to be known as extreme fiction(splatterpunk, etc.)-- Wiesel wouldn't allow himselfto write about the holocaust for ten years after itsend, and that time allowed him to adopt a detached,almost journalist-style air. Detachment, as we allknow, is a much better way of getting horror acrossthan high emotion. The book is quick and coherent, andWiesel writes with an easy lucidity. The book issimple and easy to follow without the feeling that theauthor is ever talking down to his audience, which isdefinitely a point on the positive side. In fact, theonly negative I can come up with about the text itselfisn't really a negative at all-- there's anotherdescription of the forced march that takes up the lastthird of _Night_ in Miklos Nyiszli's book _Auschwitz_,and Nyiszli goes into a bit more detail, which allowsthe reader to get a more personal view of the event.However, that's not to take anything away fromWiesel's account.Certainly worth reading, but remember-- it IS a novel.** 1/2"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Beating and murdering children! Is that what kind of book anyone would like to read? Babies, children, and mothers getting turned to ashes! This book should not be read unless, anyone wants to be depressed or if your a person that can handle stuff like that.Families would get separated. The heart breaks of the separation leading men to cry. They use most of their energy that is needed Their new journey wasn't a good either way. The way most women went, lead to \\"the fire of death,\\" so I call it that. Most men or young adults or teens went the other way, which lead to torchor, maybe even death.The use of the Irony was unwanted. \\"work is liberty,\\" whom ever wanted to work is liberty good for them them but don't put people in that possition. They had to work to eat, work to sleep. They must work to live! It must have of sucked!Starvation! Thats how most people died. They would only have soup and bread. The visual of the picture in my head of the, only one skin layered, boney skeleton. It was one of the most grossest visuals ever!People should not read this book! They are separated from family for life. Heart broken forever! Not knowing when they're going to be able to eat, so they loose energy and starve! Just remember that Warning is not Death: \\"Warning Death!\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"Did any one ever think of the Holocaust? I never did until I read the book Night.I did not care for the book Night because it was not to my liking at all. I did not understand the metaphors he wanted use to catch on too. Like on page 77 when he said \\"the soup tasted like corpses.\\" He said that because he saw three people get hung. In my mind I saw three people standing there with a noose around their necks about to get hung. I did not understand that because soup and getting hung are to different things in my mind.I also did not like the vocabulary because of the words he uses. Like he used on page 16. He used the word \\"Messiah.\\" I don't know what messiah means. He also used the word \\"Aushwitz\\" on page 24. When I reading the book I did not know how to pronounce the words. He also used the word \\"may his name be blessed and magnified\\" on page 31. In my mind I could not see any thing that had to do with those words.When he jumps setting he confused me and made me not like the book even more than before. Like when he jumped to the French lady in Paris on page 51. He knew the French lady in 1944 in a power plant at the camp he was at.After reading Night it made me not want to study about the Holocaust ever. The resin why I don't want to learn about the Holocaust is because there are too many German words to read, to many metaphors in it, and it jumped setting and confused me to much. What I was focus on was the vocabulary and the metaphors. \\"That Night the soap tasted like corpses\\" on Page 77. \\"Aushwitz\\" on page 24 and \\"Messiah\\" on page 16."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Blessed be the name of the Eternal!\\"(Wiesel, 64). But why? Why would any of the Jews hold faith when their Almighty God had so obviously forsaken them to their deaths. At least this is my belief because they were beaten, starved, worked to the breaking point, so what was the point to have faith because it wasn't going to help them. In Night by Elie Wiesel he did not hold faith to the Almighty.I kind of liked this book and sometimes didn't because it was kind of slow in spots. I think it would have been better if it had more irony. It had very good imagery. I didn't really like how he always talked about God. I mean he had forsaken them so why keep talking about Him. Like Wiesel said \\"Why should I bless Him? The Eternal Lord of the Universe, the All-Powerful and Terrible\\"(Wiesel 30).One of the part that had irony that I thought was good is when his father died when he made it sound like he was going live through it. \\"The yellow star? Oh well, what of it? You don't die of it...\\"(Wiesel, 9) this is what his father had said. This is good irony because his father ended up dying.\\"Their tongues hung swollen, blue-tinged.\\"(Wiesel, 62). In places like this I thought it had almost too much imagery, but it made the story better. And he could really make the reader feel what he wanted them to feel, like sad happy, and sometimes making the reader feel like puking. Like when he described the burning children. (Wiesel 30)I think one of the parts I didn't like about the book is how he talked about God a lot. I didn't like how he expressed his faith in God a lot of the time.All together this was a pretty good book it would have been an excellent book if it had more irony. It had very good imagery which is what I liked about the book, after I read the book. I wish they would have heeded the warnings like, \\"Look! Look at it! A terrible fire! Mercy! Oh, that fire!\\"(Wiesel, 22) if only they would have listened.Works CitedWiesel, Elie. Night.

For example the part where they were talking about the girl that did the nasty with the mean man. That was just inappropriate. It didn't make the book any better. The book itself was very informing to know what it was like during that time. Just some of the parts in there were things I myself didn't need to know about. This is just my opinion on this though!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel and his father trying to stay together and alive for each other through the whole book made it such a sad story. Even to the end, when Elie's father died there had been such loss and sadness for both of them that they seemed to get used to it all and didn't react to things like someone would imagine. According to Elie Wiesel he did not talk about what had happened to him and the other Jews for at least ten years. When he decided to write about it, he then could not find a publisher because it was such a \\"depressing subject matter.\\"I did not really like this book. It was not an easy story to read or understand. It is a time of such evil and hardships that we can't even begin to imagine. As a teenager living in a world of privileges and prosperity today, this book's story is something we can not even believe really happened.I think that maybe when I am older I might pick up this book again and read it. I'm not sure if my opinion will change or not though about the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Sawyer WattersonDecember 9, 2004ENG.Night, why would Elie Wiesel give the book that title? God first act was to make light and disperse this darkness, Darkness and night. In the book he uses is these allusions \\"Never shall I forget that night the first night in camp, which has turned my life in to one long night.\\" (Wiesel, 32) Most of the punishments were done that night and that bothered him the most, (like the burning of the people.) So he felt that the suffering never stopped or got better. I liked the book, but it was a little hard to get in to in the starting but after a wile it got better. The starting was a little confusing to me but I started to understand what was going on in the book. The way that he used irony I fell there could be more to make the story better. The imagery I felt was good it made a lot of mental pictures for me which made the book better.Elie used symbolism really well like how he named the book night, and also used it in the book. Like how all the really bad stuff happens during night, like all of the little children and women that were burned at night, his father dies at night, and after reading this I nosiest that the people at the camps fear going to sleep at night. As on the winter march they did not want to go to sleep because they thought that they would not ever wake up again, as said by Elie father \\"Don't let yourself be overcome by sleep, Eliezer. It's dangerous to fall asleep in the snow. You might sleep for good. Come on, come on. Get up.\\" (Wiesel, 84) The people not falling asleep show how scared they are, it also shows that they are afraid of night in general. To them to fall asleep at this point would mean death or that is what they thought would happen.The way that he skipped from time to time made it hard to understand what was going on during that time, witch made the book confusing to me. Like where he was in the middle of the Holocaust to the metro in Paris, where he meets the little French girl that gave him bread after he took a beating from Idek. (Wiesel 51-52) I did not like the how he just dropped the part in. I feel that he should have made a smooth transition such as, that little French girl survived also, years later we ran in to one another metro in Paris.The way that he used irony was very good but he did not use very much, there could have been more. What irony was used was good like were his father said, \\"The yellow star? Oh well, what of it? You don't die of it...\\" (Wiesel 9) but at the end it does kill him, Elie had all of the readers believing that hem and his father would make it to the together.This is a very good book he used imagery real well witch made the book a lot better but as I read the book I figured if they would have listed to a few people. Like Moshe the beadle he told everyone his story but no one would believe he they all thought he was a mad man. He told them about them taking the Jew to a forest and making them dig huge graves, babies were thrown in the air for machine Gunners to use as targets. He told them how he got shot in the leg and was taken for dead. He went from one Jewish house to another telling what happen, he wanted to get back to tell Ellie and his family so they could get a way why they was still time. (Wiesel 4-8)"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiesel was based upon true facts of the Holocaust. The book was talking about time im the later 1930s and mid 1940s.This book was OK. If my teacher wouldnt have made us read it than I wouldnt have read it. I didn't like how the Jews got treated, and all the mean things that they got said to them. That made me sad.I also didnt like some of the things that Elie had said. I didnt like how he was always talking about God, and the faith they had lost or gained in him. We--being readers--didnt care. Unless we're God freaks.The setting bothered me. Not that it was the same place every time, but just because it wasn't as interesting as if they wouldve or couldve added or changed a little bit of it. They didnt need more detail because the detail was actually good. That was probabally the best part of the book.This book was an biography by Elie Wiesel, and he did a good job. If you are interested in historical books, than I would reccomend this book. But if you like the new-aage crazy stuff, than dont bother. It is kind of hard to follow along unless you're really interested. Thanks for your time in reading this. SORRY MRS. H--I'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO USE A LATE VOUCHER!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think the book Night is a pretty alright book but i wouldnt read it if were reading a book for fun since it is about people getting tortutered during the World War II. It tells about the author and how he was in a concenttration camp with his father and how he survived though the ordeal. This book shouold not be read by a little kid or it will give him a nightmare. It should be better for people that is older nad more mature and not a chilidsh person."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's narrative is similar to The Diary of Anne Frank, as it takes you into the world of the Nazi prison camps that consumed Germany during the early 1940s. Wiesel's illustrates the tragedy that the prison had on him as a youth in just the first day:\\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed.\\"Wiesel's novel, which is pretty much an autobiography, captures the brutality and horrors of the Holocaust in a Nazi death camp. I found that Night was one of those books very tough to put down because it is a powerful read and the descriptions were brutally honest. It was gripping, and you feel the pain that the narrator feels as he and his father try to maintain hope while trying to survive the trials of a concentration camp when he is constantly being surrounded by death.This was one of those books that made me think deeply about the situation of the Holocaust, the tragedy it caused and how those who suffered should never be forgotten. The narrator's main struggle is not only a physical struggle to survive, but also a psychological and spiritual one as well. He wavers in his faith in God because of the realities of horror he experiences and sees, but he uses his faith to also make it through each day. That, and the thought of staying with his father, keeps him going despite hunger and emotional and physical abuse: \\"I had no right to let myself die. What would he do without me? I was his only support.\\"One reviewer, Gary, made a comment about this book's style being irrelevant to critique because of the deeply troubling and significant subject matter of the book. I agree wholeheartedly.Night is a book that people should be exposed to because it paints a perspective on history that stays with the reader.Also recommended: The Diary of Anne Frank"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book as an assignment in my Junior English Class. It is one of the smaller books on the holocaust, although it is not one of the better books. Smaller is not always better, and this book proved that.Elie Wiesel experienced a lot of heartache, grief, and pain through being in a concentration camp. He lost everything, his family, freedom, life, and faith. He was down and out and was only a 13-year-old kid. He tells about his pain all the way to his triumph and how he became who he is today.That being said, it was not one of the easiest books to read. I had a hard time concentrating and the book could not hold my attention. I was reading it, without understanding what the words really meant. So that being I never got the full concept of what the story was really about."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night in my opinion had a lot of uncalled for deaths, but as far as what I liked about it, I would have to say that I liked how Elie went about tellin people how everything happened in the consentration camps the way he seen it. It was very detailed. Again, to mention that the book was very detailed on how some of the SS men would kill the Jews. Personally I would not change anything about the book because that is like changing how one person feels about what they lived through, and it wouldn't be right. I believe that Elie's purpose for publishing this book was to let people know what really went on inside the camps, and to let people know that it wasn't fictional that it really did happen. There was one part that stuck out to me the most throughout the whole story and that was when Elie had been sent to the hospital and he did not want to leave simply because he was laying on white sheets. To him that was something wonderful seeing as how he had been sleeping on wooden planks. Who would have thought something as plain as sheets would bring fulfillment to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" was an interesting account of what went on in the concentration camps during World War Two. Elie Wiesel is the main character in the book. He tells us of his touching story, and how hard life was for him. You can't help but be touched by this book. Elie struggled to keep himself, and his father alive.It starts off in the village of Sighet, Romania. The authorities began pushing Jews into trains and sending them off to Auschwitz-Birkenau complex. In the cattle car Jewish villagers were struggling to survive with minimal food and water. Space was very limited also. One of the Jews began hallucinating visions of flame and furnaces. Elie and his father have to lie about their age so they can depart with the other men. Elie's mother and sisters depart to a different concentration camp. Elie and his father are struggling to stay healthy so they can keep working. They then have to start sorting electrical parts in a factory.Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest clashes horribly with the Declaration of Independence, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When Elie gets separated from his family you can tell he lost a part of himself, a part of his happiness. For some death was the only way out."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was selected as the second book of the One Book, One Chicago series, and I am very pleased it was or I would have missed an amazing reading experience. The book details Elie Wiesel's own story of his life in the concentration camps during World War II. His story piercingly describes the horror and the pain that he fought every day to save his own life. Being separated from his mother and sister as soon as he arrives at the camp, the young Elie develops a deeply intense relationship with his father, a man he was never close too before the horror of the camps began. Wiesel lets you into the struggle of his life, showing the inhumane attrocities committed upon him and the other camp residents. Along the way, Wiesel becomes a man at the tender age of 13, caring for his father and becoming the strong one in the growing relationship. The book is short and powerful. It does not use any showy language and clearly speaks to the point in describing the situations Wiesel endured. This book deserves 5 stars for its clarity and the pure power of his story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A paragraph cannot possibly describe the profound importance of this book. A must read for the entire 'human' species."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book was a good book for the ones who like to read about wars, and the past.

When he was thirsty he had to eat snow off his fellow prisoners backs."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Is this book worth the money and time? This is probably the question you're asking yourself right now. I will give you my insight on the book to assist your decision. This is a descriptive book to remind the world of the true horrors of the holocaust.Plot is easily the strongest and most prominent feature in this small autobiography. For example, choosing the time period of the holocaust would give an interesting plot with a strong backbone to any story. This book tells the tale of a 15 year old boy, surviving this madness and despair, through his eyes. Anyone can take this story in as such raw and descriptive truth. Strangely, this book is not so in depth that it carries on. In fact, it is only 110 pages. In these 110 pages is an amazing but believable plot to a realistic, true story. It becomes very interesting by the 50th page or so and by that time it acquires its dark and grim mood. These traits make the plot especially strong in this story and therefore provide a great setup for the other elements of the book.Characters are strange in this story, the way he displays them, but their integration with the plot is very well done. For example, characters in this book are plentiful. Unfortunately, only two of them remain constant throughout the book, Eliezer and his father. Other characters come and go but Eliezer and his father are the only ones who are well-developed and drawn out. This depicts a sense of reality to the story. You can almost feel Elie remembering the glimpses of people in his memory and creating them as characters as he writes. Although, these characters encounter many challenges throughout the book, it is still done very well because of the challenge's patterns and harsh examples. Descriptive challenges the bend and break the faith of young Eliezer, also surrounds the plot and supports its mood. From about page 30 to the end, there are conflicts they face like hunger, punishment, thirst, selections, and near death on many occasions. The two main characters that are well-developed mingle and intertwine well with the plot's hardships.As a summary and to conclude, the book opened up a descriptive and realistic view to these dangerous times. I learned a lot from this book and because it was written so well I think it deserves more attention and reward. The beginning was a bit boring but it set the tone, pace, and plot. I would certainly recommend this book to any young adult or older."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I started reading it at university before a lecture, I'd heard about the book through a friend.I ended up skipping my lecture to continue reading it.This is a beautiful, heartbreaking story of wisels' life as a boy, and his fathers', during the persecution of the Jews. Tears ran down my face many times, and after I had finished I just felt so incredibly sad, it gives you a really deep beautiful insight into the lifes of the Jews that were persecuted. Not just '6 Million Jews' but each indiviual life, each single person suffered during that time. Words just can't describe the power of this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think the book Night by Elie Wiesel is one of the greatest book i have ever read over the holicost. I think Elie Wiesel really did a great job on exsplaining the holicost and what people went had to go threw. The book talks about this Elie Wiesel and his family and what they went threw. The story exsplains the consintration camps and what they were like for the people that lived in them. It tells you how Elie and his father went threw to try to live threw all of the death, pain, sadness, and incredable situations that they went threw to just try to live on untill they were ether rescued or untill eather on of them dyed. Toward the end of the book you really get the felling of how bad it really was for all of the that lived or try to live threw the holicost. The book pulls you in for example will they live or dye you really get pulled in to it beacuse you really dont know what will happen next. Over all i think this book is a exselent book about survival and how hard it was for the people that had to live or tryed to live trew the holicost. this book made me think about how would these people live threw this and how they could even go on living. I liked this book i have not read a lot of books but the book Night by Elie Wiesel is one of the best i have ever read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a historical book. A book about millions of people dying because of who they are, and about a boy stiving to survive through it all with his father by his side. So many of those people who died were Jews and most of them were children, who were burned alive. All of this happened because of who they were and where they lived. I do recommend this book to anyone who likes to read action books. But action wasn't the only type of story telling going on. There were sad parts. For example at the end of the book when his father dies after somewhere around two weeks after he got sick. What was good about this book to me what the father son relationship that Elie had with his dad. I was also amazed to see what Elie does for his dad just so that he won't lose him. It's probably rare to see anyone like that today. Unlike a lot of other books this one kept me interested. It told about what happened during World War II and how it ended.I think that anyone would like this book, it's not one you want to skim through just so that you can stop reading and be done. It's the type of book where you don't want to stop reading until you're done reading the whole thing."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The night was a pretty good book, I liked this book because it explained every thing like the details, the author was also very specific about what he was writing.I think this book was good because it tells you about how the Jews lives were, and what they had to go through.

Alot of the Jews were killed durring this time period.Night makes you stop and think about how easy we have it because we didn't have to go through anything like that.I like Night because it is true and it was how life really was, it was also very interesting to read about the Jews and there lives in the early 1900's I belive you should read it, so you can understand what they had to go through &amp; how hard it was to be a Jew in the early 1900's &amp; how easy it is for us."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book, &quot;Night&quot; was very realistic to World War II.

Never shall I forget that smoke.&quot; The emotions that the characters felt were often able to feel, as being the reader. I would not recommend this book to younger children because they probably wouldn't understand the factual parts and the understanding of war. Also, the book contains extremely sad, gruesome parts, and foul language. &quot;Night&quot; was a good story that showed, how evil and thoughtless people can be, courage, strength, love, sadness, hate, anger, all people have feelings, and to never give up. I think that the message of this book was that you need to fight for what you believe in and don't let anyone stand in your way."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book Night was a pretty good book, but also made you realize how the holocaust really was. I always knew about Nazi's going after the Jews, but I never knew all the details and what really happened. The book was really sad and it was a depressing story. So many events happened with the main character and almost all of them were bad: first, the German's move in their neighborhood, then the have to leave and go into concentration camps, Jew's families were separated and some burned, then they worked the ones who survived to death. I never thought some people could be so cruel. How they would just shoot them for no good reason and how they fed them next to nothing. I never imagined how bad it really was. I do recommend this book if you like true and historical stories, thats all it is based on. Then to really think all this really happen. Its kind of freaky. There is a lot of detail in the book too. So if you like lots of detail this is a good one. I personaly did kind of like it just, because of the detail and really seeing how much better my life is and how I would never want to be put in that position. Life could be worst like the one in Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I would only want to say this in the fewest of words to make the point come across more clearly.

Elie Wiesel not only talks about his personal struggles while living in a concentration camp, he publishes it for the whole world to read! That is the definition of a hero. To change the world, he opens himself. I was disappointed in seeing that Night did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize until 1986. I guess that's American Society though. The entire book is of course very emotional and drifts you away into a world very few Americans know about."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found Eli Wiesel's account of his xperiances during the Holocaust to be moving, to say the least.

Night brought the Holocaust and smacked me in the face with it. I have never ever been so shocked by a book. I cried, and I rejoiced. Every person in this modern day should read night.

This book is a magnificent account of a boy's life during the Holocaust . At 2 AM in the morning this book had me in tears and kept me up for the rest of the night . I'm not saying that this book will leave you sad . But the way Ellie uses words is much like the way an artist uses paint to to show something . This book is short but not enough can be said about it , so pick it up for yourself and let Ellie take you back to a time period that could only be described as NIGHT ."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When a teenager, Elie Wiesel was taken from his home, and he and his family were put in a series of concentration camps over several years. Night is the haunting record of that experience, as bleakly unflinching a memoir as has ever been written. Few can know the horrors of not only spending teenage years in such a place but also seeing family members and many others die and countless others suffer. Needless to say, Wiesel's own plight was also tragically great, and he unsurprisingly lost both innocence and faith. The experience touched him so deeply that he was unable to write of it for over a decade. When he finally did, he had great difficulty getting published; the events were still very close, and the world wanted to forget rather than being reminded. However, when published in 1960, Night was an international sensation, reawakening interest in the Holocaust and all it stands for. It was not only a literary triumph but the first step in Wiesel's core belief that we must always remember the Holocaust so nothing like it ever happens again.The book remains undeniably compelling, a masterpiece on many levels. Perhaps most immediately, it is a stark depiction of evil's height, showing humanity at its worst. This is valuable in every sense from philosophical to sociological but above all in destroying hollow optimism epitomized in the belief that things will take care of themselves and all will work out for the best. Night leaves no doubt that, left unchecked, human evil grows exponentially; it is our duty to curb it, and the awareness raised by such works is a very important part of this. Second, it is an invaluable historical document, one of the best - most thorough and readable - primary sources of the Holocaust's unparalleled miseries. As such, it is one of the darkest works ever - all the more so in being true; even the blackest imagination could not conceive such atrocities, which says all that need be said about this aspect of Night and the events it records.Yet there are several strong senses in which the book is not bleak. First, it is an artistic masterpiece; unwavering honesty and vivid description raise it above mere memoir, putting it with the most harrowing and unforgettable first-person accounts ever. Its biggest strength in this way is unadorned yet highly effective prose. Wiesel has no time for dizzying metaphors, lush descriptions, or other fancy writing; he has a bitter story to tell and tells it as plainly and - in the best way - as simply as possible. This makes it clearer and more memorable than it could ever have been otherwise, forcing us to focus on the events rather than the writing. The story speaks for itself as few can. Though barely one hundred pages, it has more of substance and significance than nearly any other book. The words are few but the implications endless.Perhaps more fundamentally, though Night is a savage condemnation of human evil, it is also a tribute to human endurance. Like a surprising number of others, Wiesel survived the Holocaust despite everything, showing just how far human beings can be pushed and live. Such determination and perseverance is truly incredible, a testament to the indomitable human spirit that is at least as astonishing in its way as the evil that confronted it and far more awe-inspiring. Wiesel not only lived but, in a long career starting with Night, has admirably devoted his life to exposing the Holocaust's monstrosities to guard future ages against recurring evil.Night is a profoundly important document in this and many other ways, a must for anyone even remotely interested in the Holocaust, World War II, Judaism, or the depths to which humanity can sink - as well as, in one sense at least, all that it can rise above. It is nothing less than one of the most important and valuable books of all-time. Though a very painful read, everyone should read it if only to see just how painful life can be - and hopefully to avoid passing the pain on to those lucky enough to have been born after the nightmares it faithfully records.As for this edition, it has a short Preface and a somewhat longer and older Introduction by Francois Mauriac, who knew Wiesel. Both give some interesting background on Wiesel and the book but are not revelatory. Anyone who comes across this will get a quality version, but some of the later ones, which have Wiesel Prefaces, are probably better."},{"Title":"Night","review":"There is no way you can read this and not be moved. It made me a life long fan of Elie Wiesel. He is, in my opinion, one of the most amazing people in the world. I admire him so much. I have no idea how anyone could have suffered through the Holocaust and lived to tell about it, but I am grateful that he was able to.This book will make you appreciate your family and life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Beyond and essential read, Night speaks to the reader about fundamental questions at the heart of the human condition. A powerfully moving autobiography, the story of this teenager's journey through the most horrific death camps of Nazi Europe, strips away discussion of anti-semitism and hatred, to present the raw suffering of individual humans, stuck in situations beyond their control. From the establishment of a ghetto in Elie's home town of Sighet, the reader can only watch with growing horror as the young man and his family are swept up in the Holocaust. Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Gleiwitz: some of the most infamous places in modern human history, rise around Elie, as we watch him stripped of absolutely everything. The reader is swept along helplessly, as Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\" unfolds - death marches, starvation, selections, cattle-carts full of people, torture, floggings, mass-murder - and as Elie is gradually reduced to nothing more than a 'hungry stomach'.What will humans do to survive? How important is loyalty, trust, family, faith, when one is faced with the grim reaper? If we cannot even answer these questions ourselves, what chance did a 15-year old boy stand?Despite its horrific and heart-wrenching subject, \\"Night\\" is an essential read for absolutely everyone; something that once read will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Reading this book with my high school students led to some of the best literary discussions I've ever had with young adults. So many reviews on Amazon.com have extolled the virtues of this story. One review caught my attention-mactan's review asking why there was no mention of gas chambers by Wiesel. NIGHT does address the crematoriums as the \\"crazy\\" woman on the train keeps yelling of the fires and those on the train who hated her constant yelling realize the truth as they see the smokestacks from the crematoriums. Also, AUSCHWITZ DID NOT HAVE GAS CHAMBERS. See Auschwitz: A New History by Laurence Rees for an explanation of why this is true- and why the portion of the camp system known as Birkenau DID HAVE GAS CHAMBERS."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys realistic & intense true-life story telling. The accounts of what occured during this terrible chapter of the 20th century are depicted in both a shocking & fascinating manner. I found this story incredibly compelling as well as informative. Any person who respects good writing should find Wiesel's autobiographical portrayal of these events to be of interest, as it reflects each end of the spectrum of the Human experience in perfect contrast to one another. Anyone who doesn't, however, i would believe to have no sense of humanity nor care for their fellow man becasue they are too ignorant to concieve the possibility of anything such as this occuring within their own lifetime."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" captivates from the opening page. It's a struggle of both pain and survival. It's a steady decline from humanity to the doctrine of animalism. One can empathize and sympathize with the pains that Wiesel and all other Holocaust sufferers felt, but without the experience, none can fully understand. In the end, if a reader of this book does not have a profound appreciation for the gift of life, and total disgust for the levels humanity can sink to, then the book was not fully appreciated or understood.Elie Wiesel was born in Sighet, Transylvania and his autobiography starts when he is approaching his formative teen years. He is becoming deeply aware and appreciative of religion at a time - because of WWII and the approaching Holocaust - in which he would soon challenge all things religious he holds dear.From his everyday life and home, to the big, then little ghetto, fear had not quite settled in. From the cattle wagons to the reception center for Auschwitz (Birkenau), fear had fully set in. It was at Auschwitz that pain, loss, and desperation also set in; Wiesel saw his mother and sister for the last time. From Buna and Dr. Mengele, to Gleiwitz and the death-march it took to arrive there, there is a full spectrum of emotions: degradation, shame, pity, grief, sorrow, anger, fear, care, hope; all is forgotten in a struggle to simply survive the harsh realities of starvation, exhaustion, freezing cold, and the constant pull of approaching death. At Buchenwald, Wiesel experiences his most tragic loss, and his eventual salvation, while realizing that his desire to live must be put above all else.\\"Night\\" is an easy read in that the details and words seem to fly by, page after page leaps at the engrossed reader. However, it is also a very difficult read; there is perhaps no other book that will similarly make you doubt or question humanity, a transcendent power, or life and death.\\"Night\\" is easily one of the most influential books I have ever read, the definition of an eye-opener."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel is a man of few words. His writing style is clipped and consists mostly of short declarative statements, but this in no way takes away from the story he is trying to relate. In fact, his experiences in Auschwitz, Buchenwald and Buna are so horrific, that any more detail might simply be too much for readers.I had the privilege of hearing Mr. Weisel speak at a college about 15 years ago. He speaks much like he writes, and without a doubt, I walked away with a profound feeling of respect and admiration for this man. He doesn't feel the need to overdramatize or use flowery and pedantic language. What's more, he expertly manages to inject the perfect amount of sarcasm (which in my opinion is essential to healing old wounds).Elie Weisel lived through the worst nightmare imaginable and came out alive, yet sadly alone and without his family. His story is succinct, yet full of emotion and heart. This story should be compulsory reading for anyone and everyone who is literate. It speaks volumes about humanity's self-imposed atrocities and how they can be overcome by those with enduring spirit and will. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book that I have currently finished reading is NIGHT. It is by Elie Wiesel. This book explains the hardships of the Jews and how people of then and today can get through anything. Night was very insightful. This is also why I liked this book.The main character of this book is a young boy, about15, named Maimonides who meets a friendly neighbor called Moshe the Beadle. He always came up with little theories and poems about life. Every day they would pray and have complex conversations, just about everything. Until one day the Nazis took Moshe the Beadle away because he was a foreign Jew. Maimonides get really depressed and started praying less.Then one evening Moshe the Beadle comes back, and tries to wear all of the other Jews about the Nazis, but no one believes him. They were all really confidence with themselves. All of the Jews refuse to move. Everyone claimed to have to go of a life to just throw it always on some liar. Until one day each Jew was called out side. Now all of them wish that they had listened to Moshe the Beadle."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\", by Ellie Wiesel, explains his real life in the Concentration Camps during World War II. His family and friends who were originally from Hungary were Jewish and were forced into starving, suffering, and mistreatment by the German leader, Adolph Hitler. The Nazi death camp's horror turns this young boy into the agonized witness to his family's murder, and the destroys his faith in God. This book awakens the shocking memory of evil at its absolute worst and carries with it the unforgettable message that this horror must never be allowed to happen again.The autobiographical nature of this book helps the readers identify with all the suffering and mistreatment that many innocent people had to witness and go through. Ellie Wiesel makes the scenes so real that any reader can feel like they were living in the horrible and terrifying events. The scenes are so vivid that the words can picture the Jews during the mistreatment of the Holocaust. Wiesel has described a painful journey through the darkness, through the false dawns and false days, until there are hints that tiny shafts of light can pierce the seemingly unending nights."},{"Title":"Night","review":"On a day-long visit to the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington DC ten years ago, one thing stuck in my mind and my heart, more than seeing the pile of shoes belonging to people who had been murdered and more than standing in an actual train car that carried them to their death. It was a simple quote chiseled into the wall, high above a walkway that took museum visitors from one room that recounted unspeakable terrors to another room that did the same thing.It was a quote from Elie Wiesel, from this book Night about how his first night in a concentration caused him to lose his god.\\"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed. Never shall I forget that smoke. Never shall I forget the little faces of the children, whose bodies I saw turned into wreaths of smoke beneath a silent blue sky. Never shall I forget those flames which consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget that nocturnal silence which deprived me, for all eternity, of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments which murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to dust. Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never.\\"This book has everything I've already read and heard about the Nazi atrocities. What I didn't expect though, was such a different perspective:Eliezer (Elie) and his family were pious Jews living in Sighet, Transylvania. They believed that Hitler and the Germans had no ill-will toward them, and for the first few weeks that their small town was occupied by the Germans in 1944, the families living there played host to the soldiers who needed to be quartered. They shared their meals together, trusted them, and indeed some of the German soldiers brought gifts to their Jewish hosts.As a young boy, Elie believed in the good in people and the goodwill of a god he prayed to every day. In one night, or actually a series of horrible nights, everything he believed to be true and good, vanished, except the love of his father, whom he managed to stay with throughout the course of the year and the many transfers between camps.Although Elie wondered where was his god, he knew that his father was always close to him, willing him to live and go on. This unbreakable bond of family provided the only uplifting moments of the novella.I'd like to think that this short, fictionalized account of a year in the camps is about survival and endurance and resilience of the human body, but the more I consider it, it's not: it's about the death of the human spirit and the death of a soul."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Comming straight from the mouth of a survivor, this chilling tale of a Jewish family stripped from their home, brings both pain and happiness. Elie Wiesel tells the true story of his seperation from his community and later his wife and daughter. The beauty of this story is not that he survives, since he is the author of this book, but the manner in which he carries himself through hard times. You will be astonished at the disturbing things innocent humans are put through in the various internment camps. The remarkable description that Elie goes through from the human ovens to the disease saturated bunks, will grab your feelings more than any other book. Reading this book will be a good experience for any reader. I recommend this book for anyone interested in a sad tale of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Elie Weisel, is a book different than any other I have read. Many opinions about history, and even life in some cases changed while reading Night. For a very long time I believed that Josef Stalin was the most evil man to live in the twentieth century. After reading Night I believe that Hitler and his relentless \\"fight\\" to exterminate Hebrews from the face of the planet is the most evil act of hate ever. Elie Weisel is a 12 year old boy living in the town of Sighet. Untouched by Nazis until about 1942, Elie begins his long tour of numerous concentration camps throughout Europe. This book is about the lengths a human will go through to survive. Night is about love, hope, determination, and the spirit of humanity to survive, forgive, and to inform us, the readers, that we must never forget the lives lost during the years of Nazi occupied Germany. We must never forget how 12 million people just like you and I were executed because of differences. Night is a book that should eventually be read by all high school students. I am still humbled by Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"If I had a list of required reading for the entire human population, Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, &quot;Night&quot;, would be at the top of the list.Reaching back into his Nazi-tormented childhood, Wiesel utilizes a rare literary talent: the ability to convey a child's impressions and experiences during one of the darkest times in our history through the wisdom of an adult's eyes. His unique power of words, combined with his incredible courage and fierce determination, continue to amaze me each time I read this book.To one who has never read an autobiography on the Holocaust: brace yourself. To one who considers her or himself to be an authority on the Holocaust: brace yourself. For what is contained in these pages is like nothing you have seen nor read, and it is nothing like you will ever see nor read again.I won't describe the details of &quot;Night&quot; -- not for fear of negatively impacting the experience first-time readers will have when they take this book into their hands -- but out of respect for the realization that I am simply incapable of doing so. It is a journey that each reader must take on her or his own.For those of us lucky enough to never have experienced the horrific tragedy that was the Holocaust, it is the very least that we can do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The people who rate this book badly because of its disturbing content seem to be missing both the point of the novel and the point of the whole amazon.com rating system. You do not rate a book from one to five stars on the basis of how &quot;peaceful,&quot; &quot;beneviolent,&quot; or &quot;pleasant&quot; the nature of the story itself is! I think most people realize that but I just wanted to mention it anyway - cause it is funny to see people who rate books like this 1-star because it dealt with &quot;bad&quot; things and therefore must be a &quot;bad&quot; book.Night is a tremendously important and very readable book. It is the story of a teenage boy's imprisonment in Nazi concentration camps, including Auchewitz. Night raises many issues in the context of the Holocaust. The central idea is probably the dubiousness of God: how, after all, could any God worth the name oversee such atrocities? But there are many sub-dilemmas as well, thought provoking in their own rights. Read it and find out.I don't want to take the power out of Night at all, but I'll also say that it seems like a lot of people think that this is a word-by-word factual account of Elie Wiesel's Holocaust experience. In fact, this book is classified as &quot;autobiography&quot; - when it is actually not. Certainly there is a huge element of fact in Night, and the actuality of the Holocaust was as bad if not worse than is presented in this book are in the book. Think of a story similar to Eliezer's happening six million times over and you will understand the Holocaust had a scope and magnitude that cannot be contained in one book. But remember that Night is a novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's Night is an account of a young Jewish boy's harsh experience in a German concentration camp. Many Jewish people do not flee Europe because the horror of the reality that people were capable of this carnage was much too deep to be realized by the people. Not only the Jewish people, but all of those in Europe stood by and didn't intervene with the Nazi path. This is a lesson that we can all learn from. As John Donne so eloquently said, \\"No man is an island.\\"Elie's accounts of his time in the camps show us the depths that humans can sink to, as well as their adaptive abilities to overcome. One description that brilliantly captures the animalistic levels possible of people was an excerpt that told of the bloody fights that would occur over scraps of food. While this allows one's body to survive, Wiesel informs us that the spirit is crushed and that the individual will inevitably be defeated by himself as much as by the enemy. Once the mental boundary is breached and self-discipline is lost, the emotional state of a shattered man will be unable to be reformed, leaving him vulnerable to the physical and psychological environment that surrounds him.Night is not a work of historical fiction. It is one of several books Weisel has written poignantly documenting his real-life experiences. His is a story that needs to be told, and he has done it in a painful, yet beautiful way. It is a warning that the past must be analyzed and reflected upon if it is to be prevented in the future. It also reminds us that being ignorant of the realities of the world leaves us a vulnerability that can be exploited. The hope that Wiesel gives us is that this does not have to happen again, unless we let it, and that even if it does, individuals will persevere. In the end, it is as inspiring as it is anguishing."},{"Title":"Night","review":"During Mr. Wisels acceceptance speech for this pulitzer prize winning novel, he mentioned that he wrote this because he never wanted people to ever carelessly forget what had happened in concentration camps just as they had carlessly let it take place. In that he did an excellent job. The images that are drawn for the reader in this book are so horrifying and so vivd that they leave a lasting imprint on your soul. He uses simple diction while showing the evrelating &quot;night&quot; that he and so many others felt. He writes of the loss of his illusions , the loss of his innocence and the loss of his god on that horrible &quot;night&quot;. I know that I will never forget, read this book so you can remember."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a very powerful and moving story. It brings you through a life of a Jewish boy who watches his family picked apart in front of his eyes. At first I was going to read this book so that I could read a 109 page book and get a good grade in library. Expecting to have to choke this book down I began to read. I ended up putting myself in a state so that I could not put it down. It is very powerful. It is a eyeopener to a subject that some didn't really want to accept such as I felt. It gives you a step by step life of a Jew going through the Nazi death camps at the near end of the world war. Yet as I read on I became to realize what the horrible things really happened while I wasn't alive. At my age this was a true wake up call to what really happened so long ago."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that this book was great and I would recommend it to many others to read. It gave me an insight of how the Jewish were feeling during this time period. It really put me in the characters shoes, and I really admire Elie Wiesel for his courage and sacrifice that he made while having to write this book. A well written novel, and an elightenment to history."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel &quot;Night,&quot; by Elie Weisel is a story of hope and struggle for the survival of a Jewish boy against Germany's &quot;death camps.&quot; Elie Weisel, a survivor of the holocaust retells his disturbing tale of the terror that was imposed upon the people of concentration camps. Weisel's srtuggle to survive would most definitely touch all people who read his truely devestating story. Weisel tells of the horror of the huge creamatories, where all people who failed the &quot;selection&quot; process that was imposed on all prisoners, were sent to be burned alive. He tells of the meager meals and unsanitary conditions that caused the death of millions of innocent people at the hands of the Nazis terror. The book is a touching story that most people will be affected by its form."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiesel was a great look into the life of a person who actually experienced the horrifying chaos of the Holocaust. The themes of survival, father-son relationship, and Faith in God made this book very interesting. I think that Wiesel did a good job writing this book and the imagery of the concentration camps were displayed very well. Reading Night gave me a better understanding of what the death camp experience was for all the people that were forced into them. I would strongly recommend this book to readers who are looking for an inside view of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Weisel's &quot;Night&quot; was a terrific book that informed me of the many struggles that his father and himself went through because of their background. I thought it was an factual, yet interesting book, that I would recommend to anyone that is interested in history of the Holocaust. The constant theme of hope and survival kept you wanting to keep reading on, to find out the fate of Elie and his father. The relationship between Elie and his father not only allowed me to see the willingness of oneself to put someone else you love before you, but also it allowed me to relate to the relationship between children and parents. The thoroughness of this book added to its greatness and allowed it to be very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As a class assignment, I was told to read the novel Night. At first I thought that this book was just like many of the others written about the Holocaust. However, after about 20 minutes of reading, I was engaged in a terrific and capturing story. Not only was I emotionally touched on several levels, but I also felt that at my age I could never fathom the incidents that actually happened to Wiesel. Although I hope never to encounter an experience such as this, I feel as though I have a better understanding of life in concentration camps. I highly suggest anyone remotely interested in the Holocaust to read this novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the only book that I have ever read that I will NEVER forget. The true inhuman attributes of the Nazis are very well depicted, as well is the terror that young Elie had to experience.

I loved this book because it taught me many lessons -- one being &quot;Never give up faith; Never give up hope.&quot; I hope everyone who hasnt read this book will take the time to, and i challenge you to try to finish it in MORE than a day. That is how hard it was for me to put down. I hope you like it too."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was a pretty good book, but it was a little confusing.

I love this book and I've told everyone online and offline to go and get this book, and read it, and they'll love it!!! Wiesel uses his experiences to touch you in ways that you would never believe a book could. I want to read all of Wiesel's books because of how this book made me feel.

Him and his family went threw some bad times at the camp.They face alot of different and very unusual things during there time in the camp.

The main charachter Elizer Wiesel also the author kept us on the edge of our seats. It is a good book to read, because it tells about the beliefs of the Jewish people.

The Jewish people had no help from anybody and they had to leave their homes and possessions and get forced to live in Ghettos. They were also social rejects from their towns.

Before i read the book i wouldn't have known how he could have lost so much hope and faith, but once i became aware of how he lost so much faith and will to survive.A ggod example of irony in this book is in the beginning of the book when thew germansmove move into the jews houses. The jews thought that the Germans would be nice to them, but then they began to be meab to them and began to put barricades on there houses and take their valuable posessions. Another good example of irony is when Elie and his Father are walking towards the fire pit that the people are burning in , but about two steps before they got to the pit they changed directions and didn't have to go into the pit.\\"The soup tasted like carcuses.\\"If i had soup to eat every day im sure i grow to love it. If that was all we had to eat though i'm sure it would grow old very soon. I would love to eat more than just soup every day too.In summary of this book night, I think that this book was a very good one. It kind of makes the reader sad when he reads the book though. It makes us feel lucky to live in the years we do now. If i were a Jew in those days i dont know if i could have made it through all of the pain they had to go through. If i were seperrated From my mom i would have been too sad to go on."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"A-7713\\". I don't know what I would do if my name was changed to a number. I think that it surely would have been weird to be addressed as a number because I would feel like I didn't mean anything, sort of like being treated like I was a dog.in the book Night there were a lot of emotional and sad things that occurred throughout the story. There was also a lot of violence and hatred thrown at the jewish people during the Holocaust.I think that the book Night is very educational for kids these days because it teaches us a lot about what went on during the Holocaust. \\"It gave me a good picture on how badly the jews were treated, and for what? Because of their religion they were involved in and the beliefs that they had.\\" In my opinion I think that the Germans during the Holocaust, were not very nice people, and I don't know how any civilized humn being could burn another person or watch another starve, doing nothing about it. I also think that if most of the jews wouldn't have stayed together and kept little faith that they had in the lord, the Germans and the concentration camps would have got the best of them.\\"From time to time I would dream of a drop of soup, of an extra ration of soup.......\\". This was merely one of Elie's thoughts that evolved in his head, practically throughout the Holocaust. The jews were starved, beaten, and harrassed for everything that they had during the Holocaust. They had nothing and would have nothing all through the years of the holocaust. My sorrow goes out to all the jews that survived or that were killed by the Germans."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book as an English assignment for seventh grade English. Although I read many books concerning WWII, I found Night as a book that can touch anyone. As an autobography, it shared personal experiences. That was what made Night so special. The author was [Jewish]that lived imprisoned in a concentration camp. like Anne Frank, except this author is still alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I already knew what happened in concentration camps, but what I didn't know how bad it was in concentration camps. After reading this book called NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is added to my knowledge of the Holocaust. The good sides of this book are that he didn't leave anything out and he was true about every thing. He told the story like he lived those moments again. While reading this book I imagined myself in those camps and I couldn't stand some of the things I heard in the book. It was just terrible what they Jewish people went through in World War II."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I would highly recommand this book Night by Elie Wiesel, to people who think that they're not loved or complain about their life. I read Night for a school project. I hardly ever read because I dislike to read. But as I sat there and read the book or had the teacher read it out loud, I noticed my eyes graze on the words like a hungry person staring at food. It was the most interesting and detailed book I could have read.I liked the book Night so much that I want to get the trilogy \\"Dawn\\". In Night Elie talks anout his life story from the age of 12 to 16. He explains every detail of what he went through in the Holocaust. Some details include smell of the food, taste of the bread, and feelings like when he wanted to hurt the S.S officer for hitting his dad or when he was so hungry and hurting really bad. I would definitly recommand the book Night by Elie Wiesel"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiezel is an intriguing story based on actual events of the Holocaust. The detail in this story awing and sometimes grotesque. There are details of being able to see many of the peoples whole skeleton inside of their body. I would recommend reading this book if you are interested in history.However, if you you have a weak stomach this is not the book for you. I enjoyed the book but found myself upset with the way it ended."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an excellent book. It is a very vivid and detailed account of the concentration camps during World War II. It is told through the eyes of a young man, Elie Wiesel. This book is extremely thought-provoking.In the book, Elie describes his fear and terror of being brought to a ghetto with his family. At first, the ghetto was not bad at all; it was better than Elie and his family had expected. However, the day his family packed up and was transported to a concentration camp was the day Elie's life changed forever. On the way to the concentration camp, Jewish people were packed into trains so they could hardly move. Once at the concentration camp, families were split up. Elie was terrified; he was still very young. He was separated from his mother and siblings, but he was not separated from his father. From that day, all the way until the end, Elie stayed with his father. When Elie's father grew weak, Elie gave him some of his food ration from the day. Soon after arriving at the camp, every person was sent to work. Elie and his father were split up during the day, but continued to support each other. After what seemed like forever, Elie and his father were moved to another concentration camp. All of the Jews were forced to run to the next camp. Anyone who stopped or was too weak to continue was shot. The officers in charge had no mercy for anyone and killed even little children. Soon, the weather turned cold, and people began to die from sickness. Elie's foot became infected and his father grew ill. Through it all, Elie forced himself to stay alive and stay strong. He forced his father to do the same. In the end, Elie learns a powerful lesson. He learns that belief in himself and in others got him through this horrific experience.In this book, Elie describes everything with such graphic detail, I could see everything he described in my head. For example, I still remember the picture I got in my head when Elie described the ghetto when everyone had left to go to the concentration camps. It was empty, desolate, and silent, almost like a desert. It was as if no one had every lived there at all. I thought Night was an excellent historical biography of the cruelties of World War II."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book left me stunned. People talk a lot of The Diary of Anne Frank, but this book gives more of an overall view of the situation because it was writeen after the fact. This book will amaze you. I often think that people who still hold on to racist and prejudice feelings for any group should read this book and see through the eyes of someone who lived this terrifying hell. I keep hoping this book will change their minds."},{"Title":"Night","review":"THis book i was required to read for my summer reading when i heard it was about teh hollacost ( i know i did'nt spell that right) i was like great just another depressing tale bout all these people getting killed. When i actually sat down to read it i realized it was soo much more than all the other acounts i'd read about the nazi death camps. The author actually lived through this and dealed with soo many struggles and was able to write all these horriable memories down. i know that if i , and it makes me realize how lucky i am that this would never happen in this day and age, had gone through what he did i would of given up very early on in his struggles.So if you are looking to read someones actual account of whats it was like to be in a concentraion camp read this heartbreaking story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Somehow I missed out on being assigned this in school, though I remember seeing many of my friends carrying copies around one semester. A recent visit to the U.S. Holocaust Museum prompted me to correct the oversight.One review excerpt on the jacket describes 'Night' as being beyond criticism, which I completely agree with. You just can't apply the normal literary or aesthetic measures to this narrative. It is direct and true and must be read. Mr. Wiesel has performed a great service to humanity in recording his terrible experiences."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought night was a wonderful book. The best holocaust book I have ever read. It was not only a book about the holocaust, but if you look further it is in fact a book about humanity. And how when one's humanity it taken from them, hope is lost and you die. It is also about the bond between human's and how when one can rely on the other, they keep each other's humanity intact and are able to survive. This is such a powerful book! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was exposed to this book in camp as an 8-year old. I still rememeber the book in detail and I even encourage many of my students to read Night so that they can understand about an entire generation of people that they will never know."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night written by Elie Wiesel is one of the most powerful novels I have ever read. The Nobel Peace Prize winner of 1986 tells a terrifying tale in graphic detail of Elie Wiesel&#65533;s experience of the World War II and inparticular the way the Jewish society was treated by the Nazis.This book shows that if you have faith there is hope. Elie Wiesel had faith. He survived through the ghettos, the torment of the Nazis, stuffy crowed trains, lack of food and water and two different death camps. The description of the two death camps is so real and horrible that you wish in some parts it was not, and wish this was only a fictitious novel. It was only faith that helped him through this.He explores some very strong theological ideas, the strongest though being, why does God let such suffering happen. In one episode three people are &#65533;strung up&#65533; and hung. Two of which are men and one a small child. The men die quite quickly but the boy is so light he gradually suffocates to death over more than half an hour. Elie describes the way they are all (the men and boys of that section of the death camp) forced to watch this boy die, and as they do one man says, &#65533;Where is God now?&#65533; and Elie answers him in his thoughts, &#65533;Where is He? Here He is &#65533; He is hanging here on these gallows&#65533;&#65533;Just those powerful lines remind us of the death of Christ and the amount of suffering he went through and his identification through suffering with all who suffer. It might not strike Elie that way because he was of the Jewish faith but to Christian it certainly strikes us that way. This novel is a very intriguing one that should be read by everyone (when they are of an age suitable enough to read it) so that in the future this may never happen again. When people do read this they will be able to see what pure hatred can do to people and why it is important to keep the faith."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is listed as fiction, but is largely based on the author's experience as a concentration camp survivor during the Jewish Persecution of World War II. It is powerful in its compactness. My wife and I read it aloud to each other on the course of a 5-day backpack trip in Desolation Wilderness. It really read like a true to life horror story of the atrocities humans can inflict upon other humans. The most frightening thing about the book is the refusal to believe the impending hardships and relative blind sightedness the Jewish community in the Hungary village undergoes during the first part of the book. Hindsight offers us the element of dreaded expectation we feel in horror movies before something really bad is about to happen to the unwary on-screen character. Only with this book it really did happen. The author starts out with a developing devout mystical faith in God and by the end loses it in its entirety. No human bean should have to lose their faith that way and that really is the power of the book. At some of the holocaust displays and concentration camp sites that I have seen in Europe are the words, &quot;Lest we forget.&quot; This book sears the lessons humanity learned from the terrible tragedy of the holocaust and leaves us with a yearning to never let those events occur again. Of interesting note is that the high tide of the protagonist experience in the book is when they are sequestered off within a controlled Jewish Ghetto in their Hungary village. The characters enjoy cultural unity and isolationism and find it comfortable and familiar. All this in the face of eventual imprisonment and extermination. There are parallels to the modern day Balkans and the sectionalization movement around the globe to align political entities with ethnic entities. Maybe it makes a group feel comfortable to be surrounding with like people. We just can't afford it in modern society. The world moves towards diversity and those that find a way to thrive and revel in that diversity will succeed. Lest we Forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I don't know where to start. Wow! All I can say at this point is that this is an incredibly powerful and moving story. The fact that it is true just eats my heart out. I can't really relate to his life. I can't even begin to understand the hell he went through at the concentration camps. I don't know how those minutes would traumatize his view of time, altogether. I have absolutely no concept of enduring that kind of pain and that harsh way of suffering through the days and cold nights. I wish I could say that I could feel his wounds. But I can't, all I can have is pity, which I'm sure Mr. Wiesel doesn't want from anyone. It's been a long time since I have read such a touching book. Elie is a great writer and when good writing is combined with an extreme situation, that almost always results in an excellent book. This is by no exageration a masterpiece and it provides distinct evidence of man kind's atrocities. The cruelty is embarassing to read about. It humbles me and makes me think about what I really have to complain about. I am sorry that people are ignorant and I am sorry for the horrible treatment of the Jews among so many others. I am sorry that the attitudes of prejudice are prevalent still today. Nothing has changed in that way. Maybe now it's not against the Jews but there will always be someone who thinks his race/religion/ethnic background is superior to another. I apologize on behalf of mankind for their indecent and unacceptable treatment of other humans. I apologize for the good people who were silent. This book is so strong, so blatant and so ugly. The hatred is obvious and the evil is hideous but we have to read these books to understand why we can't let this happen again, EVER. I don't want to believe this and I barely can. I don't want to cry for all of the children, men and women who lost their lives at the hands of men who thought they were doing what was right. I think we are all guilty. Even though I, personally wasn't even alive yet, I am wron! g for all of the little things I've done or said to hurt other people. It is scary but we need to see this awful kind of thing more often to see the damage and to get rid of the torture that goes on everyday. I screamed when I read that this 15-year-old boy put through this for what? What was the reason for all of the pain? His religious convictins? Hmmmm. Good reason, right? I'd give my life for everyone in the world to read and understand this book and to make sure that this type of tragedy is never repeated. Elie Wiesel is tough. Tough as nails. And his writing in this book conveys that message. This book is a must read. -By: Rebekah Hildebrandt, Warsaw Community High School Senior."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\"by Elie Wiesel, evokes feeling for the Jewish people who suffered through the Holocaust and also brings one to ponder just how these things happen in the first place. Upon reading we can't help to get an insight into the horror the story tells, albeit a very small part, but it also brings questions to our own minds. How is it so many people can torture other human beings simply because a leader decides it is right? How is it that as human beings we are so weak we can be swayed to go along blindly and kill innocent people,among them thousands of children? Futhermore, it makes one question whether it is possible that so many thousands of people could have committed such horrendous acts without regret and conscience. Not only does the reader feel for the victims but also feels for those who were forced to take part in the slayings as it is inconceivable that so many people could have willingly partaken in the Holocaust. This account of the Holocaust has brought not only emotions of anger and sorrow for the Holocaust victims but has also promoted a great remorse that human beings have been, are, and will likely continue to harm others for any variety of reasons. This book brings alot of questions to mind about the shortcomings of the human race. Elie's account of the Holocaust is definately worth reading and reading again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book was everything and more than i expected, makes one step back and look at life!!

It captures the raw essence of the narrative. I use it when we read NIGHT in my Englsih 12 classes. Rosenblatt is exceptional."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was required to read this book a few years back by my English teacher; little did I know that it would become one of my favorite books! Though I have always been interested in the Holocaust, I had never read a book that presented it in such a straightforward and frank sort of way. The book, though short, takes you on an emotional roller coaster with both heartbreaking and uplifting true stories that keep you eager to turn the page from start to finish. The author's style is such that he is able to create a vivid image in your minds eye, but never make the book seem hard to read or like he is over doing it. Overall, a great read, one that will surely stick with you for a while and help you realize how fortunate we truly are."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I just finished Night by Elie Wiesel. It is a first-hand account about a boy's experience through the Holocaust. Separated from his mom and sister, Elie had to endure the Holocaust with only his father at his side. I learned about the mindless work that he did day after day, I saw how the Nazis dehumanized their prisoners, and how the prisoners put food in front of every thing, even family. Elie Wiesel wrote this book because he wanted the world to know about the atrocities that happened in the camps. He also wanted to make sure the world never forgets. After reading this book, I Will never forget. I highly recommend Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading this book I too wondered why? How could anyone let this happen? Elie makes you feel like you were in the camp its self. His adverbs so expressive & emotional easy to understand, yet almost painful to read & comprehend. One can only imagen what he went through. You can never know how bad it is till you have lived it. Though Night is the closest to understanding, you still cant even begin to understand how it really was. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"THis book was very powerful and moving while at the same time disturbing. I had my children read it.

He calls it a &quot;nightmare-&quot; this is an understatement. One can wake up from a nightmare. The horror Wiesel lived had no outlet.A Jew from Transylvania, Wiesel grew up with a strong religious background. He found an unlikely teacher in a man named &quot;Moshe the Beadle.&quot; Moshe taught his pupil that man could not understand God's answers to man's questions; man could only ask God the right questions. Would Elie's time in Auschwitz destroy his budding faith? The book explores faith in a searing way. A must read for all. Ages 16 and up."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a story about a young boy's life during the Holocaust. He uses a different name in the story, Eliezer. He comes from a highly Orthodox Jewish family, and they observed the Jewish traditions. His father, Shlomo, a shopkeeper, was very involved with the Jewish community, which was confined to the Jewish section of town, called the shtetl.In 1944, the Jews of Hungary were relatively unaffected by the catastrophe that was destroying the Jewish communities of Europe in spite of the infamous Nuremberg Laws of 1935-designed to dehumanize German Jews and subject them to violence and prejudice. The Holocaust itself did not reach Hungary until 1944. In Wiesel's native Sighet, the disaster was even worse: of the 15,000 Jews in prewar Sighet, only about fifty families survived the Holocaust. In May of 1944, when Wiesel was fifteen, his family and many inhabitants of the Sighet shtetl were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. The largest and deadliest of the camps, Auschwitz was the site of more than 1,300,000 Jewish deaths. Wiesel's father, mother, and little sister all died in the Holocaust. Wiesel himself survived and immigrated to France. His story is a horror story that comes to life when students in high school read this novel. Even though many students have not witnessed or participated in such horror, they relate to the character because Wiesel is their age. They cannot believe someone went through the nightmare he did at their age.This book focuses on many themes: conflict, silence, inhumanity to others, and father/son bonding. We see many, too many, conflicts this young man faces. Eliezer struggles with his faith throughout the story. He believes that God is everywhere, and he can't understand how God could let this happen, especially as Eliezer faces conflict everyday in the concentration camp. He also learns silence means. He says he says it is God's silence that he doesn't understand. He feels that God's silence demonstrates the absence of divine compassion. Another silence that drive confuses Eliezer is the silence of the victims. He cannot understand why they don't fight back, especially with the inhumanity that is forced upon them. It is because of this inhumanity that he loses faith, not only in God but also in men. He tells how at the beginning, the Germans were \\"distant but friendly.\\" However, when they reach the camps, the soldiers are transformed from men to monsters. As part of this inhumanity and lack of faith is the instances when a son betrays his father. He sees this several times and can't comprehend how a son, in order to save his own life, betrays his father. Luckily for Eliezer's father, Eliezer's love and bond is stronger than self-preservation.How can students relate to this story when they haven't experienced anything near what Wiesel did. Maybe they haven't experienced these acts, but they have experienced conflict, silence, inhumanity, and bonding, and if a teacher focuses on these themes, the students will relate.Works Cited:Sparknotes.com. http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/themes.html"},{"Title":"Night","review":"this book was very interesting. it really was deep into thehistory of the holocost in my thoughts it was really painfull an if i were there i would have killed my shelf or run away i would end up not being able to stand it the jewish people must of had a really strong heart . what i am saying is i would have gave up hope"},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I read this book for the first time I couldn't put it down. Night is a story that hits hard on the mind, the soul, and the heart.

This time in modern human history can only be described as horrible and Elie Wiesel tells his story of survival, a story that all human beings should read as to never allow a tragedy like the holocaust to occur again.This book lives on in the hearts of those that read it.

NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is a horrifying book based on the author's survival of the Holocaust.

The book is absolutely astounding! A must-read for any great literary fanatic!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is NOT a work of fiction. It is one of the most powerful autobiographies I've read; Wiesel's great use of imagery really puts the reader right in the action. It IS heartwrenching at moments though (this is the only book I've ever read that's actually made me cry). Anyways, I strongly STRONGLY encourage you to read this book; it's an easy read and would take 1 to 2 nights tops!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is an excellent, riveting, page-turning memoir. I found myself not able to put it down once I started reading.The book itself is put together very well. Wiesel uses excellent diction and syntax throughout the piece. The simple and straightforward way he describes his experience is extremely shocking and eye opening to the reader. The plot flows smoothly throughout the book, making it easy to follow and a quick read. The choice of which characters he includes is also effective for the reader, such as the sad angel faced boy.I found only a few flaws with Wiesel's piece. Though it is implied, it is never really made clear exactly what happens to his mother and sisters. I also wanted to know more of what he thought about the separation from his mother. He never goes into detail about how he felt.Wiesel's description is graphic at times and I would not recommend it to anyone of young age."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had always wanted to read NIGHT and now that I have, I have nothing but the most heart felt sorrow for this poor man and his family.

Although not considered an autobiographical piece of literature, while reading Night, one can actually take an in-depth look at what the author actually went through during his time in the German concentration camps.This book took me on an emotional roller coaster that felt like it would never stop. From the first word I read, I didn't want to put it down. It contained grotesque detail that you can't find anywhere in history books, which up until now, was where I had found all the facts I knew about the concentration camps and the cold hard truth of what happened in them.The only thing that I didn't like about this book was the abrupt way that it ended.

His positive influences rub off on his peers keeping them alive. His motavation to live shows off his strong traits not only as a person but as a leader. This book also displays true events that occured durring the Holocaust.I enjoyed reading this book because I liked the way that there was never a dull moment.

I had always heard about the Holocaust and had even seen shows and movies about the Holocaust, but I did not understand the extent of the Holocaust until I read Night. Reading the novel, I felt as if I was there suffering right along side of Elie as he struggled to stay alive.

I have read many books over the Holocaust and have done many papers over it, but I have never read a book that gave me chills, and this was the first one to do it. I could not put this book down and I think everyone should be required to read it. Elie elaborates on many things in this book and it is very hard to understand what he actually went through, but he made it as clear as possible which made me enjoy this book even more.

A young boy, Elie, and his father Mr. Wiesel, and his friends and family had to go through Nazi orders and through the different concentration camps. A lot of people lost their lives just trying to survive a day in the camps. I believed this novel was very interesting and taught me more about the Holocaust and what actually went on. I dont understand how somebody could kill innocent people for fun. Food, water, and clothing was something to fight over when you got a chance at it. This novel is very sad but is good to let people realize what happened and how we should be grateful for the things we have today."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that this book was a good book.

Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I was anxious to read about what was going to happen next. At times, I felt like I was in Elie's situation trying to survive. It made me think of how unpredictable life can be. One day, Elie was happy with his life and his beliefs in God. The next events in his life was more of a nightmare. People can easily jump to conclusion of what they would do in his situation, but they can't really say anything until they actually have to face it themselves."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The tradgic but true story of Elie Wiesel's experience in the Holocaust is one of the most enlightening stories ever written. I'm not sure if he could have been more honest but he certainly did relay his message. This story awakens you to how the world really is. It pulls the veil out from over your eyes and exposes you to the harsh reality that the world is cruel and can sometimes be unbarable. This story is a documentary on human behavior. It explains how we might react under certain conditions. And how propaganda can change how we might originally react. This book is something that i will remember always. I will carry this information with me from now on."},{"Title":"Night","review":"During the Holocaust there was alot of suffering. People died just for the fact that they were Jewish. The German soldiers were trained and told to torture the jews. They killed the jews for no apparent reason. This book was very interesting because, of the different ways that people survived. I like how they don't surgar coat things. They told how it was no matter how volgure it was or discusting. I thought that it was hard to believe that the jews just sit there and let them build fences around their house anyways. Something should have been done about that. They should have rised up and took a stand. If all of them did that then they might not have been in that situation. How could there be so much hate from people. I don't like that. I don't like how the book just came out and said what happened. Just because I feel selfish. I just want to sit there and cry. What would I have done in that situation?? Who knows.. The US should have done something way before they did. Elie's purpoose for this book is to show people like me, who didn't know what had happened the truth. He wanted to let everyone know how fortunate we are. What they went threw and how they got threw it. How the parents were taken away from their kids and how they all just killed them and kept stacking bodies everywhere. How the strong son Katz had to put his fathers body in the furnance."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a good book. I only wish I could have learned more about the Holocaust. I learned how awful and horrible the Holocaust really was. It was very sad to hear about the families that died and what all happened in the camps. It was amazing that Elie and his father lived through it together for so long. I liked how discriptive the book was because some books you don't really get the whole out-look on things. It made me interested in it more. I didn't really like how the book ended because I wanted to learn what happened after they were saved by the Americans and what happened to his mother and sisters. I wouldn't change anything about the book. It was about his life so it should be told by him how Elie wanted to. Elie published this book so everyone would know what happened during the holocaust. The most memorable part in the book for me would have to be when the got put on the cattle trains and the lady was screaming about fire and they all ended up beating her just like the SS solders would later beat them, \\"without passion\\". I think what the Jews went through was very horrible and no one should ever have to go through that. Why on earth people think they are better then other people is beyond me. To think that one race of people can think they are better then another is outragous. No one should be a loud to make camps that people have to go to so they can die. The Jews were very couragous for having to go through that. It just makes no sense to me that the Americans didn't help them out sooner or even let this happen at all. Maybe when I read the rest of his book I will give it five stars. All and all it was a great book and I am glad I got the chance to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"You can't say much about likes in this book because its mostly violence. There is nothing to dislike about this book. It tells a story that people went through not to long ago. This is a part of history. I like the book just the way it is I would not change anything about it. You can never change the past. Elie's purpose for writing this book was to let the people know what really went during the Holocaust. Some say the Holocaust never happened, I wish they would tell that to the millions of people who died or the ones that lived but never got to see their mother, father, son, daughter, grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, cousin, or any other family member again. One man led this horrible nightmare. One man killed generations of Jewish families; one man changed the world forever, who says it couldn't happen again.My most unforgettable moment was the hanging of the young boy. People had to walk pass and watch him die. They could not save him; he could not save his self."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was excellant. It helped me understand the Holocaust and what happened during WW2. It goes into great detail of how the jews were treated and how they managed to survive this terrible event.I liked how real the book was and how it was a real life story told by a boy who survived.I didn't dislike anything about the book other than just what the book told me happened that I thought was ethically wrong.I don't think I would change anything about it except make it longer.Ellie's purpose for publishing this book is to let people know what really happened during the Holocaust. I think he wanted people to know the horrors they experienced and how they had to sacrifice everything to survive. The most memorable part of the book was when Katz had to throw his father into the furnace because he was to weak. I don't think i could throw my parents into the furnace. I could not imagine being in that position."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really liked the book. I learned much on what happend durring that time. There wasnt much to dislike about the book because i thought it was interesting the whole time. It was horrible how the germans treated the jews. They put them through discusting things. How they were killed was awful and it shouldnt have happened. I think Elies purpose for publishing the book it to take you through on what happened to him and everyone else.The most memoriable part of the book was when they had to walk in front of the boy who was hung and look at him, and how the man asked elie if it was going to take long because he was hungry. That is sad that the people got used to so many people dieing and got to the point of no feeling."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was very enjoyable for that it gave you the backgrounds and dramatic effects that you might not have known. The book allows you to really understand the events from the past that some people do not believe and others feel very strongly about that did happen.I can't say I disliked stuff on this book for that it's about facts and real life events that happened to the Jews and how bad the Germans were to them under Hitler's rule. The one thing I maybe would have changed is to use more events to try and get even more people to realize how horrible Hitler's rule was over people and hope that more they would understand what the Jews had to face in order of hoping to survive.I believe Elie's purpose in publishing this book is just to let people know of the things the did happen and in a way to try and get people not to discriminate against other becuase there different you never know where someones past lays so dont judge them. The most memorable part was to me when Elie said \\" I can't cry anymore because I have no more tears to cry,I have cried to much\\" saying that when her father dies she has no tears and that she saw to many people die and cry that she had nothing left."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night was about a little boy growing up in the Holocaust. He had to leave his house and leave his family except for his father and go to concentration camps. It tells about his experiance and what he had to go through. I enjoyed this book because it gives you a real look at what went on during that time. It was very graphic about what really happened. The only thing I didn't like about the book was some of the details it gave you about the killings. I don't think I would change anything about this book because there is no way I could. I wasn't there to say what happened. Elie published the book to let the public know what really happened during this time period. The most memorable part in the book was when the SS soldiers hung a little boy because he helped someone. It was a very upsetting because the camp had to walk by him and look him in the face when he was still alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"There wasn't much to like about the book. I read a lot of books and I don't like killing and gross stuff. And the book was a true story that made it even worse. What I disliked about the book was just about everything because no one should be treated like that and I really didn't like reading about it. You really can't change it. He told the true even though it was bad. I think the purpose for publishing the book was to let people know how the Jews were treated and how unfair it was to them. The most memorable part (which I really don't want to remember) was when they were using the children for target practice. That was horrible.The book to me was not good in the sense of what was in it. It was the fact that people were actually treated that way just because someone disliked Jewish people."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book night was a great book. It had a nice story line behind the book. I liked the book because the book had a real story to it. Not like other books that are made up I dont care for books that arent true.The only part that i didnt like about the book is when the jew reached the soup pots and died for no reason.If i could change a part in the book I would change the part about the soup pots.Elie just wanted the world to know what he had to go though when he was a child.My most menorable part of the book was at the beging of the book where the threw babys in the air for target pratice. Over all this book was a great book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think this book was absolutely amazing. There is such depth in this book, it contains so many issues that Jews had to endure during this tmie of persecution. It makes you think how could people have been so cruel? This book definetly offers an in depth look into the holocoust(sp?) that no teacher can teach"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book night is now one of my favorite books in the whole world. The book is a great book for young adults and adults of any age. Night tells you about what happened in the past for the jews that got caught by the nazi's. It also tells you about the consentration camps that the jews got sent to and how they got treated while they were there. The last thing that the book tells you about is how they got sent to different consentration camps and how many times they got there camps changed and they sometimes had to walk to there different camps which were aproximentaly 3-4 hours away in walking distance. this book is a great book and i hope that you get a chance to read this wonderful and true book about the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was an eye-opener for me. Elie Wiesel had a way of making me feel like I was actually standing next to him while he was going through all of this. He talked about many of the situations with much depth, but not so much that it made me sick. He gave me enough information so I could still understand the troubles that the people of the camps had. It was nice to see how someone who witnessed this felt. After reading this book I want to learn more about the Holocaust and people's emotions towards it. I would recommend this book to everyone. I am positive that if you pick up this book, you will not want to put it down until the very last page."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that the book Night was a very informational, understanding resource about what happened in the Holocaust. It was a great book. This book told me things that I would probably would never have found out. I liked how the book was about the author and his real life experience. I would really like to thank the author of the book Night for sharing this information with anyone who reads this book. I think that this book was probably the most interesting book I have read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that the book Night was a very good book. The author didn't give many grusome details, but instead talked about the emotional aspect of it. I have read a lot about the holocaust, but this book is one of the best that I have read. It goes into detail about exactly what happened while they were in the concentration camps. I actually felt like I knew Elie, and his family members, and I felt like I was there. I think that the things that happened to Elie, along with the others in the camps, was awful. The Germans treated them horribly, and I don't understand how anyone could torture innocent people. So overall I thought that the book Night was by far one of the best holocaust books ever!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that this book was an interesting view of the world of the people who lived in and through the Holocaust. The feelings of human despair and the loss of faith are vividly described by the author. The way that people around Elie reacted to their situation was very real and believable. His story is the epitome of the Holocaust experience. The most moving situation in the story was the hanging of the &quot;sad eyed angel&quot;. This shows the relationship of religion and human emotion, in my eyes anyway. The story is the most gripping that I have read this year and may be the only very moving story that I will read this year."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I had to read this book for my English class and I enjoyed it very much. I have read many books on the Holocaust and this was by far one of the best. Most books want to include the horror on a physical level but this book took the horror on a moral level. Elie Wiesel did a great job explaining the emotional pain and also the mental abuse that went along with the Holocaust. This is not a long book and would be good for younger kids that are interested in the Holocaust to read. The book is easy, the content isn't very graphic, and there isn't a lot, if any profanity. Overall I thought this was a great book that did a great job at describing things that are so hard to comprehend about the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night deals with more of the emotional and psychological aspects of the Holocaust. The book mainly concentrates on the author's own experiences at the concentration camps rather than the overall view of Hitler who is only briefly mention in the book. This book is one of the easier books on the Holocaust to read because it does not go into too much detail about the tortures the Jews and other minorities had to go through, but yet at the same time it gives you enough information to gather a perspective of what the camps were like. When I first started reading Night I didn't think I would be able to get further than page 7 because it didn't hold my attention, but once I forced myself to pick it up and actually read it I was able to fly through the book in no time. It is so sad to think this only happened 60 years ago to a boy that is almost my age. It is absolutely amazing to me how the prisoners in the camps made it through each day of hell. You don't want to believe what you're reading actually happened. It makes you wonder where did they find the strength to carry on?"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think this book would be a good choice to read because it puts a slightly different perspective on the Halocaust. Elie Wiesel's account of this tragedy is more about the moral issues of the victims and of the feelings and thoughts that crossed their minds. The book does not talk as much about the unspeakable cruelty of World War II but more about the heart ache that went with it. The book is also good if you have not read any Halocaust survivor stories since it is rather short. It grabs your attention right away and does not let it go. You can get a better grip on what the Jews and many other minorities went through during this time. Which I think was the authors goal when he wrote this. He wanted to try and let the book identify with people as much as possible. It is very moving and you feel as if you are going through each struggle with this 15 year old."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is an excellent book for the high school and adult reader. It is thought provoking, giving insight into how the german occupation and antisemitism infiltrated this small community. It is written from the prospective of a survior and his family. It demostrates how the Jewish people tried to deal with the holocaust, first having difficulty in believing that is was actually happening then relying on each other for support. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The author of this memoir had no problems teling us what really happened during the rein of the Germans. Many of the things that happened in this book were incredibly gruesome.I would have to recommend this book for a mature audience. there are crucial points in this book where you feel that if that were to happen to you, you would have reacted differently.To give an honest opinion on this book, if i didnt have to read it in class I probabaly wouldn't have picked it up.But once I opened it I couldn't close it. I had to find out what would happen. I had begun to feel if I put the book down before it was finished i would miss something.This book would be great to read if you want to get an eyewitness feel on what took place. Like most peope want to hear the how peoplw were treated and why they were treated this way. If thats not enough you might want to go to BlockBusters and pick up Schindlers List. This way you'll be able to see what happened and not just read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Have you ever thought about being taken out of your house and taken to a concentration camp? I haven't until I read the book Night.To attract the reader's attention, Wiesel used a lot of metaphors, good imagery and irony in Night. On page 50 Wiesel uses imagery that feels you are there beside him. When Idek through a fit and went on a frenzy and I got in his way. He leaped on me like a wild animal, hitting me in the chest, on the head, throwing me down and pulling me up again, his blows growing more and more violent until I was covered with blood. (Wiesel, 50). He uses words like frenzy, leaped on me like a wild animal, and how his violent grew more and more. These made me visualize what was going on and how furious Idek was.Along with imagery, Wiesel used a lot of good examples of irony which made you think. What is going to happen next? Then when you thought something was going to happen something else happens. At the warehouse I often worked next to a young French girl.(Wiesel, 50). Later in the book Wiesel goes forward in time and mentions that they run into each other in a coffee store. This was unexpected and I was thinking something totally different to keep readers interested and full of thoughts.Like irony, Wiesel uses a lot of good metaphors. The Soup tastes of Corpse. (Wiesel, 62). Elie mentioned the soup because that was what mood he was in. Not because it really was soup made of corpse it was the mood he was in. When the kid was hung he was very sad. When Elie was eating the soup he was thinking about the people who were hung and was sad. Wiesel uses metaphors because it gives you a picture of what you are reading.In Conclusion After I read this book I realized how strongly detailed this book was in imagery, irony, and using metaphors. Have you ever thought about being taken out of your house and taken to a concentration camp? I think that the imagery is one of the most important because it makes you visualize what is going on. The other one is irony because you think about what's going to happen next and it is usually not what happens in the book Night. Idek through a fit and went on a frenzy and I got in his way. He leaped on me like a wild animal, hitting me in the chest, on the head, throwing me down and pulling me up again, his blows grew more and more. This shows how serious and how bad people were treated"},{"Title":"Night","review":"- Wendy Whelan Period 3 02-09-2005ONLINE BOOK REVIEW , i, ;:.:Elie's book centers around a 1. 5 year old boy who lived in a concentration campand survived the Holocaust. Back in the seventh grade, I built a model of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp and studied the Holocaust. I could relate to the thesis in Elie Wiesel's book titled the \\"Night\\", which was also a story relating to the Holocaust. His story was interestin-i and broadens my understanding of those ho:rrible events. 1. liked the setting, mood, and imagery .His first literary element concerning the separation of the Jews frQm the r~st of the German society was effective. I was familiar and interested in the Holocaust and how the Germans tr~ated the Jews frQm my past experiences in the seventh grade, This behavio.r impacted me, and gave me a true feeling on how the Jews must have felt. It amazes mewas no floor. A roof and fo,ur walls,\\" (Wiesel, pg, 35) This quote gave me a pictur~ and a mood on how the Jews lived in the concentration camps. They were treated as animals in a barn, with no, r~spect. freedom. nor comforts of home as they were use to, 1. like this quote because it show~ how mean and har~h the Germans were to the Jew~, and it makes me sad to think that they were so cruel to the Jews.A aecond literary element concerns the disposal of the Jews in crematories. Again this was very effective f{)r me as it shows how horrible the Germans were to the Jews. To quote Elie, \\"Poor devils, you're goin~ to the crematory,\\" (Wiesel pg,30) This quote really impacted me as it gave me a visual image of what it was like in a concentration camp such as Auschwitz, which 1 made a model of in the seventh grade. It gave a clear image of what the Jews must have heard and felt as they realized that they were going to the crematory and die, Again it shows us how horrible the Germans wer~ to the Jews and why we should never allow any other country to treat other people like this even today.A third literary element in the book that stuck me was how ashamed the surviving character felt that he had survived, but was starving. This was expressed in the quote, \\"FrQm the depths of the mirrw. a corpse gasped back at me,\\" (Wiesel pg, 1.09) 1. liked this quote because it expressed the mood and shame of the character while showing how the Germans. had s1arved the Jews, It gave a visual ima,ge of how the Germans s;tarved the Jews until they either died or became nothing more than skin and bones that looked like a waking skeleton.In conel.usion, Elie did a very good job of describing how horrible life was for a Jew in Nazi Germany. I liked the book because it was a very detailed account and educational on how Jews wer~ treated in the Holocaus;t, I believe the clincher is that this book shows why we should never allow another ruler or country to treat people this way."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read the book \\"Night\\" by Eli Wiesel. This is a story about a youmg boy who was effected by the Holocaust. He survived all the concentration camps and ultimetly wrote this book for all to read what he along with many others went through. I really enjoyed this book. I thought you could learn a lot from reading this book. Is a extremely sad story and once you start to read it, you wont be able to stop. If you want to know what people went through during the Holocaust, I suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night. Night is the diary of a young Jewish boy named Elie Wiesel. His recollections take place in his hometown; then the story carries on to the concentration camps of Europe. His frightening tales of the horrors he experiences with his family tell of the conditions and crushing manual labor he and his father perform from the time of their capture and the time of their liberation from the Germans. I find this book to be a horrific reminder of the past and inhumanities committed against other human beings. The only drawback I can find in this book is the first one to two chapters go relatively slow, then afterwards the book picks up to a fast pace. I recommend this book to anyone who likes stories of survival against all odds. All and all a very riveting tale by Elie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's account of his nightmarish 15th year of his life is a very powerful, moving story. The forward itself is enough to put provoking thoughts into one's head. Here in this novel, a young male adolescent's mind is put to the ultimate test; faith under fire from one of the greatest evils in American history. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. While it was not a walk in the park to read, it was enjoyable because it moved you. At one point in the book, one gets so caught up in the blunt wording that only a child could use; a child that has not gone through life's trials to know the proper balance of honesty and sensitivity. Sometimes, this book brings you to your knees as the burning truth comes forth; evil is very prevalent in the world, and more importantly, evil was rampant and real in this history of the world. This book is so unique in the fact that it gives glimpses, as noted in the foreward, to the mindsets of the people. The ignorance and the missed chances to live resonate completely throughout the book, giving off the sense to the reader, &quot;if only...&quot; As the book progresses, you get the shredded ray of light that promises hope. And it does end with good tidings, but this book is so awesome because it does not concern itself with physical hope but with mental, emotional, and spiritual hope. And at the end, there is none. The Holocaust has taken its toll too harshly on this young 15 year old boy. The damages have been done. This book is an excellent read because it reminds us of the evil and how if it is unchecked, it can not only rob the world of life, but of the single thing that is vulnerable, human freedom and happiness. Through the eyes of a 15 year old, &quot;Night&quot; is a gripping book that brings all these things to life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a great autobiography. It all starts in the small Jewish town of Sighet in Translyvania. Then moves to Auschwitz and then he gets moved to Buchenwald, both are concentration camps. This all takes place in World War Two. It starts with a very religious boy who begins to losing faith in his God once he sees the pain God is putting his people through. He talks about life talks about his life before the concentration camps, in the Ghetto, and waiting for deportation. He watched everyone he loved and cared for fade away. Wiesel writes with great description and imagery. He really captures the light of life in the gloomy devastating concentration camps. You grow so close to all the characters in the book and he really helps you under stand the lives and thoughts of everyone. The two main characters, Elie and his father, aren't too close in the beginning of the book but as time goes on they grow very close but yet quite distant because they no longer feel emotion for one another. I'm a freshman in High School and I loved this book. It's probably meant for teens and younger adults, but I think everyone should deal with this subject eventually. It really makes you think how lucky you are to not have to go through anything close to that. I'd have to say this is a must-read book for everyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night, by Elie Wiesel is an extremely interesting read. This nonfiction story about Elie Wiesel's childhood is a life-struggling journey through many parts of Germany from the 1930's to the 1940's. This book will draw in the reader on the first page. The descriptions of the concentration camps are uncanny. It's almost as if the reader was really there right next to Wiesel fighting for his life alongside him. The great thing about this book is that it is a short read that can be accomplished within the vicinity of a few days.Elie Wiesel has many people in his story who, for the most part, keep him alive. He meets a young musician his age, and his father who \\"saves his life\\" on numerous occasions. By this it means that he will not let his son give up on hoping for life. This is a heart warming, yet a tragic, story of Nazi Germany and a young boys struggle. I would easily consider this book for anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book over the summer for my freshman English Honors class. To say the least, it is one of the most horrifyingly objective and meaningful books ever written. I read it in a single evening, unable to put it down. It was like a car wreck-It was terrible, but I had to finish it. I couldn't stand not reading it.The spiritual, emotional, and physical changes that Elie goes through serve as a frightening allegory to the condition of the human race, as well as teaching a lesson about the tides of war. Simply perfect."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Fortunately &quot;Night&quot; is short, because one cannot help but complete in one sitting.&quot;Night&quot; briefly describes the German occupation of Hungary, deportation, and concentration camp experiences of the author. The description of the occupation is very insightful, describing how the Jewish community gradually lost more and more human rights and then was finally deported. The community refused to fathom that the Germans could be so cruel and that such persecution and genocide could happen in the 20th century, so they kept accepting each demotion, believing - hoping - the persecution could go no further. No doubt this pattern occurred time and time again in 1930s/40s Europe.The description of camp life was gut-wrenching, yet told in a very detached manner. I found the narrative less disturbing than other Holocaust literature (although just as poignant), probably due both to the author's writing style and condensed nature of the tale.I am anxious to complete Wiesel's &quot;Night Trilogy&quot; and read more of his writings."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read Night by Elie Wiesel and I thought that it was a very touching book. This was a powerful story that showed you what it was like in the life of Elie Wiesel when he was in the Nazi concentration camps as a teenager. It made me appreciate everything I have more. Lately I've been really interested in the history of the Holocaust.I read this book because we had read a little bit of it in my english class."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel was the great book of the real life stories of the holocaust. It showed the life of a boy who goes with little food and water each day and survives in a concentration camp,and how he had to watch his family and hundreds of people die each day. He is stuck with the memories of his family being killed and the lives of many innocent people who were killed. He show's how the Jews and other minorities were not treated like human's In these camps. He makes it feel like you're there with him and feel his pain. He also shows why this can never happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Some people say that Wiesel's NIGHT is fiction; others, that it is a factual memoir. Whichever side is right, what matters to me as a reader is that NIGHT is a profoundly moral work about surviving inhuman conditions, and that it is both powerful and superbly written.I am reminded of two other great concentration camp works -- Alexander Solzhenitsyn's ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF IVAN DENISOVICH and Victor Frankl's MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING -- which it resembles. Where Wiesel differs is in his ability to depict Eliezer's central dilemma: whether to survive at all costs, or risk his own survival by giving aid to his father, who is less able to stand up to the torments of everyday life in the camps. There is a beautiful image of the prisoners' forced move from Buna to Gleiwicz when another son leaves his father in the lurch while Eliezer does his utmost to help his. When his father dies of dysentery shortly before liberation, the book comes to an end quickly because outside the memory of that moral struggle, there was nothing but undiscriminated pain.Throughout this short book, the small acts of kindness come unexpectedly and stand out like so many diamonds in a vast mountain of pitch.Life is full of moral choices, and we don't always make the right decisions. Wiesel brings home the point that trying to make the right choice is always important. Perhaps that is what ultimately separates us from the SS and camp kapos."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this is the only book that has ever made me cry... i was reading it at school and i could hardly stay in control. it really amazes me that people think this book is poorly written. i guess they can't read between the lines and see powerful emotions behind the simplest statements... &quot;night&quot; actually allows the reader to *feel* the holocaust as elie weisel felt it. i recommend it to anyone, even people who are not really interested in this subject matter. i love this book :)"},{"Title":"Night","review":"There have been numerous people who have written so much about this remarkable book. I would like to comment on one event in the book. Mr. Weisel and his father had survived Auschwitz but they had to leave and march for miles and miles to another camp. The walk was extremely difficult. If you stopped walking, you might be executed immediately. Mr. Weisel's father was walking when he tripped over a person that had fallen. This person was concerned that his violin would be damaged. It was remarkable that this person could have the strength to carry his violin under such difficult circumstances. As a musician, I gained a new appreciation for the importance of music to certain individuals. Music was the strength that kept several people alive. I am grateful that Mr. Weisel shared this incident and the other events in this amazing book. This book should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was recommended to me by The Ohio State University's Buckeye Book Community. This book was amazing. I have read a lot of fiction books about the Holocaust, but this one was so amazing because it is true. It tells of a young boy's survival of Auschwitz and his struggle to stay with his father and keep him alive also. It is an amazing story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The story itself is brief, but that doesn't take away from its impact. The story, from nobel peace prize winner Elie Weisel's eyes, is of his poignant experience with the Holocaust. The book is incredibly touching--the sadness, pain, and courage his people had endured is amazing and should never be forgotten.My favorite scene from the book found a group of Jews being marched through bitter cold snow to their death. A fiddler, walking along, on the last night of his life, does fall asleep but simply plays his fiddle in the cold night air--plays out in his music his very soul, soaking the air with tremulous sadness and the futility of it all, but underlying hope for all those to hear.A great read, short, but powerful. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is so well written and it is one of the more beautiful novels ever published. I believe that it really deserves everyone of the five stars. However, I am somewhat upset when people give this book a poor review because it contains violence. Of course it contains violence. This book is about the Holocaust, and those were the things that occured. The book should not be critized for it wonderful portrayal of those terrible events. I agree that at times Night can be disturbing. But that is partially its purpose. To show us what occured. This book is a masterpiece and I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Recently I have taken the time to read the novel NIGHT, a short 110 page story recounting one mans survival tale of the Holocaust. The story takes the reader to the beginning of the deportation from the ghettos to the harsh reality of living in the concentration camps. The style which Wiesel is concise and to the point and allows one to read through the story with great ease. Towards the end of the story Wiesel begins to expedite his style, which from a historical standpoint, refelects the actions of the Nazis as the war wound down. I would freely recommend this novel to whomever the intellectual is who picks it up and wants to gain a more realistic view of the holocaust"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's book, Night, was excellent. To me, it was very moving and had a strong meaning to it. The horrific incidents that occured in this novel were worthwhile to learn. It not only showed the hardships the prisoners had to go through, but also the suffering and many deaths that occured. To me, the book sent out a strong message to the readers. Overall, this book has taught me much and had a strong impact on me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel was a brilliant tale about a mans experience during the Holocaust. The book gave great detail about everything he suffered and witnessed. At times the book moved slowly but it always regains your interest. If i could change the book in any way I don't think I would, because this is a true tale of a mans experience. And the fact that he lived through it is amazing, let alone wrote a book about his experience. Elie's purpose for publishing the book is to let everyone know what the Jews had to deal with and also to educate people on what really happened. The most memorable part of the book for me was when Elie was in the hospital for his swollen foot, and instead of staying in the hospital for fear for the SS murdering him he left with the camp only to find that the people in the infirmiry were soon after liberated by Americans. Night was at the borderline of four and five stars. I didn't give it five because I didn't like how it ended. The whole book is full of detail except it seems to end abruptly.

It gives an insiders views on what went on during this time in history with the jews. The only thing I didn't like about the book was that Elie didn't tell us what happend after the hollicost ended. I wouldn't change the book because Elie was really there and he knows what happened. Elie wrote this book to let people know the truth. The most memorable part in the book was when the jews were released."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the fact that this book displayed good illustrations of what the holocuast was really like. The book was kinda of strung out i thought it could have been completed in a shorter period of time. If i could change anything about the book i would maybe focus on the actions of hitler more and show how he was directly involved in the killings. Ellies purpose for writing this book was for people to realize how bad it really was to be a jew in put in that situation, it described some real life events to show how crazy the holocaust really was.The part were they were killed for marching outta step, i really thought that was a little drastic, but it showed how much you had to focus just to keep your life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Right now I am on a holocaust tirade. I have read several books about the holocaust in the last month or so. I get depressed as I read each one, so why do I continue reading? I'm not sure. Elie Weisel tells a compelling, though provoking story.As a high school English teacher I would recommend this for a middle school classroom."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This short work speaks for itself and leaves the reader speachless. This is perhaps the most eloquent and riveting account ever put to paper by a holocaust survivor. Even in translation, the prose is simple and cuts to the heart of the inhumanity and horror Wiesel experienced (though if you are able, look up a copy of this book in its original French: La Nuit). A must read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Reading this book gave me a perspective I previously hadn't had, and answered some questions I had about the Holocaust in general, such as how they managed to do something so horrible to such a large minority. I hadn't previously realized that the Jews had their rights stripped first then were slightly mistreated, leading up to their being badly mistreated and eventually to their murders and the genocide that is now known as the Holocaust. After reading this book I'll never look at the situation from such an uninformed point of view and can more accurately what really happened.Truly a masterfully crafted book relating a story, albeit with some fictional license, that appealed to both the emotional and intellectual. Emotional in that he told the story in such a way that it made the reader feel for the character, while telling the story in a well written easily readable format."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Unbearibly painful and certainly beyond criticism. (a. alvarez, commentary)Shame on these reviewers who gave anything less than 5 stars."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It was very interesting how he told his story about what he went through. Even though it was about the past, it kept my attention. Reading books about history through someone who lived through it made it more interesting. I would of rather read this book then sat through a history class and not know what these people went through emotionally. I would of gave this book four stars but the ending disapointed me. I felt like there should of been more. The ending of the book should of been the climax.

I liked this book because it is from a person who really had experience the pain of being a camp. There are things that I did not like; some personal reason of mine, when the SSR soliders took babys and used them as target practice. If I can change anything about the book I would add to the end what happen after I was free from the camps. I think Elie purpose for writing the book was to let people know what really happen in the camps and what really went on in some jews head at the time. ..."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a memoir, but the author was not a professional writer. That is why this could not receive five stars. The story was compelling enough, but I found it hard to get into it when the writing wasn't powerfull. It could have been better."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Where is god?\\" Nazi concentration camps stirred up much confusion amongst the Jews and the things that they once believed in. As illustrated by this quote from the book. This describes many hardships and the feeling that they felt and shared during their horrific times in the concentration camps.This book takes place during World War II in the Nazi concentration camps. And is about a young boy trying to survive as a jew in a german race that despises him in every way that they can. This boys name is Elie Wiesel, he is also the the author of the book, which I think gives the book and story more detail to the feelings and the thoughts of all the characters of the book. Elie shares personal experiences of pain, anger, and fear from his times in the Nazi Death Camps. Not only does he share his own experiences throughout the book, but also other characters that he meets throughout his fight for life and freedom.I found this very disturbing because I found myself putting myself in the story and imagining what it was like to have to do what he put up with for so long. The fact that anyone could bring theirselves to perform such acts on another human being just because of their race, is a horrific thing to think about. And the fact that all of this actually did happen and that he survived is amazing and inspiring. But when I said disturbing I was also talking about when Elie described the emotions of not only himself but of the others around him. It was hard for me to imagine that someone could forget everything that they once had like their family, their religon, or even their life. I would never want tom imagine myself even thinking like that. But throughout this millions of people died mentally long before their bodies ever did. It just made feel sad that all these people felt this way and nobody did anything about it.The oriny of the book to me would had to have been the firepit, where miilions of jewish people were buened after, and sometimes before they died. Many people took a quick glance at the flames spewing from the top of the large smoke stacks and gave up all hope in living because they believed that their fate was to thrown in the fiery pits of fury and hate that had already consumed so many lives before them. Another part of irony from the firepits, was the smell of burning flesh that the flames of death emitted. Elie himself noted that he was going to throw himself against the fatal electric fence bfore he would be burned alive in the the flames that had concumed so many before him.\\"Night\\" from Elie Wiesel is a good book for those intersted in the Nazi concentration camps. Or even if only a good story is the only thing that your looking for, Night is the right book for you. But there is ome very explicit and violent actions in this book, but like i said, Elie wrote everything from what he remembers, and that's how it was. So I recommend that this book be read by many in the near future. Thank You."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel is a very lucky man. Although he has lost a great deal fron his ordeal he is fortunate just to have survived and been able to tell his story and win the nobel prize. This book is a real eye opener about the horrors of the Holocaust. Elie must have excellent memory to describe his life so vividly. I wonder if winning the award truly revived his faith or the million dollar prize money."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night was reccommended to me by a friend who made it seem absolutely intriguing. I started into the book with the expectation that I'd be blown away, but at the end of the book I was slightly dissappointed.The book night is an account of the authors experiences during the Holocaust. I personally found the novel very shallow and not indepth. The characters were just touched upon briefly without enough background or knowledge of their true personalities or identities. For me a video shown in a History class would be the comparison to this book. It told the same tragic stories of Nazi Germany that are easily recognizable by many of us. If you're looking for a quick, easyread book that doesn't create much thought then this would be the book for you. But if you're like me and enjoy books with more of a plot then I reccommend you skip over this peice and move on to a more advanced novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is very realistic. It makes you think about what people went through just to find their place in society."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a book that everyone should read. It's a touching and sad story about a holocaust survivor. The details are so vivid, you could actually see the images of these events in your mind. Everyone should read it to be aware of the atrocities that man are capable of inflicting upon others and also to prevent another Holocaust. It is a novel that I won't ever forget..."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book taught me how much kids and adults were going through in the time of the Holocaust. People really didn't have any freedom, they didn't really get to bring any of their belongings with them. Many people had died during that time, especially if they didn't do as they were supposed to. You had to be a certain age or you would be killed, so they, meaning Elie and his father had to lie about their age. The Nazies were really explained in this book. The author explained them as true as they were in life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Novel Night by Elie Wiesel is a good book. It was interesting as well as confusing. When you read it you have to pay close attention or else you will have no idea what is going on. It is a terrifying story of a Jewish boy and his father as they move from death camp to death camp. As Elizer and his father learn real hardships they also learn to love more and to be dependant."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My review over Night is that it was a really good and serious book. Elie Wiesel really did a good job explaining all the difficulties that they had to go through when they were in the camps. I think he had to let out his pain and memories that he had when he was going through that trenchery in the holocaust. The book was really realastic, Because he really went into alot of detail when he was telling us what went on when the nazi tryed to strike fear into all the jews by hanging people and making them watch it. He explained all the facial features that the people had when they were being prepared to be hanged. The things that roam in his mind consists of running from place to place that sometimes can be more then 5 miles apart without stopping. The biggest memory he has is the separation from his family, that will forever be caught in his thoughts for the rest of his life. In conclusion what happen to the jews was truely a display of how bad the hate for the jews by the nazi was, so if you are intrested in the history of the camps this is best book you could find on explaining what went on."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel is a well written book that makes you want to keep reading. His life story is not the only thing that makes it a great read. It is also the message that he sends out to all the readers. His message is very clear, he wants to show everyone how bad the camps were and the suffering he had to go through. I think that the message in this story is well incorporated in the writing of this book.Elie has strengths and weaknesses in his writing though. His strong point is showing his emotion in the story. He shows his emotion on the topic through the novel. Another strong point is that he stays on topic through out the novel and does not skip around. One of his weaknesses is he doesn't grab the readers attention in the beginning of the novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a very good book that shows you how horrible the holocaust was. The book takes place during1941, at the beginning of World War II. I myself am not really that into reading but this book keeps you going and it makes you want to read on. Night will make you feel as if you know the characters and you really start to care about what happens to them. I would want to read on when Eli's father is up for selection, I would read just to see if he made it or not. The book starts off with a boy and his family, who live in a Jewish community. The Germans then move them to a \\"ghetto\\", which had awful living conditions and you could not leave without having a pass. Then the Germans then moved all the Jews from the ghetto to one of the most deadly concentration camps. The ride to the concentration camp was miserable. Train wagons were crowed until no more people could fit. People could not sit down it was so crowed. When all the Jews come to the camp Eli is separated from his sisters and mother, Eli and his father now have to do everything they can to survive in a place that must have been the closes thing to hell on earth. They go through everything from just missing the selections for the crematories to if they stop running they will be killed. The book fallows the two until the very end of their struggle in the concentration camp."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book about 10 to 12 years ago, I was on a flight from Florida to California, I had seen Elie on TV, maybe even Oprah and bought the book. I was sobbing on the plane, I could not speak when my husband asked me what was wrong. I am an avid reader, no book has ever touched me the way this one did. I loaned it out, never got it back so I'm buying it to read again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's book is a matter of fact accounting without literal embellishments of what non-Jewish Germans did to Jews during WWII based on his personal experiences. The book is written in the style of the Gospel of Mark - fast paced, always moving forward, lots of action and little in the way of descriptive embellishments from the author to help the reader gain a broader perspective. The author writes as if he's not looking back with any historical perspective, instead it reads as a narrative with the immediacy of being written soon after he was liberated rather than 15 years later.This book should be required reading for all 15 year olds in our public school system. It provides an example of how fascism differs from American ideals of equal protection and that each of us reserved their individual rigths from the power of government. It is also an excellent essay on suffering. While its tough to teach the Book of Job in public schools, the definitive essay on suffering, this book accomplishes the same task by asking the same fundamental questions the author of Job does. Night provides students with a non-abstract example of one of the very large benefits of freedom paid with by the blood of their ancestors by telling the story of another 15 year old with a vastly different set of life experiences that was caused by a German culture that rewarded bigotry of \\"the Other\\".Night will break your heart. That humans are capable of such atrocities is known abstractly and universally, this is an example of a book that moves one beyond the merely knowing and into the realm of feeling it in a small way, though certainly not to the level of those victimized by the holocaust.My only disappointment with this book is that Wiesel does not provide more detail on the forced march when the Germans were fleeing the Soviets with their prisoners, including Wiesel and his father, in tow. 42 miles of running and hiking in the snow with a recently operated and shoe-less foot, and that was just the first night. A few more facts to help us better understand the three day journey to Buchenwald would have been appreciated even if it violated the framework of maintaining a narrowly focused immediacy prevalent in the rest of the book.However, if you are looking for a first person accounting what it's like to be the victim of hatred and religious bigotry with government leading the charge, this book wil make most readers' short list."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NightAuthor Elie WieselHave you ever been tortured to the point when you just want to give up and die? Well, Elie and his father have been through this experience. Elie is a young fifteen year old teenager who would battle for his right in any situation. He also lives with his father. He was born in a little town called Sighet in Transylvania and lived a modern life until the Nazis came to Elie's home town and started to gather up the jews. They were put into trains that were so crammed that you couldn't even sit down. No one had a clue where they were going. They then arrived at a concentration camp called Auschwitz. The sight of seeing children being thrown into the crematories made Elie think...is my life going to end here? Elie and his father were treated like rats and lived off of every scrap of food possible. All of a sudden Elie and his father had to change camps and head out to another concentration camp called Buchenwald. They had no transportation. The officers forced them to run nonstop to get there. Elie's father tried to give up and die in his sleep, but Elie kept trying to pursued his father to keep running until they could reach the camp. People were being trampled and many were freezing to death from the cold. No one cared, no one bothered to give any food, and the only thing Elie could think about was is there a way to survive? Or is this the end? Find out yourself and read the heart stopping thriller called Night (You won't believe what you will read!).Night is my most favorite book of all time, even though it is the most disturbing book that I have ever read. If you are not into the type of books that have love stories, drama, and happy endings I suggest you read this book. If you did not like The Diary of Anne Frank it would be better to read this book because it really explains how cruel the Nazis were to the poor Jews. The author really soaks you into the story by explaining every detail that happens to Elie. Once you start to read you won't put the book down. I've tried to put the book down, but it feels like an arm is grabbing you from the book to read more. This is a book that everyone should read because what happened in it changed the whole world.Tristan Vranizan"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" is an incredible look into his life. A strong portrayal of courage and suffering at the same time, \\"Night\\" focuses on Mr. Wiesel's life during the Holocaust. Both enlightening and disturbing, Elie Wiesel brings the reader to Europe and shows there is evil out there."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a book focused on the holocaust that took place in the 1940's and 1950's. It is written from one of the survivors, Elie Wiesel. Night is narrated by Eliezer, a Jewish adolescent who lives in his hometown of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Elie explains his treacherous past with his experiences with the Nazis. His horrifying story has certainly made a positive impact on different readers as well as myself.I like how Elie explained how the other Nazis tortured the other Jews. It gave the reader a sense of what was going on, and let the reader use their imagination. Elie's viewpoint is restricted to his own experience, and the tone of Night is therefore extremely personal, subjective, and cherished. Night is not meant to be an all-encompassing discussion on the experience of the Holocaust instead; it depicts the very personal and painful experiences of this single victim. Elie tries to keep his father with him throughout the story but also had to face the struggle to maintain faith in a compassionate God.The whole book was depressing, especially at the end when Elie's father past away. It was a relief to hear when the U.S army came. It gave hope to hear that after all the killings, the U.S army finally liberated the Auschwitz concentration camp. The Jews had a chance to revenge their friends and family. By writing this book, Elie Weasel has exposed the evil that the Nazis have given to the Jews and has given me a whole different perspective on the Nazis."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was absolutely...heartwrenching. There's really no other word for it. I sit here typing trying to think of more words to do it the proper justice, but there simply are none.I read this in English while reading (very closely) Maus I in cartooning. The combination of the two left me with a much deeper amazement at just what the jews of that time went through. It is hard to think about.While this book is a short read, it is an intense read. It took me several weeks simply because I couldn't take it all in at once."},{"Title":"Night","review":"i understand \\"NIGHT\\" and realize that this book is not only good, but the book is definitly an amazing find. it was very graphic, and honestly, i almost got sick reading it, because of the intensity of it all. it's difficult to comprehend the truth of it all because it seems so distant. i just can't believe it all happened."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was one of the best and unique books I have read about the holocaust. It gave the psychological aspects more than just the physical ones which lets the reader understand more of what the people are feeling emotionally. The plot continues to keep you hooked on what's going to happen next through the killings, selections, and departers. From the first page, there was anticipation on what was going to happen to the main character, Ellie, and his family. I would really recommend Night to anyone who is interested in reading about the Holocaust. I can almost guarantee that you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this is a disturbing work in that it recounts a man's experience of the nazi death camps.

Never.\\"I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable. If you somehow missed this in high school, pick it up, if you didn't, find it again. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I cried through the book at people's cruelty and hardness of heart but saw glimpses of hope throughout. It's so important to never forget...a recommended read for all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"How exactly does one review this book? Like some other reviewers, my \\"5 stars\\" may be motivated as much by my respect for the author as for my opinion of the book itself. As a book, it's not the best. But this isn't a book. It's a reality as existed in the mind and eyes and body of a 15-year old. There are criticisms of this book that it lacks detail about the camps, etc. That's true. But we are probably getting everything that 15-year-old Wiesel had to share. He wasn't consumed with the historical details of his nightmare: the important elements of his daily life were the suffering, the loss, the murder, the destruction, and the survival. And that's all we get from this book.The tone of the book is disturbing in itself. It's like listening the words of someone who just took a big blow to the head. Even the narrative covering the time before the detentions has the same dull tone. One fears that this author is damaged beyond repair. Why not?Despite it's shortcomings, this is a vitally important and \\"good\\" book, and is a must-read. As a history of the Holocaust or even World War II, it's useful but not a substitute for other books. But it is important to know its message, and to know that the story can be repeated again. Read this book, and then pay closer attention to the developments in Iran, Sudan, China, North Korea . . . .I cannot miss the portion of this book concerning Wiesel loss of faith. It's an enormously sad element of the whole story and it must be confronted. For readers who are interested in this particular subject, I'd also recommend Corrie Ten Boom's The Hiding Place for a different perspective on the matter of faith in the concentration camps."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this very short book in one afternoon in about two hours. It is only its brevity that prevents me from awarding the fifth star. Everyone knows about the Holocaust and everyone has seen the numerous films dealing with this great human tragedy. I have been to Dachau and the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. and was appropriately horrified on both occasions.However, there was something about this book that struck a nerve. Perhaps it is the fact that I have a sixteen year old son. I was midway through the book before it suddenly occurred to me that Weisel was roughly the same age as my son when he underwent the unspeakable horrors covered in the book. The details concerning his seperation from his mother and sister. The numerous times where he was called upon to protect and save his father (who was only slightly older than me). Imagining my son in a similar circumstance broke my heart and I cried.You may know everything there is to know about the Holocaust, but until you see it through the eyes of a child, you can't appreciate the whole story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was a powerful testament to a dark period of human history.

The fact that Elie started wanting to get rid of his father, also got me a little mad. I can understand his reasoning but I could never do that to my father. All in all, it was a very good book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought the book was very sad and valgour. It had its moments when you couldn't put it down. It was extremly realistic to the point of death. The most interesting part of &quot;Night&quot; is the ending because it all comes together and makes more sense. For any one interested in non-fiction thirllers, &quot;Night&quot; is definatly the book to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I liked the book, I thought that it showed very strong purpose. I thought that the book was good. At the beginning of the book it was hard to get into it,but when I started reading for a few 10 pages or so, I got into the book and it became easier to follow, and bloomed into a good book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought this book was very captivating and mesmorizing. The book displayed all of the harsh and upsetting moments of the authors life. I think that this book was difficult to continue reading, due to the fact that the detail was very complete. Although it was different it was deffinitley a page turner and the the book made me feel like I was there and I was living the experience."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a fast moving , well writing and well understood book. It has strong word that have strong meanings! Everyone must read this book!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is one of the best books that I've ever read. Night was assigned in my high school english class to learn more about WWII. No one can say that they know a lot about the Holocaust until you read this book. It describes the terror and pain caused by the Germans during WWII. It not only informs about death camps but it's like reliving history(with this book is not exactly a good thing), including intense descriptions to help you visualize the events. Most events occuring described in the book aren't the funnest and prettiest visualiztions, but if you seriously wan to research the Holocaust, definetly read this book. But make sure your mature enough and have a strong stomach. Because you can't just skip over the truth.It's also sends the message to not repeat history. Anyone who has ever teased anyone for being different, has to read this book to see the other end of the story and to hear a true point of view, instead of reading out of a history book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel has managed to put his horrifying experience into a powerful, moving and brutally realistic book. Everyone, especially those with only a vague idea of the sickening cruelty of the Shoah, should read this."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This outstanding book graphically describes the events of the Holocaust from the eyes of one who survived it... The images Wiesel used to describe the cruelty of the concentration camps, and the way it effected his mind and soul, reached me in a way no classroom lesson or historical program could before."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is an excellent, and true, first-hand account of the horrors of Nazi concentration camps. It affected me and was greatly disturbing, as most accounts of this subject are. The strength and the ability to persevere and overcome the most extreme of human suffering is inspiring, yet should be unnecessary. This book is a graphic account of WWII atrocities. The memories and images from it will always stay with me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is the true story of Elie Wisel. A young boy who managed to survive the concentration camps. This book tells what he had to go through. It is a great book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"But this book is incredible. Really. Sometimes it seems to me that the world is literally filled with Holocaust Literature. While I think that making absolutely sure that we don't forget is an admirable goal, I also wonder whether the sheer bulk of the available literature doesn't wear out the topic. Is it possible that, after hearing so many stories about one single incident, we might become desensitized to the horror and lose our sense of shock? For this reason, I'd prefer it if there was _less_ Holocaust literature, but of higher quality. If you're a genius, fine; write about the Holocaust. If your book is anything short of sheer brilliance, don't. The topic is so important that it should never lose its shock-power, or its newness.My sermon completed, and my evil nature thus displayed, I want to say that Night is simply one of the greatest, if not THE greatest works on the Holocaust. Ever. If Fahrenheit 451-esque censorship was enacted, and we could only keep one book that was in any way relevant to the Holocaust, it should absolutely be this one. Without hesitation.Read this book. I mean it. I don't care how desensitized you are to death, to violence, to despair, to ... anything. This book will hurt you."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The story I read is called &quot;Night.&quot; It is the story of a Jewish boy and his father surviving in the cosentration camps of Germany during the Second World War. This is an eye-opening story of the true horrors of the Holocaust and what the Jewish society went through just to survive. Meet our hero, a young Jewish boy who, when he entered the camps, was bent on staying with his father all the way through, but as time wears on we notice a change in him and in many of the younger ones. They become hard and more angry at the world, and prove that even under the most harsh conditions the human spirit can survive, even if it does become covered in a hard shell that is nearly impossible to brake through, still somewhere in there is the true person who lived before the hardening. The Jewish people went through hardships we can only imagine and dream about in our worst nightmares. Life is full of harsh times but the worst is when mankind would slaughter his own because they are different from them. Life is cruel but so are people, maybe more so then life itself is. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves history, tales of survival, or just loves a real tear-jerker."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is great. Although sad, it holds your interest all the way to the end. I didn't know if I'd like it when it was assigned for a class, but I wound up reading it in one sitting.This is a book that everyone should read. I reccomend it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is very good. I found it quiet moving at a lot of times. The only thing I didn't like is that during the book he would mention things that he did after the war and it kind of made the book less thrilling. But other than that I thought it was a great book. Another great book is &quot;I am David&quot; if you like &quot;Night&quot; then you'll like &quot;I am David&quot;."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read many holocoast books, but Night definately stood out above all the rest. It is touching and thought-provoking. It asks one to question a G-d who would let such a tragedy occur. It also explores the father son relationship in depth."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The most disturbing book I've ever read but possibly one of the most important. Wiesel has given the world the gift of his own experiences, as hard as that must have been to do. There is a horrific scene of a young man pouncing on and in animal fashion killing his own father for a small scrap of bread. Scenes like that, told in the simple yet descriptive language of &quot;Night,&quot; only serve to make us realize that it is only with that type of horror should we remember the Holocaust, because only then can we prevent it from happening again. Hard to digest but so worth reading."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night goes over the same aspects of the Holocost we all have come to know after years of being retaught the information throughout grammar and high school. Perhaps it was the origonator of these cliches but I see it as being a little to &quot;standard&quot; and not very full of new information. One new thing that it does bring up and carries throughout, is the subject of god and what changes the Jews' faith goes through as they are exposed to the horrors of the holocost. I think this adds alot to a book full of gruesome discriptions and shocking first hand accounts, that only do that; shock you. Night is writen to appeal to you on an emotional level and gives a superficial overview of the holocost, while leaving much of the hum-drum and polotics of the holocost behind. Weisel's situation in the holocost was typical thus, if you can call it that, so was his story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I'm a senior in high school and have just finished reading Night for our Historical Literature class. This has been the second time that I have read this book however, I feel that reading this book for a second time proved much more valuable. The first time that I read this was in 8th grade. It was the second time through that I was able to realize the capacity of evil and the destruction of lives that occurred during this tragic time in society. The Holocaust was an event in the world that caused great despair but the book allowed me, through Elie's thoughts, to step into his shoes and feel the roller coaster ride of emotions that were experienced. Night was a great book and I would reccommend it to anyone who would like a real life account of what it felt like to be living in a time of extreme hatred."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book will almost draw you into the apocalypse. Elie Wiesel amazes me with his ability to remember the tragedies that occured in his life with such fine details. My name is Francisco Lopez and I'm a high school student. I've never really been into reading too much, so I'm not really the best critic there is, but this book had me to the point were I couldn't put it down. Definatley a book that you learn from, and it's also entertaining in a way to learn how things really went on in the concentration camps first hand from some one who was there and experienced the hardships of the German injustice. Really worth reading!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel's Night is a strong real life story from the Holocaust. It is a good read for an older audience.The book is very sad and touching. Since it is easy read it can be understood by all. The death and destruction of the Holocaust can be seen from this book the reader will gain an understanding of the time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a very moving novel explaining what the victims of the Holocaust had to endure, written in autobiographical form. This book lets you feel the pains that Elie and others in his situation had to suffer. From the seperation of his family to the physical hardships in his time while at the concentration camps. Keep the tissue box handy, because if books sometimes make you cry, this one DEFINATELY will, from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As I read this book, I could feel Elie's feelings because of the depth of detail, Elie Wiesel went into. I thought this book had a lot ofsymbolism of what he thought of his god and his father and family. Overall I found Night Exilerating!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I don't usually take interest in biographies and stuff like that. But while ready Night I found my self getting into the book more and more. I would recomend this book to anyone espicialy those who like histore"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am a sophmore in high school and in English we have just read Night by Elie Weisel. Night is unexplainable, it reaches down into your heart and grips it. This book is everything you didn't want to know about WWII and what the Jewish went through at the Nazi Death Camps, but once you're done, you feel so unexplainably grief struck that actual people went through this and enlightened that you know that it should never happen again....And you have no regrets that you read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"A spartan, gripping account of Wiesel's personal horrifying experiences as a jewish teenage boy taken with his family by the Nazi's and suffering through the work camps. His only mantra becomes \\" Stay with my father\\".As a mother with two small children at home, I read this book in a day ( I am not sure what my kids were doing whilst I was so engrossed.) but this is simply an unforgettable, haunting book.I have given away my own personal copy of this book and rebought another...several times.If you are interested in personal accounts of the holocaust or tales of extraordinary survival against the odds, I cannot recommend NIGHT enough."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book, takes you oin an incredible journey through the life of one boy's life during the Halocaust. The boy, Elie explains his time in the concentration camps, set up during WWII, by Nazi Germany.This book gives very good and accurate detail about the life and the certain things that happened that is historically accurate.This book was a sad and very horrifying true story, which makes me really enjoy it. Since it really happened it makes you think about your own problems and when compared, nothing could possibly be worse. The problem with this book was that is was extremely short, I felt that it cokuld have benn longer, but since it is a true story maybe that is all that Elie could write about. I would make it longer if I could change anything about the book.Elie wrote this book to share his horrific events in his life that were absolutely grotest, he wanted the younger generation to be aware of what went on, so that it never ever happens again.The part that I remember most about this book was when his father died and he had no more tears left to cry for his own father. That is when you know this life was absolute hell."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found this book to be well written, but it lacked intensity in some places. I believe it could have been a little bit more dramatic in some areas, like the death of his father for example. I recommend picking up the book if you're interested in different accounts of the Holocaust. This one is the most unique I have seen. But overall, it was very intriguing. I found myself finishing it in a day. It's hard to believe that the author could fit five years of hell into so few pages. But I think he succeeds quite well."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a book about survival; the strength of the human spirit; the depths of evil inherent in mankind; redemption; life. \\"Night\\" should be required reading in every school along with \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\". It's a beautifully written, haunting tale that renews your faith in life and the questions. Life is not about the anwers, after all...it's about the questions. I also highly recommend Mr. Wiesel's memoirs, \\"All Rivers Run to the Sea\\" and \\"The Sea is Never Full\\". A master survivor, writer and storyteller."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In a list of my six favorite books for \\"The Week\\" magazine, I wrote: \\"I was about the age of the teenage narrator when I first read Night. He witnessed the ravages of the Holocaust that claimed his family and left him to grapple with guilt and spiritual doubt. I still marvel over the beauty of the storytelling.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"Has anyone ever wondered what the holocast was about? Well the book Night will help anyone understand what it was like to live throught the Holocaust. I liked this book because of the irony, figurative language, and the foreshadowing.The irony, to me was very effective because, when i thought something was going to happen, it usally never did. An example of the irony is: \\"then i remebered sonethind else: his son had seen him losing ground, limping, staggering back to the rear of the column. He had seen him. And he had continued to run in front, letting the distance between the grow gretter.\\" (Weisel, 87) In this quote, one of Elie's friends had ran withhim and he had died. But he did not realize that he had left his father because he was a burden to his son.The figurative Language was very effective. Weisel creassted pictures in my mind asd i read. \\"They brought him a box. Lie down on it. On your Stomach! I obeyed. Then i was aware of nothig but the strokes of the whip.\\" (Weisel, 55.) Elie got in trouble because he ahd saw one of the Kapoes having sexual interations, with on of the girls at the camp. In that quote it created a picture in of Elie getting whiped.\\"Fire! I can see Fire! I can see a fire! there was a moments panic. Who was it who cried ou? It was Madame Schachter.\\" (Weisel, 22) This is an example of foreshodowing. Madame Schachter saw fire, but there was nothing there. Then when they got to the camps there was the fire from the creamatory. This si effective becasue it tells what hppens later in the book.In Elis Weisel's book night i like the irony, Figurativer Language and the Foreshadowing. I like the book because it is a real life story of how one personmad it throught the Holocaust. During the Holocaust over 6.6 million people died. That is 7,ooo times the amount of people i have in my town. I fourteen and i could not imagin going throught what he went through. I recomend this book to anyone that is interested in experiencing what Eile Weisel went through in the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think Night is a very good book about the Holocaust. It shows what the Jewish went through like being separate from your family and being sent to concreation camps. The part I got really into the book was when the SS order the Jews to march on the frozen snow. I could actually see what was happening, walking on dead frozen bodies. they were starving to death and also freezing. that was sad and horrible to that to happen to anyone. this book gave more of a understanding of the Holocaust and the Death Marches."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Before I read this book, I knew little about the Holocaust. While I read Night, I started to realize how bad it must have been to be one of the jews in the concentration camps. Being starved and worked to death in the fields, then the crematories, unbelieveable. But it wasn't until the night that the SS made all of the jews run in the freezing snow that I started to feel their pain. In Night, Elie Weisel described how he and his father struggled to survive the whole time, when at the end they came so close to collapsing. They helped each other subsist by sharing their only ration of bread each day with one another. When I got to the end, I was so relieved, yet angered with what had happened during this terrible time."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Holocaust was a time of our past, where Germany reigned and wielded their power to eliminate an entire ethnicity. Elie Wiesel survived through this reign of terror and through his book preaches that the Holocaust was an event in history that should be preventively studied. Wiesel supports this point through the autobiographical telling of the unconditional mistreating, suffering, and mass murders of ethnicities. Through a personal telling of the Holocaust Wiesel makes a better connection between the reader and reality. Overall, his unique approach adds to the fact that genocide should be prevented at all costs.While studying genocide and its effects one must evaluate a situation fairly. The authors' argument is solid except for the fact that his story does not consider the German point of view. However, he does support his premise through the sharing of his personal experiences that tell about the death of his family and the mistreating of others as he hung on to God for hope of survival. These inductively strong reasons support his premise clearly and precisely while at the same time he commits no fallacies.In conclusion, this book is informative and provides much knowledge to the real experiences of the Holocaust. Although the Holocaust was an event of the past that should be learned from, there are some people who believe that it necessarily wasn't a bad thing or that it ever happened. These are the people that modern day society should worry about for the questions of who, what, where, when and why, can never be answered when dealing with genocide."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I believe that this book was truly a great book. You can really feel and see the pictures of everything the author described in his book, it gave me chills..."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book touches a deep part of your soul that most others will never. This provokes a chilling sorrow. This book although I had to put it down multiple times to escape from the horrors of the book. This book is a must read to anyone and everyone. The Holocaust was real and this book tells the truth of it. You may se a note on it in your history text, but after reading this every &quot;Note&quot; you see on it will wrench your soul. This book is possibly one of the most powrful ever created. The horrors and the dark side of humanity are clearly shown and when you see it you will never look at history the same again. Overal this book is one you have to read. Becoming informed about these horrors is the best way to assure they never happen again. So once again go out right now and beg, borrow, steal and/or buy This book and read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read this book for my honors english class. The scenes that it described and foretold were horrifying and sickening. It made me disgusted and sympathetic at the same time. I think it was, despite the gruesome content, a great literary work. Before anyone makes a judgement of someone for no reason, they should read this book. The horrors of the Nazi regime are unbelievable."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a reality book. Its very and impacting. It showed me as a fifteen-year-old girl that not everyones life is a walk in the park. People suffer and experience things that are immoral and damaging.Night showed me a new prespective to the Holocaust.Night was easy to comprehend and exciting. You always want to know where they will be sent next and how they will be treated.Most of the time I dont get into books and I dont like to read. I read Night in two days after school and it was very appealing to me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am a high school student in the 10th grade. I don't particularly like to read, but I was assigned the book, and with my average, I had no choice but to read it. At the very beginning, the reading was slow and dull, but as the book went on, it really grabbed my attention. The mental pictures that the author painted were hard to accept as events that some humans actually lived through such torturous times. Anyone who doesn't believe that The Holocaust actually happened, needs to read this book because there is no way that someone could just make all this stuff up. I thourgholy enjoyed this book, and I think that it should be added to the required reading curriculum of most, if not all, schools."},{"Title":"Night","review":"THis was an editorial review about the book Night, by Elie Wiesel. It is about his own experience in Birkenau, Auschwitz that it's generally and not inaccurately read as an autobiography. The protagonist in the story is a piou teenager racked with guilt at having survived the genocidal that consumed his family. It said that there were no easy answers in this harrowing book. It marks the crucial first steps in Wiesel's lifelong project to bear witness for those who died."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have just got done reading \\"Night\\" by Elie Wiesel. It was a very good book. I enjoyed this book so much I couldn't put it down. The book gives people a real description of how the Holocaust was, and how the Germans treated the Jews. It is a sad book. The Germans did so many mean things to the Jews. I felt that Elie Weisel did a great job on telling this story and what it was like when the Germans took over; put the Jews on trains, and at the concentration camps. If I was in his position, I don't know if I could let all those people know what happened to him. I would try and forget about it even though you couldn't forget about something like that. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel was very interesting, sad and kept me reading it non-stop. Some points in this book were very inhumane yet depressing at the same time. Elie had gotten emotionally scarred many times and was harassed too by Nazi guards when he was a prisoner at Auschwitz. This book was very engrossing to me, because it identifies with something distressing that has happened in my religion. I advise you to buy this book for a good read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found this book to be absolutly amazing! The use of detail made you put yourself in Elie's shoes!

It gave you a personal outlook at the Holocaust from someone who was actually effected by it. I liked this book because of its realism. It gave you a history lesson without sugar coating it. I encourage anyone who wants to learn more about to holocaust to read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesle's novel, Night, reflects the author's true account of his life during the Holocaust. Throughout this novel you will follow his life through the concentration camps and life in the ghetto. All in all you will discover what Jews went through during this time of death and despair. I find information about this time period very interesting but the book, in my opinion, was rather boring. I understand that this is a person's true life account of his life, however, the book could have been a little shorter than what it actually was."},{"Title":"Night","review":"the book NIGHT by Elie Wiesel portrays a young Jewish boy's journey through the Holocaust. From when he gots taken away, to when the book ends, I couldn't put it down (and i'm not the most avid of readers). The fact that his and his father's life was in Elie's hands kept you in suspense from beginning to end. A simple crumb of bread or a drop of water, can determine life or death. After reading this book, i noticed many things i would have taken for granted otherwise. I started to be grateful that i'm alive, and how fragile life really is. NIGHT taught me one of life's most valuable lessons. NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is truly a masterpiece, as it brings you along on his journey through the Holocaust, with death looking upon him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was an assignment for english and for it being about histoy it was interesting. I thought the book was a reality check to what we are so lucky to not have to incounter. Elie's hardships were depressing but he had courage to survive. This book is one to tell friends who like history about. Night is a depressing , truthfull and opens my eyes just alittle more to what could happen."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book \\"Night\\" I thought was very good. It gives you a picture of what the jews had to go through during the Holocaust, and how terrible it was for them. The concentration camps, the men seperated from their families, not knowing if they would ever see them again. the book really gives you a good view of what it was like to be there."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In the book Night I learned during that time that Jews had a bad life. In some of the parts I felt really bad for them. Like when some of the people got split up from their families. I could never do that. I would just choose to be killed. In the book people were treated worse than livestock. You could see teir ribs popping out and you could almost see every bone in their bodies. I could never live like that. One piece of bread for twelve people. And the Germans liked to watch it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night is a great book. It has a lot of meaning and the emotion in it will bring tears to your eyes.It's about wwII during the Holocust. It makes you ask questions like how could people be so cruel. Many people in this book die from exhaustion. Most people have no choice but to eat snow for water. This book makes anyones emotions really set stgate.They segragated the Jews all because of there religion. They had to work in camps and be separated from their family's . I know that would have been way to hard for me I wouldn't even be able to imagine the horror and dispare these people went through . This book is one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night By Elie Wiesel is about Jews in concentration camps. Elie was one of these Jews. He had to deal with many hardships from the start to the end of the Holocaust. Elie had to help his dad survive. He also had to try and help himself stay alive. They had so little food. When they did get food they only had a small piece of bread. Many people fought to get more. Most of the Jews that were in the concentration camp died before they got freedom. Elie was one of the few to survive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiesel was an ok book. In this book there's a 15 year old boy named Elizer. Him and his family got taken from their home and had to go live in the ghettos."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book shows how life was hard for the jews and how the holocaust was hard too. Im glad that life is not like today.Im glad that i live in the united states, and not the forneigen countries. This book shows why you are glad your alive, and that we have food, they had to fight for there food."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Numerous times I have been assigned the novel, Night, and each time I take something different out of my readings. As a junior school student I read Night as almost a history book. Now, being a young adult, it is clear to me that the novel is a memoir about a painful time in history. Although selections of the text were graphic to say the least, they were eye opening and interesting. The novel was well-written full of detailed descriptions, which is an important quality for a writer to have, so one can get a visual feel for the scene.It's safe to say that it was difficult for Elie Wiesel to write this novel. Many tales were told about numerous horrific accounts, in which he took part in firsthand. While one may feel the novel is depressing to read, they should understand it was depressing to write also. I cannot be quick to judge the writing skills of Wiesel, when he said himself he was not planning on becoming a writer, and the novel was originally written in French. Wiesel is certainly no Shakespeare, yet he does an incredible job of captivating the reader through his words. If you're looking for a novel that will not only inform you on the Holocaust, but give you firsthand experiences, Night is the book for you. I strongly recommend that you do not read the novel if you are looking for an uplifting book to read on vacation, but this should be expected considering the circumstances of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a very touching book. A book which I believe everyone should read once in their lifetime. The contents of this book are complete. One would not want to change the memories of a holocaust survivor, but the ways in which it is expressed do have some flaws. The biggest blemish of Night is the gaping holes in time. The shifts from one time period to the next are abrupt and left me feeling startled. While this may have been his intent in the first place it left me wondering if anything interesting had been left out. Why leave holes like this in your work? You wait ten years and you limit yourself in this way? This cannot be that large of a demerit to the book because it does add tot eh experience of reading Night. One should not feel totally comfortable reading such matter.This book really shines in its descriptions. While the book is not three hundred pages long it does do an excellent job of capturing the reader. You can almost feel as if you are there all along with Elie. It's extremely disturbing when he writes about the hangings and killing, because once again you feel like you are right there with him. But what do you expect with a book of this nature? I feel that this book has enlightened me so much more than any history book will ever be able to do. If you want to really get a feel for what hell the Jews had to go through this is the book to read. Let the travesty of the holocaust never happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I believe that the novel Night is a great read because it gives insight into the life of an prisoner in a concentration camp. Elie is a boy who is struggling in a concentration camp who has lost everything except his father Elie and his father make it all the way through the concentration camp until they arrive at the final concentration camp. There, in Buchenwald, Elie's father dies slowly from sickness. Upon his father's death Elie is extremely shocked. Nothing else can faze him after his father's death. Long after being liberated from the camp that caused him so much pain, Elie writes this novel, It is a fairly easy to get through, and keeps you interested throughout. The reader is hit in the heart when they read what Elie's life has been like."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night, by Elie Wiesel, explores the idea of a young man experiencing the horrific and traumatic events of the Holocaust, in which thousands of innocent people lost their lives because of their religion. This book describes the terrible actions the Nazi party took in their attempt to create a master race by exterminating the Jewish people. Elie Wiesel's description of life in various concentration camps helps the reader to understand the reality of the terrible persecution Jews went through in WWII.In the concentration camps, the German soldiers used brutal methods of getting what they wanted from the prisoners. Sometimes they would beat the prisoners, either because the prisoners did something wrong or just because they felt like it, and other times they would shoot the prisoners to make an example out of them. This would prove to the prisoners that the soldiers were serious and it would intimidate them so they would follow the rules. Even the Kapos, prisoners who led the blocks/barracks of prisoners, were awfully cruel to the other prisoners.While in the camps Elie is faced with many challenges. He first separates from his mother and sister. He later faces several selections knowing that each could be his last. Soon after, he witnesses the death of his father, and although there was nothing he could have done to stop them, he blames the soldiers. This book tells of the frightening and true account of a young man who has, what it seems like is, the entire world against him."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a short, austerely written autobiographical work by a Holocaust survivor. I was quite moved by it, and feel it would be akin to blasphemy to critcize this work negatively. The writing is well executed, but plainly spoken and offers several near shocks to the reader. Being autobiographical, it has credibility as \\"source material\\" for Holocaust information. In fact, I noticed several concentration camp descriptive passages or terminologies that strongly remind me of what I have read in works of historical fiction. In considering one reviewer's criticism that the author did not refer at all to \\"gas chambers\\" --- I submit that this story is told honestly and accurately, but narrowly, as witnessed by one 15 year old survivor. Perhaps to witness a gas chamber, is to not live to write about it, no? I was disturbed by and continue to ponder the author's stated loss of faith in God while in the camps. This was not the case for all prisoners. Certainly a book that you will think about well after closing the last page."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I found this book one evening on the subway as I was going home.I was curious so I opened it up on the train and I couldn't put it down the rest of the night.As I read I was shocked;that I was actually reading a piece of non-fiction work,and at the amount of human suffering and depravity contained within its pages.It made me deeply upset and anguished during the read and afterward.Listen,this is not just some pointless story about suffering but rather a frightening look into how dark,evil,and sadistic man can be towards one another;and at what lengths man will go to survive,even under the most incredible duress.Also the heartbreaking circumstances of each.So I recommend you pick this up.I warn you,it is not an easy read emotionally but it could become an important read in your life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"At a time in which the new president of Iran leads the chorus of those who deny the Holocaust, it becomes more important than ever that \\"Night\\" be available to every American family. It is the work that released other survivors of that searing chapter in world history to tell their stories. Those who read it may also want to look at \\"First Person Singular: Elie Wiesel\\", a PBS special in which the author gives his personal account of his life, his work, and his hopes for the future of humanity."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Boston University Professor Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" joins and surpasses Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" in classic literature explicating the very deepest evil of human experience. This is in no way a deprecation of this literature as a witness to the Holocaust, but \\"Night\\" transcends even the historical record for which it is concerned and becomes a universal tale, questioning the very existence of G-d, and his abandonment of his chosen people. Wiesel, therefore, revisits the Theophany of Job with evidence of a greater horror than Job experienced, and the silence of the divine questions the very mystical roots of Wiesel's Hassidic tradition. \\"Night\\" is nearly overwhelmed by the burden of speaking of the experience, but the voice cries out, and G-d is silent. This, on top of the Holocaust, is the mystic's true horror. And it also is our own.Wiesel's personal story has been to hold on to a shred of hope for life so that he may serve as witness, like an inverted Bodhisattva. But in \\"Night\\" Wiesel makes a strong case that the true reaction should be one of abandoning hope, such is the horror. Indeed, the poetics of the experience recorded here surpass the imagination of Dante, for these are not shades and imagined demons, but flesh and blood men who commit this debasement.Wiesel's \\"Night\\" is perhaps the world's most difficult book to read, but it is a necessary, imperative obligation. It is a literary and historical achievement unsurpassed in human letters, and raises questions for all thinking persons. Most profoundly: how are we to live after this? \\"Night\\" will not let us escape this question, and for that witness, Wiesel, like Socrates, must be thanked."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is simply scary.I'm rather familiar with Transylvania, and it was shocking to see how quickly relatively normal life can be disrupted, as authorities suddenly appear and, after a very brief pause, round up huge numbers of people, deport them, and massacre them. In Germany, it took years for the National Socialist government to implement a policy of complete annihilation of the Jewish population. In Transylvania, this happened in a much shorter time. It is mind-boggling.I think you can understand that I was in no hurry to read this book. Too depressing! But I finally did so. And I looked for silver linings in this huge cloud. Notes of hope.I didn't find many. Sure, there were plenty of good people. But they didn't seem to make enough of a difference most of the time.Of course, the details in the book are heartbreaking, right through to the final words, where the author looks at himself in the mirror at the end of his ordeal and sees \\"a corpse\\" looking back at him, a face he says he never forgot.Others ask about what human beings are really like, or what God is really like, or how one ought to behave. Well, I asked myself these sorts of questions too, and I doubt that I have anything new or useful to contribute about them. Still, what most struck me about these questions was the role of authority. We are used to obeying commands. When we're told to report to a place at a certain time or face consequences, we do it. And so on. But in that time period, obeying commands was an ideal way to get oneself killed and also enable more killing. The best chance of survival was to disobey just those commands which looked most important to obey. And if one generalizes, what kind of world would we have if everyone were so suspicious of others that we rejected most of their advice and orders?Somehow, I concluded that of all the crimes, the worst may have been coming up with rules, commands, judgments, and laws that were designed to hurt and kill others. These remove the trust we need to have both in our fellow humans and in our most cherished institutions.As I said, I didn't find much to be happy about in this book. Still, I highly recommend it. It's well written, and I think we owe it to ourselves to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, written by Ellie Wiesel, tells of the horrible experiences in the Holocaust a young jewish boy must go through. The book tells of the struggles Eliezer has with surviving the many death camps the Nazi's have and his faith in god. He is forced to witness the deaths of thousands of jews because of mild nutrition, starvation, death marches, and work labor. Eliezer tries to survive not only for himself, but also for his father who is old and can be killed at anytime because of his weakness.The content of the book is very explicit. It descibes in detail the violence and harsh treatment of the Nazi soldiers toward the jewish people. The setting of the book changes as Eliezer tranfers death camps from Auschswitz to Buna. The content includes the death experiences of the jews, the death marches, the struggling faith in god, and the turning events of World War II that hlps to liberate the jews.Night is the winner of the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize. The book is very powerful and will leave you extremely emotional. It is apart of a trilogy which includes Dawn and The Accident. The book should be read by teenagers, as well as adults because it informs people of the hatred that people have and how it can affect people just because they are different. For people that do not have knowledge of the Holocaust and the terror it caused, Night is a perfect book for them to start with. It takes the reader in and makes them feel as if they were actually experiencing the torture the jews went through."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Words cannot express the feelings this book conjures up. Mr. Weisel has done a superb job at bringing the reader into the story (the train ride, the camps, etc.) He vividly describes the depths of human suffering, torture and evil. This is a book that every kid in middle school should read so they understand what our freedom has cost and why. His accounts of human suffering which turn not just Jew against Jew, but family members against family members are experiences that we, fortunately, can only have nightmares about. This is a quick read but a very powerful, moving and horrific read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book may be short, but a lifetime is packed into these 109 pages. Elie Wiesel presented to me things I didn't know about or hadn't thought about the Holocaust - things like the man who escaped and ran back to his town and pleaded in tears with the people, telling them of things he saw, yet no one would believe him. Things like a son in the camp hitting his father and taking away his bread. Things like the dilemma of whether you should fast for 24 hours on Yom Kippur when you've been fasting for months in a concentration camp.This book is heartbreaking, and there is no peace at the end, either. You are taken with the writer through the sinking depths of finding that if only you (the writer) would have done a certain thing - listened to the man who proclaimed what he saw, gone on a different train, in a different line, stayed behind with a certain group - perhaps you would be free by now and your loved ones would be alive. Many lose all faith in God, and some manage to still believe in Him.This book is devestating. You're stripped and left hanging and empty. And perhaps that's the right effect the book should have. There is no resolution other than to learn of and remember the horror and determine that nothing similar will happen again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"In only a hundred pages or so this book manages to bring to life what surely must be the darkest most horrible period in history. With simple prose the author is able to paint a horrible picture of the time he spent in a concentration camp. The images his story evoked in my minds eye of the terrible cruelty humans can inflict on one another will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's \\"Night\\" is the story of his experience of the Holocaust, in Auschwitz and Buchenwald. He writes of this bleak, horrible time in plain and powerful prose.\\"Night\\" is far more than an account of days and nights that nearly defy description. It also reveals how young fifteen year old Elie, who had been an exceedingly devout and prayerful boy, lost his faith. The lament \\"Where is God?\\" echoes throughout the book, a question to which no one can provide an answer that satisfies without seeming too glib and insensitive.Elie Weisel did survive, and has spent much of his life seeking justice and reparations for the tremendous suffering and losses of the camps. His memoir \\"Night\\" is a vital contribution to Holocaust history."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a book that makes the most of simple, well-chosen English to create a powerful, poetic picture. The whole thing can be read through in a couple of hours, and then read again to pick up all those exquisite images created by the author's prose.Even if you are not interested in the Holocaust, you can read this book if for no other reason than to see an example of powerful writing that is balanced and not overwrought with detail."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Dark and disturing -- but an excellent read. Writing is superb as I saw before me, everything that the author described. A good quick read for anyone interested in the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a horrific book about the holocost. The writer Elie is the main character and uses his own experiences to express his thoughts and feelings. He is a teenager who gets captured along with his father during the holocost and spends most of there time in auschuitz.The stories he tells are sometimes unimaginable, but catching, making you not want to put the book down.I don't want to give some of the stories away because that could ruin the book.I really enjoyed this book and recomend it to everyone. It is one of the first books I have read all the way through. It really grabbed my attention, and most books don't do that. I think that says something about this book. I think everyone should read this book to find out what happened during the holocost, and hear true stories from the man writing the book, Elie Wiesel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For a long time people denied the fact that the Hollocaust ever existed, simply because they couldn't bear the fact that something so terrible could ever happen. The shocking truth comes out loud and clear in Elie Weisel's Night(his account of what happened in the Holocaust from a young teen boy's perspective).Elie weisel gives his readers a shocking visual of cruelty at its worst. A cruelty that most people couldn't imagine if they tried. For example, Weisel explains families being separated on arrival and how those unable to work were murdered inhumanely.I would reccomend this novel to anyone with a strong stomache (not little children). There's a lot of violence and children might not grasp the importance of the questioning of God by Elie to this novel."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book impacted me because I believe in God nad have a personal relationship with Him. Elie Wiesel in this book went through a lot of persecution for his beliefs. Even though his have not gone through that kind of persecution , I can imagine how hard it would be.In he beginning of the book Elie was really strong in his Faith. He wanted to learn a lot abou the mystical teachings of the Zohar. I , like him, want to learn a lot about God and His word, the Bible. Inthe book, Elie sort oflost his faith or rather didn't trust God as much. I want through a period in my life where I didn't want to trust God with everything.Elie throughout the book often asked, \\"Where is God?\\" I have asked myself this question and the answer is here with us. Many of hte perple nt the book said that he Holocaust was to help them \\"kill the inner Satan.\\" Although I don't agree with a lot of what the people in the book believed, I like the book very much mostly because I can relate to a lot of the things he went through.This book has taught me a lot, like not to take life itself for granted. We take out lives and manu other things for granted. After I read this it made me look at things a lot differently and I was a lot more thankful. Ask yourself, \\"Do I take things for granted?\\" the for me was, \\"YES!\\"I think many of the people in the book were thankful. But I am not sure. we should all be thankful for the things we have because they are not our own, they are God's and he can give and take as He pleases."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"It was no longer possible to grasp anything. The insticts of self-preservation, of self-defence, of pride, had all deserted us.\\"(Night, 32)In Language Arts we read the book\\"Night\\". It was one of the best books i have ever read. It made me realize how lucky I really was. What would life be like in Elie's (the main characters) shoes? Hopefully none of us ever will ever know. This book helped me understand the ..brutality that went on in those concentration camps.In the beginning, the jews thought nothing of the Germans who were now living in their town. But slowly their rights were being taken away, and soon even their homes. The trip to these terrible camps waas just one of the jews test of strength and hope. Upon arivel, the jews saw first hand what was fueling those huge fire pits.Elie lost faith and was no longer afraid... Elie's writing made it seem like [the end] would have been better than those camps. Elie was not the only Jew to loose faith, it seemed impossible to keep. Some beleived that Hitler was the only person who had kept his promise. He had intended to kill all of the Jews when he had no more use for them.Elie managed to stay alive long enough to see freedom once again, or was it..? Why didn't anyone stop this from hapening in the first place? Why were the Jews treated poorly. They are no different from anyone else. I think that this book is a reminder of the suffering we can cause by [ill will]. It [hurts] people, families, and whole races."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This was definetly not one of my favorite books. I kinda had to force myself to read it.

I'm sure that not all opinions of this book are the same, but my opinion is not a good one.Sincerely,Chase : )"},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book had its good points and its bad points. The novel was very informative, however it was depressing. The book told of the true hatred the Nazi party had for the Jews. They were treated as less than animals, beaten, starved, and slaughtered. Unless they were able to work, they were left for dead. The novel, Night expresses the tragedy and real life horror that the Jews experienced."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night, was diffently was not one of my favorite books to read. The book was very repetitive and was not a very exciting book to read. Night was an autobiography which is sometimes hard to write but this book could have done a little better on what they were trying to get across. Most of my classmates I believe feel the same way as I do. I gave this book 3 stars because it was very informative on what went on in the holocaust. I would recommend this book to people who want to know about the holocaust but not for an exciting piece of work."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel Night, by Elie Weisel is definitley a very intense auotbiography. This story allows one to see all of the twists and turns that the Jews had to face. Every single time that I began to feel hopeful that something good was going to happen to the Jews, they would be faced with yet another tragedy. Elie Weisel was faced with the reality and also tragedy of losing his childhood. He had to lose many important and valuable things along the way. Elie lost his home, his friends, his childhood, his family, his faith, and most importantly, his dignity. It is unreal to even imagine that someone could be so cruel to another human being, but this novel allows you to see that this world is very far away from being perfect. It is unbelievable to think that these types of unhumane experiences are still going on throughout our society, but it is happening. If you like to be on the edge of your seat, saying &quot;What will happen next?&quot; this book is a must see."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHT by ELIE WIESEL was an extrodinary book that contained a story from a heartbroken jew's point of view. The book lets everybody know what the holocaust was all about and how the struggle to survive was the most difficult task of all. Elie went through so many situations that about 99% of people today couldnt have lasted 2 minutes in Elie's shoes. After i read this book i realized how gruesome the holocaust really was. The book will make you ask yourself questions, such as, how were the germans so terribly mean and crucial? How did the Jews that lasted for five years last? What was the point in killing all of those people? If you think that you know about the Holocaust then read this book and really find out what happen during that time period."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel Night written by Elie Weisel is a novel about a young man that goes throught a herrific ordeal with living in a concentration camp and sees things that no one is ever meant to see.The most important scene that touched me personally would have to be when Elie was told what life is suppose to be at a concentration camp.He is told that there is no sons or fathers here in this camp it is everyone for themselves.he also told him instead of being slowed down by his father he should take his father ration for himself and get rid of his burden.The reason why this is such an important scene in my mind would have to be that Elie was actually thinking to himself that maybe the man was right.The ironic thing about it would have to be the only reason why Elie was still alive was because of his father yet he was thinking for himself and only worrying about himself when his father on the other hand was worrying more about Elie than himself.Ponder This-all the similies are clues to his feelings-why is the book entitled Night and not something like the name of the camp?-In your opinion what is night?In my personal opinion of this novel I tend to think that this novel is okay for something that is not of my interest.I think that it is kind of strange that he didin't describe every detail and only described things that happened at night.It would have been better with more details about more than just what happened after the bread call.I like the fact that the protagonist questions &quot;God&quot; and brings a thought that alot of people think is wrong.Over all I think that it is okay.I would reccomend this novel to anyone who loves to read about realistic experiences about being in war and being in prison.Anyone who loves to read things that when you close your eyes you can picture in your mind."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" traces the life of a young boy from a quiet life in a small Rumanian town through the brutality of Nazi forced labor, ghetto life, deportation, separation from family, concentration camp life, symbiotic existence with an aging and weakening father, death marches, and the end to the physical horrors -- to which the word \\"liberation\\" can only marginally apply. It is also a journey into Elie Wiesel's heart, into the propensity for good and evil within all of us. The tale is a short but riveting one, indeed shrouded in the darkness of night and the depths of falling snow. You may well complete it in only a day or two of reading. My own trip to Birkenau in 2002 in the midst of winter captured only the cold and desolation, but not the guns, the trains, the groans, nor the Night which Wiesel describes. I do not believe we should confuse voyeurism with a desire for empathy, and a desire for empathy is perhaps one of the more constructive motivations for reading about the Holocaust. This work escorts the reader down a short, intense, and painful corridor into the nadir of Wiesel's own despair, into the void of a faith shattered, and into the evil propensities characteristic of the human kind since times immemorial. Yet it gracefully circumvents any penchant for voyeurism, compromising no facet of the horrific tale but in no way exploiting it for the much baser goal of producing a compelling narrative. This is Elie Wiesel's heart on paper. Probably all of our hearts on paper."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Survival, the book Night by Elie Wiesel. This is a good book for someone who likes to read about, adventure, survival, and biography.I choose theses topics because; they have to do with survival and adventure. For mistiest the main character Elizer ran into a lot of problems. He just kept getting caught doing and seeing things, so they moved him to a different camp, because of the last thing he did. He saw some guards in an alley betting a man to a bloody pulp, and then they saw Elizer watching what they were doing to that poor man in the alley. They started to chase after him and they caught him. Then sense he saw that they had to transverse him to a different camp so he couldn't tell any one about what they were doing. That is a reason I like the book is of the trouble Elizer was getting in. The main character Elizer had a hard time surviving at this new camp. The other good part at the camp is it had to do with survival, it's when Elizer got thrown in a pit with dead people and he couldn't breathe, Dead bodies still known place to breathe, He's running out of Air will he die! I think that part kept me on the edge of my chair.I choose these to parts because; they have the same kind of situation. Like when the main character is try to help his dad to March and trying to keep his dad alive. In a part of the book Elizer is trying to help by giving him his ration for him to eat. Now they are split into different groups so his dad may not live. But they got to get back together when they had to do the 3 mile jog; they were so tired when they got done with that jog they almost died. This book is a pretty good book, think if you like what you just read you should think about getting this book to read.This is a good book for someone that likes adventure, survival, and a biography. I think this is a good book and out of 5 stars I give it 3.5, because in some parts it gets boring. But it is a good book, also because the guy that wrote it got to go through it and lives to tell about it later in life."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The novel Night by Elie Wiesel inspired our freshmen class. The content of the book was based on a true story. It was a story that went into great detail on what went on and what millions of Jews went through. The story dealt with the suffering Jewish men, women, and children endured. Elie and his father went through many concentration camps through his teenage years. He dealt with disease, death, starvation, and hard labor work. I liked this book becasue it shows how cruel people are, and what went on to the millions of innocent Jewish people."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a very inspiring book for many reasons. I read this book in high school because it was required, however I bought the trilogy (The Night Trilogy: Night, Dawn, the Accident) because I loved Night. The fact that this is a TRUE story puts a whole new twist on the topic. The Holocaust can teach us all a valuable lesson and humble us in many ways. One shouldn't judge the author on the content of the book because it is based on fact.I think Elie narrated the incident fabulously. He tells the story as he remembers, leaving out no detail. The realities are hard to stomach sometimes, but such is Life. If we isolate ourselves from the difficulties in Life, we won't be living up to our full potential. This book is a great example of how hard Life is and how there is hope in all situations. I appreciate the blatant truth that Elie poured into this novel. Anyone that can appreciate the world and all its imperfections should read this wonderful book. Way to go Elie, your Spirit lives on . . ."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was, for me, on the reading list of a misguided class in 'Western' relgions taught at Barnard College in NYC. Althought the professor was an awful teacher, her havingselected this book for that class almost redeems the entire experience....What Weisel does in this book is amazing. In his autobiography, he presents a portrait of himself, his world, and the state of his religion. You can see that rites become meaningless (for him) when the suffering imposed by God becomes too much to bear. It is not that faith is gone necessarily, so much that faith has changed..... and this experience in this book will change you.....Please read this book: especially if the name Celia Deutch means anything to you.

With literature like this I can understand why Elie Wiesel won the Nobel Peace Prize."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Excellen"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is a very strong nnovel about a man that had to live and be in the halocaust. His name is Elie Wiesel. When he was 15 he was taken from his home in Sighet, Romania. He had to go through many concentration camps like Buna, Buchenwald, Birkenau, and Aucshwitz. Throghout this book he has to witness the death of his parents, sisters, his look on life, and his faith in god. Elie goes through hell as he has to run from concentration camp to concentration camp and not be able to slow down for several miles. He already has no food in his system and is as skinny as a twig. He pushes human limits and fights to survive. In this book you can see how much denial and indifference there was in the world at the time of the Holocaust and the World War 2 era. The jews throughout this book believed that the Russians would come and save them as they heard the explosion of batterys and artilliary strikes and the sounds of guns. They believed that the Germans would be defeated before they made it as far as Romania and into the town of Sighet. Within the first few chapters you can already see why things like this happened in the time period that it did. No one thought it would happen to them and when it did they asked God to save them and when they started to loose faith in themselves and not work or just give up completely they would die. What is discreat in this book is that you read that God is not there but as you continue through the book you can tell he is there by saving the people that still have the will to survive thier ordeal and fight for thier lives. Overall this is a very good book and it should be read by anybody for pleasure or for something on an airplane. I promise you won't regret picking up this book because you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Night","review":"this is a really short book. it puts all the hard-core facts without giving too much explanations. it's straight forward, and i didn't like that. but all in all, it has meaning to it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, by Eliezer Wiesel, is a short novel with 110 pages. In 1941, Eliezer Wiesel, the narrator, a twelve boy living in Sighet, explains his real life in the Concertration Camps during World War II. His story is terrifying, shocking and touched. It is hard to read through the novel without feeling into Eliezer and his family's situation. Eliezer gets used to these vivid pictures of the death people. Wiesel has described a painful journey through this darkness until there are hints that tiny shafts of light can pierce the seemingly unending nights. No matter it is day or night, the life Eliezer lived in only can describe like night. I really enjoy into the reading. There are so many messages for me to learn and go through. As I read this novel, Eliezer's language and description is making me keep turning the pages on. Toward the end of the story, Wiesel begins to expedite his life style.

We feel earnestly for he and his father to survive against the \\"system\\" in captivity. Tragically, certain fellow prisoners appear to be as dangerous as the guards are. As they do in the military, rumors bearing false hope abound. \\"Every man for himself\\" selfishness also abounds, most graphically in the instance of the young man who falls out of step with his own father to avoid punishment. We sympathize with those who second-guess themselves for not escaping the Nazis early in the War, or not emigrating to Palestine. The main problem with \\"Night\\" is that it's all too brief. The ending happens far too soon, almost as if concentration camp were a terrible weekend, a bad dream, perfectly brutal but quickly dispensed with. This reviewer believes that the Holocaust is not done justice by a 109-page paperback. It demands more detail, more retelling, more names, more places, more faces and indeed-more suffering. So many of us, this reviewer included, remain ignorant of the Holocaust and absent greater detail, stand to remain that way. At the risk of sounding petty, a map would assist in the process. I honestly would like to know where Mr. Weisel suffered. One result of my reading of \\"Night\\" is that I intend to scroll through amazon[.com] for other (retellings) of the Holocaust. Hopefully I will find some that deal with this issue the greater depth, volume and detail it deserves."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book as a class asignment. Read it in one night. I bet your asking how can it be depressing in just 128 short pages. Well, Elie weisel, if you don't know him, is a haulocuast survivor. This story is based on his childhood when he was taken with his father to the concentration camp. Throughout the whole book we are melted into the scene of a gritty, disgustingly horrific journey that the father and son must take. When I read it I imagined my father in the place of the one in the book. I think that's how you're supposed to read this book; by putting yourself in the character's shoes. Only then will you find this book, despite it's graphic images, as a peotically depressing tale of survival. It reminds you on what a privlage it is to be alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book arrived in very good condition several days before I anticipated it's arrival. The book itself was very light reading compared to other books of this genre that I have read. In general I was disappointed with the content. I have sincere compassion for the victims of the Nazi concentration camps and wish that this book had been more detailed. It was kind of like reading a condensed version of the Holocaust. In spite of this, I would recommend the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a great book. It is an interesting (true) story, and the details make it easy to imagine. It is very moving and really upsetting at times, but I still couldn't put it down. I definately suggest that you read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night, but Elie Wiesel is a touching story about life during the German Holocaust. The memoir is told by the author Elie Wiesel himself. He tells of his struggle to stay alive, and of his faith in God that was so strong, but lost along the way. Night tells of the torture the Germans went through to be an equal in society.When reading this memoir you will have to ask yourself, if the people committing these crimes were human, and if they were human did they have any soul. It seemed they have hate built up in them that was so strong they were trained to explode and kill the Jews. This was one side of the Holocaust the main side, the dark side, the in human side.The other side of the Holocaust which was rare was the good side, or almost normal side. The side where the people who were committing these crimes looked at themselves are realized they were wrong, and would sometimes give leeway to the Jews. The would sometimes in the dark give words of encouragement.This book really made me think. It was touching, yet frightening to know that these cruel crimes where happening physically in the world. It was real, it is real. Some parts I had to put the book down because it was disturbing. I would tell everyone to read this book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This autobiographical novel tells the story of Eliezer, a teenage Jewish boy from the small Transylvanian village of Sighet. He is 17 when transported to Auschwitz, Buna, and finally Buchenwald with his father. Eliezer loses his faith, argues with God, and is sustained only by the need to care for his father. Instead of God, he is rescued by an American tank. The story is a sort of Exodus in reverse, with humiliation and death as its destination, not liberation and triumph. _Night_ was the first part of a trilogy that included _Dawn_ and _The Accident_, and for these and his other Holocaust studies Wiesel won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.This book details the horrors 15-year-old Elie Wiesel went through during his death camp experience. An extremely religious teen from childhood, he struggled with his religious beliefs during the Holocaust. While struggling to keep himself and his father alive, Elie also goes through severe religious struggles along with beatings, starvation, and disease"},{"Title":"Night","review":"This concise and moving autobiographical novel by (1986 Nobel Prize winner) Ellie Wiesel makes a powerful statement. Wiesel was a Jewish teenager living with his family in the village of Sighet, Rumania in 1944 when the Germans came for them. As it was, Wiesel describes surviving Nazi concentration camps while his family and neighbors were either killed outright or wasted away from hunger and disease. We share the author's fears and survival instincts, and comprehend the callousness that he and his fellow inmates developed to maintain both their lives and their sanity. Few statements about the Nazi holocaust against the Jews, Gypsies, and other \\"enemies of the state\\" are as poignant as this sorrow-filled account. If anything, this readably moving account is too short."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Would anyone read a depressing book? I didn't want to but I had to. The book Night really depressed me. I didn't like this book because, it depressed me. I didn't like picturing people being torched or people dieing in my mind. I also just really don't like this kind of book.When I say this Book depresses me I mean some of the quotes depress me. One of the quotes that depress me is on page 72 of the book Night, this quote says \\"Eliezer...Eliezer...tell them not to hit me... I haven't done anything... why do they keep hitting me.\\" This quote depressed me because I hadn't thought about people being hurt before and this made me think about that.Another way this book depressed me was the imagery in it. What I mean is when it said this \\"for more than half an hour he stayed there, struggling between life and death, dying in slow agony under our eyes, and we had to look him full in the face.\\" (Night, 65). I used this quote because it lets you picture the person dying and makes you wish you had not just read it. When you are a person like me you have to think about it for a long time because the picture will not go out of your mind.When I think of the imagery and the depression this book gives a person I come to the thought that I just don't like this type of book. My summery is that when I read this book about the holocaust I had to think of how they killed inanest people and I couldn't see how people would let them do this.My conclusion is that I don't like the depression, imagery, or the book type its self. In the holocaust the Germans killed inanest people by the thousands. People dying by being hanged and people that new them had to watch. There were only 6 to 7 million people who survived the holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What happened in the Holocaust? I read the book night by Elie Weisel. I like that book because, It told us what happened and in his autobiography. This book is good because he used irony in the right spots, and the plot was easy to follow for some people but I had trouble.To attract the reader Weisel used a lot of imagery \\"But we were no longer afraid of death at any rate, not to that of death. Every bomb that exploded filled us with joy and gave us new confidence in life.\\" Well what I saw in that quote is that they had all ready given up once and they have gotten a little more spirit. That they had a chance to live but it was very small. But the weird thing was they were kind of depressed but happy.He also uses some irony that thought. \\"Long Live Liberty.\\" Cried the two adults. I think that it was their way to say we are rebelling and that their will be freedom soon enough. And this other quote had some irony too. \\"Where is god now?\\" But I think that it is mosty plot structure because I see it as irony very much. It was saying that where is god at obviously he is not with us right now because Weisel saw those people get hung and that young kid too. I read the book \\"Night\\" by Elie Weisel I did like that book because he used irony in the right spots and the plot was way easy to follow for some people.That when they threw the babies against the walls and that they looked like walking corpse. They all together killed 6.6 million Jews and no one knew about it besides Europe."},{"Title":"Night","review":"What is the Holocaust? I never knew about the Holocaust until I read the book Night. I liked the book because of the way Wiesel used imagery in the Holocaust. I found the setting hard to follow because it jumped around. The mood of the book was sad.Wiesel used imagery throughout the book like on page 22 when he said, \\"Fire! I can see a fire! I can see a fire!\\" I could picture a fire in my head at this time in the book. I think that Wiesel used that line to let people know that they weren't going to a good place.Along with imagery Wiesel also used mood to catch your attention like on page 4 when he said, \\"Babies were thrown into the air and the machine gunners used them as targets.\\" This quote impacted me because that's cruel and inhumane to do. Also I think that this was a sad part in the book because why would you want to kill all those babies. I think he used this to tell you that the Germans didn't care about the Jews.Along with imagery and mood Wiesel used change in time like on page 51 when he said, \\"In 1944 you were in Germany, at Buna weren't you?\\" He was talking about a girl that he met in Buna when he got beat. I think he said that to let you know that he caught back up with her later on in life. I think this was confusing because it lost me in the book by saying a couple years later he met up with her again.To conclude, I was impacted by Wiesel's use of imager, mood, and change in time. What amazed me was that they were pretty much dead but they still walked around and that the Germans used babies as targets and didn't car about anyone. \\"Babies were thrown into the air and the machine gunners used them as targets.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"The soup tasted as corpses.\\" I did not like the book night because it was boring. Half the time I didn't know what was going on in the book because I didn't like or understand the vocabulary. I also didn't like the setting of the book because it was confusing. I didn't like how Wiesel used his imagery in the book Night.Wiesel used a lot of vocabulary that I did not understand such as on page 62, \\"The soup tasted as corpses.\\" At first I didn't know what a corpse was and I got confused because I didn't understand. I didn't know what Weisel meant when he said that. I didn't know why it would taste as corpses at the time I read it, but now I do. That is why the vocabulary was hard for me.\\"The soup tasted as corpses.\\" I chose this because I didn't know what it meant in the book.Wiesel switched around the setting a lot in the book and I didn't like it because I didn't know where he was in the book. It wasn't effective because he switched around in the book to much. For example when he met the French girl in the warehouse and at the coffee shop the setting switched on pages 50-51.\\"The year of the holocaust was in the 1940's.\\"Wiesel also used a lot of imagery in throughout the book. His imagery in the book was not effective because it was confusing for me. It was hard to picture things in the book. I couldn't imagine anything in the book.\\"Fire! I can see a fire! I can see a fire!\\" This quote explains imagery well, it's a good example.So in conclusion I didn't like the book because the vocabulary was hard, hard to follow the setting, and the imagery was hard to picture. My main point is that I didn't like the book because it was hard to understand and hard to follow.\\"Over 60,000 people were killed during the holocaust.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"The Novel Night is an excellent novel of the narrator Eliezer's coming of age. Eliezer is a young child growing up during the Holocaust. Eliezer faces alot of problems that young people face, but he also has to faces problems that only the Jewish had to face. These problems were the fight to stay alive during the Holocaust.Eliezer's journeys to various consentration camps slowly deteriorate his mind, body, and spirit. The Climax of the of the novel begins when a tragedy brings Eliezer to a deep depression.This Novel is excellent and could be read by people who are open minded enough to understand the struggles the Jewish had to go through just because of their religion and race."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is , this story is so gut wrenching it honestly made me cry. I read this in highschool (10th grade) and wow so many students were just moved by this book even the teacher cried reading it outloud...Ofcourse many people and almost everyone should know the events of the holocaust...while this is said to be a novel the author also writes from his own experiences. this book moved me in so many ways and just makes you realize how horrific life can be. really this book is not recommended to everyone truly because if you know close to nothing about the holocaust the reader might just think it is just another novel. Ladies and gentlemen this isn't purely a novel but really the author's history a world history and not to be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book by Elie Wiesel is one of the best books I've read. With the events that occurred during the holocaust it was full of details & extremely descriptive. After reading this book you'll learn about the holocaust that you never knew about & terrifying episodes will be playing in your head."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I am 15 years old and I read the novel Night as an assignment in 9th grade English and I have to say that the novel made me think and want to know more about the Holocost and it made me keep the book in my hand. I ended up passing by the class in their completion of the Novel. I would recommend the book to anyone who can read a book that touches you inside."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Ellie Wiesel's account of his life in Nazi death camps is a wonderful masterpiece. The young boy'scompassion for his father, his devotion to God, and his quest for survival are what make this book impossible to put down. As an English teacher, I find this book an absolute to any curriculum. The camp descriptions are horrifying. The hanging of the small boy, ghastly. It is hard to believe that 20 years ago the only Holocaust literature taught was Anne Frank. This is definitely an awakening to the real world of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read NIGHT a few years ago, and it left a deep impression on me. One aspect that I was surprised by was my reaction to the events that happened. I found myself disbelieving what happen, and I was surprised by this reaction. I found the events discribed, so vivid, and truely terrifying, that I just could not bring myself to believe that they actually occured. It took some effort on my part to remind myself that the events discribed in NIGHT, actually did occur. The story of the Holocaust is a story that must be told so that history doesn't repeat itself. Ellie Weisel's book is one of the best, I only took me a day to read. But it has left a deep impression on me."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is the best teaching tool I have found for my unit on the Holocaust. Wiesel writes powerfully. Within a few, short pages, my students are hooked. We have excellent discussions about it and the themes presented in it. I highly recommend it to any teacher of any discipline. The writing is not inaccessible to students of lower reading abilities, yet it is challenging enough for students on the other end of the spectrum."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I really enjoy this book because it's really different to all the other book that i readed before, talk about a man that suffer to much for the war and all the people that reads this book will leard that this things can not happened again in this world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"we in the adult education class are reading your book our teacher mr bartlewski...brings this book to to life andin behalf of my class mates i commend you for the great courage you &amp; yr family endured in ww2... it would give mr B. the pleasure of meating you In person,but it would probably not happen..how ever if you took a little of yr time to send some words to mr B. i think it would bring great joy to him...he has read yr book Night at least 100 times to his claases since he has been teaching for nearly 30 yrs...thank you.."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Wiesel tells what happened to him and his family in a very interesting book. I totally disagree with the people who only gave the book 4 or less stars, put yourself in that situation and see if you would write a book as good as this one."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Although sickening at times, this book just describes the scenes in such a manner that I was just awed by how I was able to picture it in my mind. How could anyone try to destroy a whole religion?I don't understand the person from Russia: these things really did happen in the places mentioned. My Granpa, in WWII, liberated Dacau, one of the prision camps for the Jews that was mentioned in &quot;Night&quot;. My Grandpa took pictures of the piles of clothing whose owners were put into the furnaces, and the piles of bodies. He gave me those pictures, and I will never be able to wipe away the look on one of the dead men's face. Yes, this really did happen."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night was very combelling.

The book is a elementary to middle school level, and that was about the time I initially read it. The second time around, I was able to grasp the ideas and content of the book I could not catch onto when I was younger. I am now a junior in high school, and have been educated of the holocaust for many years. Night raised my level of awareness for the struggles of the holocaust and helped me to gain an appreciatence for what our elders have endured. The relationship between the father and his son was a pure demonstration of the strength one needed to survive in a concentration camp. If it wasn't for the closeness they held onto, I believe both men would not have survived. I would recommend this book to people who want to be aware of the make-up of our history, told through the struggles of a father and a son's experiences."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Weisel is an accurate look into the life of a young jewish boy sent to a concentration camp during WWII.

The images it puts into your mind are unforgetable and horrible. Knowing what your immagining isn't half as bad as what millions went through is a reality check. The only way to describe the Holocaus is horrible and inhumane. This book is about a 15 year old boy (Elie) who is taken from his city with his family to a concentration camp. The hell they go through is depressing, and explained so well. I read this book when I was in 8th grade, and now being in 10th I see things in a completely different way. I recomend this book to everyone who wants to see a childs view on the Holocus and really feel the pain millions went through."},{"Title":"Night","review":"My opinion of this book is that it was very graphic. When I say it was graphic, I don't mean with pictures. The whole book was that way, full of unsuspecting details that made it sorta come to life. It makes you picture what actually happened at the camps. Like when he says that the two adults and the little boy were hung, the little boy hung there for over a half an hour because his body was too light to get it over with. You can actually see the &quot;sad angelic face&quot; of the little boy. I recamend this book to anyone who is interested in a little history lesson, one he/she won't forget!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought this book was cool, but it was sad. They killed a lot of innocent people, just because they were jews. The germans got on their good side then turned and killed them, and sending them to camps. Elie was very lucky that the americans came when they did. His dad died and their was nothing left for him.The germans killed people left and right, throwing them in furnaces,shooting them, or beating them to death. Elie was very brave, he withstood all the trials that were put up against him. This is a good book describing what pain the people of the holocost had to go through."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that this was a pretty good book. It told all the things that had happened while they were there.

I thought that the germans are mean for killing and trapping the jews. Elie was awesome because he was one of the last survivers. It was very sad when his father died because he was struck in the head with the officers club. It was very heart breaking and it brought a tear to my eye. It was also sad in the fact that he got transferred to the childrens block and then when they called all the jews to the front and told them to evacuate so they could blow up the block. It would have been horrible to eat what they ate (a bit of grass or potatoe pillings). Over all the book was great and it grabed your attention.

NIGHT by Elie Wiesel is about a jewish boy who lived sourrounded by absolute pain and horror during his early teenlife. This boy who is the author lived a terrifying account of the Nzi death camp. As you read the book, you feel how this young jewish boy turns into an agonized witness of the death of his family, friends and specially his life: the death of his inocence and the death of his belief in God. He was a normal and happy boy when suddenly he was taken from his home to the Awschwitz concentration camp and later to buchenwold. All his memories of pain and suffering are unforgettably record in NIGHT. Elie fought for his life but nearly at the end, he got to a point where nothing mattered to him anymore because he had already suffered too much. By reading you can learn a lot. I think NIGHT is an exellent book and it has taught me a lot of things. I recomend this book to teens and adults but not to children because it might be too strong for them.

Every chapter makes you want the next one, holding you with real-life suspense. You can't help but be caught up in what was going on. It's the type of book that'll make you lose sleep.

Another example is \\"Work is liberty!\\" It did not matter if they worked or not, they would probably die anyways. These ironic statements made the book kind of interesting; however, I disliked this book.One of the reasons that I disliked this book was because the author was very descriptive which made the book seem to drag along. If there was more story over description, it would have been better. Another reason that I did not like this book is that the book was confusing to me. Some of the language was hard to follow. Here are some the other reasons for not reading this book:The author did a good job of telling what happened at the war; however some of the things he put in the book were unnecessary. For example, the author told us that they were shooting babies in mid air with machine guns.Another reason that I did not like this book is that I thought it was too long. For example, the author put a lot of things in the book that was unnecessary. He told us that the German girls were letting themselves be kissed by the soldiers.In conclusion, I did not like this book because it was to long, hard to follow and too descriptive. Therefore, I would recommend that you do not read this book. I do not believe that this book is worth the time to read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"HI my name is Tony Hall from Madison, OHIO. And i read this book about two or three weeks ago. I personaly did not like this book because it didn't have enough action, the only time it had a little bit of action toward the beginning. But I would not recomend this book to any of my friends because they like action books too. I would recomend this book to someone whom might like books about life long stories. A book I would recomend is the diary of Anne Frank I thaught that was a good book and I could read that book over and over again. So I figured I would tell what I felt on the book night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"i thought that this book was very grous and boring. i would not ever sugest this book to anyone. unless u like very bad things. the worst part was when they would take the babies and slam them against the wall then through them in a pile 2 kill them. and they would put 75 people in a cattle car for up to 4 days at a time. this book was discusting but it was full of facts. that is all."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I relly did not like this book but i had to read it. If you like learnig stuff you should read this book i learned a lot but it is about the jews durring the hollicost. It is baseed on a true story. you also might enjoy this book if you like sad stuff."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Personally, i didn't like Night simply because it contained material that was too graphic for a reader such as I. Too many times the book told of people getting burnt to death, hung, shot, or beaten. That kind of stuff makes me think more of people dying then of the message the author was trying to get across to the readers.If the author had based the book more on the whole Holocaust event and not on his personal accounts, i think that i would have enjoyed reading the book more. I thought that the book wouldn't had been a personal story so i when i found out that it was a personal story i wasn't as interested in it. I do think that writing a story like that would take a lot of courage on the authors part but i just don't feel good about reading of babies and women getting killed over another person's prejuduce way of viewing the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think that this book was disgusting. It was well writin, but very graphic. It told the story the way it really was which was good in a way but bad in others."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read this book in one of my English class. I really enjoy reading it with my class I learned to not be a racist against other people. I learned that Elie Wiesel had a difficult life when he wrote this story, but after all Elie Wiesel success in his life. I read it all and I saw a lot of racism on this story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Ellie Wiesel does not know how to write a book!!! He tries to make his novel dramatic by writing one line paragraphs and short, terse phrases. While reading the novel, Wiesel writing style makes him seem more like one who has researched the holocaust endlessly than an actual survivor of the horrific event. Actual first hand accounts of the holocaust by concentration camp survivors are few and far between. That is why I gave this book two stars rather than one. When Wiesel can buffer up his writing, I'm sure his novels will be great and remembered works of literature; for now, they are immature writings by an unknowledgable author."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Where is God? Where is He?\\"That's one of the quotes from the book \\"Night\\". I thought the book was terrible, becuase the author (Elie Wiesel) went into way to much detail. He talked about babies getting thrown into the air and using them for shooting practice. They killed people for no reason. They threw people into a fire pit and let them die a slow aganising death. Can you imagine? I'd hate to have a slow, painful, and aganising death. That would stink!Anyway, these Germans came and took the Jews to a camp where they would, well, die. The Germans took them to the camp in a train and if the Jews were to jump off the train they would get shot.I just thought it was a really disturbing and sad book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"As far as this time period is concerned, I truly expected much more."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"work is liberty\\" disturbed me while i read because in the end i didnt come true and it made me wonder about it.They told all the jews a lie. The book was mostly about the Holocaust.I didnt really like the book night because it was very sad to read some parts on the book it is very disturbing to read the parts were they talk about burning people in the pit. I also didnt like the part were they killed babies.If a baby and was a jew they were killed because there was no place for them because they couldnt walk or talk or even work. So the germans killed all the babies. The safest age in the concentration camps were between 18-40.If they were any younger the Germans would think they were healthy and they could probably work more and faster.There are parts in the book about what a guy said that was irony which was \\"work is liberty\\" it means if you work hard and succeed in what you are doing you will get liberty(released from camp).The start of the book is more detailed. Towars the end the narrator gets more short and abrupt.Since elies dad dies it changes to short and abrupt.After reading the book it didnt seam to be very good.The book made me think of bad things and it kinda hurt my feelings.I didnt like were they killed the babies."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I was assigned to read this book for socratic seminar in our eigth grade class. While we read it in class, one of the boys actually started to cry! But on the other hand, it's hard to believe that someone would acctually DO such HORRIBLE things!!!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recall when I first read 'Night', it was just after Elie Wiesel had given a lecture at my university. It was in the mid-1980s, and the lecture hall was standing-room-only. Wiesel's presentation moved us to tears, and moved us to anger, and moved me to want to follow up on his words by reading what he had written.This is supposed to be fiction, but in a style that seems to be typical of many modern Israeli novelists, it is so close to the truth of the actual events that transpired in Wiesel's life that it might as well be treated as autobiographical. This is actually part of a trilogy - Night, Dawn, and The Accident - although each element stands alone with integrity.How does one deal with survival after such atrocities as that at Birkenau and Auschwitz? How can one have faith in the world? How can one accept that a people so closely identified with a powerful God can ever accept that God again? Where is God in the midst of such things?Wiesel himself as spent his life in search of such answers, but doesn't provide them here. Why then would one want to read such accounts as these? Wiesel was silent for many years, until he was brought into speech and writing as a witness to the events. Wiesel proclaims that there is in the world now a new commandment - 'Thou shalt not stand idly by' - when such things are happening, one must act. One must remember the past in all its personal aspects to both honour those who suffered and to forestall such things happening again (which, given the the depressing repetitive nature of history, is a difficult task).This is the longest short book I've ever read. It is one that has stayed with me from the first page, and I've never been able to shake the images brought forward, the misery and suffering, the existence of evil and brutality, the sadness and desolation. We live in a culture that likes to gloss over pain and suffering, mask it with drugs and other things, and always end the story with a happy ending.There is no happy ending here - even Wiesel's own survival is a questionable good here. How does one live after this? How does the world go on?One thing is certain, we must never forget, and this book is part of that active remembering that we are called to do."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is not a \\"good\\" book. It is not something that is uplifting, fulfilling. It seems, in a sense, empty. The whole book is like a funeral dirge, or a requiem mass. It is extremely well-written, and amazingly moving. However, the fact still remains that it is a depressing, disheartening write-up, as are many accounts of the Holocaust. You will not come away from it satisfied or satiated. Yet I think that is the purpose Elie Wiesel had in writing this book. A book about emptiness, darkness. Night. An endless, eternal discord, aptly entitled so. A spiritual struggle between good and evil. For that is what night is, in a sense. It is old and wise, laden with grief, somber in its insight, whereas day is young, carefree, innocent, a delight to behold. Day pours over the fields, dancing brightly as the world awakens to greet it. Night washes the innocence away without a hesitation, a thought or a care. Night can be beautiful. But it is also treacherous, for under cover of darkness, a fiend waits to ambush anyone who would cross its path or meet its eye.Mostly, that is what happened to the Jews in Night. In a flash, the fiend had ambushed them and brought them to their fate. As Elie writes, \\"From that moment, everything happened very quickly. The race toward death had begun.\\" In those short sentences, night swept over the land, eliminating the light, brushing its innocence aside without a care. Yet, shortly after, he contradicts himself by writing, \\"life returned to normal\\". This he continues to do for awhile, frequently choosing to signify the dawn of a new day, the dawn of hope, the dawn of a small inkling of a chance for freedom. But then it stops. From that moment on, that night had devoured them. Their hearts were heavy, laden with the memory of events and deeds as black as night.But even with the symbolic significance of Night, it is somewhat ironic that Wiesel would use this as the title of the story. He, his family, all the Jews, were stripped of all they had, all they ever had owned or wanted, in a flash. It all happened in the day. The fact that the few who were eventually liberated were liberated in the day. The fact that nearly all the action, all the terrible events that occurred, happened during the day. Though, for Elie, who goes through many religious highs and lows, it is all an endless night. His God, the God who would always bring back the light, was murdered before his eyes. \\"My God,\\" he writes, \\"was dead.\\" His faith shattered at the coming of the night, as did all his hope for a new dawn of a new day. As Elie puts it, \\"In the depths of my heart, I felt a great void.\\"But then, at the end, at last it happens, when Elie finally escapes the terror, the horrible death camp of Auschwitz, along with the other Jews who had survived. It marks the dawn of a new age, for Elie, and for all the Jews. It gives them a new chance, a chance for freedom. Hope and freedom is kindled anew. \\"In the depths of my being, in the recesses of my weakened conscience, could I have searched it, I [was] free at last!\\" And once he is free, he takes a look at himself in a mirror, something he has not done for almost a year. He sees a corpse staring back at him. And that image is still with him to this day.Many nights have fell and days have dawned since that took place. Sixty years later, and the story still lives on, every bit as true now as it was then, and every bit as unimaginable. Thousands upon thousands of Jews who did not survive-the thought is incomprehensible. A recession. To just think about the terrors told of in Night, of the crematories, the blocks, and the electrified fence, is difficult if not impossible to understand. So much death came to those who were undeserving. So much death came to them, all without any reason whatsoever. Why would anyone do such a thing like that? Why would anyone think another group as deserving of having to endure such a night? It was no normal night, but it was a night nonetheless. A night that drove children to kill their own fathers for but a scrap of bread. Elie may have finally escaped the terror of that night, but it will never leave him. He will always remember. \\"It was a nightmare... [it] has never left me.\\""},{"Title":"Night","review":"NightBy Ellie WeiselHolocaust a myth or did it really happen? It is all about your opinion. Some people are still trying to believe that the holocaust never happened. I believe different while doing some recap on history after reading the book Night (by Ellie Weisel) and having daily discussions about what happened in the holocaust.Has anyone even ever thought about the holocaust, well in this report I will take you back to the late 1930's to talk about this dramatic book.Some of the reasons I liked the book Night is because the way the writer wrote the book. He gave imagery and descriptive writing to paint a picture in your head. Another reason I liked the book is because the book makes people feel like they are there. The reason I didn't like the book was because sometimes the book jumped from one time period to another time period.To attract the reader, weisel used a lot of detailed writing and imagery in Night. \\"That night the soup tasted like coupes.\\" When I read that I got an image in my head of three men hanging on a noose dead and a little boy hanging their still alive because his neck didn't break when they pulled the lever.Along with detailed writing and imagery, weisel also used great dialog to keep the reader interested in the book. \\"Were god, were he, were he, he is hanging there on the gallows\\" The reason this book has great imagery is because it has great dialog. Great imagery is from great dialog. Dialog is the reason people get images in their head.If the Jews would have never went to the concentration camps, the setting of this book would have never taken place\\"Do you recognize me?\\"\\"I don't know you.\\"\\"In 1944 you were in Germany, at Buna, weren't you?\\" I didn't really like this part in the book because he was telling about him working in the factory and then it just skips to him talking to the woman latter in Paris, I just didn't really like that part.A person with so much power, abuses that power by not setting the people he torchers free.A human, the way those people were treated they mise have well not have been humans at all but, animals.Did you know that 9,000,000 peopleaccording to the documentary film Nuit et Brouillard (Tr.'s Note: \\"Night and Fog\\", title used in the English-speaking world) (1955), whose historical advisers were the historian Henri Michel and the woman historian Olga Wormser-Migot."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel's novel is his own horrifying account of the Nazi death camps. He uses simple, bare prose and images to tell his story and \\"Night\\" haunted me and filled me with sadness and questions. This book has been read widely and deserves to be continually read and re-read for the lessons about fallen human nature and the spirit of perseverence in the face of great evil. This is a short book, but all the more potent for its brevity. If you have not read it, you should buy or borrow a copy immediately. There are few equals to the power of this story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie was sent into concentrarion camp when he was onle 15. he and his father were never aprt. his mother and ther siblins were seperated. he never got to see them again.

He had suffered so much and faced very hard decisions and I loved it. Everyone should give it a chance because it is a very good book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Eliezer was 15 years old when he, his sister and his parents were taken prisoner by the Nazis and deported from their home in Sighet, Transylvania, for the crime of being Jewish. Upon arrival to the concentration camp of Auschwitz, Eliezer and his father were separated from Eliezer's mother and sister, never to see them again. To survive the most inhumane conditions imaginable and to avoid immediate death, Eliezer and his father desperately tried to keep up their strength, thereby demonstrating to the Nazis their usefulness in their ability to work. Each day brought new horrors, torture, starvation, exposure, exhaustion, and illness. Constantly, death hovered over them and the other prisoners. Their challenge: how to avoid the physical and emotional damage that hastened that almost certain death.The author does a stunning job of presenting the difficult subject of the Holocaust. He follows a father and son as they move from a religiously-observant life in Transylvania to the agonizingly slow and painful experience of deportation and imprisonment in a series of concentration camps. To make this story more acceptable, the author makes it neither long nor frightfully graphic. It reads as a documentary presenting in clear detail the movements and emotions of one young man caught in an unreal world and how he suffers in his attempt to survive. What causes the greatest sadness and horror to the reader is the slow realization of the degree to which man can inflict physical and emotional pain on another human being with little or no remorse. It is a difficult lesson but one which needs to be taught, understood, and remembered by all people. Elie Wiesel begins this terrible education with Night."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I think I read &quot;NIGHT'at least 3 times. Its the kind of book you put on your bookself forever. Mr.Weisel is truly a remarkable man. His writing style is so deep and you feel you are right there with him. The things he endured in the concentration camps and the loss of his family is truly something that makes you feel your life with its little ups and downs can not compare to his loss and suffering. I truly admire Elie Weisel not only for his courage but for his determination. I recommend this book for anyone over 12. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is one of those books that needs to be read by all. The book is a first-person account of surviving the (...) Holocaust. With only 109 pages, the book is short but meaningful, saturated with horror. As I was reading it, I couldn't put it down. It's that good. With its horrifying details of life in the Holocaust, it gave me the impression that I was actually there. I felt that I was Elie going through life in the concentration camp. I could feel the misery and despair, the torture everyone went through. To read about the struggle and survival of these innocent people made me realize how fortunate I' am actually having a mattress to sleep on or stuffing my face whenever I please. I never knew that the Jewish community went through such misery. The pain of lost love ones, the pain of your body eating away the flesh until there's nothing left but bones, the mental heartbreak of not feeling worthy in the world; all this touches everyone that read this book. At times, my jaw dropped with disbelief; no way can someone go through such horror, but they did and some lived to tell it. I like this book because it shows how people had a strong will to survive. They didn't allow such mental anguish stop them from living. The book Night was a very emotional novel explaining the horror of the Holocaust. I highly recommend this to everyone because it makes you appreciate the value of life and understand the history of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"Night","review":"If you want to know what it was like to suffer under the German-Nazis, this book is for you.

I can still remember quotes from the book, the most heart wrenching being when he spoke is &quot;see his God crushed&quot;. Well, so maybe I can't remember the exact quotes. But the point is this man tells freely of being put in a ghetto, of seeing his mother and sister taken form him at the camp, and of the death marches he was forced to participate in, all with his father at his side. This amazing man is a wonderful story teller, and his language is beautiful and eloquent. A must read for anyone who is in high school or above."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I read this book for school and it was the most amazing book I've ever read. This is a TRUE account written by Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the Holocaust, and he describes every detail of the concentration camps that he had been to, such as Auschwitz. I give him SO much credit for wanting to write this book- even though he may not have wanted entirely to write it at first, he knew that the rest of the world needed to know about the Jews' terrifying experience with the Nazis. Some people believe the Holocaust never happened, but that is completely false. If you want a completely true account of the Holocaust and concentration camps, read this book- you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night by Elie Wiesel is a very real and provocative story. It's very emotional and true. The true story of Elie and his father is well documented in this little book. So compact, yet so life-changing. Elie struggles with his trust in G-d. \\"G-d is dead.\\" In the camps, people be came so desensitized, that they couldn't even bring themselves to cry for the death of a close relative. \\"To cry was to die.\\" It has changed the way I think about life and hatred. How fragile they both are... And how they simply cannot mix or the outcome will be awful. A single drop of hate can kill; thus, changing the lives of thousands (and Millions in the case of the Holocaust). I've listened to the stories that my grandmother told me about her experiences during the Holocaust. Wiesel tells the story exactly the way it happened for himself as well as countless others. Being able to relate to the book is a plus, but Night is definately meant for everyone."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book brought a lot of inspiration. I was assigned to read this book for an English class. I only had to read pages 1-20, but I could not put the book down. I had to finish it.

People will do ANYTHING for a scrap of food. Elie encounters decisions on how to survive the time at the camps. This book is very well written and describes in vivid detail of the life and gruesome fates of someone living in the concentration camps.

It taught me what it was like to be a jew and how they had to suffer everyday. Personally i don't think i could survive one day in a concentration camp like they had to. This was the first holocaust book i had ever read and i am now looking on to reading a couple more books like this one and see a little bit more about the holocaust. These types of books are very educational, and this one expecially. I think it was very hard for Elie Wiesel to remember what had happened when he was a child, and how he put in many details about his surroundings. I recommend to anyone, who wants to learn more about the sufferings of the Jews during the holocaust, this book and i hope that they enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is a book written by Elie Wiesel.

His father is very kind and thinks about others more than thinking about himself. When they were put into a concentration camps his mother and sister were sent to another concentration camp. Some concentration camps were nice and some were very mean. The boy and his father go to all the concentration camps together. The boy goes through hard tasks like being whipped twenty-five times, having to to run twenty-five miles straight without stopping and having to not eat for six days. He tried to help his dad out as much as he could. Sometimes when his dad is suffering at the end, he would give him his rations of food that he had recieved.

We were so into the book that none of us wanted to put it down. This book gave us a vivid feeling of how the Jews felt while going through the Holocaust.

This book will inspire you greatly to treat others with the same respect you would want.If you read this book and think it is good try the other recommended books.

All of his family were broken up and he knew he would never see them again. His last memory of his mom and sister was in the line splitting man from woman. People were burned up alive because they werent good enough to work. At the end of the book, Elie is the only one from his family to actually survive the war. He saw himself in the mirror for the first time after the war, he saw a corpse looking back at him. This is a great book to read and it is amazing to see what the character of the book has been through. It is important that these chain of events never happen happen again. I greatly and respectively recommend this book to all people out there to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is the remarkable work of Elie Wiesel that gained him notoriety as a writer and caused him to win the Noble Peace Prize in 1986. Originally, the book had difficulty finding a pulisher as it was found to be too depressing. Depressing as it may be, there is nothing about the Holocaust that is not depressing. It is reality.In \\"Night\\", Wiesel recalls the numerous locations that he endured as a Jew in World War II Europe. After being forced from his home to the ghetto, he was transferred to several different concentration camps. It was at the first camp that he saw his mother and sister for the last time. However, he was able to stay with his father through most of his relocation. His father only passed away near the end of the war, just a short period before the Jews were liberated.What strikes me about \\"Night\\" is the stark, cold reality presented by Wiesel. I could almost feel that cold with Wiesel as he shivers through the cold night. The physical and mental pain he felt was authentic, though he grew calloused as time passed. The emotions expressed by Wiesel are also very authentic. Even to this day, he still feels abandoned by God. How could an all powerful God allow this to happen to his people? While it is difficult for me to empathize with his anger toward God, I can certainly understand his rationale."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is an Autobiography of a man who had many horrific experiences during the Holocaust. This man went through so many pains, including losing his whole family. This book will make you cry. I loved it; it was so well written and inspiring. It inspired me to NEVER give up at anything."},{"Title":"Night","review":"One strives to find any small glint of light, one shred of humanity in all great tragedies but in this book there are none.Brutalized, dehumanized, stripped of everything but the very breath of life itself, survival is made meaningless. There are horrors too horrific to comprehend, son killing father, brother killing brother, all for a scrap of bread.There is no honor here, no pride, no dignity, no religion nothing but the eternal degradation of the damned in the darkness of the 'night'. Because in the end, even faith is lost.This is a powerful book, there is rancor and ruin and mindless violence on every page. This is not a book to be taken lightly, nor one to be forgotten"},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel has written a profound sermon on the holocaust worth the world's contemplation.\\"Night\\" is written as a novel but I have learned it contains many actual events that Wiesel witnessed as a prisoner in camps Birkenau, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald during WWII. It is vivid and stabbing in its horrible descriptions about the concentration camps. Wiesel writes about babies burning in pits, sons burning their own fathers in cremation ovens and all of the complex choices that the victims of the Holocaust faced. This book is well written, great style, penetrating descriptives and straight to the point. It is definitely not a wasted afternoon spent reading this little book with such a huge impact.I am surprised this book is not required reading in every school. With so much racial profiling still evident in the world we could all benefit from a dose of wisdom written by a man who knows first-hand the outcome of pure hatred. \\"Night\\" will shed a great light on even your darkest day."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I know this book is already acclaimed and pretty much reccommended by everyone, but I felt I had to put in my own two cents. This book was so unrelenting, so horrifying..it's not a story about an adventure. It's not a story about a hero triumphing over his villain. This book is a essentially a series of horrific and tragic events happening to a young boy, and how he survives them. As Elie Wiesel says in the novel, &quot;Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as God himself. Never.&quot; And neither should we."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Once I read Elie Wiesel's \\"Night,\\" I thought to myself, how could anyone go through an event like this and still be strong in the heart. No matter if you are Christian or Jewish, this novel is good for everyone. Wiesel's use of symbolism and themes is just outstanding. He takes the reader through the life of teenage boy, Eliezer, and his struggle through the Holocaust. One thing I really like about this novel is how it is not a historical book based on facts, it is based on the individuals who suffered through this horrific experience. If anyone wants to read about someone's true experience through a horrific event, \\"Night\\" is the best to read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have heard the question asked more than once \\"How could they just stand there and let the Holocaust happen and not fight back?\\" Elie Wiesel has answered this question along with describing his ordeal he suffered at the hands of the Nazis. The short simply written book shows the true horror when man suffers at the hand of man. He gives descritions of various moments during his concentration stay and the reader is left knowing that these moments happend all of the time to the victims. The humiliation, torture, and degradation were commonplace. More imporantly. Wiesel writes about thinking at any given moment how to survive even if it meant turning his back on his friends. He describes how various people would leave loved ones to die so they could survive themselves. Animal instinct took over when humanity failed. This is truly an imporant book of a first hand witness and should never ever be forgotten. Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have always been fascinated with the Holocaust and what happened to the Jewish people. Never have I realized the horror from such a perspective as I did when I read this book. I started reading it on a Friday morning, and I finished it that night. It was one of those books that suck you in to its life from the very beginning.Night is the true story of Elie Wiesel, a Hungarian Jew sent to concentration camp after concentration camp during World War II. It begins by telling a bit about how life was at the beginning, before the Nazis came. Then, slowly, it begins to tell of what it was like day after day, before arriving at the actual camps. It goes on to tell of the mishaps of watching his family die before his own eyes. Page after page, I couldn't stop reading. It is one of those books that catch you off guard when you start shedding tears because you feel as if you should have been able to do something to help.I recommend this book to people who have a knack for World War II or the Holocaust. It's so extraordinary that I might just read it again, just to hear the story from someone who was there."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was absolutely without a doubt exceptional! I liked the book from the first word to the last word and all points in between. I didn't dislike anything about the book. This book was very well-written and told very descriptive details about the daily events that occured during those unforgettable and tragic years of Elie's life. He painted a picture so vividly to where you was right along with him witnessing murders and beatings. If I was Elie's age, I don't think that I could have survived. Being away from my family was probably the most saddest part for him. I think Elie's purpose of publishing this book was to let people know what really happened during the Halocaust giving from a perspective of a witness. The most memorable part was when his father spoke his last words. That part was so sad. Elie possessed the courage and strength to survive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I recently read this book in one of my English class. I really enjoy reading it with my class I learned to not be a racist against other people. I learned that Elie Wiesel had a difficult life when he wrote this story, but after all Elie Wiesel success in his life. I read it all and I saw a lot of racism on this story."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I first read the book NIGHT it was one of the saddtest books that I ever read. Because It was during the world war II. I think that was one of the bad thinks that happened in those days because the NAZIS were the people that didnt like anyother race but their race. I think ELIE WIESEL is a bery brave person to tell part of his life. I think night is a terrying account of the nazi death camps horror that turns a young jewish boy named Elie Wiesel into an agonized witness to the death of his family. Night is one of the shoking memories of evil from the nazis againts the jews and other people that are not from the same color or race. Elie Wiesel for me is giving a message that this horror that he has been through must never be allowed to happen again in the world."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night , by Elie Weisel The novel Night is about a Jewish community that gets taken over by Germans during World War 2. The novel shows how the community was effected and the permotion of violence lead most of the people to their grave. Elie Weisel is was a religious boy that was about to undergo the biggest faith challenging moments of his entire life. Throughout the book he tells the truth about how he lost his faith in the jewish community and in God. At one time he goes so far as to say that there must be no God because he would not allow someone to suffer so much. I think that if one is so religious when his life is going great than maybe God was testing him outside of a perfect life. Elie also shows the way that a boy will even consider his father a burden and something that is holding him back. When the leader of the cluster of people started to beatup Elie's father Elie did nothing to protect him. He even went so far as to not want his father to make it through the ordeal. This is a perfect example of the things that a person will do to live. The novel shows a very interesting look on the germans that surprised me. The novel talks about how the jewish people invited the germans to live with them and how well educated they are as well as curdious. I would have thought that Elie would have tried to hide that story to make them sound more evil. Instead he showed that the germans were only following directions given by the dictator Adolf Hitler. The novel gives an interesting look on how there are differant things that inspire us to do good as well as bad things."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is about a fifteen years old boy who was taken with his family to the concentration camps during Hitler's rampage. He and his father were separated from his mother and sisters. He tells about life in the concentration camps and their struggle for survival. There was a scene in which Elie was watching a guard and a Polish girl through a crack in a building. She had her shirt off and he could not help himself, but to laugh. This found him getting whipped twenty-five times on his back until he passed out in front of everybody on his block. The guard told him not to tell anyone about what he saw. If he did then he would get ten times worse. There was a scene where Elie Wiesel and his father were laying on a bunk bed and he was encouraging his father to push on and to keep on trying not die. He would tell his father that they did not have much farther to go. This was near the end of the novel. He tells much of this story to a \\"beautiful young Jewish\\" girl which once encouraged him earlier. She encouraged him the same, to push on and to strive for the finish line, which was for them, the end of Hitler's reign. This was a good book. Some parts were suspenseful and some were funny. It was sad, although not as tragic as I thought it to be. In the end it was sad that his dad could not make it since they had been through so much together. I do not understand, though, how they were able to detach their feelings and relationship to family members during this time period."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book is about a fifteen year old boy who was taken with his family to the concentration camps during Hitler's rampage.

The Holocaust survivor's account of his struggle to live places a personal touch on a period of history that our youngsters know little about.

Survivor testimonies will always be the best way in which to learn about the Holocaust. I recommend this book to any serious reader."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Don't be fooled by the slimness of this book...it packs thousands of lifetimes' worth of horror, despair, suffering, and agonizingly beautiful writing. Wiesel writes concisely but heart-rendingly about his terrible experiences in the concentration camps, the cruel fates of others, and the disgusting acts humans can be capable of. Night is shocking, moving, and above all, a work of extreme cruelty and beauty. May we all learn from it - and never forget."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Few books will touch you like this one.

Straightforward and unrelenting. I had to read it in one setting because I couldn't put it down. This book deeply taps into the depths of your soul and so horrifically brings you face to face with the deepest questions of human nature and existence."},{"Title":"Night","review":"\\"Night\\" is a frightening book written by a man who saw the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand. Elie Wiesel survived years of torture, malnourishment, and dehumanizing conditions as he was forced to travel from one concentration camp to the next during the height of Nazi control. He was separated from his mother and sister and never saw them again. He watched his father gasp his last few breaths before authorities took him away during the night and disposed of him in a crematorium.This book is a scary and very real. It is like reading the words of a young boy's diary- a young boy who is frightened and appalled at the acts of violence taking place around him; a boy who cannot understand why this is taking place but knows that he must reach for every ounce of courage within him to survive this living nightmare.The scenes Wiesel describes in this book will stir up all sorts of emotions in every person who reads them. Adults, kids, and even young babies are thrown into fire pits by the Nazis. Thirsty prisoners eat snow in the hope that it will provide some thirst quenching relief. Near- naked people are forced to sleep without any protection on frigid, snowy winter nights. Wiesel describes the events vividly; going from a naive youngster to a hardened prisoner as he is sent from one camp to the next. He is sometimes emotional at first. But after witnessing so much inhumanity he becomes emotionally numb to the injustice around him.The arrival of the allied forces brought an end to the nightmare for Elie Wiesel and other prisoners. Wiesel's family members were not so lucky and he dedicates this book in memory of the three of them. He never saw his mother or sister after they were separated from him and his father so there is no way to know how they died. No one will ever know exactly how each person perished and the author doesn't offer any predictions. It really doesn't matter at this point anyway. His immediate family is gone, dead at the hands of a government out of control.This book is short, but it packs a tremendous punch. It serves as a reminder of the potential brutality of some people. And it also serves as a tribute to the human spirit: A tragic book that is also full of hope; showing how one young man was subjected to one of the most terrible human tragedies in history and lived to tell his painful story. It's a powerful read and a page turner from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This is truly the best book I have ever read. It is not long, just over 100 pages, yet it is incredibly powerful. It has scenes in it that made me close my eyes and shake my head in disbelief. I often found myself wondering, \\"Why?\\" as would anyone. Mr. Wiesel's ability to go back to such a young age and remember such atrocities is amazing. Even more so is how he was able to put it all in words without being so graphic that you could not finish the book, but still graphic enough to make you cry and to be sickened by the realization that this did indeed happen. My fifteen year old cousin just read it and she really liked it, so I'd say 14 or 15 would be a good starting age for any kid to read this and understand it. In a way I think it is a more interesting read for a student than \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" because Elie Wiesel survived the Holocaust and was able to recall it, whereas Anne did not and her words were pre-camp. I actually think the two books would be good companion pieces."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The first time I read Elie Wiesel's Night was 15 years ago, and I was 17 years old. It made quite an impact. World War Two history was sort of my \\"hobby\\" growing up, so I was already aware of what happened. I often remind people that it wasn't only 6 million Jews that died in the camps, that 6 million more of various minorities met untimely ends at the hands of the Nazis.Anyway, Mr. Wiesel's personal narrative seizes you. Every time I've read this book, it has been in one sitting. I would be surprised (and perhaps frightened) if I ever became comfortable enough with its words to put it down before finishing. Mr. Wiesel's writing put me in his place and I seem to see the night stars framed by tree branches as the march goes on. Frightening and powerful."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I thought that the book Night was really good. The author, Elie Wiesel, told his story so well that I could picture everything in my mind while I was reading. I'm glad I read this book because it was about the Holocaust and I have learned about the Holocaust, so it was interesting to read.The book is a true story about the author, Elie Wiesel, and his life before the Holocaust and in the Concentration Camps. He was thirteen years old living in Sighet, Transylvania when the Hungarian police set up two ghettos for the Jews. Elie and his mother, father, and two sisters were in the last group to be taken from the ghetto to the concentration camps. Elie describes his train trip and what he sees at Auschwitz. When they arrived at Auschwitz, Elie and his father were separated from his mother and sisters. After that you heard nothing more of the mother and sisters. Elie and his father spent two years at Auschwitz then went to Buchenwald. He was at Buchenwald until it was liberated.The book is very good, but I wouldn't recommend it if you get grossed out or upset easily because there is a lot of detail in the book. If you like history and you don't get grossed out or upset easily, then I would recommend this book. If you read this book there is a second book called, Dawn that you should also read."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book should be required reading in any class that even remotley covers the issue of the Holocaust. Wiesel offers insight into the absolute horror that was this terrible period of history. He brings you into the world he experienced and almost makes you feel as if you were there and thankful that you were not. However, I say \\"almost.\\" There is no way any of us could understand what he and those millions of others experienced. Not one of them came out alive. Even those who did not perish had their lives taken from them. And not even the most powerful of earthly judges could give it back to them. The stories of fathers and sons fighting over bread. Of fathers and sons having no will to care if the other lived or died. Of husbands looking at their wives for the final time and not having the benefit of knowing that it would be the last time. Being robbed of their last chance to simply say goodbye. If you think you are having a bad day or life all together, take the little time it requires to read this book. I doubt you will still feel the same way afterward."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night By Elie WieselA ReviewElie Wiesel's account of his terrifying trials he experienced during the Holocaust are chronicled in his memoir titled Night. In his bone chilling and often gruesome chronicles the reader seems to be there with Elie as the blows from his oppressors rain down upon him. Elie Wiesel brings us back to the chaos of World War II with his very detailed and descriptive writing style. Night is both a terrifying and beautiful book. As we journey through the various nazi concentration camps with young Elie we are treated to horrifying memories and a tale of triumph over evil and unsurmountable odds.It is late 1944 and as the western front is pushed back upon Poland young Elie Wiesel and his family become embroiled in the conflict. Being Jewish, as the Reich initiates the &quot;Final Solution&quot;plan Elie's life is turned upside down. Him and his family are carted off to the Warsaw ghetto where brutality becomes a day to day occurrence. Elie and his fellow jews are savagely beaten and degraded by the nazi forces. After his terrible time in the Warsaw ghetto him and his family are loaded onto cattle cars and taken to Auschwitz; an infamous death camp. Along the way they see people breakdown and come to the realization there is no hope for them, all is lost. Once at Auschwitz Elie being only fifteen years old is separated from his mother and sisters forever. What follows is a struggle is a struggle of obstacles him and his disenfranchised father must overcome. It is a very tragic reality that Elie Wiesel had to face.As aforementioned, often times the brutal experiences are almost to hard to read. This book is not for those who are weak of heart. The brutal and blunt accounts are sometimes emotionally draining and very hard to read. For example, when Elie recounts the day a young boy was hung in Birkenau he tells of how he struggled and fought against asphyxiation for hours eventually dying in the end due to massive trauma to the head inflicted upon him by a camp guard. On the other side though, if you are into history or find stories about triumph and tragedy interesting this is the perfect choice.Amongst the terrifying imagery displayed in this book there is great triumph. Elie faces oppression and all the odds stacked against him, yet prevails. It is very inspiring to read about someone who faces certain death and loses everything he holds dear only to prevail in the long run. Mr. Wiesel survived the horror only to write this book and inspire and motivate many readers. It is also an excellent story because through Wiesel's intense writing you feel like you the reader are there in the camp with him. Elie Wiesel is an excellent writer and through his journalistic approach we learn a lot about the tragedy he faced during the Holocaust.Night is an exceptional read, sometimes hard to read it deals with tragedy and teaches us how to prevent it. It is a very inspirational account about a young boy who quickly matures as he experiences the worst of humanity head on.Mrs. Clynckes English 12Justin, Zach, Kevin, Steve, AndrewOctober 15th, 2001"},{"Title":"Night","review":"NIGHT by Elie Wiesel has to be the most disturbing autobiography I have ever read. It was only 107 pages, yet with all of the brutality inflicted upon the Jewish community by the Nazis, it just seemed longer. The torture boggled my mind and left me dazed. Mr. Wiesel has my ultimate respect for being able to surive such a tramatic experience. Such conditions would have cracked many strong men, but he was blessed to be able to survive and share his story with the world. His is a spirit of strength and this is a story that will not be forgotten."},{"Title":"Night","review":"It is true that anyone who didn't experience the holocaust will never be able to truly understand it. What people become when killed every way but physically, and what people become when given the power to kill without discression is of paramount importance for us to understand. Mr. Wiesel sheds light on the moving forces behind the people of the holocaust through his own experiences. This book gives a short lasting view of the horrors of the camp, but an unforgetable sense of the loss and tragedy suffered by everyone involved. I suggest you read it."},{"Title":"Night","review":"NightBy Elie WieselHas anyone ever thought about what the Jews went through? I never did until I read the book Night by Elie Wiesel. I liked Night, and I didn't like Night. I really liked the way Wiesel used irony, and his plot, I like how he used imagery, I like the way he makes u see it.Through out the book Wiesel used irony, like on page 57 Wiesel wrote \\"Every bomb that exploded filled us with joy and gave us a new confidence in life.\\" Every time I read this I can see all the Jews that had went through so much and every one of them had a little grin on there faces, seeing the Nazis where being bombed.After Wiesel arrived at Auschwitz imagery was used quite often, in one section it said \\"there was an abominable odor floating in the air.\\" (Wiesel, 25). Just the way that is written makes me want to plug my nose, and I image what was going through all the Jews minds about the smell.I really like who the story flows, the very last sentence of the book was a breath taker, and it read \\"the look in his eyes, as they stared into mine, has never left me.\\" (Wiesel, 109). In this sentence he is talking about him self in the mirror, after seeing him self for the first time since leaving the ghetto, and what is says is how he is free from Auschwitz, but what happened there at Auschwitz will always be.When I got fished reading Night I was amazed by the ways Wiesel used Irony, I also liked the was he planed his plot, and hoe it flowed so smoothly, the way he wrote made you see it not just read it, and that's what makes a good book, I don't understand how the Russians could treat the Jewish people the way they did. How people could be killed with no mercy. Night made it easy to see how 6 million people could be killed in around 10 years. The book made it easy to imagine, your own father dieing right before your eyes."},{"Title":"Night","review":"PEOPLE THINK THE HOLOCAUST WAS FAKE AND OTHERS KNOW IT WAS REAL LIKE ME MY GRANDMA WAS IN IT SHE WAS AT AUSCHWITZ.I NO HOW IT WAS AND WHAT THE DID TO THEM.

I GIVE IT A 5 BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading this story, it almost seems like it could never have happened. The way that the horrible things are portrayed in this story makes you feel for the people in the story. the ways that they deal with their personal struggles and bleifs toward God is insane. They start out with good morale and high hopes. At the end of the story there is no more will for the people to live and most have discarded their religion saying, \\" How could our God do this to us after we devote our entire beings to him?\\" the transformation that these people undergo would kill most people. In the story, people had to go on to save themselves and eachother. Sons relied on fathers and fathers relied on sons. They had to because there was nothing left for them to keep them alive."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I believe this is one of the most interesting and descriptive books I have ever read. Elie Wiesel, a survivor of the holocaust, tells about the horrific events that went on during the holocaust. In certain parts of the book he tells us event that he witnessed in so much detail, for an example he tells us about how he saw people, including babies, being tossed into a pit of fire alive, to hopefully show the reader how horrifying the holocaust was so that it can never happen again. That is the reason I give this book a 5 out of 5 because it isn't just a story, it is a book that is trying to teach us something, trying to tell us not to allow the holocaust to ever happen again. I also recommend you to read Night because it shows you, at least it showed me, how lucky our lives are and not to throw it away. We may think we have it bad just because a couple things are wrong but make it the best anyways because anything is better than living in a death camp."},{"Title":"Night","review":"After reading this book, I feel I have a deeper understanding of the Holocaust, even though I know that I'll never be able to fully comprehend the horrors that took place.

This book starts off with a boy who meets a guy that has seen Germans killed Jewish babies burning in oven, Germans throwing babies up in the air to use them as a target to shoot. At first know believed him, but after 2 years, the worst thing happened to the Jewish. The Germans were using the Jewish people to work and just suffer.He was a Jewish boy when he was to Aushwits. He could still remember the nights of working and seeing people suffering. and the only thing, he could still question god Why did it happened? When the War happened, his family and him were sent to Aushwits. In there his mother and his sisters were burned alive and his father and him were to send in a camp to work. The camp was huge and that is why there were many people. After few months and years the Jewish boy was seeing people that he knew. Some just gave up to live and some just suffer and waited till it was over. Maybe there were devils sent to the German's body, maybe there was no god, and because there were no help for those who suffered, they prayed to god. It was a hateful thing to this boy, that he was seeing people praying for him. He no longer believed in god his belief in god was vanished when he was suffering. He could never understand. ....This book is a very interesting book written by a great author name \`Elie Wiesel.' This book is a true story and I assure that it is an excellent book written. &#60;This is an Holocaust book&#62;"},{"Title":"Night","review":"There are movies and plays and novels and non fiction accounts of the Holocaust. Everyone knows Anne Frank and Schindler. This author was there and young and survived and put it down on paper so well that you can taste it. What he conveys about how poorly people can treat one another and how simply and luckily one can survive is haunting. The book was so short I read it in a few hours; so intense and alive that, years later, I always think of it when I see pictures of war or hear talk of war. On a side note, Wiesel's writings/interpretations on current events are usually amongst the most thoughtful & aware ideas in print."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Elie Wiesel is a survivor of Auschwitz and details his experience in this book. Elie was not only a young man when he was taken to Auschwitz but a young man who lost his innocence and childhood. Elie and his family was Jewish and that was the reason for their imprisonment. True story and the book goes into great detail about his experience, feelings and horror that occurred."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I gave this four stars only to ensure the rating is not pulled down unfairly by the worst reader I've ever heard.I listen to audiobooks all the time, have probably listened to 400 or so. This reading was so horrendously over-acted that it:1. hurt my ears when he over-acted his plaintive cries, going from soft low volume to loud screeching.2. was so unbelievable that at one point I reacted by thinking \\"This isn't true!\\" Then I realized I was judging the truth of a story from the unbelievable tone of the reader, who is not the author. (I had the same reaction when I listened to Linda Smith on TV crying about her kids at the murder scene, at the time when everyone thought she was the victim. I was so struck with disbelief that I proclaimed out loud to the TC, \\"She did it!\\" The point being that one can judge truth by tone of voice.) Then I further realized what a disservice this is to a book about the holocaust, that this terrible (over-)actor would lead people to react in disbelief, exactly where no right-thinking person wants a listener to a book about the holocaust to be led.0 stars for the reading, and it so overcame any possible absorption in the story, that I can't fairly give a rating on the story itself, maybe 4 stars, maybe 5, I don't know, I'd have to *read* the book."},{"Title":"Night","review":"what an honest author. he had a difficult life that most people would choose to forget rather than share."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The short novel Night has emotional power not only because of the dark subject matter, but because Elie Wiesel is a gifted writer who deftly reveals the spiritual and mental anguish of the main character. Generally considered autobiographical, the account follows a young man who feels he is losing not only God, but his humanity as the Nazi machine ravages Europe. The novel itself deserves 10 stars.However, the original translation deserves -1. Wiesel's skill as an author is blurred by a clumsy translation. The worst part is when the translator chose the lighthearted \\"siesta\\" as a description of Wiesel's first sleep in the labor camp. There is a much better translation out today by Marion Wiesel, and its worth the extra few dollars. This book is more than worth reading; buy the better translation, and you'll understand why Wiesel deserved not just the Nobel Peace Prize, but also the Literature Prize."},{"Title":"Night","review":"The book Night by Elie Wiesel was definatly a book I would recamend for a person that wants to know more about the Holocaust. The book contains alot of tear dropping momments. I would give the book Night five stars.In the book Night there is a family,a mom, dad, and two kids, that is tortured and most of them are killed. It begins with the Nazis puting the jews of the town into what they called \\"The Ghetto\\". Then they moved them to Germany where they were forced to work and put to death by fire or gas if they were children or not good enough. They had little to eat which was not enough for most to say alive. The prisoners of the camp had to run miles to get from concentration camp to another camp. Most prisoners were shot from being to slow and others just past away from their sicknesses. The prisoners push the limits to stay alive hoping to be free."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Night is the ugliest book I've ever read. It's so horrifying because it's telling the truth, the truth told by someone who lived it all. Elie Wiesel took us on an honest journey to the monstrosities of the Holocaust through his own eyes. The novel may be quite short, but it is shockingly powerful.This is not a story for kids interested in learning about the Holocaust. You have to reach a certain maturity and have a certain knowledge on the topic before even thinking about opening this book, because it's so great it would be a shame if someone read it and didn't yet understand it.The story is written in first person and is basically an account of Elie's experiences as a child before and during World War II. How no one in the town believed they would be mistreated for being Jews was particularly depressing, because you just knew what was coming for them, and it most definitely wasn't something nice.Elie's descriptions are very, very graphic and gruesome. After reading just a few pages of the novel, I found it very hard to sleep at night. You simply get all the details - and sometimes they're just too much and you wonder how anyone could have lived through that. It's an outstanding book as it awakens people and really makes them reflect on what the Holocaust really was.Apart from the remarkable story, Wiesel is a great author and even a greater person, for all he's done to support human rights throughout the world. Wiesel's writing was very clear and simply very, very good and extremely powerful. It's no wonder his books have become so popular today.Read Night. You won't be the same person ever again."},{"Title":"Night","review":"I have read this book countless times because it is a monumental piece of literature. However, I tried to order a hardback copy for myself and Amazon couldn't get it for me. For that, I am unhappy."},{"Title":"Night","review":"For decades after the Holocaust, the fact that it ever happened was often vehemently denied, its existence certainly dubitable. There were horror stories, of course; but Germany was far away, and during war, weren't there always? As time passed, many survivors, seeing the ignorance of such an earth-shattering atrocity, began to open up and tell their stories. Since then, and particularly since Steven Spielberg's documentaries and films on the era, there has been a preponderence of literature, film, and scholarship concerning the brutal murder of eleven million people. Children read these stories. They have a common theme and common plot. They are always imbued with a certain sense of horror--and yet, the horror is not real. It is a story. A persistently repetitive tale, certainly *true*, but to the reader, not real. Wiesel's Night, a seamless merging of his own experiences and outstanding metaphorical plotting, is not one of these stories.Night is not a book for a child. Night is not a book for those who remain children at heart. It slaughters that child. 106 short pages sear through the pathos and emotional manipulation to the raw and brutal core of what the Holocaust is and was. There is no weeping over lost family here--there is a dull void throbbing for the loss of a soul that would have allowed one to weep. There is no pity, there is no food, and there is no God. No paragraph is wasted--each effectively cuts to an essential truth, a cruel irony, an undeniable fate. Wiesel is a master of words, and it shows. His spare prose leaves no room for comfort. You will be shocked. You will cry. You may feel sick. At the end you will perhaps be left with a small portion of his understanding of the enormity of this tragedy, as well as the savage nature of humanity. Probably the most moving account of the Holocaust that exists today."},{"Title":"Night","review":"No matter how much I think I know about the horror of the Holocaust during World War II, whenever I read an unknown view my disbelief and disgust continues to grow. This especially holds true with Elie Wiezel's personal account of this terrible time in his life. Wiezel is a teenage boy who goes through the journey that we have become familiar with. His family endures the infamous Star of David armbands, Jewish ghettos, and the crowded train ride that leads them to their fate. The family is separated at the first concentration camp, Auschwitz. Elie is able to stay with his father as him mother and sisters are ushered away, most likely to the crematories that are blazing and smoking of human flesh. As Elie and his father are being moved, Elie loses his faith with each step. As he watched young children being burned alive, his God was murdered forever. This is such a significant part of the book because it shows the incredible impact that only one night had on this boy. This boy who was so completely devoted to his religion and faith, but lost it all after one night in a concentration camp. After this night, staying with his father and getting food were the two most important things to Elie, in that order. As the time wore on, Elie began to find himself hoping for freedom from his father's burden. This also shows how the Holocaust tore people down until they could care about nothing. Elie Wiezel lived to tell his story and people should definitely take the opportunity to see through his eyes. It's hard to read and a difficult subject matter, but it opens up people's eyes. I have deep appreciation for this book but it would have had a larger impact if the book were longer."},{"Title":"Night","review":"When I was in high school 20 years ago, various books were required reading during those 4 years.

It is a mournful, yet truthful story of terrible and horrific events.Some critics remark that the book is \\"too grotesque\\" for readers, but the pains of the past must be realized than be avoided.This book is recommended for high schoolers and older, and certainly not for children due to excessive brutality."},{"Title":"Night","review":"Book Review: NightI have yet to read a book that is filled with more passion and reality than \\"Night.\\" This novel is written by Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, who writes holocaust literature and who has won the Nobel peace prize for literature. This novel is emotional and full of passion and terror as the words and thoughts of the young Eliezer (narrator of the story) fill your thoughts, mind, and heart. This novel, like a lot of other Holocaust literature forces the reader to question humanity and in some ways forces one to look within themselves to find answers to some the most fundamental questions within humanity. This novel could easily be considered a work of horror and fiction as the actions of one human being to another are laid out on the pages of this book it is surreal the level of injustice and cruelty that is possible to be bestowed from one human being to another. The novel, \\"Night,\\" is narrated by a Jewish teenager named Eliezer. Eliezer lives in the town of Sighet, Hungary in Transylvania. Eliezer and his family have a good life living in the small town of Sighet. He consistently studies the Torah and Kabala. His family is very close including his mother, father, and his younger sister. In 1944 the Nazis occupy Hungary and begin to suppress the Jewish communities in various ways. Some examples of the suppressive measures that were used against them were creating curfews, making them wear a badge identifying themselves as Jewish, and not allowing them to own businesses or property. Soon ghettos were created for all Jews and they were put in those ghettos and watched as they were then separated from others in the world around them by massive brick walls that kept them inside the ghettos and others in the town out. Eliezer and the other Jews in his community are soon after that carried off in cattle cars in route to Auschwitz. Eliezer and his father are separated from his mother and sister and the nightmare begins for them. They are all evaluated to determine their usefulness for those who were old, debilitated, or handicapped in any way they were separated from the general population and sent to the furnace or gas chamber. They are hauled between various camps until finally arriving in Auschwitz. Eliezer and his father are forced to watch the hanging, beatings, and cruelty that others are subjected to and Eliezer is forced to watch his father die in camp after a series of illnesses.Eliezer tells of the most horrific conditions and of new born babies being carried in by the truck loads and used as target practice by Nazis with shot guns. Also, of huge trenches and mile long ditches where the bodies of babies who were either hung and/or shot and discarded. The narrator tells the story of sons being forced to throw their aging or ailing fathers into the death furnace if only to save their own lives they all completed the task. As the story unfolds and becomes history the Jews are soon liberated but not before millions of Jews, handicap, and minorities are executed by the Nazis. This book is filled with so much depth that it is almost impossible to give the novel true justice in written description alone or on any real level. This novel is a true must read for anyone interested in Holocaust literature, philosophy, psychoanalysis, or religion."},{"Title":"Night","review":"This book was very great.

This book is very touching and it helps visualize what it was like for the Jews at the concentration camps. It was so hard for them to live in these camps and try to survive. The Jews did not even know if they were going to be living the next day. They just had to hope for the best and not be stupid to stay alive.It is a great book to read if you do not know much about the concentration camps or the Nazis. I did not know much about either of them before I read this book. Now I have learned so much just from reading this book. It actually made me realize how hard it was to live then.

Upon hearing that the publishers Dodd, Mead, and Company were holding a contest for the best North American novel she decided to return to Winnipeg Manitoba and devote herself to winning the prize. From her rented room, she completed the draft of Wild Geese in a mere six weeks. Her submission beat out 1,389 competitors to win, and became her first of many published novels.Wild Geese is the story of the Gares, a very secluded rural family that is presided over by the tyrrannical father/husband Caleb Gare. He subjects them to what can only be described as daily slavery... fiercely suppressing anything that does not contribute to his maniacal tilling of the land. Because of Caleb's selfish need for constant control and domination of others, freedom of expression is not allowed in the Gare household. But this does not set well at all for his fiery tigress of a daughter (Judith) and their live-in schoolteacher Lind Archer. Together, these two women represent the hope of passion, the power of beauty, and the occasional whiff of perfume amidst the manure of Caleb's machinations. Will he be able to ultimately thwart his daughter's freedom? Will Caleb be able to destroy Lind's lover with the terrible secret that only he and his wife know about? Not until the VERY last pages do we really know the answers to those questions, and Ostenso does a great job of keeping the reader interested up to that point and beyond.She is very much in the style of Willa Cather who also wrote of the windswept plains of the early 1900's.

This is James Scott Bell at his best."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"When Paula, the famous actress, leaves Mark, the struggling actor, for a famous director, it seems like a story straight out of Hollywood, because we see it all the time. James Scott Bell takes us behind the scenes in Breach of Promise to see the story from the distraught husband.Mark still loves Paula and can't comprehend why she would destroy their family. To make matters worse, Paula will resort to any method to gain custody of their daughter. This is a powerful book on many levels, but for me, the most powerful is the forgiveness that Mark displays toward Paula. It seems like an entire book could be written on the subject of a jilted husband forgiving an adulterous wife. That kind of forgiveness is easy to talk about but next to impossible to practice."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"Paula and Mark have a five year old daughter and seem to have a perfect marriage. Yet they live in Hollywood, a land where bigger dreams and aspirations have crushed many marriages.James Scott Bell tackles the subject of marriage, adultery, divorce and child custody in the novel A Breach of Promice.Paula gets the break of a lifetime, a chance to work with world famous director Tony Troncati. She is gone for four months while Mark is at home taking care of their daughter. Paula returns and tells Mark she wants a divorce and that she is now going to live with Tony. Then she takes Maddie, the daughter, too. Breach of Promise is powerful because it is easy to relate too for most people. I'm the same age as Mark and I have 2 kids and it tore me apart to see his wife leaving him and taking his daugther because I knew how mad/angry/sad I would be if the same thing happened to me.Mark is devestated that Paula has left him, and even more crushed when she takes Maddie from him and then battles him for custody. Of course, Paula can afford the best lawyers money can buy, and soon Paul is overwhelmed with legal problems. Bell keeps the bad news piling on Mark, forcing Mark to turn half-heartedly to God and a group of friends at a church for help. To give the reader hope that Mark has a chance, Bell throws in bits and pieces that Mark could potentially use to get his daughter back and possibly even save his family.The entire story is from Mark's point of view, so one key thing left out is the how Paula was able to justify tearing up her family to be with the famous director. But it is believable to see how she got caught up in the typical Hollywood romance. Because of the point of view, the reader also never gets a good insight into why Paula allowed her daughter to be manipulated in order to destroy Mark. However, knowing what one knows about the seductive powers of fame, the reader can infer that Paula would do anything to please her new flame. Breach of Promise is a great book by Bell. The ending is sweet, as some reviewers have said, but it also left me wondering if I would have the strength to do what Mark did. Hopefully I'll never have to find out."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"This book amazed me because it's written from a man's perspective, yet I really got into the character. In fact, I was trying not to sob at the end. It touched me really deeply.I loved the suspence of wondering what was going to happen.

I was sad it ended. Where's a sequel?"},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"After having read many books by James Scott Bell, and being extremely pleased with his mysteries, I was surprised to experience a complete \\"downer\\" in this book. All the way through the book, I felt uncomfortable. The book was told in the first person which made the main character's feelings even more depressing. The ending seemed contrived to bring to an end a horrible situation in only a few pages. I would not recommend this book to anyone as it left me feeling that life was \\"ugly\\" and hardly worth living."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"I enjoyed the first person writing as it gave me a good feel for the main character. Having experienced a situation where someone I knew had their child kidnapped by the other parent who took the child to another state--I could identify with the hostile parties in the book. I think the book teaches a great lesson on faith and forgiveness. Not all Christians have come to faith simply by hearing the Gospel. With some it's a tough process and God works through tough situations to reach them."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"I have read other books by this author and enjoyed them very much. That said, this is the worst book I have ever read all the way through, well mostly. I gave up and scanned the last 20% of the book and only because one of the previous reviews mentioned the unbelievable ending.The characters were poorly developed and unbelievable. Not even caricatures could be as shallow as this bunch.The courtroom scenes were melodramatic and untrue to life. The anger of the father character was totally unrealistic for a man genuinely trying to get custody or visitation with his child.This ranks in the top 5 of the worst books I've ever read.Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"Tight indeed are the bonds of love. Love drives lovers to act irrationally, spontaneously, defensively, protectively. Betrayal devastates and separates.

Hands of love always reach to hold what they should not be forced to release."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"With scenes that move, dialogue that cuts, and nostalgic references to classic movies and actors, expect to be drawn into the world of Mark Gillen from the first sentence. A struggling actor and father, here's a man who doesn't have it all together. He has doubts. He makes mistakes. He's even tempted to hit the bottle. A real-life guy, thrust into the fight of his life.Having read all of Jim's contemporary novels, I can confidently say that BREACH OF PROMISE features some of his best writing. There's enough action in the nasty custody battle Mark faces to please Jim's legal thriller fans (several of the scene endings simply FORCE you to read on), while the sweet contemporary storyline of Mark's love for his five-year-old daughter will satisfy those who might have only read Jim's tamer Shannon Saga or Trials of Kit Shannon series.Go ahead.

I know I will now be able to better empathize with those who have gone through it themselves."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"I am not a huge fan of contemporary fiction of any kind, but James Scott Bell's book gripped me right from the beginning. I appreciated the realness of the story -- the main character's emotions are just what any other human being could identify with. The writing is fresh and witty. This is definitely a read again book for me."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"I loved this book and I think it would be a great movie. The characters are more realistic than many books you read today. The situation that Mark face are like many we face in our lives today. Many of us struggle with loving someone and them not loving us in return. I could actually visualize the characters in this book as a real family that I knew.Mark was a loving father and husband but his wife did not know if she loved him the same way. She discovered she was pregnant and did not want the baby. Mark was crushed and talks her into carring the baby through. Once Maddie is born, Mark's life was never the same. He was a wonderful father and would go to the ends of the earth for her. The only thing that Mark is not capable of doing is landing a lead role in an acting position as like is wife who becomes a star overnight. She has an affair on him while in Rome with the director and comes back to take Maddie away from Mark. Now Mark faces so many obsitcles in his life that many of us can relate too. His wife files for a divorce and accuses him of being abusive to her and her daughter. Mark is forced into a deep hole in which he seeks God to help him in his darkest hour. It takes Mark several tries before he accepts God's view on things. However he stays strong and fights for his daughter. The book goes on to further explain the everyday life problems that many of us know so well. I'm not going to spoil the ending but it is an awesome book. It is very intertaining and never a dull moment. This book kept me on the edge of my seat as I rooted for Mark to suceed.Many of us face problems in our lives and we fail to listen or spend any time with God, when God is the only answer to our problems. Allow God to work in your life and watch your life change and the blessing to pour in."},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"One of the things I like about Bell is his honest approach toward writing. Having been involved in a custody dispute myself in the past, it is easy for me to identify with the main character. Men have a history (sadly) of being biased against when placed on opposing ends of the family courtroom.Without spoiling the ending; suffice it to say that if you are looking for a warm fuzzy conclusion, you might not find it. Bell is a stickler for reality, and he delivers in this book. Through faith in God and devotion to his child, the main character finds strength that he never knew existed. In the end, the final pages will, if nothing else, give you pause....and a deeper faith!"},{"Title":"Breach of Promise","review":"James Scott Bell's writing gets better with every book of his I read.

Mr. Bell's background makes this excellent story credible, with knowledge and passion. The creation of interesting books and characters--combining suspense within a theme of a strong Christian faith--is a very positive direction, I believe. While, in my opinion, Terri Blackstock remains No. 1 in this special genre, Mr. Bell (who lends a \\"male view\\") and others are right on track.

And, unfortunately, the end result is rarely dependent upon the quality or force of argument made by the author, but rather entirely dependent upon the notions with which the reader entered the &quot;discussion&quot;.Knowing this, it seems that one has to be of a particular mindset in order to enjoy the novels collected in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath and Other Writings 1938-1941&quot;. The novels of this compilation attack many of the ideals upon which this country was founded -- and they do so by looking closely at those who have never really benefited from those ideals. This attack is carried out most effectively in the most prominent of the packaged novels: Steinbeck's classic &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot;At an abstract level, this particular novel is an impassioned plea for change ... one that left many readers at the time of its publication both angry and frightened, and resulted in the book being placed on many academic &quot;Banned&quot; lists, and caused Steinbeck himself to be branded by some as anti-American.That said, it is my opinion that &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of the best novels ever written, because it tells the story of those most affected by the Great Depression - those who never had much in the first place. In particular, it focuses on the Joad family as they are forced to relocate to California, to try to find enough work to put food on the table. Along with thousands of other displaced sharecroppers they are lured by colorful handbills advertising great jobs for all. California becomes Mecca to the families, many of whom have literally been forced out of their homes. Desperate, the families sell all of their belongings, buy cheap cars, and begin the arduous journey. Many do not make it, and those who do find to their dismay that all is not as promised.This is an extremely powerful novel. The reader comes to know the members of the Joad family and their friends as people, not just as characters in a story. We are able to identify with them as they suffer hardship after hardship. Written in an accessible style, and spellbinding throughout, this novel is certainly a deserving classic, and it dominates this excellent new collection of Steinbeck's fiction."},{"Title":"John Steinbeck: The Grapes of Wrath and Other Writings 1936-1941: The Grapes of Wrath, The Harvest Gypsies, The Long Valley, The Log from the Sea of Cortez (Library of America)","review":"I, like many, first read this _The Grapes of Wrath_ in high school. Then, it piqued a great curiosity about recent (this century) American history that my teachers could never satisfy. A recent re-reading, however, has shown me the great depth that I missed the first time. Read it slowly, savor the dogged, determined hopelessness that was life for many of our immediate ancestors. From the sad beginning to the desperate ending, it will teach you, and reach you."},{"Title":"John Steinbeck: The Grapes of Wrath and Other Writings 1936-1941: The Grapes of Wrath, The Harvest Gypsies, The Long Valley, The Log from the Sea of Cortez (Library of America)","review":"It is surely a shame that Mr. Steinbeck forever will be confined to the archipelago of socio-economico-political literature. Too often a smug reviewer writes of Steinbeck's &quot;moving&quot; portrayal of the Joad family and their struggle against a growing America. &quot;Oh, how I can 'identify' with the Preacher!&quot; HUMBUG. Mr. Steinbeck wrote words, not ideas. His art is exquisite and melodious and stock-full of imagery. His structure, even in the volumunious Grapes, is compact and economical. His style, even in the scientific Log, is artistic and exact. And his ideas, even in the idea-ed Harvest, are irrelevant. Buy this book. But don't buy it because the blurb on the back says something about the Joads being an American archetype of the twentieth century; instead, buy it because it is literature - American literature - at its finest. Every sentence. Every word."},{"Title":"John Steinbeck: The Grapes of Wrath and Other Writings 1936-1941: The Grapes of Wrath, The Harvest Gypsies, The Long Valley, The Log from the Sea of Cortez (Library of America)","review":"This is classic literature from one of America's great writers. In high school I was required to read The Grapes of Wrath for my literature class. At the time I liked the novel but did not really appreciate how timeless and what an epic it was.Recently my family and I bought a cattle ranch in far west Oklahoma and I was introduced to what happened in the Dust Bowl depression time.I had to buy this book and read again about the Great Depression and families moving from the dust bowl in an attempt to find a better life. The Grapes of wrath is a fictitious story but the master genius writer John Steinbeck uses many many actual facts and events that really happened in the depression.His writing style is so richly descriptive and thought provoking Steinbeck eventually received a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. John Steinbeck a true American writing genius. Shortly after The Grapes of Wrath was published many schools and colleges banned it as being too controversial and creating too strong emotions and being un american.We see families out of work during the depression and starving. Banks are taking their homes and farms because they cant make the payments. Its affecting tens of millions of people. Catastrophic. We do see some of the good things in people doing what little sharing and charity they can. However there is much evil in the hearts of many man and women. Hundreds of thousands of agriculture advertisements are given out to people in the Dust Bowl states to come to California (the land of milk and honey) to get picking produce work in the fields. Poor farming techniques by farmers have left the land without nutrients and unable to hold the valuable topsoil in the Midwest states. The wind just blows the topsoil away and a barren non producing dust bowl is left. Millions flee to California to try to get work in the fields. Its a total rip off. The big ag companies just wanted unlimited cheapest labor. These people are starving and the big ag companies say Ill pay you 20cents/hr to pick. Competition pickers said Ill pick for 10cents/hour. Some said 5 cents per hour etc. etc. Then the big farmers only kept the best pickers that could pick the most and paid them the least. This was all a sham to get the cheapest labor. Then there is the ultimate horror. There are tons and tons of produce grown that the big ag companies can not sell at a profit. They deliberately throw kerosene on mountains of perfectly good food and light it. Starving desperate families watch this. People are left to starve.After reading this book one thinks maybe another Great Depression could happen. We may be skating financially on very thin ice in this country. Try to prepare a little just in case the unthinkable happens again.This story is about change and man eventually doing better for his fellow man. Its a powerful story that really gets you thinking about what people are capable of for good and for evil.The other stories in this collection are excellent too but The Grapes of Wrath is the one everyone remembers and will be a classic forever. Now I know why it was required reading in high school literature 40 years ago. INMO every family library should have at least 10 pieces of classic literature. This John Steinbeck collection is one of them. 5 star"},{"Title":"John Steinbeck: The Grapes of Wrath and Other Writings 1936-1941: The Grapes of Wrath, The Harvest Gypsies, The Long Valley, The Log from the Sea of Cortez (Library of America)","review":"My son is into the older books by writers that he's heard about but never read....this arrived in time for Christmas and he has enjoyed it very much...."},{"Title":"John Steinbeck: The Grapes of Wrath and Other Writings 1936-1941: The Grapes of Wrath, The Harvest Gypsies, The Long Valley, The Log from the Sea of Cortez (Library of America)","review":"grapes of wrath is a great book. it is about a family that goes through ups and downs every chapter. and a man who wats to get his family back on track, cause his father lost his farm land in Oklahoma.

The story is set in the Ming Dynasty, sometime after the rule of the great emperor of Yangle, but \\"his successors had grown weak, until now the whole country was again facing disaster\\"(Bosse 89). Lao Hong, 15, the younger brother, is \\"born under the sign of the Tiger...People declared that in every respect young Hong was true to his birth sign\\"(1). Hong is reckless, loyal, hot-tempered, compassionate, and with little respect for authority. Throughout the book, Hong showed all these personalities. Lao Chen, 17, the older brother, was born under the sign of the ox, which made him \\"patient and stubborn, with a gift for language\\"(1). His language is very advanced and sophisticated. Chen often uses poetry to try to prove a point in an argument. They live in a poor village in Sichuan. Their mother has died before the book starts, and their father has become a drunk and a gambler. In the beginning, Hong, knowing his family is poor and that order to take Chen to the examinations in order to be a scholar, fights with crickets and wins a match, earning them a sizeable sum of silver. Chen has already placed first in the county examinations, and received the rank \\"Flowering Talent\\". Before they set out on their journey, many villagers entrust them with important letters that will prove to be pivotal to the story.The set out for their trip, to Chendu, the provincial capital, knowing well that they may never return to their village. They walk steadily for two weeks, and they meet a man one night during their stay at a barn, who tells them that a famine wiped out his whole family. This exposes to the brothers the horrors of the countryside. While walking one day, they notice locusts, and Chen fears that they might migrate to their village, killing everyone. Hong tries to comfort Chen, but he continues to think about Daiyun, a girl back home. They finally reach Chengdu, and while they were waiting to take the exam, Chen notices that he is young for someone who is taking a provincial exam. Most men have been trying for a long time. They meet a man in his thirties in their lodgings, Shen Ding. Chen goes to the examination compound and takes it with great confidence, even though at first, he feels, in his cell, that he is trapped. He always finishes first with everything written perfect. On the last day, Shen Ding tells Chen to bribe the grader, but out of respect for Confucius and suspicion, Chen does not. Later he learns that all those who bribed were banned permanently. In the meantime, Hong has delivered a letter written by his schoolmaster to Ye Pan, a barber. The barber reveals that he is a member of a secret society called the \\"White Lotus\\". That society is trying to restore the Mandate of Heaven that they believe, the Ming emperor has already lost. Hong is both mystified and scared. He however, wants to join it if his brother succeeds. Chen finds out that he placed fifth--a recommended man. He is invited to a huge banquet, and Hong is initiated on the same night.They next head out for Chongqing, next to the great Chang Jiang. They use a junk to get to their next destination--Wuhan. On the boat they meet this old merchant, Lin Shi. He tells them about the fearsomeness of the Chang Jiang. His wife drowned in it fifteen years ago. They quickly become acquainted, and to Hong, Lin Shi seems more like a father figure to him than a friend. A great foreshadowing is presented when Hong sees nothing but calm water, he says \\"The danger is a hoax...for them (captain) its like riding a donkey down the road.'... Chen shook his head \\"I don't trust it\\" (140). After passing two of the three gorges without any problem, Hong begins to let his guard down. Lin Shi was suddenly caught by a rock and hurled into the water. Hong has only seen his mother die before Lin died. Hong, \\"having seen the old man swept away, he couldn't bear the idea of death.\\" They boarded another ship to Suzhou, to deliver an important letter entrusted to Chen. On the way, however, pirates intercept them. Chen is sent to the pirates' boss, due to his high ranking, and Hong is separated from his brother. Hong had just enough time to hide his valuables (Letters, and White Lotus emblems). The pirates eventually find them and demand to know the meanings of its contents. Hong refuses to tell them. They first beat him, and later, they torture him by using the \\"Thousand Cuts\\". They cut every part of his body, but before they could finish, he yells out the number \\"fifteen\\" signaling that a Lotus member needs help. A young boy, Yao, saves him. They take back the valuables but in the process, Yao is caught and presumably killed. Hong meets up with the army after days of wandering, and he sees General Ma, the great general in which one of his letters is addressed to. General Ma likes Hong and they go witness a battle together. They trap the pirate boss, and they handed prisoners over, which includes Chen. Hong is relieved, and they continue their journey. They reached Suzhou, and Chen delivered the letter to Meng Dafu, an inventor. The immediately become friends. Chen becomes infatuated with his daughter. Meng is extremely protective of her, however, and they meet secretly. One day, as Chen discusses the possibilities of meeting privately, the daughter runs away from him in fear and tells his dad that Chen has \\"grabbed her from behind and insulted her\\" and Chen and Hong is forced to leave for their final destination--Beijing.They use the Grand Canal on their way, but Chen takes a detour to Qufu, burial place of Confucius. They then uses the flooded countryside to walk to Beijing. They notice more peasants suffering. After arriving, Hong immediately goes to the Imperial palace to meet the \\"Red Horseman\\". He tells Hong that the letter Yi Pan gave him was just a fake one to test his faith. Hong is proven loyal and assigned with the task arranging a rendezvous point where a hated government official could be killed. When Chen takes his exam, \\"Nothing came to mind for any of the questions. Unaccountably, his thoughts returned to the mother and daughter starving to death in a village where two desperate men lurked with pitchforks. Had so much experience on the road incapacitated him for the exacting work of scholarship and composition?\\"(261). This whole experience has shaken his beliefs. He decides to write his essay about the suffering of the people, instead of the tradition way. He was ranked second. For the second part of the essay, taking place inside the palace, Hong once again wrote an essay about his personal experience, but this time he tore it up. He wrote an essay instead about the mandate of heaven, and the celestial harmony that comes with it. This time, Chen was first. Many job offers came along, and Chen was selected as the Vice Secretary of Rites at Qufu. Hong wanted to go south and join the army. The two brothers go their separate ways.The author, Malcolm Bosse, was an American author. His novels often have Asian settings, he researches extensively and uses his own experiences. He graduated from Yale and passed away in 2002. The perspective of the book is one of an outsider. He understand the Chinese culture very well and presents it in a good way. He stated in the title page that He uses the Wade-Giles system of transliterations instead of the more widely used pinyin. Some words were different. The emperor was called Yung Lo instead of Yungle. And the first place finisher was called Hui Yuan instead of Zhangyuan. Bosse uses many Chinese phrases throughout the story. For example, gege for big brother.The whole story was an example of the author's thesis. Chen was just a poor boy from a poor village who went on to become number one in the whole nation. He gained experience that money could not buy, and even with money, like those sons of officials who did not have to write a much to get into the exam, they failed. Bribery, no matter how corrupt the system in China was, did not work. Effort and preserverance worked.The good forces always prevails. The pirates almost had their way of torturing Hong, but he managed to escape and come back with the army and destroyed their garrison. And even after Chen was captured and returned, \\"the golden wings on his cap still shined in the clear sunlight, a deep contrast to the rest of the torn and battered cap\\"(194). It shows how pure Chen is compared to the pirates, and how nothing can harm his intellectual achievement. The empire is filled with poor, starving people, as evidenced throughout their voyage. Poor merchants on ships, poor soldiers, poor farmers barely scraping by. The two brothers are working towards two different goals. Chen is testing to become a scholar, working for the government, and Hong is a member of the White Lotus, a sect bent on destroying the current government.Most of the other books avaliable are about the grandiose achievements of the emperors when they were young, but this book is unique. It talks about two ordinary brothers achieving exordinary things. Not much daily life was documented during that time, and all this events could very well have happened.This enthralling novel captures the heart and soul of the Chinese Imperial Examinations. It was intended to give everybody a fair chance at achieving great things. The readers feels as if they had traveled alongside the Lao brothers, meeting a diverse range of people, and getting a feel for the state of the Ming Dynasty. The details are exquisite, down to the description of the junks. The imagery creates a clear picture of the scene and it stays there."},{"Title":"The Examination","review":"\\"The Examination\\" by Malcolm Bosse has its good points along with its bad. This is a historical fiction book set in the medieval China, the Ming dynasty to be exact. He tells the tale of Lao Chen, and expiring scholar and young prodigy, who traverses the empire to take the strenuous civil service examinations. Chen is accompanied by his young brother Hong, his complete opposite. Chen is the smart type and Hong is more into adventure and military. If you are really into Chinese culture, this would be a good book for you. It explains very well the atmosphere there and how amazingly hard the Examinations are. The author is really detailed in his writing. In the beginning I found it was very interesting but by the time I made it to the middle I started to get bored. But stick with it the author comes out with a good ending and did a good job of summing up the book. To rate this book out of from 1 to 10, I would give it a 7. I thought this book was very interesting but I thought it was really missing some things to hold my interests."},{"Title":"The Examination","review":"I love reading well researched historical fiction which gives a lot of detail and flavor of daily life. I am impressed by the author's ability to get us inside the minds of characters from another century and another culture (I am not Chinese). I found it fascinating, and have read it twice. It inspired me to read more fiction set in this same time period."},{"Title":"The Examination","review":"Bosse doesn't always say in his book exactly how his characters are feeling. At first, this gives the novel, although entertaining, a slightly historical feel. However, as you travel with the brothers, (I felt like I'd been all over China at the close of the book!), you come to really see inside of them, and the contrasts, similarities, and interaction between the two brothers really pulls you in. You come to care for each of them through the other's eyes, so that when they separate, you know what each of them is feeling-- because you are feeling it yourself. More impressive than Bosse's research were his plot twists and the flow and freshness of the brothers' experiences on their journey. And its reality. The thing I like about this book is that it's not just about a young man taking a test, it's about ambition, it's about pirates and secret societies, it's about love and friendship and loss and fear, missing home and finding home, conflicts of ethics and religion, and uncertainty about the future. Three cheers for Bosse! I hope he keeps writing :)"},{"Title":"The Examination","review":"Definitely not the best book I've ever read. Not even mediocre. The plot started out okay, but then went in a completely different direction. The characters were not &#34;alive&#34;, the description of the &#34;set&#34; was...okay...but what really bothered me was the plotline. It was as if the author didn't have a cohesive plan other than the very beginning and the very end, and then shoved in as many disjointed and confusing action scenes he possibly could. After reading it I immediately gave it away. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"The Examination","review":"This was the absolute worst book ever. I disliked it entirely through.

One, who is Chen, is a high-classed scholar, and the other, who is Hong, is a spy for a group called the White Lotus. The brothers face many difficulties, such as starvation and river pirates. At the end, Chen goes off and serves China, while Hong continues to be a part of the White Lotus. This book is a page-turner!

One of the mistakes is that the Year of the Tiger and Ox are only One year apart so there was no way that they would be four years apart unless Malcolm Bosse has some dumb*ss to help him write this book.Another thing is how dumb this book is. Chen tries to seduce a girl and only think about them as well. He doesnt care for anything but his studies and even that isn't enough. When his brother is hurt badly he doesn't even seem to notice.He is so wierd and obviously out of touch with the world.The story is entirly for people who don't give a damn about what they're reading.

Greenblatt has been criticized for homogenizing the history and sacrificing the complexity of the text (for an alternative model of new historicism, one can refer to Louis Montrose's articles and his book &quot;The Purpose of Playing: Shakespeare and the Cultural Politics of Elizabethan Theatre&quot;), but still he has successfully made a strong case for his major argument, namely that Shakespeare, far from a single-handed isolated individual genius coming from nowhere, heavily drew upon the cultural resources and &quot;social energy&quot; circulating among various domains beyond the boundaries of theatre and literature. Greenblatt is very deft in reconstructing the historical and ideological context that enriches the Shakespearen play. Time and again readers feel that the historical anecdote Greenblatt talks about even eclipses the play itself with its magic power of invoking wonder, which might make even those sympathetic readers like Frank Kermode complain that the part on Shakespeare in this book is less interesting than the part on history. But isn't this refocusing of interest not exactly part of demystifying the notion of genius and his sacred writing in order to appreciate Shakespeare more as a negotiator in the marketplace who purchases and exchanges symbolically? The last chapter on &quot;Tempest&quot; is especially highly recommended for its skillful intermingling of the issues of ruling strategy by means of inciting anxiety, colonial (counter)history, the space of theatre and finally the institutionalisation of literature."},{"Title":"Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England (The New Historicism: Studies in Cultural Poetics) (No. 84)","review":"Although Greenblatt as received a good deal attention for his interest in critical practice and for his coining of the terms &quot;New Historicisim&quot; and &quot;cultural poetics,&quot; his real strengths ahev also ben doing close readings of literary and historical texts.

This is the reason why one can consider this book outstanding. Nonetheless, I have read many recent books about Shakespeare and I consider that behind the interesting concept of social energy lies an excessively skeptic version of Shakespeare. I can agree that Shakespeare's preeminence in the canon is largely due to the circulation of social energy, but I think that many of the richness of Shakespeare is too reduced to this factor. The book is an excellent reading for anybody interested in Shakespeare but requires some balancing. My recommendations would be the heterodox book by Rene Girard and the passionate and excessive approach of Bloom. This triad gives an excellent approach to contemporary theses on Shakespeare with complete counterarguments that neutralize the radical points of view of the three authors."},{"Title":"The Outboard Boater's Handbook: Advanced Seamanship and Practical Skills","review":"Covers a wide variety of topics (e.g. selecting, powering, equiping, trailering, maintaining, and sailing) a small (12 to 20 foot)power boat.

The bad news is that we're told that 'There is no Santa Claus' against multiple opponents, so wannabe James Bonds are out of luck.The good news is that when Royce Gracie entered the 'Ultimate Fighting Championship' he was able to do what most martial arts promised but could not deliver; consistently defeat much larger men.At 170 lbs soaking wet, Royce kept winning against Sumo, Greco-Roman wrestlers, Boxers and Karateka-- as did the rest of his family.Fleming would have approved of their methodology. The Gracies had tons of eperience, Brazilian law did not forbid no-holds barred challenges.A bit of a throwback to the 19th century catch wrestling matches, if not quite The Wild West . . .This book covers the beginning of the Gracie clan's ascencion to prominence. The authors make the point that martial arts which teach 'deadly moves' e.g; eye-gouging, shuto throat strikes and such are weaker than those which practise safe techniques--an easily explained paradox in their view, since the 'deadly' ones (Karate and Ryu-style Ju-Jitsu) have to remain theoretical--not too many students being willing to get their throats crushed in practise; whereas boxing and Judo spend most of their time in sparring safely against a training partner-that is not being cooperative.Thus they have nothing but the highest praise for Jigoro Kano, founder of Judo. Indeed their 'lineage'is traced back to him via Mitsuyo Maeda,(1871-1941) a Judoka who saw Judo lose to the Fusen-Ryu school of Jujitsu. This was the first time Kodokan Judo had EVER lost against the 'theoretical' schoolsFusen Ryu employed ground grappling.Kano added this to Judo and Fusen Ryu was 'incorporated' into Japan's official national sport--but not before Yukio Tani, a Fusen-Ryu stylist traveled to England around 1900 and defeated all comers, sometimes fighting as many as 50 a week. He only weighed 125 lbs.In any case Maeda moved to Brazil followed Yukio's example and quickly adapting to foreigners who wrestled without a gi, boxed, etc.He then met and befriended Carlos Gracie, and the rest, as they say is history. . .---------------------------------------This book shows some of the most basic (read effective) holds, takedowns and submissions in BJJ.It also treads on some toes by stating that the cherished concept in JKD about 'ranges of combat' (kicking, boxing, trapping and grappling) has proven to be false. A flying knee can be long range and a grappler who has his mind set on a clinch and takedown from 15 feet away, will indeed, take you down.A possible weakness is the dogma that 'all fights end up on the ground' which the authors sometimes amend to 'most fights between usnkilled opponents' etc.The reality is that BJJ confesses to having no defense against two or more opponents save running or looking around for 'improvised weapons'-- See chapter 10, JuJitsu for self defense.But there is a lot of data in which a boxer a karateka or a good street fighterhas indeed prevailed aginst two men---and more. Ask around your friendly local barroom bouncers, LEO's , and MP's.Come to think of it, many in the military police and other similar organizations think the world of the hand to hand combat developed by the likes of Fairbarns, Sykes and other commando trainers from WW2--which are indeed 'theoretical' Furthermore with the introduction of 'Redman' and other protective suits and gear, the gap between theoretical and practical is closing.Lastly, and I know I'm nitpicking--I think the world of the Gracies--Bruce Lee would be somewhat taken aback by the statement that the roundhouse \\" Can be safely regarded as the 'king of kicks' \\". Here the authors are referring to Thai low roundhouse using the shin to attack a boxer's leg.I'm surprised the authors did not follow their own logical conclusion, that the low side thrust kick to the leading leg of the opponent does not exist in Thai boxing because it's too dangerous and thus is 'theoretical', but might prove quite handy in a real fight , just as Bruce thought.In any case, all martial artists can be gratefull to the Gracies for putting back some perspective into what works and doesn't, as well as for founding an organization where it does take years of hard work to earn a 1st degree black belt, as opposed to--well I'm too much of a gentleman to name names but if you've been around the MA scene, you know the score- and where possesing one actually means that yes, you can handle yourself in a fight-- WHAT A CONCEPT !Outstanding book."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This is a notable contribution to the martial arts literature, particularly from the standpoint of theory. There have been several recent books capitalizing on the popularity of Brazilian Jujutsu (BJJ) such as those presenting basic techniques, a training syllabus, and self-defense applications. This book is distinguished clearly from those by its more systematic coverage of the general principles and their origin, allowing more advanced martial artists of all styles to learn what makes Brazilian Jujutsu so effective under the submission fighting and &quot;no holds barred&quot; conditions where it excels. This book also takes on unarmed fighting strategy in general, and so does not limit its coverage to the traditional methods of BJJ.The book has several remarkable strengths, especially for a martial arts technical book. It treats cultural evolution of martial arts in an unusually serious and competent manner, it is relatively free of stylistic bias despite being written from within the perspective of Brazilian Jujutsu, it is very well written, and it has a logical structure with clear, useful, well-chosen examples.The book also has a couple of minor but notable problems. First, the authors chose a completely non-scholarly format, and so they have some difficulty making serious historical and technical points with a very bare minimum of sources. Second, the authors treat principles as if all principles were strategic, thus largely missing technical (e.g. biomechanical) principles.Third, the authors avoid an important central issue, the classification of strategies based on the degree of risk and commitment. An important distinction should be made between strategies that minimize the damage an opponent can do to us (&quot;minimax&quot;), and strategies that create the maximum opportunity to do damage to an opponent (&quot;maximax&quot;). Without this distinction, Japanese Judo and Jujutsu seem to the authors to be 'without a systematic strategy,&quot; when in fact they have a consistent systematic strategy but it is based upon the Japanese aesthetic and strategic principle of the &quot;sudden death&quot; finish. The goal is to use first opportunity to execute a devastating finishing move rather than to accumulate positional advantage in a series of phases.The difference is one of the logical relation between preconditions and commitments in strategy. Just as in chess strategy (e.g. see Vukovic, &quot;The Art of Attack in Chess&quot;, ch. 11) there are in general a set of preconditions that make a commitment to an attack sound, and missing those preconditions the attack is unsound and can be countered devastatingly by a skilled opponent. Knowing the preconditions that will make the risk of a move worth taking is an extremely complex and error-prone matter that in most fighting strategies has to be done through experience and intuition.Since an attack necessarily requires a commitment and therefore produces vulnerability, it is important at high levels of skill that the attack (finish or transitional move) be done when the necessary preconditions are in place rather than simply hoping to pull them off through speed and strength. What the BJJ phased positional strategy does is to break down the preconditions for attack uniquely well and ensure that they are present. A finish (or transition) doesn't begin until the advantage is present for it to succeed with a high degree of likelihood, unless a very clear target of opportunity opens up. This way, BJJ fighters rarely get countered and frequently succeed at reaching the next step of their positional goal, especially against opponents who are waiting for larger openings to appear, even though they may have great technical skill. This is what I think is the reality behind the &quot;lack of strategy&quot; of other grappling approaches.This book does a very competent job placing the (strategic) principles of Jujutsu into Japanese social and cultural context, using more than just the standard uncritical mythology usually found in books of this type. The difficult topic of cultural evolution in general and martial arts evolution in particular is covered unusually well, although it stops well short of being a scholarly presentation. The general problem of trying to explain both convergent and divergent evolutionary patterns in culture is introduced in an understandable way, and the weaknesses of the &quot;common origins&quot; theory of Asian martial arts are made very clear.Having detached their analysis from the questionable &quot;common origins&quot; theory, the authors are able to make a strategic analysis of unarmed combat based on a more sophisticated combination of historical, social, and technical factors. With this analysis, they accomplish something akin to what Bruce Lee and the Jeet Kune Do theorists attempted years ago, and what Paul Maslak addressed in his &quot;Strategy in Unarmed Combat&quot; and &quot;What the Masters Know,&quot; but with a new twist. Whereas previous analyses focused on the range-dependence of standing fighting, the authors of &quot;Mastering Jujutsu&quot; add their understanding of mixed martial arts fighting. This allows them to incorporate both the principles of grappling strategy and the principles involved in fighting against grapplers, and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the of the range-based strategic approach.They find the range-based approach marginally useful. Where they consider range important to standing fighting is in the same sense that Maslak divided ranges into &quot;infighting and outfighting,&quot; and classical Budo considers a single critical distance or Ma-Ai to be important. The JKD-inspired idea of separate ranges for &quot;kicking, punching, trapping, and grappling&quot; ranges is found to be an inferior teaching tool in a very persuasive analysis using both practical examples and general principles. The authors divide standing ranges into &quot;non-contact&quot; and &quot;contact,&quot; and demonstrate why this is as useful a range-based analysis as can be attempted.Where the book has its greatest value is in its clear and very general presentation of the origin and application of the phased positional strategy of BJJ, and the examples of how it is executed in mixed martial arts, submission, and self-protection fighting. This is one of those rare books that while written from the perspective of one discipline has value that easily crosses disciplines. An excellent addition to the literature of unarmed fighting strategy."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! This is one of the most comprehensive works on the principles behind one-on-one, unarmed combat that I've read. We're not talking one of those &quot;every move in the world&quot; books here, though some are included. No, this is more on principles and theories which reallity fighting, specifically jujitsu, embrace. The book starts out with a rather extensive history of BJJ, going all the way back to ancient Japan. Briefly covered are the different theories of how martial arts developed around the world, which was interesting to read. The book then goes into the different stages of combat; the clinch, the free-movement phase, and groundfighting. I have to admit, I've never really been satisfied with &quot;long, medium, short&quot; or &quot;kicking, punching, trapping, grappling&quot;, and I'm a little jealous that I didn't think of Gracie's stages of a fight on my own. His division is based on the different skills needed for each stage of a fight. Further chapters cover the stages by themselves. The free-movement chapter covers basic strikes, blocks, and long-range &quot;shooting&quot; takedowns. The section on the clinch actually goes over the most common clinch possitions (over-under, front headlock, double-underhook, etc.), and includes brief strategy for both. The authors give insights into strikes, takedowns, and submissions from the various clinch possitions. Groundfighting is covered in the next chapter. The focus is on the different possitions/pins, and is covered in a hierarchical manner, from most desirable to least desirable. Two chapters are then devoted to specific aspects of grounfighting; winning from the bottom, and winning from the top. These are probably the most technique-rich sections. Escapes from bad possitions, transitional movements to different possitions, and common submissions are shown. After that is a short chapter on training in general, and competitions that attract BJJ stylists are given a little detail (sport BJJ, submission wrestling, and MMA events). The last chapter is on using the theories of BJJ that have been presented in the book for self-defense. This one chapter is what Royce and Charles Gracie's self-defense book should have covered. Among other things, this chapter goes into the &quot;prayer stance&quot;, a seemingly benign possition that enables you to defend yourself efficiently; six general catagories of violent encounters, and how their dynamics might effect the techniques used; and how to deal with common attacks, including a very pragmatic look at group attack. A nice feature of this book is that the authors look to present all views and theories of a situation, even if it doesn't really jive with BJJ's main tenents. I can also see how the style keeps evolving with exposure to different arts; many of the clinch moves are taken directly from amature wrestling, and the only kick presented is the Thai-style roundhouse kick. As I mentioned earlier, this book isn't a mega-technique book, but the techniques that are presented could be best termed &quot;essential&quot;. The authors also make no bones about the environment that thier theories best suit: one-on-one, unarmed combat. There is definitely a sense of prejudice towards grappling and groundfighting, and this is where I kind of take issue with some of the stuff said. Early MMA/NHB events are brought in as evidence of &quot;little guy beats big guy using grappling&quot;, but in UFC's 1-7, without going into too much detail, of six cases where the winner of a match was greatly outweighed, three were won by striking, and two of the remaining matches ended up with the grappler taking a severe beating, and the last one lasted about 20 min. with little action. In other words, I question the &quot;little guy beats big guy using grappling&quot; theory based on those events. Other than that, no real complaints. Great book overall, and an exelent illustration of BJJ theories and how they're applied. Good for anyone interested in what to expect out of a one-on-one, weaponless fight, or a MMA/NHB event."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"If you want to learn Ju-Jitsu, it's best to take classes, and practice with real partners.

The game has changed, but the book is still relevant. The book is largely about grappling against the striker, but includes enough striking work to show where jiu jitsu fits into the big picture."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This is a book I couldn't put down. It is nice to come across a good martial arts book that one can actually READ, rather than just look at pictures and techniques. This book contains history which details the evolution of Judo and its descendant Jiu-jitsu in Brazil and beyond; it has strategy; it has techniques, self-defence concepts, and many other things. It is written by a Ph.D in philosophy, so its style is excellent. As a classicist, I enjoyed reading the quote from Herodotus at the start of the book, and the reference to the ancient Greek Pankration.Now, to be fair, I should relate some things to consider:1. It is written by ground fighting specialists who have taken their preference for ground fighting into MMA and have had a great deal of success there. Others have taken their specialties in striking into MMA and have had a high degree of success also, as the book clearly points out. Thus, while this book attempts to be balanced in regards to the 'phases of combat' concepts that it presents, its area of specialty is in the ground phase: the sections covering the clinch and striking are good, but clearly not as sophisticated as might be ideal.2. The statement that wrestlers have achieved their stunning successes in MMA primarily through being 'bigger and stronger' than their adversaries is an unfair comment to make. Wrestlers rather use their skills to stay on top of their adversaries from where they can beat them into submission. The kind of positional skills wrestlers exhibit are proving to be more and more important in MMA as their continued victories clearly point out. Since Jiu-jitsu itself promotes pinning, even if less so than wrestling, it seems quite illogical for the authors to discount the strategy wrestlers take with them into MMA. One weakness of Jiu-jitsu is that its rules over-emphasize the submission at the expense of the pin, encouraging one to sacrifice one's dominant position for an attempt at a submission that can be disastrous if the intended victim weasels out of it and even worse if he then ends up on top. Judo has at all times, even when the Fusen-ryu practitioners joined the Kodokan, counted pins as victories. Indeed, there is no evidence at all that the Fusen-ryu folks ONLY fought for submissions. Just as they brought their intricate ground chokes and joint locks, so too did they bring their expertise in pinning (osaekomi). Modern MMA is bearing out the combat validity of this form of training more and more. It is in many cases simply much safer to pin and strike than to sacrifice one's position for an attempted submission. In Judo, of which the Kosen style is most famous for its ground work, pinning and submitting go hand in hand as equally valid combat techniques. To be sure, pinning in an MMA situation in order to strike is not the same as pinning someone in a mere grappling match, but so too is submitting someone in MMA quite different than submitting someone in a grappling competition, due to the important inclusion of strikes. Just as the submission grappler must alter his style for MMA, so too must the wrestler, and we have all seen how the positioning and striking skills of the wrestlers have been proven equally effective in achieving victory as the positioning and submitting skills of the Jiu-jitsu fighters. Ideally, one will have mastered both.3. The authors make the comment that no martial art can prepare one for combat against two or more opponents. This is a little pessimistic and something of an exaggeration. There are indeed persons who have fought against two opponents and won. In these kinds of situations, being able to strike hard and fast and to stay on one's feet are critical. Staying on one's feet is particularly important so that one can retain the option of fleeing the situation: once tangled up on the ground grappling with one of the assailants, one has compromised one's ability to escape. The authors seem to assume that one cannot train to keep on one's feet in combat - that one will of necessity fall down or be knocked down by one's assailant at some point in the fight. This is patently ridiculous, since there are many forms of wrestling around the world that can train one to keep on one's feet very well, and their efficacy has been proven time and again. By using a strategy of sitting down and saying \\"come and fight me on the ground\\", one is nullifying one's offensive potential. These are facts that practitioners of an art that focusses on grappling on the ground may not like to consider.4. The authors state that 'most fights end up on the ground'. But, what they seem to skip over are the various reasons why this is so, and how this comes about. In fact, many times fights end up on the ground due to one of the fighters being knocked down with a punch, or being thrown over a chair or other object, or even simply by tripping or slipping. Often the fighter who falls is stunned as a result of the punch or as a result of his impact with the floor or ground. If you can be the one knocking or throwing the other fighter down, and being able to thwart any attempts to do the same to you, then you have a potentially greater advantage going into the ground phase: it is much better to ground-fight someone stunned, disoriented or hurt than someone unscathed.5. There is no in-depth coverage of using throws/body slams to harm one's opponent in this book. As mentioned above, it is advantageous if one is able to slam one's opponent into the ground and take some of the fight out of him. Unlike in sporting MMA rings, the real world tends to have a mostly un-matted surface area, and in cities, much of the earth is covered in solid concrete, making the hard contact between the ribs/spine and the ground as a result of a throw more disturbing than in the ring.So, as long as one keeps the limitations of this book such as those mentioned above in mind, one can gain a great deal of insight into unarmed combat and MMA fighting."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This book contains a lot of verbiage about the history of jujitsu, which unfortunately was not what I was hoping for. It is also entirely no-gi based.The book does a good job of breaking down the most common positions two fighters can get in. For example, winning from the bottom is broken down into attacks from the guard which is further broken down into attacks from the closed guard, and so on.If you are looking for a more in depth technique book, check out Jiu Jitsu University by Saulo Ribero."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"An alright book, reviews a lot of positions which is important, but not enough submisions in my opinion, however it does cover a variety of techniques for takedowns and those are very important. It does not show counter-attacks nor defense if you get in trouble."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"If your BJJ instructor is like mine, then he doesn't talk much about theory or high-level strategy - he's too busy showing you how to do the stuff. I found this book to be the perfect compliment to a \\"less talk, more work\\" training regimen because it takes the things you are learning and applying (normally immediately) each week, and explains the foundations and reasons behind them.For example I came from kenpo and never had strong grappling skills or a lot of experience in it, so I could accept that I didn't want someone to get double underhooks locked on me, but I had no true understanding of the implications of screwing that up. Rather than stop the class a dozen times to ask questions, I suggest reading this book first, then asking questions. Previous reviewers have touted the \\"phases\\" of combat instead of the traditional \\"ranges\\", and I also found that very helpful. The ranges always seemed a bit too ... neat to me. Both theories are very helpful and should be learned in my opinion, if only to argue intelligently for/against one.The writing style of this book was actually quite good as well. This worried me since the Gracies focus on combat, not English literature, but the co-author is a PHd who managed to NOT throw unecessary Latin phrases around. Overall it's a smooth and interesting read without grammar/spelling mistakes or illogical jumps in topics.One thing that I was very happy to see was a non-arrogant tone. There is a division nowadays between standup and grappling arts that sometimes gets snippy for no reason, and to be honest it's pretty annoying (since pure grapplers and pure standup fighters BOTH consistently lose to complete fighters). This book's tone is very objective and when it states an opinion that might raise some ire, like pure standup fighters are flawed, it points to either direct evidence, strong logic, or both."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Easily the most in depth anaylsis of jiu jitsu and mixed martial arts I have ever seen. The history section at the start of the book is awsome!! It reads like a textbook, full of insights - it will change the way you think about and understand MMA. The technical drills and moves are great also."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Finally a book that breaks down the whole MMA game into a cohesive and well written form. The central idea is the &quot;theory of phases of combat&quot; that is at the center of the books discussion. There is also a good selection of contemporary MMA technique. An interesting and original account of MMA/jiu jitsu technique for self defense. This book is light years ahead of anything else out there."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Includes in depth discussion about all aspects of the game and even incorporates some of the \\"Jujitsu\\" techniques and tactics used by Sakuraba against the Gracies. The techniques are demonstrated by the actual instructors at the New York school as well as Renzo himself. I tried a number of the techniques against an experience grappling opponent and they worked without a hitch. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"What a great book. Impeccable writing and research takes this book way above anything else out there. An in depth look at the current state of jiu jitsu and MMA. The writing is outstanding, along with an excellent selection of techniques and training drill, making this the outstanding book on the market. Worth every penny!!"},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Wow...that's all I could say. After purchasing Brazillian Jiu Jitsu: Theory and Technique buy Renzo and Royler, I very much anticipated Royce's addition to the library...which disappointed me greatly. Renzo's book, Mastering Jujitsu, as reaffirmed my faith in the Gracie family texts. From theory to history, this book does a fantastic job of conveying key concepts for sport and fight. I HIGHLY reccomend it to any serious martial artist."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"The greatest revelation of this book is that Gracie recommends bodyweight exercises such as calisthentics rather that weight training for the martial arts."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Bad editing and poor production values mar what otherwise could have been a great book."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This book outlines the foundation of grappling, with the primary emphasis focused on ground grappling tactics. It serves as a primer to those interested in the basics of mixed martial arts and BJJ.The book is very well written by the coauthor Danaher, who has a graduate school education, in education. The topics are discussed in a short yet, sufficient manner to accurately describe said topic.This book along with the aid of a competent instructor and a hard working training partner, will assist one on their journey to becoming an effective grappler. Just do not forget the other aspects of the martial arts. There are many paths to the top of the mountain, choose wisely. \\"To learn about the universe one must study more than one planet,\\" Miyamoto Musahsi."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"Let's just say that as a student at Rickson Gracie's school, I rarely find a bjj book which augments my training. This one does. It's a deep, rich read with fasinating history and theories of combat. It changed the context through which I view the Gracie artform.If you train or are interested in bjj, read this book."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This book makes an excellent introduction for the mixed martial arts and the Gracie fighting system. It is very well written and illustrated. This book is worth every bit of its cost and is a good addition to any martial arts collection."},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"I just read this book and all I can say is- WOW!! Great effort! Gracie and Danaher really take the book market up a notch with this one. Easily the best written and researched jujitsu/MMA book on the market. Great stuff!!"},{"Title":"Mastering Jujitsu (Mastering Martial Arts Series)","review":"This book is very different from other BJJ books on the market. Other BJJ books concentrate on showing one the techniques. Mastering JJ concentrates on the theory and the application of technique. I also found the history section to be accurate and detailed. I highly reccomend this book.
