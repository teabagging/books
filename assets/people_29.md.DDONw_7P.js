Three quarters of the way through, you'll be in stitches. Every character in the squadron, from top to bottom of the pecking order, is subject to ridicule. Those familiar with the nonsense and pettiness that revolve around office politics would be the first to relate to Heller's unique brand of humour.Readers looking for an intricate plot will undoubtedly be disappointed, because there isn't one. Instead, the book is made up of cleverly interwoven vignettes all of which (somehow) have a bearing on Yossarian's relentless efforts to save his own skin.Very funny. Very perceptive. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If you are going to read this book in a subconscious state of mind, don't even bother. The book is well written and extremely humorous, but the reader has to think while reading it. The plot is not obvious; the characters are not fully described. This book was written for a thinking man (or woman) with a good sense of humor. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I went into this book with mixed feelings. On the one hand, this book is widely considered a masterpiece, and friends who know my reading tastes were shocked that I hadn't read and fallen in love with this book. On the other hand, the (newer) copy of the book I read starts out with a pretty lame preface by the author: he writes about what great reviews the book got, and how well-received the book was. It's hard not to come away from such a self-congratulatory preface without a bad taste in your mouth.So did the book live up to the hype? No, not really. Heller is exceedingly clever at times, and he displays a masterful command of the language. The characters are all top-notch - well illustrated and interesting to read about.However, the flaws were also very apparent. Catch-22 weighs in at 452 pages; while the characters remain interesting, the zany predicaments they land themselves in become repetitious. For example, a chapter after Yossarian learns about 'Catch-22', he has a conversation with a prostitute, who tells him that she won't marry him because he's insane, and he's insane because he wants to marry her. I felt like I was reading a recycled joke - nowhere near the laugh-out-loud hilarity I was expecting.The story is not told in a linear fashion - characters will talk about an event in chapter 2 that isn't described until chapter 10 - and this gives the story a meandering, episodic sitcom sort of feeling. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. So far as themes go, the book does a decent job of mixing absurd inanity with serious war-time events, but I personally feel that Vonnegut mixes tragedy and comedy far more skillfully than Heller.Also, I thought Catch-22 would be the story of Yossarian trying to act crazy in order to bypass Catch-22, but this isn't the case. Catch-22 is really a collection of loosely-related zany incidents that Yossarian's squadron go through - the story of \\"Catch-22\\" is really just one in a series of clever conversations.Despite all my reservations, Catch-22 is still a better book than most books you'll read, and most definitely worth reading if you haven't already. I just felt that all of the unqualified praise that this book is getting needed some counterpoint."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Just finished reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22.I did not like it. Here are my reasons. I have avoided citation of specific instances in support of a point so as not to give anything away.Heller works the novel like an Archilochus/Isaiah Berlin hedgehog - around the idea of people entrapped, enervated and then destroyed by intended and unintended contradictions of, in this case, the war machinery. Perhaps the indictment is of any powerful bureaucracy - even life itself. The irrational and dehumanizing aspects of war unfold in farcical iterations. Each iteration further fleshes out and reinforces the chimerical webs that entrap the flies - the harder they struggle against it.The author is most formidable in his use of the language. What skill it must take to overuse the language so incredibly, yet, so lightly. His pen shows no strain - none at all - as it moves left to right, up and down - over and over again - fluting out in steady drips a full mountain of descriptors. It would be achievement enough if the overlapping descriptors somehow came together harmlessly. But here the imagery is all the more better for it. As if, using the elements/techniques of oil painting, one has churned out a most exquisite set of watercolors! Gestures, expressions, movement of any kind rise from the medium of words to that of a resplendent image almost immediately. This, I propose, is Heller's true achievement.No doubt, Heller has several sources and inspirations. Certainly one of them is Dostoevsky, class Hedgehog. But Heller's one big idea is hardly novel. Literature has many memorably executed suffocating, paradoxical, tragicomic bureaucracies. Repetition of an idea is in itself not a critical drawback because new ideas are not so easy to come by. An existing idea newly represented such as to expand its scope and understanding can be just as worthy an achievement. But there too Heller falls short.Heller fails because his deliberate, repeating exaggerations become too repetitious. The iterative unfolding of the novel is thick with dialogs, events, characterizations that repeat far more than they move. After a point these repetitions do not add anything significant to any aspect of the novel. The plot is not any more intricate for it. The characters are not any more intelligent or coherent or paranoid for it. The repetitions cease to reinforce anything. In-fact they blunt any worthwhile movement that comes along. Such as ascension of Milo's enterprise into lunacy. The repetitions strip all the edge of such progressions.Since Heller himself makes several references to Crime and Punishment let us consider it. Too serious and intricate a comparison would be silly but one may still compare certain general aesthetics like plot and character richness. Look at the exquisite contemplative gallop with which Raskalnikov moves to crime and then towards punishment. Look at the coherence of his paranoia. Look at the rich characterizations of Svidrigailov and Porfiry Petrovitch.But yes, having said that, I think, Yossarian's stroll through war torn Rome is just as beautifully illustrated as any of Raskalnikov's stroll through Petersburg.All in all, I think the novel is worth reading for its language. Otherwise, I would put it after so many of those other outstanding classics."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"> AS I recall the editor of this book changed the title from Catch 18 to Catch 22. I think the editor was right a much Catch-ier title. If you have not read this book take my advice, read the book, read the other reviews with the 5 star ratings and take their advise, I'm really to tired to review this book properly but not so tired as to recognize the wisdom of some of my fellow five star'er'ers.STOP READING! just read the book Joseph Heller I aint!... I havnt been this tired since I was a young man of eleven, my brother Charles Chadwick and I had a good friend nicknamed Big John who set up a waste basket on the ground floor of our families unfinished cottage and he decided to play Dresden. He climbed upstairs where my dad kept all his old playboy magazines, dropped his boxers and dropped a few biscuits in warning (as the allies did in WW2) and then zeroed in on the basket. We all ran for the woods and hid until dusk and then snuck around to the house avoiding Big John because we were afraid of being caught and becoming forced labor in the cleanup in Big Johns reenactment of the Dresden bombing. Even as kids we understood the importance of learning from history...Speaking of history I had a good conversation with Big Johns younger brother Roscoe about the Dresdan story and he remembered hearing about about it but was not present, he mentioned that knowing his brother as he does (as a brother) that it all made perfect sense. He related to me a story about when Big John and Big Joe (Big Joe is Roscoes twin,he was younger than Big John as well, in addition he was not as big as Big John despite the fact that he was big) would play a game with a rubber ball when the folks were out of the house, kind of like basketball except the object was to throw the ball in the toilet, the looser had to fish the ball out. However as Roscoe explained and what ads credence to my Dresdan story is that Big John would always make Big Joe fish the ball out no matter who made the basket...Off the subject abit but I cant help myself, my friend Roscoe is a self-made millionaire, he had the idea a few years ago to convert old washing machines into dog houses and made a fortune, he cashed out and travels the states with his girl friend Lora lee lee and his monkey Tater."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was assigned this book in high school and did not finish it with about 100 pages left. About 10 years later, I recently picked up the book again to finish a book I have been wanting to finish. I was not disappointed. Joseph Heller is a skilled story teller whose pen is well adept to writing satire. Many of the humorous points of this book I was not ready to appreciate as a high school senior. Years later, I found myself laughing out at many lines in this book.The book tells the story of Yossarian, a disgruntled World War II pilot. Yossarian wants nothing more than to go home from the war after his mission quota is satisfied. Unfortunately, his mission quota is raised each time he gets close to meeting it. Along the way, we meet a cast of unique characters. It makes me curious as to where Heller came up with the idea for all these characters. Lieutenant Scheisskopf and Major Major Major Major are two of my favorite characters in the book. Their stories in addition to the idiosyncrasies are wonderfully written. The book ends with Yossarian faced with a paradox of choices based on the development of the character. It is worth reading the book to find out the ending.This book is a literary classic. I hate to give too many points of the plot away in the review as I would hope the sharp turns in the plot can surpise other readers the way they surprised me. Truly, this is a great book for those with an eye for wit."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a biting satire about the absurdities of war. Set in World War 2, the novel is about a squadron of bomber crews stationed in Pianosa. The book follows the exploits of the group, and of one man in particular: a bomber named Yossarian. Yossarian goes against the grain, and tries valiantly throughout the novel to escape the inevitable Catch-22. All Yossarian wants to do is survive the war, but that seems impossible in the face of Catch-22. This novel is about his struggle against the system, his personal quest for survival in the face of a military that sees him only as part of the war effort.Several things--a colonel who's aspiring to be a general and keeps upping the required number of missions, a mess hall attendant who forms his own syndicate and sells supplies to the enemy to gain a profit, a major who disappears inside his trailer--combine to form the military unit to which Yossarian belongs, where \\"what's good for the syndicate is good for the country\\" and where men are endangered and their lives sacrificed for the ambitions of higher-ranking men aspiring to fortune and notoriety.This book would be depressing--horribly depressing--were it not so downright funny. The situations, the way the characters react and interact with each other, are absurd and hilarious. In fact, the attitudes of most of these men (commanders in particular) are downright ridiculous, and the book is not realistic in terms of the characters personalities (how many generals REALLY believe they can order someone to be shot whenever they want?). Still, the absurd nature of the book is what gives it such power. By giving his characters such outrageous ambitions and by creating such ridiculous situations for them, Heller makes his message painfully clear.This book is a modernist approach to war. The narrative is fragmented and roughly pieced together, and the satire is very prominent and in-your-face. In the end, Yossarian is faced with a choice: submit to the \`Catch,' or die trying to escape it. The irony of it all--submit to the Catch and be a hero (though morally dead) or try to escape it and be physically dead--is what makes Yossarian such a powerful character. This book is one of the greatest works of the 20th century for a reason--the impression it leaves is very lasting."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22, it has to be the funniest book I have ever read. The title itself, is a law in the army that has many parts. One of the parts is to get discharged from the army; you have to be crazy. To say you are crazy, you have to ask the doctor to keep you on the ground, but as soon as you say your crazy and want to be grounded, Catch-22 says you are sane to say your crazy so therefore you have to continue flying missions. The book is about a fleet of bombers that are bombing cities in Germany. They are constantly made to bomb, even when they are suppose to be sent home. The whole book is filled with crazy people, like Dunbar, he does things he hates doing, because it would make time go by slowly. Dunbar thought that it would make his lifelonger. Orr, has to be one of the weirdest guys out there, like when he talks about putting crabapples in his cheeks when he was little or the prostitute that hit him with a shoe because Orr paid her to do so. The book is mostly composed of learning about characters and then their stories add on to a plot line indirectly. Throughout the book, it reveals more and more of the maincplot, escaping war. I recommend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor and enjoy books about war. I will read this book again, just because it was an all around good book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The book Catch 22 by Joeshph Heller is a book about a piolt in WWII. The main charecter is named Yossaian. This piolt is very paranoid about alot of things. Also through out the book he trys to get out of flying missions by doing various things. A couple of things he does is fake being sick. Also he fakes being mentally insane.This book is different from any other book i've read. There is a unique yet talented style of writting i've never encountered before. In the midst of all the chaos of war the author still seems to throw in alot of humor. It is also a different sense of humor based on simple concepts. When I first started reading it, I was thinking too hard to understand the humor, I thought there was a deeper meaning to alot of it. After confusing myself a bit I learend that I just have to take it for what it is and judge it at face value. At the end the humor is more one big joke than many little ones. My advice to the reader is to just read and accept, then later it will make sense. An example of this humor would be on page 33, &quot;I did it to protect my good reputation in case anyone ever caught me walking around with crab apples in my cheeks. With rubber balls in my hands I could deny there were crab apples in my cheeks. Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands not my cheeks.&quot; That is a perfect example of humor you shouldn't try to figure out. There is nothing to figure out. That part is just telling you about the personality of the charecter Orr.Overall it was a very good book. The only possible drawback is that the begining is slow moving. You might get frustrated with the book, but just keep reading, it gets better. The possitive of this book far out weighs the negative."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Sorry, people. For some reason this book has been branded a classic simply because...well, I'm not sure why frankly. The satire hits you over the head until you are dizzy (unfortunately not with laughter), the plot is cellophane thin, the message completely muddled. The book flows as smoothly as a trainwreck. There are some witty commentaries but overall don't believe the hype. This book is an outdated bore."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Yossarian doesn't want to fight and get killed. For this reason, the army psychiatrists rule that he is sane. If Yossarian were to want to fight and get killed, the Army would still not send him home because he is just the kind of man they need....Get the picture? Catch-22 is a moving novel about the individual soul's continual despair at the neverending combat with the absurd and unreasonable in life, particularly war. The humor hurts and enrages. Yossarian's situation seems irremediable and, down to the last pages, one wonders if it is sane to even go on.If this book does not awaken you to the insanity of those around you, then you are probably part of the problem...."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"With the advent of Joseph Heller's first published manuscript to the nation's bookstore shelves in 1961, critical reviews were far from rave. Indeed, at first glance there seemes to be little reason why it should have been a success. The plot, what little there is, orbits freely of its own accord, and the chronology is so fragmented that it takes a ridiculous effort to piece snippets of time and space together. But it is the total absurdity and odd seriousness of Heller's bitter black humor that gave paranoid characters like Yoassarian and Major Major a cult following of average civilians and servicemen, if not the educated bigwigs.To these perfunctory--and perhaps more cultured--readers, Catch-22 reads like one off-color joke after another. Logical fallacies abound. Why the pilot Orr puts crabapples in his cheeks, the reader will never know...except that they are better than horse-chestnuts. Why? Non sequitor. Milo buys eggs for seven cents on Malta and sells them to the mess hall...and still manages to make a profit using nothing but circular logic. It is this type of bizarre humor that propels the entire book. Heller's over-the-top slapstick and conflicting logic will seem like a literary papercut to some readers. Yawns, or even grimaces, may eventually paralyze most (normal) readers' hysterics about halfway through the mission to Bologna, but the pages keep turning.There is a method to the rampant madness. Beneath its warped surface, Catch-22 addresses the depressing, scary, so-serious-its-sick subject of total war. Heller reaches a point where he is no longer funny because everything he writes suddenly springs true. For average non-entities like me, it rings a little too authentic."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I first read this book in the sixties. I wanted a good copy for rereading, remeniscing and discussing.Ideal copy Thanks, Amazon"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"While Catch-22 might be one of the most known and reviewed modern US novels, not everybody has actually heard of it, even if you are familiar with the \\"catch-22\\" phraseology. It is by no means a standard story told through a conventional channel, but rather a surreal picture conveyed through the novel use (and mix) of different techniques.So, why should you bother reading (and buying) it?Well, let's start with the simple part. The book itself is well printed, with the 50th Anniversary edition boosting some additional material, which, if you are a die-hard Catch-22 fan, you will cherish, but which otherwise doesn't really add that much value to the novel but for making it easier for the (younger and) newer readers understanding the context in which the novel was released and actually gained fame. This is one of the nicer paperback editions I have seen, probably only lacking the glossy paper and the hard cover. There are even a few (rather lost) pictures in between.Now to the real meat, the content.If you are looking for a book about WWII, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book as a bedtime companion in order to fall asleep, go away, this is not.If you are looking for a book that is an easy read and does not require you to actually think about what you are reading, go away, this is not.Catch-22 is a book that requires the reader to work and think. It will not do the work for you, nor present you with any preconceived ideas or solutions, but it will punch you right in your face and stab you with a knife in the back and force you to react, to think, to rethink. If there is a merit in this novel (and make no mistakes, I think there are many), this is the biggest. Heller makes an astonishing and refreshing use of well known techniques to take you along the ride and seemingly without too much effort force you to face the brutal, cruel and often crazy world of war, bureaucracy and ill-understood free enterprise.Now, this force ride does not come along easy nor cheap, it will cost you quite some effort to get past the countless repetitions, the often seemingly meaningless dialogues, the vast amount of information that is being thrown to you without any aid nor indication what to do with it. Which is fine, as long as you know what to expect and be prepared for.My biggest problem with Catch-22 is the context, both in terms of time period as well as geographical/sociopolitical. If you are a US reader, you should have no problem relating to the book (if you are over 30 years old you probably have read it in school anyway). In the post-Korea and Vietnam world of the 60's and 70's, this novel hit on the nerve of a society that was just waiting for this kind of books (another fine example being M*A*S*H). However, the 60's and 70's are now far away, and many readers know this period of time only from the history books or from the stories told by their older relatives, so this novel seems a little out of context today, actually a bit outdated.I rated it 3 stars because of the outdated feeling of it, and because it is so difficult to really grasp that the amount of work seems a bit too much compared to the end-result.So, you have been warned, now it's up to you to decide if you want to take the risk to be \\"catched\\"!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I was satisfied with shipping time and price of product, only downfall was that it wasn't in mint condition.

I believe Catch-22 is a well written war novel that blends different moods,which express each characters point of view on life as troops.This Novel discusse the ups and downfalls of World War II.One character who I found most intersting in the book was: Yossarian. Yossarian is character who captures personal fears and opinions of his troubles in life. He reminds me of high school and all the pressure you go through,inorder to get your goal done. However in high shool, you have to deal with passing examens,inorder to get a good grade. Instead of passing examens, Yossarian has to passed missions, inorder to become a well trained war flier. Yossarian is trying to indenify his way through life, under pressure and protecting himself and troops,who Yossarian is in charge of.Catch-22 is novel that can truly show you how most military families are and the obstacles we go through,inorder to have a love one safer from any type of war that's over seas. Most people don't understand what it takes for a person to fight for a country that may not be right all the time. It takes encouragement and self-control to fight in a war that may never end for both real troops and the troops express in thew novel.Overall this novel is truly an amazing story that could teach you lessons upon lfe and what not to do that may leave you scar for life.

There are many references to prostitutes, one night stands, and \\"love\\" that is actually lust. So, if you're a bit skiddish of vulgar language and references you'll be sorely disapointed in this book.The whole book is full of catch-22s. For instance, a character named Hungry Joe likes to take pictures of naked women that never develop correctly but when he was a citizen, he had been a professional photographer.This book jumps around a lot. It gives tidbits of information that at the time might not seem important but tie into the main story later.

After reading this book for the first time, I read every Joseph Heller book I could get my hands on. None of them equaled this book, but none of them disappointed me either.This is the story of a group of pilots and their crews in World War II. The main character wants to get out. He claims he's going crazy, but the fact that he's afraid of getting killed proves he can think rationally, which proves he's not crazy. If he stops worrying about getting killed and requesting a discharge, that will show that he is crazy, but then he won't want the discharge. That's basically what Catch-22 is.The book is filled with memorable characters from Major Major to Milo Minderbinder.

I figured i was going to dislike it very much, and just pretend to read it. The way that Heller mixes fact and comedy blows me away. The details and descriptions of characters and places in this book are almost like watching a movie. Each character is drawn well, and very defined-- I began to feel for a few of them, and reading doesn't usually do that to me. There were a few parts of profanity that I wasn't totally getting a feeling for, but other than that it was good, and well worth the reading. My favorite character happens to be one by the name of Major Major. It is quite the story how he got the name, which you will have to read to find out. His character stuck with me from the first introduction. This book is about crazy people: You're crazy if you want to stay in the war. You're crazy if you want to leave, because you know you won't be able to.

Reading this book is one of life's grand realizations. There is no other novel like it in any other country. It is uniquely American.We all know the story. Yossarian's story.

If there is one book everyone should read atleast once in their life, it's this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. I gave up early on and came back to it after reading one good review after another. The first few hundred pages can be confusing and even dull. Heller's disjointed out-of order story telling technique is very hard to come to grips with. There are some entertaining passages even at the beginning but you have to slog through many dimwitted puns. There are some scenes that are quite funny. The best, in my mind, is a scene near the end, where Yossarian is offered the chance to go home by the Colonels that have been tormenting him. There's only one catch, he has to agree to like them, to be their pal, and say good things about them. This is unacceptable and he chooses instead to run away. Skip the puerile chapter titled \\"Major Major Major Major.\\" The one joke of this insult to the reader's intelligence is the character's name: Major Major Major and the rank he is automatically promoted to on joining the army.It gets better after the slow start and story begins to come together once you get halfway through. Yossarian, or Yo-Yo to his friends, is the unhappy and psychotic bombardier who is the central character of this non-story. He's afraid of dying and is upset that his superiors have repeatedly raised the number of combat missions he must fly before he can go home. His friends are killed while incompetent, evil people are promoted and prosper. The black-marketeers Ex-PFC Wintergreen and especially Milo Minderbinder get rich. He's haunted by the memory of a fellow flyer (Snowden) dying in his arms over Avignon.Whether you think this novel is a good or not, it exists and many people who have never read the book are familiar with the title phrase. Heller uses Yossarian's situation to makes some points about the absurdity of war and, perhaps, of modern life in a Capitalist society. He points out that you are \\"free\\" just as long as you never actually want to use any of your freedom. It's interesting to see a depiction of American soldiers during WWII who have absolutely no patriotic or heroic feelings but are only concerned with saving their skin or perhaps profiting from the situation they are in. Mailer, in The Naked and the Dead, and other authors have expressed these sentiments better. This take on war and American society came to be the norm in the aftermath of the Vietnam War but it probably seemed very subversive when this book came out in 1961."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"You must read this book.

If it's humor you're looking for, then this is a funny, comical book to read with fast-paced, pinpoint dialogue (similar to the slapstick humor in Zuckers/Abrahams/Zuckers movies &quot;Airplane!&quot; or &quot;The Naked Gun&quot;). BUT FUNNY IS SUCH A GROSS UNDERSTATEMENT. Catch 22 is rich with social and political symbolisim, which means if you're looking for something deeper than a &quot;good laugh&quot; there is plenty here to keep you busy thinking for a long time.

It may be the best book on the war, fiction or nonfiction."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller does a great job in piecing together this story. Each anecdote acts as a new puzzle piece. As the story progresses the pieces start to fall into place to form the overall picture: a criticism on the aristocracy of war.If you are into abstract stories that make your mind wonder what the author is truly trying to say, you will love this book. The writing style Heller presents is very unique. It leaves his readers split; you will either love it or hate it. The complexity of this text is better understood when reading it the second time through."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a brilliant satire that plays out like an old war sitcom, such as Hogan's Heroes or M*A*S*H*. The story takes place in an airbase, on a small island off the cost of Italy, during the end of World War II. The sitcom feel comes from the over twenty central characters, each with their own different fears, ambitions, passions, personalities, goals and beliefs. Not to mention each character is INSANE in his own personal way. From the rebellious Yosarrian, who believes everybody is out to kill him, to the capitalistic Milo, who bombs the base himself as a business investment, the misadventures that occur on the island when all these characters try to survive with one another bestows upon the story its sitcom-like charm.The author, Joseph Heller, uses elements such as dark humor, explicit violence, and everything in between to craft this novel. By making you laugh out loud on one page, and then sicken you with disgust on the next, Heller demonstrates the utter insanity of war. He blatantly accuses the government and the military of turning their back on the innocent men they USED to do their dirty work. The generals in Catch-22 are portrayed as irrational, ignorant, and power hungry because they are more concerned with the prestige they may receive than the number of men they pointlessly send to their death.On the whole I would recommend this book because of its ability to be humorous, appalling, and thought provoking all at the same time. By the end, the reader begins to understand the hopelessness of all the characters because they are not evil men, but the war forces them to choose between doing evil and being killed."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In order to find out how complicated this book is, you must first read it. However, after having read it and having struggled through many parts of the book, you find the book not very complicated anymore.Since many reviews have been written about the plot and characters of this marvelous book, I will proceed to write my feelings after reading it.Heller has done a great job of writing a book that basically satirizes World War II. This book is very complex, with its many plot twists and flashbacks, but not complex enough that readers will lose control of the main picture he is trying to paint. Readers young and old alike will be awed by the cruelty of the last world war while laughing through many other parts of the book. The amazing range of emotions regarding the book is what truly makes it a masterpiece.However, I must warn that readers will not be able to comprehend the full comical effect of the \\"profoundness\\" of this book very easily, as it requires a much higher level of reading than most other popular books."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Ok, I can see how the cynics could get all deep and delve through the mixed messages of war and rank in this novel, and how the contradictions could be seen as frustrating, but, as far as I'm concerned, this is the best book ever written, better that Don Quixote and the Bible combined (though I've read neither). Here's what I think. I don't think the book was hard to get through. I read it very quickly the first time, although, I later went through it a second time with a dictionary, circling the words I wasn't familiar with (of which there are plenty) and wrote their definitions in the margins. Now, whenever I am bored, I can just grab this book, open it to a random page, start reading, and laugh and laugh and it will never get old because the contradictions and the nonsense are the exact ingredients that make life itself a never ending roller coaster. A bit over the top? Ah, who cares, it's not like this is The New York Times. Don't be afraid of this book. Read it, but make sure you keep an open mind because the moment you insert a prejudice or a preconceived idea of right or wrong you WILL get angry and throw the book and you may end up hurting a pet or loved one."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is widely regarded as the classic masterpiece for all comic warfare novels. It cleanly addresses the pointlessness of trying to escape war, as well as topics such as bureacracy, hypocrisy, and captitalism. It has a cynical, sarcastic style of writing that is sometimes hard to trudge through however. Yet while using this style, Joseph Heller has perfect control of where he wants the story to go; what he wants you (the reader) to feel. Through the eyes of the sometimes crazy Yossarian, we see that no matter what he does, he cannot escape flight duty during World War II. Yossarian flies at maximum altitude to evade German anti-aircraft \\"flak\\", changes flight maps, destroys the cockpits radio, even fakes illness to get out of flying. An antagonist of the story, Colonel Cathcartt, keeps raising the number of missions required to fly before the pilots can be honorably discharged. This really ticks off the reader as well as many pilots, even driving one to have violent nightmares. I would recommend this book to individuals thinking about joining the military because of its exposure to a different side of war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's classic, Catch-22, is a very intriguing novel that I would suggest to anyone. Though the book is about war, extensive knowledge of history is not needed to love this book. Catch-22 is written in a different manner than other war novels. Set in WWII, the novel continually moves from the hilarity of the personal situations between the soldiers and the horrors that all involved in war face.People generally agree about the validity of WWII. Catch-22 presents a side of it that is rarely seen. Heller's protagonist, Capitan Yossarian, hates the war and takes it personally. Throughout the novel, Yossarian constantly wonders why he is risking his own life for people that will eventually die anyway. Everything has a \\"Catch-22\\"- it is impossible for him to feel that he is in the war for good reasons, but he must stay there or he will be punished. I feel that it is beneficial to see both sides of the issue. Catch-22 is very interesting in that it shows us a unique perspective that diverges from the norm."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is Joseph Heller's satire that pokes fun at the military. In it, the army has absolute power, dictating the lives and fates of the men in its power. The military constantly increases the required missions for the men. Colonel Cathcart, the person who raises the mission requirement, is risking the lives of his men in order to impress his superior officers. This reflects the futility of their situation. The reason they risk their lives is not to help the country. Instead, they fight for the greed and ambitions of one man.The main character, Yossarian, is constantly afraid that he is going to die. People think he is insane, but the fact that he wants to leave and survive makes him possibly the sanest person there. Each chapter in the novel centers around another character in the military (though, with few exceptions, everything leads back to Yossarian and his plight). From Major Major Major's issues with his name to Colonel Scheisskopf's fixation with parades, these characters and their situations are very interesting and amusing.While hilarious and amusing, Catch-22 does have a deeper meaning. It talks of the futility of war and the powerlessness that men can have against bureaucracies such as the military. Yossarian's reflections on life and morality in the midst of chaos are surprisingly deep."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is one of those books that everyone ought to read, because it is so effective at chronicling one of the strangest sides of the human condition. The book is hilarious throughout; the result of this is that it's much easier and more fun to read than most anti-war books, and the violence and horror are much more affecting. Absurdist and pointed at the same time, this book is much more potent than many other more serious war novels. Heller's writing style is not very literary, but it gives the book more of an urgency and a realism. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In the beginning, we are introduced to the protagonist, Yossarian, and the situation based in the last part of WWII. It is difficult to keep from chuckling out loud while reading about the many desperate attempts of the squadron to escape the gruesome and violent conditions of the war. Somehow, Joseph Heller incorporates a light-hearted, humorous tone into a melancholy situation. By claiming to be sick and insane, the men buy time away from the dangerous flights, but the captain just keeps sending them on more required missions before they can be sent home. This actually holds the pilots in the captivity of the war until they complete the continuous assignments. With these discouraging conditions, Yossarian endures many difficult experiences, including the death of his friend. The ending is technically a happy ending but the reader is left with a feeling of despondence. Though I began the book expecting it to be more of a male's favorite, I was surprised at my enjoyment of this action-packed, humorous novel. This book deserves a four because it is hard to put down, but not my favorite."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is one of the greatest novels written in the 20th Century. Heller's sense of absurdity and pacing is remarkable. His understanding of the double standards created by greed and dishonesty give depth and meaning to a world hungry for answers. His style is not lost on a new generation of writers: David Sedaris for one has mastered the wit of satire. A new writer, John Orozco in his DELANO, pays tribute to Heller with rapid fire dialogues that are reminiscent of CATCH-22. These satires are valuble in exposing hypocrisy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Is it possible for a book to merit all the above adjectives above? Yes, if it is Catch-22; in the setting of World War II, Heller depicts the sheerwaste and tragedy for humans, when 'nations' are at war. Catch-22 seeks to show the waste exemplified by the War , without ever depicting a direct attack by theenemy, the Germans. The protagonist of the book, Yossarian, sees through the sham that war is, and questions his superiors relentlesslyabout their ideas of patriotism, when it is he who is going to die 'for the country'. the novel moves back and forth in time, throughevents and from the farcical to the tragic at a machine-gun pace. Yet within this seeming disarray, atale builds up- in the end you wonder who the real enemy is - the Germans orYossarian's superiors"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's timeless classic, Catch-22, is amazing. Hellercrafts an upside-down, senselessly sensible world whereeveryone but the main character, Yossarian, is sane. Or isYossarian the only sane one? Decide for yourself when youread the book. The novel is endlessly funny, pointedlyrevealing and gleefully rambunctious, filled with inherentcontradiction that somehow makes perfect sense. It's beenone of my personal favorites for years and will remain sofor many to come. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is perhaps one of the best post WW2 books ever written. The style is unique in that Joseph Heller writes in a circular maner rather than the traditional linear style common with Western authors. It can best be compared with the oral traditions of the Native American story tellers. The characters are unforgettable and the plot fresh. Trully a brilliant master piece"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What is the message or moral?Joseph Heller is trying portray the message that life is worth living. The American system is corrupt. There is not a point to fighting for a country that does not fight for him. It is closely related to Greek myth of Sisyphus. As Sisyphus pushes a boulder up a hill in Hades, it rolls back to earth. He continues to do this into eternity since there is no end to his task.Did he say it well?Heller's message was shown very well. Characterization was excellent. The reader is able to sympathize with Yossarian, the main character. As the number of missions to be flown rises, so does Yossarians desire to escape and go home. The reader is supposed to be able to identify Yossarian and his life with their own. Yossarian tries convincing the doctor that he is insane so he doesn't have to fly. It doesn't work because of Catch 22. He'd be insane to want to fly, and sane to know that he was doing something insane.Heller's values also came through in the symbolism used in the book. The dying fighter, Snowden, represents Yossarians own death. Snow (Snowden) is also white, representing the absence of color and life. When Yossarian walks around the air base in the nude, it represents his rebirth.Was it worth saying?The message was worth saying. Joseph Heller showed America how pointless it can be to fight for a cause. Yet Yossarian faught for his own cause: to live. He wanted to live and enjoy the rest of his life instead of being one of the many killed or lost in action"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"You have to be a certain type of person to like this novel. I imagine many people are that type of person. I am not.For me, the problem with Catch-22 was that Heller never developed the characters in a way that made me like or dislike or otherwise feel a certain way about them. Most of his descriptions of the characters focused on superficial qualities; he hardly developed the *character* of the characters (other than Major Major) at all.These superficial traits, however, do not have universal appeal. Different people have different opinions of these superficial qualities, and my opinions are evidently very different from Heller's.Take General Peckem. It was obvious that Peckem was supposed to be the epitome of annoying characters in the novel, based on his name alone. Yet, when we finally met him, I hardly found him annoying at all. In fact, I found him rather efficient.Maybe there's a certain honesty about not presenting characters in a way designed to influence the reason's opinion of them. But Catch-22 is a satire, and a satire depends on the reader feeling a certain way about the characters. Much of the satire didn't work for me because I didn't share Heller's feelings about the charaters.Now, having said all that, I will say that I think most people, especially military and other action types, will share Heller's opinions, and will understand the satire.The other problem I had with Catch-22 is it's lack of temporal continuity. It seemed that you could read most of the chapters in the book in any order and it would make just as much sense, which is not much. Also, there was a ridiculous overuse of a certain figure of speech (mostly used to describe Milo).On the good side, the book was quite funny, and the satire was amusing where it made sense to me."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is incredible; I've enjoyed reading it and re-reading many times since my first copy when I was in 8th grade (I'm now 62)I wanted to purchase this classic novel to carry on my Kindle but ... the Kindle edition is more than the paperback edition.I will not buy with this pricing policy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I don't presume to add much to the varied and detailed reviews of the book, except perhaps for an observation on how a popular work esteemed by one generation simply may not transcend its own time.Like many, I first read Catch-22 many years ago in high school. I don't believe it was assigned; rather, it was one of those revolutionary, counter-cultural books that you just HAD to read (Like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). At the time, the Vietnam War was winding down, the \\"counter-culture\\" had come and was rapidly going, and unbounded faith in the wisdom and integrity of authority (especially governmental authority) seemed dubious, at best. Although it was published a number of years prior to that, Catch-22 seemed a brilliant evocation of everything we KNEW was wrong with authority, the govenment, war (read, Vietnam) and capitalism. War was wasteful, individuals were largely pawns in a much bigger game, rapacious capitalists would deal with either or both sides to make a buck, and the underlying logic of the entire equation could only be described as \\"absurd,\\" or, perhaps, a rational man could only grasp the world, and continue to function with his reason intact, if he came to appreciate absurdity.I still believe Catch-22 brilliantly makes all of these points. I will never forget, for example, Milo Minderbinder's seemely bizarre schemes to make money for the \\"syndicate\\" by cornering the market in cotton and trying to produce from it something edible, or contracting with the other side to bomb his own army. Similarly, the concept of Catch-22 (only a crazy man would want to fly more missions, and if you are crazy, we can't let you fly more missions; but you don't want to fly more missions, so you're not crazy, so you have to fly) has become a part of the language, though I'm not sure everyone who uses the term these days (fewer do) could explain its meaning or origin. Finally, I love the idea that, because time seems to pass more quickly when you are bored, the best way to extend your life is to bore yourself unmercifully.All of that being said, I do believe that many of the more negative reviews of the book result from our familiarity with so much of the political landscape of the book that, 40 years ago or more, seemed positively shocking, if not revolutionary. Ours is not an especially revolutionary time, so Heller's absurdity, on the one hand, seems a bit out of step. More than that, it is no longer new; we've heard it all before. Reading Catch-22 now seeems a bit like listening to an overly long joke that we've heard too many times. Finally, it is hard for us to appreciate how unique the book seemed in the '60s and 70's as a critique of war, especially a critique of World War II--the Last Good War of the Great Generation. Before Heller, the literature coming out of WWII, despite depictions of avarice or cruelty or waste, had none the less esteemed that war as a great and good thing that, in pertinant part, overthrew an evil dictator and freed (part of) Europe, etc. It was shocking to see THAT war depicted in THIS way.I only came to indulge in this review because, recently, I thought I would re-read the book. I was hoping I would find it fresh and funny and insightful (as I remembered it). I was disappointed. It was still occasionally funny and made many of the points I remembered. But the disjointed nature of the narrative seemed confusing and indulgent, whereas I remembered it as groundbreaking. And much of the book left me rather cold. It seemed long-winded, and repetitive (because we really did get the point), and many of the characters seem as if they are there only to set up a joke or make a point and they are not especially real or multidimensional.In any case, I would still recommend reading the book. Like many \\"popular\\" or \\"political\\" books, however, to really appreciate it requires casting your mind back to a different time and looking at it from that perspective. Without doing so, it is hard to realize how unique and deservedly influential the book was. On the other hand, if you cannot or will not approach the book from that perspective (and it is certainly no sin if you cannot), I'm afraid a new reader will find himself agreeing with the more negative reviews on this site. That seems a shame, even though I can hardly imagine Heller or any of his earliest readers contemplating that the book would ever be a historical curiosity or an expression of the mind-set of its day rather than a penetrating satire."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I just finished reading this book, and it was definitely a chore. I was very disappointed with it because it's widely hailed as a great and 'hilarious' work of classic fiction and I saw it as exactly the opposite.Once again, as with many books I've read, the foreword wasn't really worth reading. It should have been an afterword because it basically described the process of getting the book published along with all the successes and obstacles therein. As with almost every foreword, it contained some amount of spoilers which dismayed me because I prefer to find such things out myself. Those curious about the history behind the book or folks who have read the book before and bought the new copy would find it useful.After reading the first three chapters, I was wondering when the book would begin to be funny and enthralling. I was constantly confused about what was happening and most of the \\"Jokes\\" fell flat. The book is intentionally written in a manner that makes the reader dig deep to link events together, which I personally didn't care for. I felt like I was watching \\"Lost\\" by the way everything was spread out and the beginning of the book in particular offers tiny pieces of the plot through seemingly incongruous events.As I tried to get into the book, I developed a strong distaste for the writing style and I had to force myself through this book most of the time. There were only a few parts that I found funny, but I was mostly disappointed by the real lack of any climactic action whatsoever. The reviews I had read about this book had me expecting a hilarious thrill ride but it's almost half dialogue apart from tons of unnecessary descriptions and a smattering of fistfights and actual combat.I think that Heller's sense of humor was lost on me. This book is a riot if you love reading the same thing over and over again. When the reader isn't trying to figure out which character is terrified about which or waiting to find the significance of an event, the dialogue drones on and the paradoxes and contradictions that make the heart of the book pop up incessantly and contribute absolutely nothing to the story. I did find some parts funny, but those parts were far too few to be redeeming. I do not consider this book to be especially funny, and I do not think that the humor of the book should be mentioned in most of the quotes and synopses on the back cover or in the Amazon.com description. I could see it being a bit better in movie format because of how important the tone and delivery of the dialogue is, but I have not seen the film nor do I intend to. If you disagree with my sentiment, then take into consideration that I found the Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger to be the funniest novel I've ever read and blame my sense of humor for that.The characters were pretty well developed, and with all the description the reader knows about every freckle or wart on their faces. Some of them were funny or surprising at first, but the way every person is involved in nearly every event makes juggling all the names and facts exhausting at first. As the story goes on and the plotline jumps wildly around, I think that some readers would have to have a pen and paper ready to take notes as things progress tiny bits at a time while the focus is on a different subject. Luckily, everything is restated several times and if you missed anything the first time, you're sure to see it pop up again and again.I think that the main reason why I didn't like this book was the fact that in reading through it I had effectively read the same thing twice, if not several times with all the repetition. The secondary reason is that my expectations of this book were simply too high and I didn't appreciate the way life and death were so inconsequential, and insignificant events and errors were blown out of proportion. I understand that the book is meant to be partly satirical about the military and about that very portrayal of such skewed priorities, but such a piece of writing is simply not for me. I don't feel that this book is deserved at all of its reputation and I would never consider buying the sequel or recommending it to a friend.I saw fit to rate it two stars because it is not entirely without good qualities, but I couldn't help but wonder why the book couldn't have been written in chronological order. I suppose that that quality is part of the charm, but I would have preferred a less repetitive book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"While some might sing their praises of Joseph Heller and his \\"masterpiece\\" in the book Catch-22, one should not be so quick to join in unless a serious examination of the book has been undergone. There is a premise for greatness in this book, a foundation upon which Heller could have created a truly wonderful piece of literature, both comical and unobtrusive into the morals of those who read it, but this is not the case.The book is downright hilarious at times, mournful at others, and downright disturbing in parts. Many sections of Catch-22 will have the reader cracking up with laughter, as Heller uses his wit to full effect in the many characters which fill the pages of Catch-22, from hated generals to deaf pilots; one cannot help but smile at their antics. Likewise, the book takes place during World War Two, and therefore is forced to take a somber mood as sanity is slowly ripped away from those exposed to war for too long, and terrible accidents claim the lives of young soldiers. The character Yossarian the cowardly bombardier, claims the reader's full attention with his witty attempts to stay grounded and out of the flak filled skies of Europe. He is able to conjure up many a sickness yet undiscovered by mankind which keep him in the hospital, but is incapable of finding a way home, as the loathsome Catch-22 keeps virtually everyone in service regardless of physical or mental ailment. One will begin to feel a burning hate for the superior officers of Yossarian who are continually adding on to the staggering number of flights each person must endure before a much hoped for trip home, and yet still be able to laugh at them. The book, told from the view point of the mentally disturbed Yossarian, takes all concepts of what should be right or wrong and twists them so that one must reevaluate just exactly what is the correct course of action for Yossarian to take as to whether or not he should remain patriotic and continue to unwillingly serve his country.These feelings cannot cover up the sense of disgust that sits deep in the pit of the reader's stomach however, as the book is fraught with sexually explicit encounters, which are present in nearly every chapter, and which detract from the overall enjoyment of reading. Whorehouse scenes take the formerly comical, or formerly somber feelings and ruin any previous enjoyment of the book that was extant. Seemingly unnecessary hotel room depictions degenerate the most interesting portions of plot and throw them into the gutters.The book is by all means an interesting read, with all the qualities of being a great book, but before it is recommended so freely to all who enjoy literature, the warning should be set in place that this book is filled with portrayals of immoral and tasteless actions as if they were supposed to cause mirth in the reader. Interesting is all this book can conjure up, not magical and unforgettable reading, nothing which the younger minds should be exposed to, but simply interesting."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I had seen the movie a couple of times, for better or worse, before reading this top-ten most important 20th century American novel.While the book is more complete, I think in some ways the movie does a better job of illustrating the madness of war; &quot;Catch-22,&quot; the novel, does not rely so much on graphic depictions of blood and gore as it does on the unfairness of circumstance and the fear and pointlessness of men killing other men over the colors of their flags. (How many German and Italian soldiers were facists at heart? Most, I reckon, were young and impressionable and filled with fear over what would happen to them if they refused to fight.)Of course, WWII was an unavoidable war, one we fought bravely and righteously -- Heller's novel doesn't openly dispute that. What &quot;Catch-22&quot; does in a groundbreaking way, though, is point a spotlight on some of the absurd, from-the-top-down, morally questionable and out-of-public-view actions of war that lead to innocent men, women and children (on both sides of the border) suffering and of course dying. Some of these actions -- repeatedly upping the required number of missions after the quota's been met, using military connections and materiel in the act of selling or trading black market goods for private profit, war-related corporate benefits, private goals of officers that involve men going in harm's way -- may be more associated with our conflicts in Vietnam and Iraq than WWII.The only valor in this novel exists in the idea of getting out alive; after all, the enemies are not the Germans so much as the commanding officers. Interpreted more deeply, &quot;Catch-22&quot; could be considered a comment on corporate structure and the use of men as pawns in the top-level games played by the players and power brokers of America. (For more on that subject, see &quot;Life Askew,&quot; available at Amazon.com.)The first 100 pages of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is a series of character sketches, some hilarious, some maddening -- there's a very stream-of-consciousness aspect to what little narrative structure exists. (Heller breaks so many storytelling rules and gets away with it!) Madness, folks. It's about madness. The story, what there is of it, really takes shape in the second half -- the more satisfying half of the novel, more structured and less antic.Like The Grapes of Wrath and 1984, Catch-22 is an important cautionary tale. Read it if you would rather live on your feet than die on your knees."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Last summer, I read this book somewhat reluctantly. I figured I should read more classic books like that for my own personal literacy level, not suspecting I would enjoy it overmuch. However, after about 10 pages, I was delighted to find that reading it was one of the better experiences of my sedentary life. Sure, it's long, but regretfully not long enough, for it is so glorious that I wish it would not end. And now I make it a tradition to re-read Catch 22 every summer (along with the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series, which I also highly recommend).Joseph Heller brings us over 40 characters, each with distinctive attributes. The plot is jumpy, but for some reason, it works. Heller keeps what is usually a mundane subject exceptionally interesting, and truly proves that writing is an art. Read this. It's funny too."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller classic is very well written, it contains wittiness, funny situations, and other life threating ones. Written at the time of world war two and lived in Europe.The book is not always easy to follow, since it jumps from one thing to another, but that what makes it even better, and more interesting to continue reading.Yossarian, the main character is just something else. He tries in everyway to get out of the war, he spends a lot of time in the hospital pretending to be ill, he even pretends to be the son of another family who has been greatly injuired in the war...A classic to be read..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"We read \\"Catch-22\\" in our \\"alternative\\" high school back in the 60's. It was just as the Viet Nam War was rising to its shocking crest, people were rioting in the streets, the young were questioning everything and rebelling, the draft was taking older brothers and friends, and it was a very crazy time. We asked the teacher who selected the novel and who had served in World War II \\"Is this an accurate representation of the madness of war?\\" He replied that, in his experience, it was.After recently re-reading Heller's novel, I realized that this book wasn't, as we had studied it, just about the madness of war. Sure, that was foremost on our minds at the time the book was published. But Heller really caught the moral dilemma of an individual caught up in the mob hysteria of war, where the rules of civilization and laws are temporarily and deliberately suspended by the authorities.The key paragraph, for me, is: \\"Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.\\" In other words, Man is no more than meat and bone EXCEPT for a brief period when he is alive...and if he does something to preserve his soul. This is deep and perceptive.At the end of \\"Catch-22\\", Yossarian is faced with a tempting choice. He has, however, learned something from the horrors and insanity. His decision takes into account not only his personal safety, but goes beyond to the greater good. He has risen.For that reason, \\"Catch-22\\" is more than just an amusing novel, a bestseller and the novel that gave birth to M*A*SH*. Yossarian's moral dilemma is one each of us must ponder, whenever we choose to go to war. I think this is one of the best 100 American novels"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"At first I thought this book ridiculous. No one is as whacked as these characters. Then I started to recognize my own flaws. I saw that the ridiculous characters have the same flaws we all have, only exaggerated in the book. The Chief believes he will die of pneumonia so he does not bother to wear a coat. Of course he gets sick and dies of pneumonia. How many times have we lost before we started because we thought we could never win? We defeat ourselves as the Chief did. I saw myself in other characters too. Heller shows us our own tragic flaws through a cast of ridiculous, but quite realistic characters. Everyone should read this book. It is funny, sad, ridiculous and brilliant."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22, it has to be the funniest book I have ever read. The title it self, is a law in the army that has many parts. One of the parts is to get discharged from the army, you have to be crazy. To say you are crazy, you have to ask the the doctor to keep you on the ground, but as soon as you say your crazy and want to be grounded, Catch-22 says you have to be sane to say your crazy so therefore you have to continue. The book is about a fleet of bombers that are bombing cities in Germany. They are constantly made to bomb The whole book was filled with crazy people, like Dunbar, he would do things he hated doing, because it would make time go by slowley. Dunbar thought this would make his life longer. Orr, had to be one of the wierdest guys out there with his stories about putting crabapples in his cheeks or the protitude that hit him with a shoe. The book is mostly composed of learning about characters and then their stories add on to a plot line indirectly. Throughout the book, it reveals more and more of a plot, about escaping war. I recomend this book to everyone who has a sense of humor and enjoy books about war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"this is one hilarious story with some of the most memorable lines i have ever read in a book! great read!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a comedic story that keeps you on your toes because of the hilarious actions and reactions preformed by those who are trying to escape the imfamous &quot;Catch-22.&quot; This catch makes it impossible for Yossarian and the other members of his squadron to go home. Everyone wants to be grounded or sent home so they don't have to fly dangerous missions. You can go home if your crazy, but anyone smart enough to say that they're crazy so that they can go home, is really sane. Along with Catch-22 keeping them in the service, a seemingly infinite amount of required missions also keeps the bombardiers in the air. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone ready for a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"At first I thought this book had a pretty slow pace to it, but once I got beyond Heller's style, I found it to be a very humorous and entertaining depiction-or mockery-of our country's military, and of the way people in general tend to think. It has a lot of good insight into the decisions we, as humans, tend to make, and of the effects our constant need for approval will have on our lives. Great book...I haven't laughed so hard in a long time!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In Joseph Heller's WWII story, Catch 22, we the readers are given a less than perfect picture of the realities of war. By showing the ironic and irrational events that take place during a war we are able to see why the main character, Yossarian, hates war, and tries his best to stay out of it as much as possible. Heller is able to produce a comic effect throughout the book by telling of some of the crazy stunts that Yossarian does in his attempt to live forever or die trying as he puts it. Yossarian fakes ever possible illness he knows, he makes himself and others sick and finally outright refuses to fly any longer. But in the end he must decide if he wants to risk the lives of others, or his own. The mess of other characters also adds to the humor of the work by showing the effects of war on all different types of people.This book was written excellently, and paints a very vivid imagine in my mind. The only thing slightly difficult about the book was the fact that Heller skipped around throughout the book, never going in order.For all those who think war is always the right way to go, don't read this. But I would recommend this for those who always wondered what it's really like to look death in the face, for this book is able to present it in a comical tone while still keeping it serious."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller writes Catch-22 to show how abusrd and pointless the idea of war is. Yossarian is an American bomber in Europe during WWII. Being sane and intelligent Yossarian tries to get out of his duty to stay in the war as a bomber. He tries to use the idea that he is insane and get a letter from the doctor to prevent him from flying. The doctor says if you are insane, then they have to ground you and anyone who is flying in the war and doesn't try to get out is insane, but the minute you want to stop flying or get out of the war, you are sane so you have to continue to fly.The characters in this book also portray how in a war you have some people that are only looking out for themselves and want to make a profit. One character in particular who sticks out is named Milo Minderbinder. Milo will do anything in order to make a profit. And, &quot;with Minderbinder enterprises everyone owns a share.&quot; But when someone wants to claim that share they get an interesting surprise. Overall Catch-22 is an amazing book and is a must read in order to know where the phrase Catch-22 comes from."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I just read some of the reviews which give this book only one star, and it amazes me how people can give up on a story just because its not structured like a normal story, and it dares critcize war and the military. Most people complain that the story had too many characters and no order. That's the point of the book. The point was to give the reader a story so adsurd and crazy that in reading it you gain insight into what it may have been like to be serving in the military in WWII or any war for that matter. I have never served for my country and respect all the soliders present and past who have fought either for America or against it. Stories like this and Slaughter House 5 really represent how pointless and absurd war really is. One reviewer said this book was \\"replete with needless descriptions, and depraved immortality.\\" Funny, I always that war was the best example of depraved immortality."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"At first I was skeptical. After hearing mixed reviews on the book, I wasn't sure if I could weather 450+ pages of nonsense. But I found the book to be a literary adventure, and a mentally stimulating experience. At one point, I found myself feeling almost as delirious as the characters in the book, only to realize that I may be the only one with my head screwed on properly. The book opens a gateway into the mind of humans as we strive to survive in this world of unexpected outcomes. And as you will see, Yossarian lives."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 was written by Joseph Heller. The book was excellent. It was a novel that showed the bad side of war. It starts out with the protagonist of the story Yossarian, in World War 2. Yossarian may be fighting in the war but he disagrees with it all the way. He tries to get out of the army anyway he can. He first tries to fake sick, but then that fails. He then tries to change the bombing map but that only worked for a little time. All of these things just delay his bomb runs. He later finds out that one of the officiers has raised the number of bomb runs so he runs back to the hospital again. Thats why the book is so great. He tries so hard to get out of the army. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who likes war stories, or just wants a great book to read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"First of all, it is necessary to notify potential readers unfamiliar with this book that the writing style is very colloquial and the humor quirky. If you are looking for high-brow writing, I would say you are probably not looking in the right place. The author has a very conversational tone that verges on stream-of-consciousness writing.If you have seen the (1960's era?) movie, don't let that affect your decision to read this book. I thought the movie was OK, and it certainly followed the story mostly, but there was too much in the book to faithfully transfer the characters to film. Of course, this criticism stands for most books that turn into movies...The book, as I mentioned, has a very off-beat narrative style. Heller is very funny, but I don't think his sense of humor could be considered traditional. That said, When I read the book the imagery was so rich, and the dialogue and situations so crisp, that I could not help but laugh out loud on the BART (the local public transit system).Catch-22 mostly reads as a collection of stories about different interrelated characters. The book also does not have an entirely linear timeline-I'd guess that about one quarter of the book mostly relates to flashbacks the main character has.If you believe, like me, that great literature comes in many shapes and sizes, I can't think of a book that I can recommend more highly.As an interesting side-note, Heller mentioned on at least one occasion that the characters in Catch-22 were completely fictitious. He did serve in the military, but he never had anything but praise for his collleagues and superior officers.YOSSARIAN LIVES!!!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"That catch-22 is a very funny and insane book. Why i say it is insane is because it reveal the truth about the Wars an the views of Men. The characters in the book are in the War but non of them knows why they are there fighting so they are totally crazy as they are flying to bomb and kill the people. The main character, Yossarians, is the one we can say is the craziest of all, but,in my opinion,he is the one with the clearest state of mind to judge the war. Because he is the one who is trying to avoid the wars and refuse to fly. Milo who is a mess officer who is trying to do business out of the war and really make popular and success in the book. And the other characters are also very interesting and make you to think that if it is possible that people who in the war really look like them. The most interesting of all is &quot;the catch&quot; that is catch-22 in which people are trapped. It says, &quot;Yossarrians can be allowed to stop flying if he is crazy but then he has to ask the doctor to ground him, then he is not crazy when is asked then he can not be grounded.&quot; Isn't it crazy and confused?As the story goes on, the real purpose of the wars is becoming more clear, the more the stupid the wars become, and the sad the story become.As an Asian, I found that book is really difficult to understand but it will become more and more interesting and exciting in the end. So keep reading and you will find it really funny and insane or may be sad in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The first chapter of Catch 22 will either repel or enthrall the reader. Heller's emphasis on dialogue, combined with his ironic sense of humor and a set of absurd premises, makes for a writing style that is galaxies away from any other. Rapid scenario shifts keep the interested reader on his toes, although they will confuse and turn off anyone who's only marginally focused on the book.One potential problem for many is the book's lack of an obvious plot line. It reads more as a chronicle of a man's experiences told out of sequence than a story of his accomplishment. Certainly, many hints are given; however, it is not until the very end of the novel that the reader realizes that the novel concerns not a specific action but a specific mindset--namely, the mindset of a sane man who merely wishes to retain his sanity in the face of those whose sole purpose is to destroy it.The novel's only major flaw is its ending--not so much the content, but the style. The sappiness is what one would expect from Hollywood, and the abruptness makes the reader wonder if Heller didn't suddenly realize that he had a deadline to beat and had to end the novel right away. However, the ending is not reached until the end, and so all through the preceding pages the experience of reading Catch 22 remains flawless."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This isn't the type of book who's rating tends mainly on opinion. But more on how you read and studied it. While as everyone says it's a war novel, it's a metaphor on corporate America. It is a difficult read, but if you study it it will prove worthwhile. Reading with someone who knows the book also helps. It does help you become well read because of it's being one of a kind. You learn from it, not every book's hero is the ultimate anti-hero. Not every book is a paradox upon it's self.This could be read just for the humour. When you think about it though you wonder, why am I laughing, this is so dark. It's the way of writing only expert authors such as Heller can do that makes the book that way.Who you are also is necessart for the book. You need to be well read to begin with to get the most from it. You need to be willing to take your time. You need to not care if there are 5 pages where the characters swear 24 times. You need to be able to deal with this book. You could be a 13 year old mature high-school student or a 30 (or 50) year old adult. You need the inner maturity and perserveriance to do this book what it disearves."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"While I was reading this book, I couldn't help but crack up. In class people would look at me oddly and then I would have to explain what was going on and then they would be laughing too. The way Heller presents these incredibly eccentric people is ingenius. His third person narrator is very matter of fact, though more compassionate toward some than others.The story starts out with Yossarian in the hospital flirting with the nurses and screwing around with his pal Dunbar until an annoyingly patriotic (but extremely likable) Texan moves in and pushes them all back out into war. The actual plot takes awhile to get going, but there is not a single boring page in this book. It is one of the funniest things I have ever read, and one of the most profound. It attacks bureaucracy, questions and ponders religion, and deals with ever present death. Honestly one of the best books I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh but wants to think too."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22: the only thing that can define a book that seethes with paradox, contradiction, and twisted reasoning. The novel is set in the closing months of the Second World War, on a little island off the coast of Italy. Heller skillfully depicts a generation of people who are used against their will and the sheer helplessness of their resistance to the system. What makes this piece of literature so clever is how Heller uses his characters, which seem so real, to create many instances of contradiction and questionable logic. For example, Major Major, who will only see people in his office he himself is not in it. Or Commanding Officers who care more about well shot aerial photographs of bomb targets than actually bombing the target. And the most twisted contradiction of all: the main character's (Yossarian) iron will to survive the war, or die trying.The novel stays fresh by unfolding many side stories that involve Yossarian's relationship with other characters. This, of course, tells the reader more about the men in the Bomber Division, but it also reveals more about Yossarian himself and his attempts to get himself out of as many missions as possible. Other characters present many of the recurring themes in the novel, such as faith. The division's chaplain, Chaplain Tappman, spends all his time preaching from the Good Book in hospitals and to the men, but at the same time, doubts everything he says, and the Lord's existence. Also, Yossarian's superior officers reveal the absolute weakness of language: while it offers no reassurance to those facing death, or those who could meet it, it offers the power of officers to trap their men in a hopeless prison of the army or in a grander scheme of things, bureaucracy.By the time I finished this book, I was again presented with another contradiction: while this book is serious, sad, and incredibly thought-provoking, it's quite the funny read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is an exciting and sometimes confusing adventure about a WWII bomber named Yossarian, and his atempts to get out of the war alive. I read this book for pleasure. I recomend reading this book if you are looking for a great book about as crazy as a book can be. The first couple chapters of Catch-22 and some vocabulary may be a little daunting to the reader, but the book is well worth the time to read.This book was amazing. I do not think I have ever read any thing this funny one minute then horrifying the next. The book is funny in how the world around Yossarian seems totaly absurd and impossible. Unfortunatly in a military setting Catch-22 may also be shockingly closer to reality then first presumed.

When you read Mr. Heller's work, you are waxed into the setting and see-saw back and forth between the same pivotal scenes over and over again--living life the way that Yossarian does. For anyone that dislikes this novel, I recommend watching the movie one time. It will resolve some of the questions I have seen in other people's reviews.I do not recommend watching the movie INSTEAD of reading the book.

Its cynical circular comedy is captivating. Only the narrow-minded can classify this book as nothing more than an &quot;anti-war&quot; book. It is just as much about human behavior, hierarchical organizations, survival, and happiness. I particularly enjoyed all the parts about Milo, the one-man international commercial machine (although everyone owns a share).

I guess either you like Catch-22 or you don't; you &quot;get it&quot; or you don't. I certainly don't mean to say that if you don't &quot;get it&quot; you're dumb, either. Quite the contrary.

It is simply one of the most tedious, poorly-written books I've ever read. It makes its point well within the first 100 pages, then spends the next 300 plus pages beating you over the head making the same point. War is hell, the military bureaucracy is tedious and illogical, war profiteering (capitalism?)is evil, there is no God, there are bigots in the world (and half of them are in Yossarian's chain of command), blah blah blah. The characters are shallow, cold, and completely unlikeable - perhaps none more so than our poor, put-upon Capt. Yossarian, although I don't think that was the author's intent. I appreciate the literary device of absurdity as much as anyone, but its overuse in this novel struck me as...well, absurd."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Mark Twain said that a classic is a book that everybody praises but nobody reads. I'd like to add that a classic is often praised now because it was praised in the past. Some classics are timeless and can make their point in any period, but others are useful for a certain amount of time then lose their effectiveness. \\"Catch-22\\" clearly falls into the second category. When this book was written back in the 50's it was necessary to give the world a reaction to the mythology of World War II. The soldiers in the war were still being worshipped as perfect humans with a perfect love for their country and unlimited bravery and courage to save the world. Surely some of the soldiers were not so perfect and that's what Joseph Heller shows us in this book. In the character of Yossarian, we have a WWII soldier who was not the epitome of courage, but a slacker and malcontent who did everything he could to get out of his duty. But Heller takes this way too far as the book becomes an extremely repetitive parade of soldiers who do nothing but try to weasel their way out of service or stab each other in the back; and officers who are inept bureaucrats who are under-qualified for their positions of authority and are focused on their own self-interest rather than winning the war. With this never-ending parade of idiots, Heller not only makes the statement that some of the fighting men in WWII were not up to the stereotypical ideal. He keeps on repeating the implication that they were ALL unworthy. He makes this point early on but fails to expand on it other than beating it to death repeatedly. While \\"Catch-22\\" is still useful as a good example of non-conformist and subversive literature, it has aged badly.

What Heller did was to spawn others to do the same, such as the novel \\"Castle Keep\\", which was better, and the movies Mash and Kelly's Heroes.The protagonist, and antagonist is a W.W.II bombardier who finds himself at the breaking point. Along with bombing missions his other mission is to find a way out of the war. It doesn't help that the Generals keep adding more missions onto the squadron's quota. We find our way into the hospital quite often through this read. The characters are unordinary, finding any way they can to divert and diverge themselves from the war; we discover entrepreneurs, maniacs, ridicule, capitalists, ineptness........ but rarely normalcy.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Stop changing the rules.That is what the title refers to - that fact that you need to successfully complete a number of missions to get out of the war, but when you get close, the nasty people in charge keep upping the number.This is a black comedy that follows our protagonist as he tries to get by while stuck in this ugly war situation with a bunch of crazy and going crazy fellow military, locals and other whacky people around the place.Both funny and bleak at once.Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When looking at the book, it looks like they had to cut down a whole tree to make it, but it's worth every cent. Personally, I am not a big reader, or a fast one, for that matter, so it did take me a while to read, but I most certainly enjoyed this book. Joseph Heller does a great job in putting comedy into such a serious topic as war. The book has so many morals like stay strong and success will come and different stories that will keep you awake all night; unfortunately, this book is hard to follow because of all the stories and you need to make sure that you remember what happens to each character and build off of that. I highly recommend it for more skilled readers. I am leaning more towards the high school age, and if you are an adult, then you will also get major kicks out of this one!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The Book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is novel about a young man named Yossarian who is a bomber in the war. He is a scared, weak drunk who hates being a bomber in the war. He is afraid of dying and does anything in his power to not have fly missions. He faked a liver problem and went to the hospital for a few weeks to just relax, hit on the nurses and talk to other patients. One time he even faked being someone else dying and talked to the guy&#65533;s family just so the doctor wouldn&#65533;t tell that Yossarian wasn&#65533;t actually sick. Heller portrays the whole unit Yossarian is in and everyone he meets to be sort of odd and a little crazy. Most the captains and people of rank are alcoholics and do something to take advantage of their positions in the military. For example Major de Coverly kidnaps Italian laborers and goes to cities to get apartments for officers and enlisted men to go on leaves. The main purpose of these leaves is to visit prostitutes and get drunk. I feel that Heller portrays everyone in the book to be a joke, and I think he shows his feelings about war through these characters.Catch 22 is a good book but a confusing one you need to pay attention to all the characters because they all seem to have a story to go along with them and in some way they connect to Yossarian. Heller furthers the complexity by jumping from character to character and from scene to scene. Catch 22 is a funny novel with a lot of good humor about life and the war."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Judging from most of the reviews here I'm obviously going against the flow, which is bizzare since one of the reasons i decided to read Heller's book was exactly the fact that most reviewers are raving about it. Oh well, there's a lesson to be learned here somewhere.&quot;Catch 22&quot; is considered a classic but in my mind &quot;classics&quot; are books of the caliber of &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot; or &quot;The Stand&quot;, books that hold up in time and deliver their message in a way that isnt anachronistic. &quot;Catch 22&quot; does not belong in such an &quot;elite&quot; category.It's supposedly &quot;hilarious&quot; but that's a very emphatic statement to make about humour and, hmm, i hardly laughed with it. Sure, humour is (as are many concepts) just a matter of perspective but from my angle of the world this was hardly enough to make you grin. Another paradox is that many readers claim you &quot;have to be well read&quot; to like this or (even stranger) you &quot;have to read this if you want to be well read&quot;.This is absolutely untrue. What is actually true is that the more you've read the less the chances become you'll be thrilled by &quot;Catch 22&quot; and if you are not &quot;well read&quot; (which is hard to define anyway) &quot;Catch 22&quot; wont add too much to your thinking arsenal except in my opinion the obvious.So what is the obvious here?Heller goes into an overlengthy diatribe to deliver an antiwar message decorated with philosophy bits and some provocative thoughts. While he tries to bring forth the insanity of war he does so by using incredibly underdeveloped characters, a totally ineffective plot (if one can call this a plot) and humour that tries to be subtle sarcasm but fails completely as:-if it's subtle i\`t's so subtle it's almost invisible, and- if it's sarcasm it's so harmless that it causes little concern to its targets.I wont go into the story or the characters as many other reviewers have covered that in 1000s of reviews here. What i will add is this: &quot;Catch 22&quot; is painfully boring to read, it becomes almost a task as you go through the first 50-100 pages and you find the same concepts over and over repeated and what is supposed to be a &quot;storyline&quot; thinnning continuously until it almost dissapears. If all &quot;classics&quot; were like this my take is that literature could easily become mental torture.What i find even sadder is that Heller fails while actually delivering an important message. This only drives home the fact that you might have the right thoughts but this doesnt mean you can express them in a literary way. Heller would be probably better off had he written a straight philosophical book which would have been way more in his element. As it is he takes a shot at literature and doesnt miss as he hits the target head on and the victim expires.All a matter of perspective as i said, but i would advise you to take a good look at both the negative and the positive reviews about &quot;Catch 22&quot; before you decide whether to read it or not. You'll be surprised how completely contradicting they are. Hilarious and boring dont exactly go together. If, however, you do go on and read it dont be surprised if you find that you're forcing yourself through it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Yo Yo Yo, here I go again. This is MC Book Review reviewing Catch 22. I mostly read this book, because I wanted to know what \\"Catch 22\\" meant. Apparently it means something different than what I thought it did. I thought it meant something like you achieved a great goal or something. Like a fisherman who had caught 21 fish and caught one more and would say, \\"Yo, that was a Catch 22\\". So I have been going around and saying stuff like, \\"Yo yo yo, I just got payed.

Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\" Chapter 5, pg. 55While this explains what Catch-22 is all about, I still found this book very hard to follow. Joseph Heller does a wonderful job at manipulating the language, but he seems to have done too good of a job. It is broken down so much that I had a hard time following the simplist plot twists and progression. While this pose a tremendous problem with the story, I will give it credit that it is strongly filled with wit, humor, confusion, and hope.Heller puts a powerful message of how pointless war is and the corruption of beuracracy. The colonels show the strongest representation of these factors throughout the novel. This seems like a very topic but the way Heller deliver's it is outstanding and confusing by the constant twists of Catch-22.I cannot say I would reccommend this book to most people."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Not my favorite novel of all time (hard for a woman to appreciate male bonding and glorified prostitution), but certainly worthy-in it's originality, wit, and cleverness-of the classic status it has acheived.

The expression of this book is so difficult to understand. It was very long and too many characters. I was very bored when I reading this book. Also it is not my favorite type of book.However, sometimes the language of book is very funny. I like the scene, where Yossarian- a bombardier (main character) had the conversation with Luciana (Italian woman). Yossarian asked her to marry him, but they talked as if they are all crazy. That kind of conversation made me laugh the whole way of reading the \\"Catch 22.\\" Also the conversation between Yosaarian and Doc were very crazy too, it seemed as if they were out of mind. So sometimes I need to concentrate about what they tended to say to understand the conversation.\\"Catch 22\\" is about Yossarian who do not like the war. Yossarian always thinks that someone is trying to kill him. He thinks that the war is stupid and people are dead for nothing.I agree with him, I hate the war too. People die in the war. Moreover, all valuable structures and old relics are destroyed. Nothing is going to solve by using \\"the war.\\""},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This was my second attempt to read Catch-22 all the way through (last year I gave up after 40 pages).Reading this book was a chore, and it took about three weeks and every ounce of discipline I could muster to complete it. The thick cast of characters were exhausting to follow, the repetitive running gags were tedious, and the circuitous \\"narrative\\" was just irritating. The humor struck me as dated and corny, with few exceptions.I agree with other commenters who have said that a condensed version of the book would have been more successful. Its core \\"message\\" was clear and the concept of a \\"Catch-22\\" clever, but after 450 pages of being hit over the head with it...(come to think of it, being hit over the head would have been less painful than the long journey to chapter 42...)Like others, I also thought the ending was a bit too \\"suspend your disbelief\\" but by the time I got there, I was no longer invested in the outcome.To be fair, I did smile at a few passages, and certainly respect Heller's distinct style and abilities as a writer. Having never written a book myself, I admire his accomplishment, especially considering that it's become a part of the American vernacular and is widely regarded as a modern classic (and enjoyed my many, many people).It just wasn't my bag, and I'll probably never read another Heller book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I bought this book because it was known as a classic. I don't know if you have to read it 20 times, but I was confused through the whole book. I couldn't tell the timeframe of each chapter. Maybe I just don't appreciate that each chapter was a catch 22. Oh well, I don't suggest to buy this book, though."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In November 2000 I wrote a really lame review of this book, and I apologize, to Joseph Heller more than anyone. This is a re-write of that disappointing effort.I just finished the superbTracy Daugherty biographyof Joseph Heller, which led me to my annual re-read of this book. I was introduced to this book in October 1980 in high school Honors English, and I have read it at least every year since. I never get tired of reading it, and every time I do I find something new. I adore this book. It is my #1 favorite of all time, and likely always will be.Synopsis: Twenty-eight-year-old World War II B-25 bombardier Yossarian is faced with the prospect of death at every turn, and no one notices or cares. Eventually he finds a way to do something about it.The book is wild, sprawling, seemingly out of control. The non-linear format can be a turnoff to many, but if you stick with it, and just let the story unfold, it all makes sense. The story comes together, page by page. The payoff comes only in the final pages, but it all comes together. Really. It's also deeply, deeply funny, with an enduring humor that operates on a number of levels. Although written more than fifty years ago, the language and dialog remain colloquial.One thing I wrote eleven years ago I still stand by: the book is about a man and men, set in a purely masculine environment. The point of view is overwhelmingly male, and sexist, with every single woman in the book described in primarily sexual terms. Yossarian admits to it on page 291, \\"...Everything reminds me of sex.\\" Women exist in the story as foils for male action and as bases for Heller's editorializing. This being said, I would hope women reading the book gain some insight on general male approaches to and perceptions of women.So what is the book about? There's a lot going on here. Heller took more than ten years to craft it, its 443 pages edited down from the original manuscript's 1,000+. It's about the nature and burden of conformity in the most conformist institution (the military) during the most conformist of times (war), and how that conformity--and unquestioning obedience--will kill you. It's about the cruelty and inherent dishonesty in bureaucratic and hierarchical institutions, the inevitable corruption within capitalism, abuse of power, greed, deception, justice and injustice, heroism and cowardice, God and religion, and the manipulation of logic and language to legitimize a wrong, pronounce sentence or make a sale. The book is about the loss of innocence and the concomitant loss of youth to age, awareness, and ultimately to mortality. It is about the value and vitality of individuality, about friendship, humor and sex, and how essential these are to sense of self, well-being, and how we relate to others.While the story and themes are powerful enough, Heller's writing itself is a pure joy, with such gems as:-- Yossarian under physical exam, his body \\"...drugged and derogated, dusted and dredged, fingered and photographed...\\"-- \\"Hungry Joe was a throbbing, ragged mass of motile irritability.\\"-- \\"...he was dead, a bleeding cinder on the barbarous pile whom nobody had heard in those last precious moments...\\"-- \\"The clinging, overpowering conviction of death spread steadily with the continuing rainfall, soaking mordantly into each man's ailing countenance like the corrosive blot of some crawling disease.\\"-- General Peckem's \\"martyred smile of sweet reasonableness...\\"-- \\"...her hands lying in her lap like fallen moths.\\"-- \\"...the crazy, craggy, patchwork canyon of crashing antiaircraft fire...\\"-- \\"...the open-air theater, where the milky, dust-filled beam bursting horizontally from the projector slashed a conelike swath in the blackness and draped in a fluorescent membrane of light the audience tilted on the seats there in hypnotic sags...\\"-- Major Aarfy's \\"...fustian, moon-faced ineptitude...\\"-- \\"..the primal, powerful, rhapsodic instinctual rhythm of erotic ardor and abandonment...\\"-- \\"...a howling, strident, onrushing cacophony of overwhelming sound...\\"And there's Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City,\\" one of my favorite passages in the world. It is a stark, shattering 14 pages in heavy, dense paragraphs offering grisly detail in which Yossarian treads the inferno, descending into and through man's unending inhumanity to man, realizing it has existed and always will exist, only that up until now he had been unable to see it. The violence, cruelty and injustice cascade through the narrative. Heller's pacing, structure and word choice in this chapter are the high point of this book.As heavy as this book gets as the story unfolds, there is a great deal of humor, and this books still makes me laugh out loud. Its humor comes in all forms, clever puns, plays on words, turns of phrase, illogical actions, and at times the darkest and cruelest black comedy I have ever encountered. It is a deep, thought-provoking book which still makes me laugh out loud after more than 35 readings in the past 31 years.Bottom line: this is a brilliant work of fiction, an absolute treasure, and I recommend it with all of my heart."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I first read &quot;Catch 22&quot; when I was 16, and I still revisit the book once a year.

I enjoyed the book for its creative style, and humorous situations. What I don't understand is why people must try to look between the lines to find some political motivation behind its humor and satire. The critics need to remember that it is fiction, and only fiction. It is meant to be read for enjoyment.

If I were a character in Catch 22, Heller probably would have turned me into a king.The great thing about Catch 22 is that a man can write a book that makes no sense and has an insane plot and come out with a best seller. I have no idea why this occurs, but I go with the flow and I say Catch 22 is one of the greatest books I've ever read.I recommend this book to anyone who laughs at anything besides your everyday Disney type slap stick humor, and anyone who knows what everyone else hates."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller, in his novel Catch 22, has created a unique peice of Literature, one uniquely American.

I had seen the movie, and loved it, had heard all kinds of references to the book, and every time i opened it before, there were good sentences in it, the kind that drew you in. So I started reading and was fast disappointed - it's just a series of vignettes, of SNL sketches. It's not a real novel, it's an experimental one, of modernist flavor, where the story is not continuous, where, in fact, the author doesn't care too much about the story: he cares about the process, about showing how clever he is, about dialogue that is witty and absurd at the same time. Was this a disease of the times? I seem to remember Monty Python had similar stuff, the stuff that seems just clever and belabored now, not the stuff that has become classic.I have to confess: I like linear narrative. I read a bunch of the other stuff and it just makes me tired. This jumping around, this collage of happenings just doesn't add up to a good story.I heard somewhere that Heller was much influenced by Jaroslav Hasek (who wrote the Brave Soldier Svejk). I read Hasek, and found him to be much funnier than Heller - but then, again, Hasek was telling a story, whereas Heller is primarily displaying his skill with words."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I am using my mom's account and so this review is by me, not my mom.I read this book for a book project.

The order of events is screwed up to the point that I was strongly tempted to rip out the pages and put them in some kind of a rational order. The \\"humor\\" in the book is really not that funny to be honest. The rare moments of true comedy were so scarce as to not be able to justify this books existence. Any morals or \\"big ideas\\" that you were supposed to get out of reading this book are lost in the nonsensical ramblings that I guess were supposed to be the plot.

In fact, I have no idea what the real storyline is, but I can say this, having read the book; the author attempts to define the Catch-22 numerous times by telling stories of each of the characters lives, and how they try to achieve something, but they never seem to be able to get there, for one reason or another. Joseph Heller therefore proves the Catch-22 exists. but beyond this main point, I do not recognize any form of story developing. The whole story seemed to be going around in circles, and, if it wasnt for the humorous parts within the book every now and then, I may have put it down in utter confusion as to what was going on in the book. Without the humor, the book did not tie itself together, so, for the little that I did get from the book, I owe it to the humor."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 consisted of alot of irony and witty sarcasm, and held ideas that seem unrealistic yet comical and incredibly unexpected. I found it understandable that character Yossarian wants to get home without having to die in order to do it, and the other numerous characters and situations made it even more comical and twists the ideas and sarcasm, making it truly unique. But as entertaining as it was I also found it somewhat redundant; the situations and predicaments certain characters were stuck in kept it interesting, but in my opinion there wasn't really a plot. It would jump around to different moments in time unexpectedly and the end of the book was so unexpected and disappointing, it makes the book as a whole seem superfluous.Irony was a large aspect of the book; practically every situation any character got into was totally ironic, and I think Joseph Heller's use of irony brings out more of the anti-war opinion the book seems to have. It seems like Heller meant for the ideas and situations to be superfluous in order to show that war is superfluous, and I think he portrayed it well in the book. The tools he used to get that point across-- irony, sarcasm, comedy-- I believe were crucial to the ideas and themes, but I also think that seeing it from Yossarian's point of view is crucial as well, and brings out more of Heller's opinions throughout the book.A good aspect (and one of the very, very few) I found about the book was the fact that it wasn't based on pre-conceived notions of war but based on Heller's own opinion. Heller wrote the book the way he saw war, in a way where it seemed so twisted and unrealistic that it couldn't be reality but in my opinion it was reality. Every situation seemed unbelievable, but I think war in itself must be unbelievable and that was Heller's opinion...it was ridiculous, unbelievable, something one couldn't describe using everyday circumstances. It made all the main ideas stronger and circulated them throughout one another and throughout the book, but that was probably the only good thing about the book. I thought the whole thing was incredibly unnecessary with the way it ended and it was too repetitive with simply describing characters for each chapter; it made it kind of dull."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book definitely had its good points - Yossarian's antics (&quot;I yearn for you deeply&quot;), the out-of-sequence structure (yes, I actually liked that), and some of the philosophizing about war which struck a chord with me - but its annoying points outweighed them in the end. The main thing that ruined the book for me was the ridiculously illogical behavior of almost everyone in the book. Now, in a military satire, I expect some ridiculous logic from the commanders, and it's funny at first, but when EVERYONE behaves without logic or intelligence, it loses its edge and becomes annoying. One example: the Colonel (?) who says &quot;You mean the enlisted men pray to the same God as the officers?&quot; OK - that's not biting satire - that's just plain stupid. There are endless examples of this type of ridiculousness, and it turns the novel into a cartoon. And please don't give me the &quot;war is insane&quot; line - while I agree that it is (or can be), the war and characters in Catch-22 are not insane, they are inane."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I had high hopes for this novel; I mean it's a classic right? My 16 year old son had to choose a novel for summer reading and I helped him pick this book. The story was very difficult to follow and just jumps right into a confusing hospital scene. We hung in there and figured that if we kept reading it would eventually piece itself together and make sense. After Chapter 4 I had lost my son entirely and I wasn't too far behind. I rented the movie out of desperation, hoping it would gel a background story that we could carry back to the book. We couldn't get a third of the way through the movie! There were too many discrepancies between the two and the movie just threw us deeper into confusion. The book and the movie were very \\"Monty Python\\"-ish only not funny. This was the first time in my 52 years I've ever started a book and not finished it...and I'm surprisingly okay with that."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It was the slowest book I have ever read. Joseph Heller over describes the characters and tries to use a 1960's euphoric childish humor that more irony than anything. 3 key words, Do Not Read"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I can clearly recall after over 30 years the stir that Catch-22 caused in the group of friends I was close to in college. The book at first reading was so outrageously funny and captivating that it was a major error to put down the only copy we had for any reason. The sole copy left unattended would immediately be picked up by one of the &quot;vultures&quot; that were constantly circling the fortunate one who had the book, looking for an opening.On subsequent readings of this remarkable novel the incredible depth of characters and irony comes through more forcefully and new meaning is discovered. Heller's command of the language and his fine understanding not only of the madness of war and the insane reasons those in charge offer for its necessity but also of the day to day absurdities of life in the military and by extension in everyday life, make this a novel a Bible of Truth that for those of us who have experienced those absurdities and that madness. Conversely, those who do not have the experiences of armed conflict and interaction with any military machine still get full meaning of &quot;the catch&quot;. This novel touches so completely the soul of an ultimately sane man, Yossarian, living in a totally insane world. That the phrase &quot;its a Catch-22 situation&quot; has so completely entered the language and that it is understood by those who use it exactly as Heller intended is the ultimate compliment and review of this timeless work."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I have been taking a look at some of the negative reviews here, and some reviewers do bring up a good(albeit obvious) point: this book does not portray war realistically. It should be a given that practically every satire exaggerates. That is, after all, what makes satire so funny.That being said, this is still a great book. I won't explain why it is great, as there are so many other reviews which tell you so. I would however like to touch upon a few things. The last few chapters have less humor than the previous chapters, and these chapters can get quite gruesome and disturbing. Also, I sometimes found myself frustrated with the stupidity of some events in the book, instead of humored. Finally, the ending was a little TOO unrealistic, as the whole mindset and attitude towards life is changed in Yossarian thanks to a single bit of news. Mind you, the book ends so abruptly that it is unknown whether he maintains this attitude for long, and therefore it is a bit of a cliffhanger, despite the fact that there was never meant to be a sequel.Still, overall, a great book. Not quite 5 stars, but more than 4."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"To immerse yourself in the WWII-era nightmare at the heart of Joseph Heller's masterful novel is to lose yourself in a world where bureaucracy has run amuck, logic and sanity have become rare commodities, and the threat of imminent death permeates the very air. And yet, the only person who can see all of this is Yossarian, a bombardier who has the misfortune to be stuck in a war while being, as the dust-jacket points out, \\"dangerously sane.\\" He is terrified by the dangers that surround him, disgusted by the wanton behavior of his compatriots, and angered by the selfishness of his superiors. He just wants to go home and leave all this behind him, but that seems to be an impossible dream. The closer he gets to the end of his tour, the further he gets from going home as power-hungry, image conscious superiors concoct new ways to extend the number of missions their pilots must fly. This is a war where the accuracy of a bombing run is seen as irrelevant so long as it photographs well (a pretty explosion is all part of the CO's PR campaign), a mess hall officer can run an international business that makes him the most powerful man in the unit, and a dead body can be allowed to lie around without getting removed if that officer's paperwork never arrived (making him never officially exist to the bureaucrats), and more. The logic that they and all characters except Yossarian use is utterly absurd, lending \\"Catch-22\\" a farcical air, but the genius of Heller's work is that their outrageous logic is actually an only mildly exaggerated version of the logic that we are forced to abide by in everyday life. You can read in his inspired satire the problems that plague any bureaucracy, whether it be as mundane as the office or as vital as the government.\\"Catch-22\\" is outrageous, yes, and that may turn some readers off, but it is a novel that has a devilish heart and a wicked wit at its core - not to mention the fact that it is sheer genius, and it isn't as far-fetched or outlandish as it may initially appear. Heller's tone is pitch-perfect and never wavers, and his vision has made \\"Catch-22\\" a timeless classic that is every bit as relevant today as it was when it was first published. An absolute must-read.Grade: A+P.S. If you like this check out Kurt Vonnegut, another spectacular absurdist author. I'd recommendSlaughterhouse-Fiveor my personal favorite,Mother Night."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is genious. It's so hilarious. It manages to make as serious a topic as war funny. But at the same time, Heller makes it clear just how terrible a thing war is. This book isn't for everyone, it's a love-it-or-hate-it book. The sense of humor is hard for some to understand. If you read the first one or two chapters and don't find yourself laughing, just stop reading right there. But if you're like me, you'd have fallen in love with it by then."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22, by Joseph Heller, is the story of Yossarian, a bombardier fighting for the United States in World War II. Heller takes a lighthearted and satirical approach to address the serious topic of war. While doing this, he addresses several themes including the idea that money and power corrupt, and conveys the loss of religious faith and the overall uselessness and destructiveness of war.Catch-22 takes place on Pianosa, a small island in the Mediterranean Sea. The reader witnesses Yossarian and his desperate attempts to get out of the war. He was once a great bombardier, but loses interest after he witnesses the death of a man on his plane. He no longer cares about the assigned missions and instead \\"had decided to live forever or die in the attempt, and his only mission each time he went up was to come down alive\\" (29). Yossarian finds himself trapped in the war due to his antagonist, Colonel Cathcart, a man so interested in being promoted that he will put other people's lives in danger. The problem is that Cathcart continually raises the number of missions required of the men in order to complete their service in the army. \\"They were in a race and knew it, because they knew from bitter experience that Colonel Cathcart might raise the number of missions again at any time\\" (27). Yossarian finds himself closing in on the number of missions he needs to get out of the war, but sees the number rise just before he can get there. He can also be excused from service if he is insane, but Catch-22 makes this option impossible. One part of Catch-22 says that a man is insane if he flies his bombing missions, but if the man says that he is insane and asks to be excused from duty, the fact that he is requesting this proves that he is in fact perfectly sane because \\"a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\" (46).Catch-22 features many separate characters, all of which have their own side stories. The book often switches from present to past to allow the reader to learn much about many of the characters. Most of the focus, however, is given to Yossarian, a character who is hard not to like and feel sorry for. The novel shows how Yossarian and the other characters spend their time in the army-both during missions and during their free time. The reader gets to witness how the characters deal with the war and watch as some of them, characters like Colonel Cathcart and the cook, Milo Minderbinder, use the war to their advantage. Catch-22 is a constant struggle by Yossarian to save his life and to stop flying bombing missions.Catch-22 features several important themes. The first shows how power and money corrupt. Most people would hate being at war, but Colonel Catchart and Milo Minderbinder definitely do not mind. Cathcart is a man who cares about little else than being promoted. His powerful position and hunger for more power drives him to raise the number of missions his men must fly in order to complete their military service in order to impress his superiors and possibly get his promotion. Milo, on the other hand, is totally driven by money. He runs a syndicate where he is constantly buying and selling goods throughout Europe. However, he begins to lose money and is willing to do just about anything to make money back. \\"One night, after a sumptuous evening meal, all Milo's fighters and bombers took off, joined in formation directly overhead and began dropping bombs on the group. He had landed another contract with the Germans, this time to bomb his own outfit\\" (257). Both Milo and Cathcart are willing to endanger the other soldiers just to feed their appetites for money and power. Their corruption is only one of the several themes present in Catch-22.Other ideas that are introduced in the novel are the loss of faith and the uselessness of war. After being involved in the war for so long, Yossarian has abandoned any belief in a higher being. He says, \\"And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways. There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing. Or else He's forgotten all about us...What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His...Why in the world did He ever create pain?\\" (179). The war, along with the viciousness and selfishness of the people that Yossarian deals with have led him to lose any religious faith he might have had. He does not agree with the war that he is fighting in and seeing his friends die in. War, in the novel, is overall depicted as useless since there is no real reason why the men are fighting, except for the benefit of people higher up in command.Overall, Catch-22 is an excellent book. The only complaints that could be made about it is the fact that it is sometimes difficult to follow since the plot jumps from the present to past without warning. Also, there are numerous characters with many names and military positions to get confused. However, after a while, one will get used to this and it will not be hard to finish the novel. Joseph Heller decides to depict war in a comical and satirical manner, styles that are not often used for books in the war genre. It is a very funny book, but is also deeply significant since it addresses the ideas of power, money, corruption, religion, and the uselessness and viciousness of war. It is a great read and is wholeheartedly recommended to anyone who is interested in reading a classic."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If there is one thing i can say about this novel, is it's surprisingly dark humor. Every page gave me a wicked grin.I'll give a warning though: if you don't have a sense of humor... go read someone serious and leave this book to the eccentrics. But, if you have a warped sense of humor (such as myself) this book is just... wow.The strength of the book is it's underlying theme of buracracy. If you are blind to the dogmatic society that we live in: there will be too much red-tape for you to truly understand the novel, and Heller's intentions.My favorite &quot;thing&quot; of this novel is the cast of characters. In fact, i'll go out on a literary limb and say that Catch-22 has the greatest ensemble of characters then any other novel ever written (or that i read for that matter... which is alot).The only obstacle i can think of (besides if you are a blind conformist) to reading this book is the structure of the plot. It's as if Heller had the novel all set and ready to go, accidently dropped the manuscript out out of a window and every chapter oddly stayed intack; but have fallen out of order and have no sense of time frame anymore. on top of this, heller was to lazy to put them back in order, and gave it to the publisher that way. I think he intended it to be a chaotic structure, much like the enviroment of being in war, where everyhthing seems to be flying at your face. But this really isn't too much of an obsticle. actually, it makes riddles out of the side-plots, and how they end up (or began for that matter).I heard that Heller's other books pale in comparasion (and are downright bad for that matter, which is very unfortunate) but at least he got one classic out of his head for us. Thank you, truly."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller has written a true masterpiece. I can just imagine the considerable effort that went into the genuis of this book. Catch-22 is a powerful satire composed of such well-written, unique, and frightening characters. It can be so absurd at times, but then you find that you are chuckling to yourself at others. Then you realize what you found humorous and that is kind of scary in itself. Catch-22 is such a challenging and complex read, it is full of allusions, images, and metaphors. You also cannot overlook the very organized way Heller used for the time sequences. However, all these aspects contribute to show the sheer genuis of the author and how well he was able to create this work. I am sure Catch-22 will remain prevalent in society for a very long time, and just getting through the book can become a great reward. Read Catch-22 for its provocative satire, intriguing characters, and brilliance."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"To be honest with all you gentle readers, I don't much admire War novels, nor do I stand by the title of my review. Generally, I believe War is truly Hell.But last Winter, in the grips of a bout of quasi-depression-for-teens following a move to the most FLAT province in Canada, I truly thought I was in Hell. An e-mail friend suggested Catch-22 to use up edgy cabin-fever time. Now, let it be known that my attention span for most novels dwindles quickly, especially if the book is slow to pick up. While significantly slower to get 'into' than most of the writing I chase, Catch-22 sucked me in, like Alice down the rabbit hole. It is sharply funny, engaging, and chock full of delightful characters. The main character is a thinker; a young man disheartened by war and his own mortality. His name is Yossarian, and since reading this novel, he has stood out in my mind as being one of the most...sculpted... characters in the history of literature.Put simply, this book is a satire about World War 2. Coming from a kid sickened by the very idea of war, I can say that this book is worth whatever bills you have to fork over for it. It's not about war, per se, but more about the human condition. In addition, it made me laugh a few times, something that only a few other works of fiction have ever been successful in accomplishing. I finished this book feeling oddly... renewed. If you're looking for something 'new' (or, so old it's new) and engaging, I heartily recommend 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I am merely adding in my own two cents:I never read this in high school or college, and now, at 32, I am rediscovering many 'required reading' novels that I missed. Though this novel won't appeal to everyone, it is a satirical view of the folly of war, capitalism, religion, and many other ideals. Through humor and very interesting situations the reader gains a sense of the exasperation the main character has with the surrounding characters and their morals (or lack thereof).Deep down it has a very Kafka-esque feel to it. If you enjoy dark humor then you should definitely give it a shot. I am very happy I read this, it is on my short list of favorite novels."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Why did this 570-page book take me a month to read? Is it because I only read on the commute, is it because I often had work-related stuff to read on the commute, or is it because it's a tricky book to read? Paragraph by paragraph, Catch 22 is probably the funniest book I've ever read, some really hilarious bits. It's difficult to describe its hilarity, somehow, but the example below provides a pretty good description of its general wackiness. This is from a scene when the chaplain is being taken away by a colonel and a major and he asks \\"What have I done?\\"\\"Why don't you keep your trap shut and let us ask the questions?\\" said the colonel.\\"Don't talk to him in that say,\\" said the major. \\"It isn't necessary to be so disrespectful.\\"\\"Then tell him to keep his trap shut and let us ask the questions.\\"\\"Father, please keep your trap shut and let us ask the quesiotions,\\" urged the major sympathetically. \\"It will be better for you.\\"\\"It isn't necessary to call me Father,\\" said the chaplain. \\"I'm not a Catholic.\\"\\"Neither am I, Father,\\" said the major. \\"It's just that I'm a very devout person, and I like to call all men of God Father.\\"\\"He doesn't even believe there are atheists in fox-holes,\\" the colonel mocked, and nudged the chaplain in the ribs familiarly. \\"Go on, Chaplain, tell him. Are thre atheists in foxholes?\\"\\"I don't know, sir,\\" the chaplain replied. \\"I've never been in a foxhole.\\"The officer in front swung his had around swiftly with a quarrelsome expression. \\"YOu've never been in heaven either, have you? But you knnow there's a heaven, don't you?\\"\\"Or do you?\\" said the colonel.\\"That's a very serious crime you've committed, Father,\\" said the major.\\"What crime?\\"\\"We don't know yet,\\" said the colonel. \\"But we're going to find out. And we sure know it's very serious.\\"Taken as a whole, it's a bit hard to figure out what's going on, although by the time you get to the end of the book you do start to realise that the reason why it doesn't make sense is that he tells some parts of the story backwards: you'll learn an outcome that puzzles you because it came from out of nowhere, but throughout the rest of the book it's referenced often enough that you begin to piece together what actually happened. Heller's thesis is fascinating, if a little adolescent: everything and everybody is insane, especially during war. But because he takes it to such an extent - you'd have to be crazy to want to fight, you'd have to be crazy to want to kill, you'd have to be crazy to fly air force missions, you can only get out of the war if you're mentally unstable but if you were rational enough to want to get out of the war you could not claim insanity; also systems are insane, bureaucracy is insane, commerce is insane, the military system is insane - it provides him with so much material that he has no problem filling a whole book about the insanity of a single army unit. In the end, it seems that I enjoyed the book in spite of myself. Now I want to see the movie."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"CATCH-22 is masterful in so many ways. It begins as comic farce, proceeds to the increasingly surreal, and then transforms into a nightmarish tragedy before ending triumphantly. No novel that I know so successfully blends all these disparate moods. I believe it was Hugh Walpole who wrote, \\"Life is a comedy to those who think, and a tragedy to those who feel.\\" No book illustrates that better than this novel. This truly is one of the funniest books I have ever read. It is also one of the most tragic.CATCH-22 also introduces one of the most insane collection of great characters in fiction: Yossarian, the Chaplain, Orr, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Milo Minderbender, Maj. Major Major Major, Nately, Doc Daneeka, Danby, General Dreedle, Nately's girl (not the description in the book, but Amazon's software will bleep it), Cathcart, Nurse Duckett, The Texan, Major ----- de Coverley, The Soldier in White, and a host of other characters. It is one of the most gloriously populated novels of the past half century.This is a novel I can almost not discuss except through superlatives: greatest war novel I have read, funniest novel I have ever read, greatest English language novel of the past 60 years. But the best thing is that it is, on top of being a superb book, an exceedingly fun book to read. Even at its nightmarish, this is a fun, delightful book. And few novels contain as many unforgetable moments as this one."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I would first like to inform other reviewers that I am a high school junior, read this as part of a choice novel project, and had no trouble grasping the ideas that Joseph Heller presented within his Catch-22.The sarcastic attitude of this novel is conspicuous, and all bonds with reality are dropped with the first character introductions. The humor that has previously been criticized I found to be easy to understand, not monotonous, and a unique aspect to illustrate WW2. This is not to say the humor is for all, because Heller uses many paradoxes (look up definition of \\"catch-22\\"), simple one line contradictions, and subtle word choices to draw a laugh-all which represent the personality of the novel.Yes, there are many characters, probably over fifty, yet grasping the names is not important at all times. Of course you quickly get associated with Yossarian and the other main characters, and chapter do reintroduce people from the early parts of the book. This may be annoying, yet each character is distinct, and there is little chance of confusing Milo, and entrepeneur, with Havermeyer, the elite pilot. In truth, the novel lacks a linear time, but chooses, rather, to define the novel through numerous character sketches, focusing them loosely around Yossarian. By the later chapters of the novel, Heller subtly introduces the gruesome truths of the war, balancing the early humor with more realistic look. It is through this transition that the weight of the situation is elucidated, and by contrasting the final chapters with the first, Heller is able to attract our attention and force us to analyze the war.What is the novel about? There is no simple answer, yet if I attempt to state it in a single sentence Catch-22's theme, it would be \\"The only true fault of America's once the war began, was that we as a nation began to glorify war, without truly understanding the implications of our actions.\\"What is the idea behind catch-22 as a statement? Read the book. Enjoy. Open your eyes with laughter and tears. Perhaps you won't like the satirical tone, but I would suggest to all that you try."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I was in high school, my English teacher introduced me to the absurdity of war. We were assigned to read &quot;Dulce Et Decorum Est&quot; by the great war poet Wilfred Owen. This poem refuted the &quot;old lie&quot;, Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori - How sweet and fitting it is to die for one's country. After reading this poem, I suddenly realized how wasteful and utterly senseless war is, especially for the unfortunate people who must put their life on the line.One day, I was in a second-hand bookstore, and by chance spotted a copy of &quot;Catch-22.&quot; I had no idea what the book was about, but once I started reading, I couldn't stop. This book, like Owen's poem, describes how frightening and pointless war is to the soldier. However, while Owen uses gory details to bring forth his ideas, Heller uses satire.This book captures the personal fears and opinions of the troubled bombadier, Yossarian. He does not know why he has to be there, and he certainly does not want to die.Yossarian stated that he didn't care if this opinion made the enemy happy. He said that the enemy is anybody who wants to kill you, and it was his superior who kept sending him out to get killed...This makes me wonder about the millions of soldiers throughout time, for this thought must have passed through some of their minds at some desperate point. The old men who instigate and plan wars are not the ones who will die. Rather, they send people out to die for *their* cause.As you can see, this book really made me think. Yes, I thought, I laughed till I cried, then I cried for the senselessness of it all. Heller is a genius!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"For so many of us growing up in the USA, our high school teachers assigned us Joseph Heller's \\"Catch-22\\" as required reading, and I was among those assignees. I'm not sure why the requirement, other than perhaps some Catch-22 type of logic that everyone else was assigning it, so there, must be great, must read. I don't particularly remember liking the novel then, perhaps with no more substantial of a reason than -- just not my style. Reading the novel now, in midlife, my opinion (or my literary style) has changed little, but today, I can attempt to add to \\"not my style\\" perhaps a few deeper insights.In this second read, I realize what so fails to appeal to me is Heller's slapstick, absurdist, repetitive and dizzyingly circular style of storytelling. At the same time, I fully realize this is also the appeal of the novel for many: it's absurdity. Indeed, time has tested Heller's topic of war having little logic or reason in the real world, mostly born of individual and governmental insanity, power plays and mere whim, male ego clashing and chest thumping. Few wars seem to have good reason for happening when one considers all the other possibilities of resolution. While leaders sit safely in secure offices on fortressed hilltops, the common soldier takes all the risks, offers up his/her body for battering, endures indescribable torments in battle, and often gives the ultimate sacrifice of life. Shall we debate the virtues of boxing rings for political leaders instead? Yes, war is absurd. And Heller captures this \\"crazy-making\\" truth in a crazy-making novel in which characters dance to illogical commands, spin in frustration, and dig themselves in ever deeper as they try harder and harder to dig themselves out. You know... as in war.So I slogged through the pages like a good soldier. Characters leapt forward and backward in time, one event led to no other event, resolution rarely made a showing, and the dance of insanity kept the main lead. Even as I slogged, I could not deny what an excellent reflection of warring reality Heller's writing proved to be. Kudos for that. Redeeming factor.And then, somewhere towards the final pages, I was somewhat won over. Without losing his voice of absurdity, the author had Yossarian, key player, say lines so absurd they rang true to the core, e.g. \\"but we don't want what we want!\\" and I could only shake my head and echo, oh indeed. We don't. When offered a bounty of temptations to sell out his soul, Yossarian denied them all, and in his crazy way, spoke utter sanity. How common is it to want something desperately much of our lives, only to realize we don't want it at all when fantasy turns into reality? A gold star for the author. Other episodes of Yossarian struggling to keep a fellow soldier alive even as his guts spill out, the sheer horror and despair and helplessness of the situation, hit target. Bravo.This, and Heller's commentaries on man being little more than meat, fodder for the brutalities of war, resounded with such painful truth that today's reader can only look up at current events and current disasters and realize -- we are living in a world ruled by absurdities even today. History has taught us nothing.And so, I could be convinced that Heller's novel is a classic. Perhaps it is."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"To be honest with all you gentle readers, I don't much admire War novels, nor do I stand by the title of my review.

In addition, it made me laugh a few times, something that only a few other works of fiction have ever been successful in accomplishing. I finished this book feeling oddly... renewed. If you're looking for something 'new' (or, so old it's new) and engaging, I heartily recommend 'Catch-22' by Joseph Heller."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Undoubtedly, this book is a modern classic. To describe and elucidate all peculiarities of its style, allusions (Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, etc.), plot, characters and its influence on the modern culture and life one will need to write another book of similar volume. So I'll be short: the novel is excellent, a must read.It starts as a brilliant satire showing absurdity of a war machine and its human components. In times the story is so funny that it is preferably to read in solitude in order not to exasperate people with irrepressible laughter. But in the second half of the novel the festive mode metamorphoses: a hilarity becomes a horror of a man ensnared by a booby trap. The events and orders are crazy but the blood of friends is absolutely real. The black comedy, taking place in Italy during World War II, transforms into a hideous picture of the human society, where a life of an ordinary person signifies nothing being only a card in heinous game of rapacious and salacious potentates. In one of the last chapters Rome, the Eternal City, appears as an apocalyptic vision of impending destruction of the iniquitous world. The marvelous novel of Joseph Heller warns us: Be vigilant!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is not a book America wants to read, especially in her present state of patriotism. One cannot picture Heller's Yossarian sporting a \\"These Colors Don't Run\\" T-shirt and waving a flag. Indeed, the opening chapter explicitly refutes any interpretation that suggests Yossarian's actions are rooted in a deep sense of nationalism: an uber-patriotic Texan drives almost all the men out of a hospital ward and back into combat. Catch-22 is a book that challenges the logic of war. It combines wry humor with startlingly affecting anecdotes to force the reader into asking questions. It is the portrait of a man who is dangerously sane, but trapped in the insanity of war by catch-22.When I started reading Joseph Heller's Catch-22, I had no idea what to expect. I scanned the buzzwords on the back cover...\\"apocalyptic, bitter, hilarious, monumental, original, subversive, classic.\\" What I found was a moving satire, centered ..., an allegory who manages to retain his humanity. The fact that Heller's Yossarian was indeed so easy to relate to contributed to the book's power. The novel brings you deep into the world of war, as viewed by a soldier. Yossarian's experiences are not entirely realistic, and much of what happens over the course of the novel seems to make no sense at all. In presenting war in such a manner, Heller asks the reader whether the reality of war makes any more sense than does Yossarian's story. Heller says that war itself is a great catch-22, a paradoxical trap that humans walk into time and time again. He questions the logic of the illogical, and asks the reader to try and rationalize the irrational.Catch-22 is significant because it claims that not only war is a catch-22. The metaphor extends to include life itself. We see that the characters are not merely fighting to survive the war...they are fighting to be immortal. Each has his own way, whether it be by enduring boredom to make time move slower, or by gaining global power through commerce and enterprise. They are all trying to cheat death. Heller's novel reveals many deep and often unpleasant truths, but it does it with humor and style. For this reason, Catch-22 has reached \\"classic\\" status and will probably remain a classic for generations to come.As a book, Catch-22 is flawless. It is moving, witty, and ultimately one of the greatest novels I have ever read. It deserves every one of its five stars. However, to those who are interested in reading it, I warn you to take Heller's work with a grain of salt. Many may find the satire offensive in light of the current global situation. Please do not let current events get in your way. Catch-22 is a wonderful, eye-opening novel; but as with all \\"subversive\\" literature, it must be approached with an open mind."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Having recently read and greatly enjoyed Herman Wouk's &quot;The Caine Mutiny&quot; and Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;, I expected &quot;Catch-22&quot; to be a straightforward war novel. Boy, was I wrong, and pleasantly surprised!There are two sides to the style of &quot;Catch-22&quot;. On one hand, the character profiles and the bits of dialogue showing how the characters interrelate are hilarious. Heller's prose is as funny as P.G. Wodehouse's and even his wry style of humor is very similar to Wodehouse's. But Heller is not using humor to lighten the mood of war, nor is &quot;Catch-22&quot; merely humorous. The other side of the novel is its realistically gory portrayal of the atrocities of war (some of which are even the result of &quot;friendly fire&quot;), including detailed accounts of the sights, sounds, and terrors of flying in a World War II bomber aircraft.Rather than present the plot in a linear, chronological fashion, Heller cleverly and innovatively cuts it up like a jigsaw puzzle and lets the reader put the pieces together. Only towards the end of the novel, relating Yossarian's sadness at the news of Nately's death and the events that follow, does the plot start to proceed a little more conventionally until Yossarian makes his final decision to escape his predicament.If the novel has a theme, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's about the evils of rationalization; that is, the way people interpret and twist the logic and laws of authority or society to their own advantage. People's desire for power, status, and money results in excuses for military brutality and endangering the lives of others, and &quot;Catch-22&quot; illustrates numerous examples."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller's excellent anti-war satire is on of the most poignant, intriguing and comical books ever written. The conversations of his roundabout characters are some of the wittiest pieces of dialogue one could ever find in a novel, and the underlying satire and social commentary behind every character and every page really does pack a punch. Catch-22 is both hilarious, cynical and scathingly satirical: a masterpiece; a tremendous achievement.It revolves around a group of characters during WWII, notably the eccentric Yossarian. Yossarian is confined to a small military on the island of Pianosa, in amongst a large group of weird and wonderful characters. Each of these characters exhibit strange idiosyncrasies inflicted by the madness of war: they are vehicles for Heller to convey the futility and stupidity of the institution.Yossarian, no matter what he tries, cannot escape bombardier duty and cannot get transferred. To be transferred, one must be classified as insane. Hence the Catch-22: by exhibiting a concern for one's personal safety and asking for a transfer, one is sane. But, by flying combat missions and risking one's life, one is IN-sane, but by asking to leave, one is SANE! Yossarian is flummoxed.Catch-22 is one of the best books ever written and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Who is more dangerous to your sense of self-preservation, the enemy soldier who wants to kill you, or the superior officer who orders you into hostile fire? Joseph Heller took everything that is wrong and insane about war and bureaucracy and turned it loose onto the pages of CATCH-22.Time does not progress in a linear fashion is this book. Characters that are furious when the minimum number of bomb-missions to be flown is raised to sixty are later appalled when it is raised to thirty. The pilots and crew are trapped in an endless circle of logic, time and red tape. Yossarian's attempts to preserve his life end with him exactly in the same place that he was before. Everything is structured so that escape is completely impossible. All the regulations and requirements keep looping around back upon themselves leaving Yoassarian with no options left.The strange and bizarre characters that Heller created are really what give the book its teeth. Virtually every character has constructed a routine for himself (since this is set in the male-dominated military camps of WWII, just about all of the major characters are men) that distances him from the actual war effort. The leaders bury themselves into the deep sands of regulation and order, and grapple with tough problems like paperwork, the military hierarchy and organizing parades. The soldiers spend their time drinking, having sex with Italian prostitutes, getting into bar-fights or trying to get rich. What is interesting is that almost none of the characters even mention the opposing side in the war. CATCH-22's war is not about bravery or heroics, it is about selfishness and greed and insanity.I disagree with those reviewers who have said that the order of the book appears random, as if Heller had written the book in a straightforward fashion and then merely shuffled the chapters around. With the book written in this way, we see the development of certain characters within their own bubble of time, freed from the distractions that other characters and their unrelated subplots would bring. It allows Heller to bring specific themes to the foreground when they are needed or let them sit in the background when they are not.This is a really excellent book and I highly recommend it. I rate it at five stars because I honestly cannot find any fault with it. The book moves effortlessly from hilarity to tragedy while pausing only briefly to look at how the individual deals with the horror of war. Everything in this book is absolutely and hilariously absurd. One of Yossarian's friends, Milo, owns so many supplies and controls so much of the market that he is able to buy eggs at seven cents each, sell them at five cents and still run a handsome profit. A computer with a sense of humour decides to promote a man to major based purely on the fact that his last name (and his middle and first names) are the same word as the position.This is a must read for everyone. The illogic will delight you, the humour will tickle you, and the reality of it all will scare the hell out of you.Note: The Everyman's Library edition contains a new introduction by Malcolm Bradbury, a timeline for notable events in the period during which the book is set and the preface that Heller himself wrote for the 1994 re-issue. If you are planning on buying this book, I recommend getting the Everyman's Library edition, as the added features are quite worth it. Plus, it comes with one of those built-in cloth bookmarks that are so handy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. I was disappointed to see the Kindle version priced higher than the paper back book through Amazon. Furthermore, the Kindle version contains several typos that seemed to result from translation errors made from scanning from print to digital. For example: \\"He wouldn't he to anyone;\\" which should have been \\"He wouldn't lie to anyone.\\" The typos were minor, and I probably wouldn't have cared as much if the publisher weren't selling me a digital book that costs them less to produce than the identical paper back which presumably has no typos. Still - read the book - regardless of the version."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is the funniest book I have ever picked up. Joseph Heller has to be one of the greatest wits in literature history. The story of Yossarian the pilot who simply wants to live works on so many different levels. In the end the book transcends simply being comedy, it uses humor to pack a helluva moral punch that absolutely reduces the blindness of war, the slavish devotion to government to total ruin. By the end of the book the illogical nature of war is so clear that it's a wonder the UN hasn't declared war illegal and a crime. The dialogue is incredibly clever and the characters so unique and colorful. On of my favorite parts is the scene where General Dreedle at first wants the chaplain to hang out in the bar (\\"So that he can sympathize with the men and gain their trust. How else are they going to believe in God?\\") but in the next breath says, \\"That's a fine thing, a man of God hanging out with a bunch of drunks and losers.\\" And ends up threatening to have the chaplain taken outside and shot. Most of the humor fallows this same pattern, proving over and over again the illogical, contradictory, and insane nature of the military and of war. Or how about Milo and the syndacite? Milo plays both sides of every conflict and ends of funding an enemy bombing of his own batallion...There are better reviews on here and I could go on and on but this book literally blew me over with its powerful message and savagely satirical humor."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I had originally read Joseph Heller's \\"Catch 22\\" many many years ago while in High School. At the time, I greatly enjoyed the book, and it's telling that over 30 years later, I still remember many of the characters very clearly today. I recently decided to re-read the book, although not without some misgivings, as I was afraid that, like many things in life, it might be better left in memory than revisiting in reality. I needn't have been concerned.Catch 22 is a classic novel, combining many disparate elements ... slapstick, biting sarcasm, tragedy, the darkest of black humor ... into something larger than the sum of its parts. The story follows Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian, a bombadier in a B-25 bomber in Italy. Yossarian and his fellow pilots have been pushed well beyond their limits of endurance by an incompetent and uncaring superior, and Yossarian has lost his nerve to continue fighting, along with maybe a large part of his sanity. He desperately trys to avoid flying any more combat missions, but the military bureaucracy always manages to stay one step ahead of him. Yossarian's story, as well as those of the multitude of colorful and flawed characters around him, make for a good read.They say you should write what you know, and like his character Yossarian, Mr. Heller was a B-25 Bombadier in Italy, where he flew 60 combat missions. The book shines on many levels ... as pure entertainment, as an anti-war novel, as an inditement against mindless bureaucracy ... and stands up well almost 50 years after it was first published. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Yossarian, the protagonist of Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unlikely war hero. Many central characters in war novels focus on more typical soldierly qualities, such as bravery and duty, but Yossarian is a blatant antihero whom the reader comes to regard as a competent and sane voice in an otherwise absurd setting. Yossarian has no illusions about the war and does not trouble himself by concealing from his military superiors his true feelings and concerns. While there were certainly moral factors in World War II--e.g. the fight against fascism--Yossarian's bizarre environment has erased any pretense of nobility. His military service can only serve to get him killed, as he constantly reiterates.To Yossarian, the needs of society can never replace the needs of the individual. Although society may be comprised of individual citizens, each must retain his fundamental freedoms and safety. Within his bomber group, Yossarian has found the blatant indifference of General Dreedle, the incompetent careerism of Colonels Cathcart and Scheisskopf, and the maddening anti-social behavior of Major Major, the squadron commander. Against this backdrop, Yossarian cannot accept that the needs of society trump those of the individual; furthermore, he believes his need--survival--outweighs the Army's need for him to fly missions as a bombardier.Catch-22 is as relevant and compelling today as it ever was. With America embroiled in two wars, each with its own nebulous goal and distorted morality, the role of the individual in society is more in question that ever. Yet, unlike Heller's day, there is no draft and individuals are no longer compelled to serve in uniform; thus, war persists because the military has been relegated to nothing more than a government department that politicians and bureaucrats are unencumbered to use as they see fit. As society moves down this dangerous path, most readers would do well to read and reread Catch-22 and reflect."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book runs through the gamut of emotions in a single chapter. I laughed, I cried, and I thoroughly enjoyed the emotional rollercoaster. It's a difficult read in the beginning as the chapters are like the corner pieces of the puzzle, they seem random and disconnected. Eventually you're given the pieces that tie the whole puzzle together and it's a beautiful sight to behold. It's a war story, but it's also a commentary on bureaucracy and the social condition. For me, it sums up my views on life in a way I could never express. Heller just gets it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I heard Catch-22 was up for grabs in my English 9 class, I was eager to obtain the book. From Amazon and even from a few of my friends I had heard good things about the book, the biggest being its humor. This book was perfect for a person of my reading level, which is around the 11th to 12th grade mark. I would say, however, that it is quite long for anyone looking for a casual read.The book itself stars the satirical Captain Yossarian. Yossarian is an American bombadier in WWII stationed in the fictional camp on the nonfictional island of Pianosa, Italy. Through the book, many events lead him to other parts of Italy like Bologna and Rome. Yossarian has to fly more and more missions, and after the witnesses the death of Snowden, he is demoralized and simply stops trying. Yossarian's new goal is to just stay alive. The general idea of the book revolves around a universal idea called a Catch-22, in which no conclusion can be made due to the fact that both options cancel each other out. If event a has to happen, event b must happen, but event b cannot happen without event a, etc. In essence, a Catch-22 is an unobtainable paradox. It is this paradox that keeps Yossarian and his wingmates in the war for a walloping 80+ missions.Yossarian's wingmates are all a bunch of strange individuals, each with their own stories to be told. As such, each chapter usually focuses on that character to help the reader better understand why things are the way they are. However, this often causes the narrator to have to go back and this can disorient the reader. Another low point is how it takes a while for the plot to actually advance. I swear I got d&eacute;j&agrave; vu reading this book. However, in the end of the book, things start coming together and it focuses mainly on Yossarian.The book's highly-praised humor is one of its selling points. The dark, satirical, and sometimes just plain funny humor is evident, as each chapter has some sort of funny happening, such as a witty, lightning-fast debate that lacks logic, or the distortion of famous quotes to fit a character's personality. It is this that keeps the reader pushing on through all 453 of its pages.Catch-22 may be a long book, but anyone interested in an entertaining, humorous, and just plain good read, should pick it up today."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"While reading Catch 22 I wondered when Heller realized that he'd struck literary gold. Was it during the writing process or later after the book received critical acclaim? Although Heller wrote numerous other books, I defy any average Joe to name any except for the \\"sequel\\" to Catch 22 (called Closing Time) and the often considered \\"sacrilegious\\" posthumous Portrait of An Artist As An Old Man. Nonetheless Heller ended up writing one of the most endearing, hilarious and poignant American novels ever.Catch 22 follows the exploits of a WWII American bomber pilot named Yossarian. We follow Yossarian through numerous missions and extra-curricular events in around his air force base and various locations throughout Europe. Yossarian is a wise cracking paranoid fellow who often finds himself in the most absurd of situations that end up being revealing slices of life. It's political satire at its best and one of the book's many strengths is the ability to change the reader's reality so that the absurd seems commonplace.Catch 22 has many things going for it. \\"Laugh out loud hilarity\\" is a phrase I've often heard others (and myself) use to describe Catch 22. One of the funniest books ever, it gets better with each read...Yossarian and his cronies are loveable characters that you will come to care about root for to survive. Besides being hilarious the book has many touching and horrifying moments as it deals with monstrosities and casualties of war. To top it off, Catch 22 is more relevant as a military satire due to current world events.Amongst my group of peers (mid to late 20 somethings), Catch 22 seems to be the most common \\"all time favorite book\\" and I would have to say it's top 3 for me as well. It has a message, it's delivered in an entertaining way, the writing is more than serviceable, the characters are memorable and it has introduced a phrase into the American colloquium. These are just many of the reasons why the book was a \\"classic\\" shortly into after it was published.Everyone should read this book although its length and prose could be a challenge for the uninitiated or inexperienced. Although some of the material is adult in nature, the book is appropriate for mature high school students.Bottom Line: A cornerstone of American culture, this novel is not to be missed. A genre defining novel that will make you feel like you accomplished something important upon its completion..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller is such a talented writer! This story is funny, shocking, sad, horrifying, confusing, and yet painfully simple.

This novel is a social commentary that explores the atrocities of war, interpersonal relationships, and the depths of the human condition.Catch 22 is definitely one of my top 10 favorite books."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When my father told me to read this book, I was 13 years old. I moaned and groaned but just said \\"to hell with it\\" and began to read. From Chapter one, \\"The Texan\\" to Chapter forty-two, \\"Yossarian\\", this book held my interest for the whole ride. Heller has produced not only a hilarious but an intelligent and well-thought scenario to place Yossarian into an inescapable paradox of authority and his own discombobulated resolve. This novel also carries an excellent anti-war and anti-authority message, and will motivate a reader to stand up for what they believe in, not to conform to someone else's beliefs. A must-read for anyone in their right mind."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is by far the funniest book I've ever read. The humor is truly original and creative.

The book isn't in chronological order, but instead structured by theme. The product is a realistic but specially sequencial order of events.Catch-22 is by far the best book I've ever read. From the beginning to the end, I was blown away. I've reread it several times the same year. The only drawback about Catch-22 is that it's not completely accessible.

It may have something to do with the indignant, satirical energy that the book explodes with, or with the sheer unorthodoxy of the mechanics of the writing itself. Regardless, this is a novel I have revisted time and again, alternantely finding comfort that there may be a way to short circuit the madness that is my life, and sharing Yossarian's exasperation with the unnecessary indignities and difficulties of life. In laughing at Catch-22 we laugh at ourselves and our lives, and although few of us have experienced WWII from a bombardier's eye view, we have all experienced Yossarian, Major Major, R. O. Shipman, Dunbar, and everyone else in or even remotely connected with the 256th squadron. Sometimes the cosmos laugh.

(The word is widely used in the russian army and society and stands for unpunished petty tyranny of people of higher rank, carried out to demonstrate the superiority of their position and (or) as a result of the inefficiency of their brainwork, which leads to unnecessary waste of time and energy of the subordinates, who are forced to execute orders often devoid of any common sense.)

It was 1964 and a place called Vietnam was just starting to be spoken about, a place most of us didn't know the first thing about. I was lucky enough to be discharged in 1965, and missed the opportunity to kill Asian farmers. I finished &quot;Catch-22&quot; in just a few days. I've read it many, many, times since. From being a rather ordinary, &quot;just go along with it&quot;, marine, I became an anti-war protester, in no small part due to this wonderfully subversive work of Joseph Heller. I've never read another book, (and, I've read very many), that so completely and so darkly (yet hilariously), points out the horrible absurdity of war.

Before Catch 22, much had been written about war but few had found humour in it, and fewer had ridiculed it. After Catch 22, it is difficult to conceive of war (and warmongers) being presented in any other way. In presenting war as farce, Heller didn't just change the way we view armed conflict, but the way we see authority, in corporations, government bodies and other institutions where men accrue and exercise power.

I finished this book a couple of years ago, and I still laughingly think about some of the circumstances that Yossarian got himself into while trying to get out of the war machine that he was part of. You don't have to be of the generation that fought WWII to thoroughly enjoy this book; in fact, you don't have to know anything about war at all to cheer for Yossarian in his attempt to escape the war.

Returning the favor, many critics condemned the book. Some, however, defended Heller, contending that the book was in fact not about war or the military, but was a commentary on American society. Furthermore, Heller dwells on a few specific aspects of American society, like the emergence of mega-corporations.\\"Everyone in my book accuses everyone else of being crazy. Frankly I think that the whole society is nuts - and the question is: what does a sane man do in an insane society?\\" -Joseph Heller (AP)As Norman Podhoretz said in his essay, \\"Looking Back At Catch-22,\\" Heller's real subject was the nature of American society at the time he wrote this book. But how? It sure seems as though this is a novel about war. The setting is in Italy during World War II. The characters fly combat missions on a daily basis. They act like soldiers. In fact, they are soldiers. So how can this novel not be about war? It is not about war because of the meaning buried within the narrative - the war serves only as a vehicle for Heller's message. But what is Heller's message? The novel jumps from place to place, almost illogically, perhaps like American society. So how do we figure out his message? By carefully reading the lines of text, and in between the lines, we see that Heller thinks that American society is crazy. \\"What would they do to me,\\" he asked in confidential tones, \\"if I refused to fly them?\\" \\"We'd probably shoot you,\\" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen replied. \\"We?\\" Yossarian cried in surprise. \\"What do you mean, we? Since when are you on their side?\\" \\"If you're going to be shot, whose side do you expect me to be on?\\" ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen retorted.And perhaps this exchange between ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen and Yossarian is a commentary on how people in this country have no sense of loyalty to anything. Reading into his commentary, we see that Heller has lost hope for society.During the writing of this book, companies merged and \\"acquired\\" each other right and left. From this merger and acquisition frenzy came the term \\"corporate America.\\" Once again, Heller deems this to be crazy, so he makes fun of it. In the book, Milo's syndicate, M&amp;M Industries, represents one such large corporation. He claims that if the syndicate makes a profit then it is good for everyone. This is analogous to corporations that claim that if they merge, they will be able to provide a better product, which is better for the consumer. Well, in reality, it cuts jobs and thus creates larger profits for the corporation. Nonetheless, corporations present some damn good arguments for merging, just as Milo presents some damn good arguments for why the syndicate is good for everyone - \\"everyone gets a share\\" (Heller). Furthermore, M&amp;M Industries exhibits some organized crime structure as well. Perhaps Heller is saying that the size and political power of these mega-corporations (which were nothing like the corporations today vis-&agrave;-vis BP-Amoco, Microsoft, AOL/Netscape-Time Warner, etc.) makes them too powerful, and that they can do anything that they please, legal, quasi-legal, or blatantly illegal, much like organized crime. To put it bluntly: it's not about war, stupid. What it is about is American society and how it is spiraling downward towards oblivion. Furthermore, Heller thinks he is the only sane one in an insane world - like Yossarian. Heller thinks that everyone is crazy, and so he broadcasts his message to everyone via his book - if they are sane enough to decode his message - a catch-22 in and of itself.\\"It used to shock me and alarm me and discourage me that there was a general decline of everything of value.

This world is called \\"Catch-22\\" by Joseph Heller. In this land of probabilities a narrative encircles a reality (like a ball encircles roulette's bowl before landing on a lucky number for some or a cursed one for others) before revealing the final results. And in the process of encircling, the same narrative paints characters out of the white pages with the colors of stories full of absurdities, and in spite of these absurdities these characters represent parallel witnesses of real personalities - the ones in our own reality.The more I read the book, the more I discovered how Heller's world complements mine, how it reflects it like a mirror as it examines the meaninglessness of war, name, rank, serial number, order, death, economy, capitalism, love, sex, religion (and not necessarily in the same order) and several other highly regarded objects of (im)moral value, and in this reflection it condemns them.Initially, I thought everyone in this novel was crazy. Then, I thought Heller was crazy. In the end I found out that it's the (I) reader who is crazy, that the world (I) he lives in is crazy, the job (I) he does is crazy, the aspirations (I) he holds are crazy, the mind (I) he tries to expand is crazy, and yet it feels good, and sacred, and meaningful, and happy, and cuddly, because (I) he makes it to be so, and because others say it is, and because (I) he is never going to be Youssarian (although secretly (I) he dreams of becoming like him).For those of you who don't have time to delve into the story completely I recommend the movie. Otherwise, the book is a must read.-by Simon Cleveland"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"&#65533;&#65533;They&#65533;re trying to kill me,&#65533; Yossarian told him calmly.&#65533;No one&#65533;s trying to kill you,&#65533; Clevinger cried.&#65533;Then why are they shooting at me?&#65533; Yossarian asked.&#65533;They&#65533;re shooting at everyone,&#65533; Clevinger answered. &#65533;They&#65533;re trying to kill everyone.&#65533;&#65533;And what difference does that make?&#65533;&#65533; (25)Catch-22&#65533;s antihero questions the ultimate logic of war. &#65533;And what difference does that make?&#65533; This is a resounding question throughout the book (and throughout the war), both in which Joseph Heller&#65533;s creation, Yossarian, plays a vital role. In Catch-22, Heller creates an array of characters whose absurdity is at once satirical, silly, somber, and scathing. Particularly, the passionate, angry, strikingly sane voice of Yossarian lends a certain ironic tragedy both to the mindless pursuit we call &#65533;war&#65533; and to the mindless machine we call &#65533;bureaucracy.&#65533;It is important to read Catch-22 not only as a great piece of twentieth-century literature, but also as a primary source, written by a man whose own involvement in WWII allowed him to create this novel and this character. The characterizations that Heller creates in this novel are a clear and scathing indictment of twentieth-century &#65533;&#65533;isms,&#65533; all of which combine to perpetuate aggression and eventually escalate into the total wars of our modern era. These &#65533;-isms&#65533; include patriotism, opportunism, capitalism, heroism, individualism, and sadism. In striking contrast, Yossarian seems to transcend these evil &#65533;-isms&#65533; and capture something missing in modern warfare&#65533;sanity. Yossarian&#65533;s desperate desire for self-preservation is the clearest evidence of his sanity and runs counter to all of the caricatured &#65533;ideals&#65533; surrounding him. Certainly, like all other novels, Catch-22 has its failings&#65533;at times, it seems that &#65533;the book is an emotional hodgepodge; no mood is sustained long enough to register for more than a chapter&#65533;; at other times, the action and characters almost seem too absurd and farcical to make a valid point; at still other times, the satire seems too formulaic, unable to grasp at the ironies of life. However, for all of its failings, the mood and voice that is uniquely Yossarian&#65533;s allows the novel to maintain a joie de vivre and strength for all time. Yossarian&#65533;s logic is created against the stark backdrop of a tragic and deadly war; however, this logic lives on especially now. At the conclusion of the book, the reader is compelled to ask, of war, of bureaucracy, and of all else, &#65533;And what difference does that make?&#65533;This book must be read by anyone who decides to weigh in on the most recent political conversation regarding war, conflict, and terrorism. Best of luck...and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book used to be funnier. When I read it as a teenager it was hilarious. The absurdity, the foolishness, the ripping descriptions of situations and people with whom we could all superficially relate -- it made me laugh and shake my head and then laugh and shake my head again.Now I'm an adult and -- with age and the experience of responsibility -- I picked the book up to enjoy it again. And I didn't. I still chuckled in the early pages but stopped reading by page 100. First, I no longer found any of the characters remotely believable. Even as a veteran, I didn't link the straw-man military types to real life. Then I thought, maybe that's the point: create over-the-top characters in order to skewer an idea. But I still didn't get it.Second, the unrelenting bitterness of the author's voice reached me this time and it annoyed me to no end. Every character seemed to be either crazy or an idiot, unhappy with himself, a failure at life, stupid, dishonest, amoral or immoral, and even those who weren't were -- per the protagonist and the author -- therefore fools who didn't know how dumb they were. Even in a work of satire that gets old. In fact, especially in a work of satire it made me lose what the satire was supposed to be about.Last, and this is a sure sign I'm getting old, I couldn't get past the protagonist's selfishness. Absolutely I sympathized with his desire to fly no more missions. But then I kept wondering, so who's supposed to fly in his place? If he doesn't go, someone else has to. Obviously the self-centeredness appealed to the 60's generation who made this book a \\"classic.\\" But now a few years on, it no longer seems so funny.It's still an interesting book and worth reading if only to know how the title entered our lexicon. But it's not as good as I remembered. And it used to be funnier."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I'm more aligned with the reviewers that the trimumphal author takes to task in his 1994 preface, which appears at the end of this edition. I was expecting more out of a novel that has received such wide acclaim, including on the amazon website. The novel was flabby in many places, the characterization was thin, and the absurdist aspects wore on me. In many regards, it read like an extended Marx Brothers movie. I suppose I understand the origins of television's McHale's Navy and more to the point M*A*S*H a little better now, though I must admit what I found tiresome in M*A*S*H, I found tiresome in C-22. The wit was too much on display, wanting to be looked at and thought deep and insightful.All of that said, I did become engaged by the second half of the book. The chaplain and a few other characters did begin to have something to say. And anyone who has dealt with corporate absurdities will find resonance in many parts of this book. Additionally, I learned something about how the American officer class of WWII, which strikes me as quite different than that of today. Heller obviously writes of what he knows. For my money and time however, I would recommend Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy over C-22 if it's a comedic, jaundiced look at WWII one is seeking."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book because I saw it was recommended by Kurt Vonnegut and then again by Matt Groening in a Life in Hell comic strip, so I thought it must be pretty good. It starts out great, but Heller's style is so repetitive it becomes pretty boring to slog through it. It would have been much better if it had been edited down by about half. My advice--read anything by Vonnegut instead...even his worst efforts are better than this thing."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is about 350 pages too long. It's not that it's bad, it's just that Heller makes himself quite clear in the first thirty pages and then ensnares the reader in chapter after chapter of \\"War as an Endless Sitting at the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.\\" I think that the length and density and madness of the book is itself part of Heller's unique take on the \\"War is Hell\\" theme, but I still wish he had chopped out a dozen chapters or so.The book doesn't really have a plot, exactly, as instead it examines a number of characters involved in WWII in Italy. There are some plot points, like a particular mission in which Snowden is killed, but the plot does not advance so much as loop back on itself in a Gordian knot until the last fifty pages or so, where the structure makes a welcome shift to a more straightforward but significantly darker series of events after an accidental mid-air collision.There are some very amusing moments in this book - I laughed out loud at some of the developments in the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade, and some of the more nakedly amoral actions of Milo (the ultimate capitalist) - but it's not exactly a laugh-out-loud funny book overall. Heller seems more inclined to use humor to engage the reader in the absurdity of war, and I don't know that he's entirely successful at each attempt.Overall, I see why this is a classic, and I'm happy that I let my fear of peer pressure stop me from giving up after the first hundred pages, but I can see why it's not for everyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It seems most criticism of this book on the site asserts claims of dull repetitiveness and trite anti-war arguments. Even Yossarian however admits that the war against Germany had to be fought (of course to know this you would have had to get past the first hundred pages as so few of the critics have).The book is about capitalism, relationships, friendship, duty, service, love and the eternal paradox inherent in each. There is something human in this book that touches us as the reader in the depths of their humanity and throws us naked from the tree of knowledge (and good and evil too!) into the world around us. Enjoy the fall!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"At first this book puts off because it is so clever and cynical. The whole 'madness of war' concept has been covered so often that the book seems stale (though this was one of the first modern American books with this theme). This cynical and clever criticism appeals maybe to self-centered young men but it was tiresome. However the humour is genuinely suprising and the book starts to have some heart about half way through. Not everyone is an idiot and there are some nuanced portrayals of more complex characters.So read it for the wit, but unless you've never read anything of the genre (i.e. anti-war novels), don't expect any fresh insights."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 was written by Joseph Heller who served as an Army Air Force bombardier during WWII, which seems obvious since some of the information described seemed like it could only have come from someone who actually was there and went through the war.Rule Catch-22 seems to be a lose lose situation. You can be discharged from duty during war if you are insane. But Catch-22 points out that only people who are insane would participate in war to begin with, so if you know you should not be participating in it, then you're sane, and thus have to serve.John Yosarian the main character reminds me a lot of Corporal Klinger from M.A.S.H., (I'm sure that that T.V. show had to have used this book as a model, if not intentionally, then at least subconsciously), but unlike Corporal Klinger who is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war because he's lazy, Yosarian is trying to get a section 8 to get out of the war to save his life. It's not as funny when you put it that way.This book was quite an emotional roller coaster ride. It's full of sarcasm which I like, but it's Joke, Joke, Joke, and then someone dies. When that happens I didn't know whether I was supposed to laugh or cry.Then just when you get used to this type of format it changes to the reverse where it touches upon a really sincere issue, and then hits you with more satire to follow it up.The tension in the book keeps mounting and mounting as the number of missions a bombardier needs to fly to qualify to go home keeps mounting. You find yourself routing for the character just to survive.It's full of lot's of irony, and all of the characters are wonderful. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I'm sure each one of them represents some part of his psyche. Overall it was a very good book.P.S. A movie based on the book came out in 1970."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's Catch 22 is the funniest book I have ever read, but it is also a surprisingly tragic story.The plot (about a bombardier named Yossarian who wishes desperately to find a way out of fighting in WWII) is not truly concrete, and the entire book is mostly a study in character. The conflicts of John Yossarian's various friends and foes are explored, and the ineffectiveness of bureaucracy is mercilessly satirized. Here's an example of the trademark wit and absurdity that characterizes Catch 22:\\"They're trying to kill me,\\" Yossarian told him calmly.\\"No one's trying to kill you,\\" Clevinger cried.\\"Then why are they shooting at me?\\" Yossarian asked.\\"They're shooting at everyone,\\" Clevinger answered. \\"They're trying to kill everyone.\\"\\"And what difference does that make?\\"A great and memorable book, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I usually prefer the English classics (eg. Dickens, Austen, Brontes etc.),but thought due to a friend's recommendation that I would give this a go - it was well worth it. This book is unique, with its gently facetious humour and the darkness which becomes more and more prevelant as the novel moves on. A situation strikes you as hilariously funny in one part of the book, but later it is presented in a light which makes you feel incredibly guilty for laughing first time around. This book plays with your emotions on a grand scale."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller began work on Catch-22, the story of a US airman's attempts to survive the madness of the Second World War, shortly after returning from the conflict himself.The book - tells the story of Captain Joseph Yossarian, a member of a US bomber crew stationed on the Mediterranean island of Pianosa. Yossarian is convinced that the military is trying to get him killed, and that those around him are insane, and he spends the book trying to get out of flying any more seemingly suicidal missions.Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else, the newly promoted Major Major, who spends most of the war trying to hide from his men, and the profiteer Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder, a pure capitalist whose only ambition is to make money out of the war, and who ends up charging a commission on every military engagement.Using satire, black humour and seemingly undefeatable logic, the book argues that war is insane, that the military is insane, and that, quite probably, modern life itself is insane too.As Yossarian struggles against the self-serving bureaucracy at the heart of the military machine, Heller argues that the individual will always struggle against the vested interests that control the world. And, perhaps, that madness is an entirely relevant reaction to this.Yossarian's dilemma is summed up by &quot;Catch-22&quot; of the air force's code of practice, &quot;which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind&quot;. What this means, as the book's Doc Daneeka explains to Yossarian of another flyer's situation, is that &quot;Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to&quot;. In other words, the only sane reaction to war is to recognise its madness. But in doing so, and proving his sanity, Yossarian makes himself eligible to fight. As Yossarian puts it: &quot;That's some catch, that Catch-22&quot;. The doctor, whose job is to save lives only so that they can be put in danger again, can only agree that &quot;it's the best there is&quot;."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a war book for people who love war, people who hate war, people who fear war, and people who don't particularly care about war. But most importantly, this is a book for people who have a sense of humor. Catch 22 is filled with ridiculous, unbelievable situations that make perfect sense. For example, a commander who wants to move up and therefore orders his men to fly more missions than are required - therein lies Catch 22 (or one version of it) - a man can leave because he finished his required missions, but he has to stay, otherwise he would be disobeying orders from a commanding officer. There is Milo, the self-perserving capitalist, Orr, who constantly crashes his plane, the Chaplain, who is afraid of everyone, and unsure about God, and many more. Basically, this book is about survival - living to tell the tale. And Yosseran does his best throughout the book.

Mr. Heller looks into the center of man and sees our fatal flaws and pours them out on page after page in an utterly hilarious way. No one has ever created so many memorable characters in a single book: Major Major Major Major, Colonel Cathcart, Milo Mindbender, and the center of this off-center universe, Captain Yossarian.Read it, you'll like it.

In a paradoxical world, where the supposedly sane commanding officers run the miltary through methodical madness, the \\"crazy\\" Yossarian is deemed so because he values self-preservation over death.The military brass in Catch-22 proves not only utterly pretentious, incomptetent, indolent, and inept, but incongruously insane themselves. General P.P. Peckem ostentatiously states, \\"My only fault\\", he pauses for effect,\\"is that I have no faults.\\" General Peckem is only one of the many well-developed laughable characters developed throughout Catch-22. The general pedestrian reader might say that this is solely another \\"anti-war\\" book. I think that would be shallow and inaccurate as Catch-22 is much, much more than that. To me, Catch-22 sparks many thoughts and feelings concerning individuality vs. the system(and the Syndicate) and the willingness of one person in a sea of conformity to have the balls to stand up for what is right regardless what the consequences may be."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"contemporary classic; timeless; hilarious.i first read this book almost twenty years ago, and laughed aloud then and at each subsequent reading.catch 22 is a permanent fixture in my library, a terrific timeless comedy with laugh aloud moments that are rare for literature.heller is a wonderful author, and this work will remain relevant for generations.in short . . . i love it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When I first picked up Catch-22, I was hooked by its immediate sense of confusion and hysteria. These themes seem to saturate the book, creating a satirical, memorable novel that points out the senselessness of war. The renegade bombardier, Yossarian, consistently attempts to rise above the rule of Catch-22 and return home to the States. Yet Colonel Cathcart continues to raise the number of missions, causing Yossarian to come up with different ways of rebelling, whether he decides not to wear a uniform, or asks Doc Daneeka to send him to the hospital.The novel not only talks about the ridiculousness of certain customs in war, but the tragedy caused by war. Every soldier risks his life on every mission he flies, hoping that he will survive just this one so that he can be one step closer to going home. Towards the end of the novel, Yossarian walks through the dirty streets of Rome, where he contemplates the state of the world.\\"What a lousy earth!

It isn't just a war book; it goes a lot deeper than that. It has a variety of themes and morals, it just matters how you choose to look at it. Yossarian, the main character, is serving with the Air Force near the Mediterranean. As the time progresses, he understands that war is going on and there are enemies out there who want to kill him. His main goal is to stay alive.The book shows how Yossarian takes the war personally and tells it to us from his view. The novel contains passion with which later comes hate. For those of you who are into history, the book will tell you the situation in Rome through Yossarian's eyes. In the book, Yossarian is a rebel who is going against the society's beliefs. He manages to avoid death by knowing what a precious thing life is. By the end of the book he succeeds in regaining the control of his life.If you have read or planning to read this book, I suggest to also pick up a novel \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" This book is staged in the future, but the main character undergoes some of the same dilemmas as Yossarian."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"After picking this book up and setting it down many times in the bookstore, I was finally prompted to read it for school this summer.

From the moment I picked up the book I was conpletely enthralled, and every word had me hanging. I have never felt the frustration of a character in a novel more than Heller's Yossarian. Every time he runs into Catch-22, I feel the tension rise. And Catch-22 applies to more than just the paradox itself. Every little thing in this novel contradicts itself and shines new light on our own world. Milo telling Yossarian that he should not risk his civil rights by exercising them made me wonder about our world today.

Orr and his crab apples in his cheeks, (because they are better than horse chestnuts), is a good example of the mental instability that most characters seem to exhibit.The book is brilliantly written and it has a great flow to it.

Yossarian is the kind of man we can look up to, he understands whats going on in the world and how he cannot do anything but run for his life.

In future generations, as long as there are people who are able to read and understand, this book will stand with Jonathan Swift, Rabelais, and Cervantes as one of the greatest satires.

One that has something for every one of all ages.The way Heller has combined his sense of humour with simple truths of life is amazing.The reader would not realise that he is reading a serious stuff until he has finished the particulartopic or chapter. The way he has portrayed theagony and sufferings of people at war is unbelievable.The end is also superb. As the saying &quot; All is well that ends well&quot; goes, he shows that an optimist will always win.A masterpiece about which nobody (except perhaps himself) can write exhaustively about."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I realize that Catch-22 is one of those landmark novels that people feel passionate about and that any criticism of it on my part is going to be met with some modem of outrage by everyone who feels it is one of the ten best novels of the 20th Century -but as much as wanted to love this book (and I did want to love it), I have to say, the best I can give it is 3 stars.The novel is well written and is full of amusing moments, poking fun at the insanity of war, with its best ammunition saved for the absurdly convoluted and twisted logic of the military bureaucracy, but these bright moments were not enough for me to consider this a truly great novel.Catch-22 doesn't follow a conventional story line, jumping back and forth in time. While this didn't cause me distress or confusion (in fact I've found this technique appealing in many other novels - including pretty much everything Kurt Vonnegut has ever written) but in this case I found the story moved aimlessly, consisting of little more than a series of loosely bound (albeit, amusing) antidotes. Amusing anecdotes are not a bad thing, but for me, there was no sense that the chapters were building toward anything. The story didn't feel like it was moving forward. As a result, my interest waned (despite the fact that the individual chapters were often entertaining) and it took some measure of discipline for me not to put this book down and move on.My complaint about the lack of forward-moving plot is the primary reason for my middling review(a mere 3 stars for this highly acclaimed novel), but it isn't my only complaint. Another is the lack of likeable characters. While Catch-22 features no shortage of entertaining, self absorbed characters complete with a dizzying array of quirky personality traits, after spending 500 pages with these characters, I have to say, I didn't really care much if they lived, died, deserted, or were sent home to the safety of the good ol' USA. Admittedly many of the most memorable characters in modern fiction aren't likable, in fact some are pure evil, but in the case of Catch-22 I think the novel needed at least one character we could care about.Is this a great novel? In my opinion it isn't. But it's certainly a good novel. It's definitely worth a read, but it won't make my list of the top 100 novels of the 20th Century"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"here are a few recommendations.If you want to laugh out loud and tell your friends about the funniest book you've ever read, pick up something by Bill Bryson or Tony Horowitz.

I feel like the little kid in theEmperor's New Clothes story..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"\\"The real trouble with this world of ours is not that it is an unreasonable world, nor even that it is a reasonable one. The commonest kind of trouble is that it is nearly reasonable, but not quite.\\" G. K Chesterton.*This book's one flaw is that it neglects a discussion of the concentration camps. But more on that later. . . .Catch-22 is classic absurdist literature, focusing on bureaucrat's circular reasoning and double-binds. Although the story set in WWII Italy, anyone who has had to deal with hierarchy and bureaucracy--be it the military, college, the DMV, or the Board of Deacons--will resonates with the ideas expressed herein.It is the American equivalent of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\\" In style, Heller is a mixture of Douglas Adams and Dave Berry. He has the same with and the same dead-eye for human foibles, and the cumulative effect of compound incompetence. This is not a \\"Greatest Generation\\"-type book.I found the first third of the book fresh, with the mixture of absurdist and repetitive humor, the stream of thought, and mid-sentence scene changes. Heller's style gives the book not so much a dreamlike feel, but more of a surrealistic flow to the events. It reminds me of the old classic \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.\\"However, the second third of the book was tedious. The novel humor deteriorated into a gimmick, and a series of stream-of-thought gags. The repetitive humor therefore became redundant. I got the point that things were weird, but the humor-mechanism was overused.The last third got interesting as Heller stopped focusing on absurdist gags, and began focusing on the narrative. This book has a large cast of charters, and it is a fitting tribute to Heller that he keeps track of the mob, and is able to keep us interested in their lives and in the situations.What surprised me the second-most was that this book is definitely a seed-source for M*A*S*H. The most famous moments such as Hawkeye streaking, or his mental breakdown all have their roots in this book. What is that quote about flattery?What surprised me the most was the hidden religious aspect. The book's opening lines are: \\"It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.\\" The chaplain serves as a pontiff, the unit's bridge between man and God. And Yossarian's relationship with the pontiff is one of love.Brilliantly, Heller drops the subject and goes on with the narrative. However the religious ideas keep cropping up. Chapter 18 has a discussion of God by two atheists. I think the statement by Lt. Scheisskopf's Wife on page 180 is a classic example of someone trying to have their cake and eat it, too. Chapter 25 is devoted to the Chaplain's doubts--which leased me to wonder why Heller wants the character to be this way. Then there is the ironically titled of Chapter 39, \\"The Eternal City.\\" So religion is clearly a leitmotif, but it also serves as book-ends to the story.The story (and Heller's sequel), focuses on Yossarian's and Milo's relationship. Yossarian is the rebel and outsider--even outlaw--of the system, while Milo's assimilates and takes advantage of the system. But as the incident with Snowden and the missing morphine illustrates, the assimilation backfires.So it is the death of a comrade, the unnecessary death due to the war profiteering system, that forces Yossarian to have a change of heart, and reject the sub-word of the black market. This is the essential Christian message of the Atonement.This incident forces Yossarian to shift loyalties from Milo and the conniving Generals to the Chaplain. This is an odd realignment, considering that in Chapter 36, the Chaplain Christically suffers for Yossarian horseplay in signing the letters \\"Washington Irving.\\"Once again, we have these Christic moments is this grim and gritty tale of the Other Side of the Greatest Generation. This reminds me of what ex-atheist C. S. Lewis observed, \\"A young man who wishes to remain a sound Atheist cannot be too careful of his reading. There are traps everywhere--\`Bibles laid open, millions of surprises,' as Herbert says, 'fine nets and stratagems.' God is, if I may say it, very unscrupulous.\\" (Surprised by Joy).This brings us to the concentration camps. The book's conflict is Yossarian vs. the absurd situation, with the enemy being the omnipresent Catch-22. But Heller does not discuss the nature of Nazism, except for the brief banter in Chapter 42. This omission is the key--the danger of bureaucratism is infinitely smaller compared to the dangers of Nazism. Or Islamofascisms for that matter."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book based on a friend's recommendation that it was \\"the funniest book ever\\". Sorry to say that I can't agree with her. This is one of those books that does have some funny parts but that's it... these funny parts simply aren't delivered on a consistent basis. Despite this, I did think that Heller did deliver a powerful message about the sheer absurdity of war.

I would read the book again in a heartbeat! It's a really funny and clever book--and it's not really about war. The war just provides and interesting and dynamic setting that can support a variety of backdrops and situations.I can't give this book five stars, because I think I could like a book more.

I'm not one to read books and enjoy them, but this one was different. It showed the stupidity of war and hateful situations with satire. Yossarian, the main character, leads us through his thoughts and actions, basically through a maze of situations unbeknownst to any but an unlucky sane soldier. There are times when you are so confused and enraged with what the way hierarchy decides things, you want to get inside their heads and figure out what they are thinking.We are reminded through Yossarian and other characters, Hungry Joe especially, that what may seem to be nonsense could very well be sensible, and what is known to be good could be bad. Hungry Joe reacts the opposite way you would expect a person to, when things are horrible he is happy, and when things are fine, he is miserable."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 can be a frustrating novel. I HATE the first 50-100 pages. The names of characters come flying out of nowhere. The circular and contradictory style of writing just annoys me. The nonlinear style annoys me.I stuck with it, and before you know it, it all comes together. That is the key. If you stick with it and not try to understand every single detail, or read every dialogue like you are some deep, intospective English teacher, it can be a lot of fun. Understand some parts are supposed to be confusing, and it is normal to feel lost.One chapter describes the roundabout way Milo Minderbinder makes a profit. It is supposed to sound absurd to you. Heller is sarcastically demonstrating the reality of war profiteering. Milo can make you furious, but what really made me furious was how he made no one else around him furious!Overall this was just a fun book, that appeals to the average person looking for a good read, and the serious reader looking for enlightenment. That is the genius of it. For a couple of days while reading the book I was talking like the characters, and I drove people around me crazy. I do not recommend doing this, especially if you are married. Just have fun with it!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"With good reason, Catch-22 is a smart alleck classic. Joseph Heller munches-up one of our most sacred institutions, the military and spits it back into faces. Through the eyes of Yossarian, the World War II bombardier who wants nothing more than to not die, Heller exposes all that is kitschy, absurd and soul-numbing about not just the US army but about the high-minded American attitude in general. Indeed, this is probably less a novel about warfare, as it is a novel that comments on all American extremes including extreme pride, extreme capitalism and extreme bureaucracy. Heller may be a gadfly and he may be too cute at times (my only significant complaint about his style) but it is undeniable that he often has a point. It is easy to commiserate with Yossarian. Why is the numbskull who commands his regiment any less of an enemy than the numbskull who commands the one on the other side when both could get him killed? What do things like pride and country matter to someone who is dead? What does it all mean in the end? Those are questions for the reader to answer, but it is pretty certain that there is a passage somewhere in Catch-22 that would take a pretty good shot at his or her resolution."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a biting satire about the absurdities of war. Set in World War 2, the novel is about a squadron of bomber crews stationed in Pianosa. The book follows the exploits of the group, and of one man in particular: a bomber named Yossarian. Yossarian goes against the grain, and tries valiantly throughout the novel to escape the inevitable Catch-22. All Yossarian wants to do is survive the war, but that seems impossible in the face of Catch-22. This novel is about his struggle against the system, his personal quest for survival in the face of a military that sees him only as part of the war effort.Several things--a colonel who's aspiring to be a general and keeps upping the required number of missions, a mess hall attendant who forms his own syndicate and sells supplies to the enemy to gain a profit, a major who disappears inside his trailer--combine to form the military unit to which Yossarian belongs, where \\"what's good for the syndicate is good for the country\\" and where men are endangered and their lives sacrificed for the ambitions of higher-ranking men aspiring to fortune and notoriety.This book would be depressing--horribly depressing--were it not so downright funny. The situations, the way the characters react and interact with each other, are absurd and hilarious. In fact, the attitudes of most of these men (commanders in particular) are downright ridiculous, and the book is not realistic in terms of the characters personalities (how many generals REALLY believe they can order someone to be shot whenever they want?). Still, the absurd nature of the book is what gives it such power. By giving his characters such outrageous ambitions and by creating such ridiculous situations for them, Heller makes his message painfully clear.This book is a modernist approach to war. The narrative is fragmented and roughly pieced together, and the satire is very prominent and in-your-face. In the end, Yossarian is faced with a choice: submit to the \`Catch,' or die trying to escape it. The irony of it all--submit to the Catch and be a hero (though morally dead) or try to escape it and be physically dead--is what makes Yossarian such a powerful character. This book is one of the greatest works of the 20th century for a reason--the impression it leaves is very lasting."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I started Catch-22 3 times in my life. 2 of the times ended halfway through because life just wouldn't have it.

I saw my own world changing after reading the novel for two weeks. The way i thought the way i talked, my views on what a coward and what a brave person is. It was really great.Joseph Heller is absolutely a genius. He created a world, much like our own with it's own hypocracies and jaded/curupt leading figures.

His amiable persona and his great questions and ideas and etc.Definately one of my favorite books now."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 was an extremely well-written novel taking place during World War II. The author, Joseph Heller, made full use of his extraordinary wit. The whole novel takes on a light view, looking into an American military camp in Italy. The story is superbly set up as a camp of foolish bombardiers headed by egotistical power- and glory-hungry generals.The story shifts from character to character, spending only a few pages on each. As the story progresses, previously introduced characters come in contact with each other, setting up the plot.Heller wrote the book ten years after the war was over, but he still was able to grasp the general ideas of a military camp. Heller realized though that his novel was going to be much too serious if he kept it completely factual, so he changed a few details, which altered the novel from being serious to funny.Although Heller changed the idea of a camp somewhat, he was still able to write an extremely funny novel. His wit provided an amusing storyline that no other book from World War II has, making Catch-22 truly one-of-a-kind."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a great book. In the beginning, the book starts great, though it seemed that some of the jokes were no that funny. Many of the characters were great and some of them were comparable. There were many hilarious scenes that I thought were great in the novel. Though at times, character's seemed very ignorant and immature. This novel is also great, for having an aspect of how many people that are in war have. There must be many individuals in war that might feel the way that Yossarian felt. Though this book is a comedy, Heller made a mixture of Comedy in the beginning and Tragedy in the end."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Great book, great ideas, read it, but before you do know some things.First, remember that this book is &quot;Catch-22,&quot; not &quot;such and such at war&quot; or whatever. I read the first ten reviews an only one mentioned it. An C-22 is not the unexcapeable situation the dictionary would have you believe it is. I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say know there are scences that better handle C-22 than the Doc's. It initially seemed to be about 1/2 dozen things that only shared a name in common but after a few reads it clicked.As others have pointed out, the novel is not cronological in order. This makes the novel difficult to understand, and that combined with the difficulty of understanding C-22 the idea brought my rating down to 4 stars."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In Catch-22, Joseph Heller uses a flashback structure and irony to make reader not only see how horrible war is, but Heller utilizes comedy to first make the reader laugh then have the reader be disgusted with what they were laughing at. Heller structures Catch-22 in a jumble of flashbacks of events and repetitions. Heller may first mention something very random at the beginning of the book, and make it seem like it's some joke. However, then later on in the novel he'll actually tell the situation behind the first mention of it, and it sickens the reader to learn what truly happened. For example, Yossarian, the main character in the book, has a \\"dead man\\" in his tent. At first this just seems to strengthen the opinion that Yossarian is insane. Heller repeats this use of the \\"dead man\\" all throughout the book until finally he tells the reader who the \\"dead man\\" really is. The \\"dead man\\" is a man named Mudd. Mudd transferred into the same squadron that Yossarian was in, but immediately went on a mission after he put his stuff in Yossarian's tent. He was killed on that mission, but his paperwork hadn't actually transferred him into the squadron. Therefore he was never actually in the squadron. That means his stuff still lies on one of the beds in Yossarian's tent, and no one can take it out because it's really not there. At first the reader may find the mention of the dead man to be humorous, but when the reader finds out the truth they feel disgusted with what they were laughing at. Another structural episode that is repeated numerous times throughout the book, deals with a man named Snowden. At first he is just mentioned, and once again this adds to the thought that Yossarian is insane. Then near the end of the book Heller tells the reader what really happened with Snowden. This graphic description of Snowden's death sickens the reader and once again enforces the purpose of the author to show how horrible war is. Irony also is very prevalent and purposeful in conveying Heller's message from the book. One instance shows how corrupt the management has become. The leaders of the squadron want them to go bomb a bridge to form a roadblock, or that is at least what they tell the men. The truth is they just want to get a nice picture of a \\"bomb pattern\\". They don't care that this will kill innocent civilians, all they want is their stupid \\"bomb pattern\\". It is ironic that the commanders don't uphold that decency of not killing people just for the fun of it when they should. They really don't care even if their own men die, just as long as they get some recognition. Another irony demonstrating how war twists things, happens through the chaplain. It says \\"the chaplain had sinned, and it was good\\". This is ironic because the chaplain is supposed to uphold some sort of righteousness even in trial, and now when he sins it is good. A paradox that also portrays how war really messes people up is the fact that Yossarian thinks that everyone is \\"trying to kill him\\". At first this statement seems ironic, but the more the reader gets into the book the more truth it has. Not only does the enemy try to shoot Yossarian down, but his own commanders are trying to kill him by making him fly more missions. Colonel Cathcart, the leading colonel of the squadron, keeps raising the number of missions therefore giving more chances to everyone else to kill him. In an indirect way the colonel tries to kill him, and according to Yossarian so is everyone else. War has made him paranoid, and it destroys any sort of faith in goodness or even any kind of truth. War has completely warped everything that he is. Heller's purpose is to show how terrible and twisted war can make a person."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book ALWAYS makes my Top 5 List"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Maybe it was somewhat shocking in its day to take a critical and lampooning look at the military and contemporary society, but its somewhat status quo today. The writing is decent, but not extraordinary. The chapters focus on a separate character, weaving their interactions together with some flashbacks and a few other out-of-chronology accounts. There are repeating themes about irony, deceiving appearances, contradictory motives, power-blind leaders, prostitutes, black markets, infirmaries, and borderline insanity. There are some interesting points made, but not nearly enough to fill up 450 pages. The list of characters is fairly impressive and engaging, but the narrative itself doesn't have a powerful arc, nor are there many philosophical insights or cathartic moments along the way. The characters are amusing, but one doesn't make an emotional connection. Overall, the passages on prostitutes and black markets seemed cliche by modern standards, and deflating via ennui with their trite and vulgar presence.

The book is incredibly fictional, to the point of ridiculousness, but as they say, &quot;much truth is said in jest.&quot;It's not perfect: Heller's scene with Yossarian in the rain near the end was a bit overdone, and if he wanted to make it dramatic and impacting, he should have written it better, but all in all with the hilarity, the brilliant irony, and the anti-war effect it leaves you after you read it, it deserves an easy 5 stars."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a very thought provoking novel.

For those of you that have never run across this law it states, \\"If anything can go wrong, it will.\\" This book seems to embody this thought and nothing else. \\"Catch-22\\" is a long list of things that go wrong with little hope for meaning or plot. Why is this book popular? I believe that many people can relate to a person that is always faced with problems and is surrounded by strange people. When I was reading this book I was able to find one person (I stress the one) who truly enjoyed it. This single person happened to have been enlisted in the Army twice, both times being put up for Court Martial for their resistance to authority. While hearing this person's story I could tell how their similar situations could draw them to a book like this. I haven't experienced any military time, but I wasn't happy by the portrayal of incompetence by the leaders in this book. I have a hard time believing that everyone in positions of authority in a military unit are either looking for advancement or public notoriety."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book was quite interesting.

It concentrates on the evils of war (its absurdity) by creating a text with little concrete plot, shifting time, and characters who are as senseless as war itself. Heller makes his point very clearly, and this novel deserves to be regarded as a classic. Comparisons with Slaughterhouse-Five are almost certain to arise; Vonnegut's novel is the stronger of the two, but Heller should not be underestimated in any way. The message of this novel, which is developed slowly as Heller leads the leader up to a spilling secret, is plain; for a lover of peace and wry humor, this is an excellent piece to read. For a lover of war and conflict, however, this is a novel that should certainly be read; if everyone could be lead to see Heller's point of view, maybe the world would be a safer, better place for \\"nuts\\" like Yossarian."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I am not overdoing it when i say that catch 22 is undoubtably the most entertaining, humourous, unique and utterly beautiful book I have ever encounted.

The book does not simply make a point and then drive it into the ground. Its length and content aid in its quality of satire. Heller could have abbreviated it after page 200, but, in keeping with the title, the ubiquitous sense of frustration and hopelessness would have been compromised, (not to mention the irony!!!)! This book says volumes about war, perhaps in as profound a manner as Johnny Got His Gun. And Heller achieved this with a caustic wit, and little to no reliance on horror. I read it seven times in a row, and discovered complex new layers each time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book does not follow a novel format.

If Joseph Heller had only written one book, this one book would make him a great writer. The insane humor alternately makes you laugh and think. There are characters in the book who have become metaphors for me. Life will call to mind such people as the infuriatingly thickskulled Arfy. The spirited ending always jolts me out of myself and makes me feel hopeful at the cynicism of the world around me. Because of Yossarian, I try to jump when life requires me to do so."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Do a little thinking! First of all, their is an order to the book. My English teacher (to whom all credit is due) told us that the book follows a spiral-like chronology. If you look closely, Heller will come closer and closer to a certain incident in the book. The book has an almost non-existent plot. THAT'S THE POINT! Heller is making a statement about the total insanity of war here! I encourage people who don't like this book to read deeper, and really contemplate what the characters represent."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Being a sophomore in high school, I didn't know what kind of treat I was in for when I picked up Catch-22. I was hooked after the first page. The witty paradox of Yossarian's situation and the realization that he represents all of us, really influenced me. John Yossarian's character really pulls the reader into the plot. I couldn't help but sympathize with him, yet there is something in his personality that offends the reader as well. He is crude at times, but it is so close to the way things were during that time, that you forgive him, and learn to love this character. I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and will read it again and again... I highly recomend it to anyone who likes a challenge... you will be pleasantly rewarded."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is THE most funniest book I have ever read. I read it and could not stop laughing. It's so brilliantly written, with excellent style and jokes that are universal. Of oucrse, it's not easy to catch onto Heller's style, but once you do......absolutley amazing. I can read it again and again and still marvel at such astounding genius. Above all, it is FUNNY with a capital F. Satrical kind of humour. I love this book, it is my definite best."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As far as novels go, you won't find a better one than Catch-22. It amazes me that this book could have even been WRITTEN, it's so damn brilliant. Interweaving characters, timelines, and ideas, Heller makes everything perfectly clear to the reader, and then goes in and flushes it more for good measure. It's like he's trying to juggle as much as he can, and when he gets that far, he throws in several flaming chainsaws too. Everything is put up to the light for scrutinization, and finally, much like the Vonnegut statement, everything is revealed to be quite preposterous and ultimately, insane. If you didn't like this book, then read it again and again until you do, dicknose."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Reading Catch-22 was not only enjoyable but it taught me a lot too. I am now able to look at many things in a different light. I would recomend it to amyone"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I don't know what goes on in Joseph Heller's head, but it's cool. And funny as anything. I don't remember HOW many times I laughed out loud during the course of the novel...it was hilarious...the way Heller walks himself into contradictions and paradoxes is highly amusing. There are a great many characters, hard to keep track of, but most have a quirk which helps identify them. And the amazing thing is, he keeps everything straight. Little funny things he mentions seemingly offhand continue to pop up later on in the novel. Yes, get out those horse chestnuts and crab apples. The book is very funny.Then, towards the end, the book develops a heart. Bad things happen, and you feel bad. War is bad, and bad things happen. Yet, Heller still manages to inject humor into these events, including one of the funniest sequences, that of the chaplain and the generals...the people in charge are the craziest of them all. You will laugh out loud. You will sometimes feel bad for laughing (hence, black comedy). But you will be happy you read this book.It is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Yossarian, the hero of CATCH-22, never wanted to be anyone's hero, but it's easy to see how he became such a popular figure in American literature and culture in the 1960s and 1970s. He may be the best literary example of the tortures a sane person goes through in a world of crazy and dishonest men. A WWII bombardier who's tired of people trying to kill him, Yossarian can't get over seeing a kid in his plane die in his arms, in fact he can't get over death at all, or the people who seem perfectly relaxed about flying into its jaws on a regular basis. No one has the right to say he hasn't done his duty, but they say it anyway, and every time he flies the required number of missions to be sent home, Yossarian's insecure, self-aggrandizing colonel raises the number of missions. As a result, most of Yossarian's friends end up killed in action and somehow Yossarian ends up not insane despite the best efforts of all his superior officers and doctors to convince him otherwise.You almost have to take an amphetamine to SLOW the effect of Heller's rapid-fire prose. Yossarian is the only roundly developed character in the book; everyone else is a just developed enough so as not to seem a caricature, but most are distorted extremes (e.g. Milo Minderbender who runs such a highly profitable international black market that he gets praised for bombing his own troops, or the never available \\"Major Major Major Major.\\") Heller uses these distortions for their humorous, satirical effect, and they work, but never do they obscure the true horror of the experience of the men fighting the war.How I wish I had read CATCH-22 in high school. So many of the daring, anti-establishment, questioning of \\"excessive authority or obsolete traditions\\" would have stirred me up and made me laugh so much more than they do now, at thirty. And the sexy parts would have really got me going more as a teenager. CATCH-22 remains and important anti-war text, and an important lesson for all to beware of those who push empty-headed patriotism and religio-pietistic mind control. Heller pleads us to think as he shows us the evil that men do when justice is a commodity. Intelligent teenagers of all ages should read this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"&quot;You mean there's a catch?&quot; Yossarian asked. &quot;Sure there's a catch,&quot; Doc Daneeka replied. &quot;Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy.&quot;I thought that Catch 22 was an excellent and hilarious book. But, I don't think it is for everybody. Some people might not get the type of humor Joseph Heller uses throughout the book. And to others, the lack of a plot might make reading the entire book very demanding. But for me the constant humor and exceptionally well created characters made the book well worth the read. Catch 22 is a satire that reflects on the absurdity of war. It is about a bomber squadron in Italy during the end of WWII. The book's main character, Yossarian, is frantic and furious because people he hasn't even met keep trying to kill him. The best part of the book would defiantly have to be the characters. Joseph Heller did an excellent job creating so many unique and interesting people. That was definitely what kept me reading. There were so many great characters I'm sure everyone could find someone in the book to relate to. So if you don't mind a book that can be a bit slow at times and is absolutely hilarious Catch 22 is a great choice."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Without this book there would have been no \\"MASH\\" the television series, no \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or the general refusal to view war as some great historic accomplishment of mankind. Heller's masterpiece transports us to the absurdity of war, a human construct that devours the individual in the face of bureaucratic systems designed to enable the destruction of the individual through depersonalization. The inherent chaotic state of war is captured through the plot structure embedded by the author, a technique that many readers will find difficult or impossible to deal with but unlike the characters the reader can choose to escape from.An important subplot of the novel often not dwelt upon is the nature of capitalism, international trade, and spot markets. Milo's Syndicate provides the basis for analyzing the sociopathic behaviors that can arise from the pursuit of the profit motive without reflection on the condition of Man, a subject first considered by Adam Smith in \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and his \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments\\".Acclaimed as a great American novel, the book deserves this recognition on many levels. First, it is an American novel through and through both in its perspective and its style of the individual over the group, the quest for independence and freedom, and the disrespect for rank and privilege. It is also a beautifully written book both in its prose and its psychological connections. It is also a story of common men thrown into alien conditions that they were not raised or trained for but who find an inner strength to carry on and who find humor in the face of damnation.You will want to run away from this book but it is important that you persevere to the end just like the characters who survive..."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I served in the US Army, and what struck me about Catch 22 was that although this was an obvious satire, it was still so true. Even the craziest parts of the book were no more crazy than the day to day life of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.My dad has since passed, but we spent hours discussing this book, and he actually served in the Army Air Corps during the war. But it doesn't matter. Anyone who served in the military, and I think anyone who has worked in a large company can understand and appreciate Heller's work.This book is part of our national psyche now, and it has to be in the top 10 American books of all time."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"We've all experienced the catch-22 of being at the dentist's office, with the dentist all up in your mouth, while you're asked that question that you're expected to answer. How can you talk while the dentist has his hands in your mouth? Classic catch-22!I started reading \\"Catch-22' by Joseph Heller, and was incredibly surprised (and delighted at the coincidence) of a catch-22 that I experienced just yesterday.I have been a teacher for 5 years and my husband's job has us moving in the near future, so my job is going to change. We'll be in transit somewhat and I figured a good option for me would be to substitute teach. Denver, Colorado requires a background check with paper fingerprints (like getting the prints done on paper with ink), not digital like my county in Florida currently requires. The Colorado Department of Education says to just show up or call ahead to a law enforcement office to get the prints done and the law enforcement office will take care of everything. Unforunately, the Colorado Department of Education doesn't provide the paper fingerprinting form and neither do the law enforcement agencies! How am I supposed to get fingerprinted, which is a requirement, but no one will let me have a card for the prints? After many more phone calls, I found a way to order the cards, but still, that's a great catch-22, and such a welcome coincidence since I was currently reading the book!\\"Catch-22' by Joseph Heller was definitely a unique story. I've never read a book quite like it! Yossarian is a bombardier in the military in Italy who does anything he can to get out of flying his missions and to be sent home. Unfortunately, every time he completes the required amount of missions, or gets close to it, the mission requirement is upped. Also preventing him (and the other men) from leaving is the fateful Catch-22, which says that \\"a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.\\" So you're crazy for flying the missions and should be sent home, but just asking to be relieved means you're sane enough to keep flying!\\"Catch-22' is filled with catch 22's and quirky scenarios. One scenario has a doctor who is terrified of flying and has bombardiers lie to say he is with them in the plane (since he is required to fly a certain amount of hours). On one of these instances, the plane crashes and those aboard die. Since the doctor did not bail out (even though he is standing there with other soldiers watching the plane crash), the doctor must be dead. His wife is informed, he stops being paid and fed, etc.\\"Catch-22' is a witty, quirky story where it seems that every situation has its idiocracy and a catch 22. I would recommend it mainly because it's so different from anything I've read and it was humorous. I wouldn't laugh out loud, but you have to give the book some credit for making me SMILE when someone dies, based on the irony of the death."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"There are probably thousands of reviews regarding this book, and I will not endeavor to review such a literary giant. So I will simply give my honest opinion regarding the story.I have laughed, cried and been furious simultaneously on a few occasions while reading this book, and I do believe it is one of those books that everybody should read at least once. If you are an avid reader you will not be disappointed here. If you are more of a casual story seeker, you will probably find some sections of this book difficult and cumbersome, but I would still recommend giving it a go as the exquisite humor mixed in with some truly head scratching moments make up for it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"NOTE: The first version I read was published in the 1960's and my current copy is from 1976.About the book:This is a satire about war, about bureaucracy, about the disinterested, uniformed, unintelligent men (and women) who end up in charge, and about the people caught in the horror of all of it. The story loosely follows airman Yossarian as he navigates the terrors of war and the horror of those who control his life. There is a large cast of memorable characters who often unwittingly, but at times on purpose, influence the life of Yossarian as he tries to save himself from being killed in the war.The book is not told in a linear time fashion, so a reader can get lost as the stories move forward and back over various events. The chapters tend to be character sketches, which take us through events only to have them repeated in another sketch through different eyes.My take:I didn't immediately fall into the book. It took me time to realize how time flow was presented. Remember, I was only 15 or 16 when I read the book. I had not come across a nonlinear book before. Once I understood the presentation, I was hooked.I had enough experience in life to understand what Heller was trying to get across, though I hadn't any experience with satire. Those days were the middle days of the Viet Nam war, giving me additional insight to the book.Much of the humor is subtle while most of it is over the top, in your face. For instance part of a sentence in the book reads \\"Chief White Halfoat was transferred out of Colorado at the first rumor of oil...\\" which is buried in an explanation of how Halfoat came to be with the squadron. While another part of the book contains conversations that sound like the Abbot and Costello routine of \`Who's on First'.Memorable scenes for me included Orr tinkering with the stove \`faucet', Milo and his chocolate covered cotton, the dead man that wasn't dead, and the most haunting was when Yossarian treated Snowden for the wrong wound. In fact, Snowden remained with me for decades in much the same way he stayed with Yossarian throughout the book.I highly recommend this book for anyone who understands satire and has had experience dealing with bureaucracy. I will say this is not a simple or easy read but the gems are fascinating. For many of us, this book is laugh out loud funny."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I, like many others, have used the term \\"catch-22\\" knowing it's core meaning but never knowing it's origin.

However, the more I read the more I understood that these players were caricatures of the real-life insanities that many of us have experienced.By the time I finished the book I felt a sense of loss that it had ended!Wes Hill"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"No long review, just an opinion about a memorable tour de farce. Once I began reading I couldn't put it down. I'm not a fast reader but I finished this book in about ten hours. I was completely engrossed. It's an adventure that explores the foibles and nonsensical rationales of men in harm's way that are assigned to do the business of war and are looking for a way out or a reasoning for their participation in convoluted circumstances. It is eccentric hyperbole. Now, I lent the book to a friend of high intellect and steadfast scholastic pursuit who thought it ok but nothing to tell his children about. When we discussed the book, it became obvious to me that one of the differences in our enthusiasms was his lack of military experience. While I had seemingly experienced all the characters in stressful venues, he had not. Still, my affection for the book, well, I wear it my sleeve."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"My daughter says...The story of Catch-22 opens with the introduction of Captain Yossarian. Captain Yossarian, quirky and extremely paranoid, is the protagonist of the tale. Throughout the story, he is paranoid that everyone around him is trying to kill him. Yossarian's only wish is to fly the required number of missions, seeing as he is an American bombardier during World War II, and return home. However, due to the prideful actions of his Colonel, Yossarian has difficulty fulfilling his goal. Colonel Cathcart continually raises the number of missions his bombardiers have to fly in order to increase his own glory. Catch-22 is an accounting of the actions Yossarian takes to try and escape death, as well as the story of all the interesting, slightly odd, people he meets.When the number of required missions is first raised, Yossarian travels to the Army doctor to try and get the doctor to certify him as insane. However, Doc Daneeka refuses to allow Yossarian to get out of his missions due to the now-infamous Catch-22. According to the army's regulation Catch-22, any soldier who tries to get out of fighting by pleading insanity is showing personal concern. By showing this concern, the person proves himself sane, because insane people don't care about their lives. Men who are truly insane have no trouble flying more missions. However, since the only way to be \\"grounded\\" is to request that you are, and the act of asking implies sanity, no person can get out of flying their missions. Yossarian, therefore, has no choice but to continue to fly the ever-increasing number of required missions.Yossarian, foiled in his attempt to plead insanity, attempts a number of other measures. First, he pretends to have some sort of liver problem and is checked into the hospital. In order to avoid being bored, Yossarian forges the name \\"Washington Irving\\" on a number of the soldiers letters home he is asked to censor instead of writing his official signature. This action leads to a huge problem later on in the book as all the officers try to discover who Washington Irving really is. That problem is only compounded as various other soldiers began copying Yossarian. When he is finally thrown out of the hospital, Yossarian moves a line on a map of Italy to avoid flying a dangerous mission.Through the next section of the book, Yossarian has to deal with the deaths of several of his closest \\"friends.\\" Snowden, the young Nately, and Hungry Joe are all bombardiers like Yossarian who ultimately get caught by one accident or another and die. With these deaths, Yossarian simply refuses to fly any more missions. This has a profound influence on the other soldiers stationed with Yossarian, and they silently begin to support him. Because of this, Colonel Cathcart offers to make a deal with Yossarian. If Yossarian will return back to the states and tell everyone how wonderful his superior officers are, they will let him go home. At first he considers the offer, but then realizing that it would be selling-out his fellow soldiers, Yossarian refuses.Instead, when the chaplain brings Yossarian to the living quarters of Orr, Yossarian realizes that Orr is not lost at sea like everyone believes. Instead, Orr carefully planed his escape by practicing crash landings on every flight he made. This time, instead of returning to the base, Orr had made his was to Sweden. Yossarian decides that he will run away to Sweden and join Orr there so he does not have to continue to risk his life fighting in the war.Review:Unlike most books about World War II, Catch-22 does not attempt to describe specific battles and provide insight in the course of a war. Rather, it deals with the human interactions that are a part of war. Catch-22 is more than just a war novel, it is a novel about why people act the way they do when put into certain situations. I really enjoyed reading Catch-22.One of the most dominant themes in Catch-22 is that of insanity. In almost every chapter of the book there are examples of people using insane argumentation to make logical points. Catch-22 takes a look at the way people form so-called reasonable assumptions and proves how everyone, it seems, is crazy in their own way.In the very beginning of the book, Yossarian travels to the hospital and meets the army Clergyman. Once he decides that the man is not insane, Yossarian warns him that insanity is contagious, and, indeed, by the end of the book it seems that Yossarian is correct. By the second chapter, Yossarian has determined that war itself is madness. Men fight and die for a crazy notion of patriotism and that doesn't seem to bother anyone. Yossarian's friends think he is crazy because he recognizes the insanity around him, however Yossarian realizes that it is this awareness that will ultimately save his life. Because Yossarian knows he is in constant danger because of those surrounding him, he is prepared to defend himself against anything at any moment.The presence of the Catch-22 itself is a prime example of insanity in the book. It employs insanity to come to an insane conclusion, yet on the surface appears to be a logical chain of reasoning. Even doctors in the book are figures of madness. Yossarian is evaluated by a psychiatrist who determines that he is insane, however, because Yossarian went to the doctor under a different name, the doctor sends a different soldier home even though he knows that person is not the one he diagnosed as crazy.Another example of irrational circular logic occurs when Yossarian proposes to Luciana. Luciana refuses to marry Yossarian because she believes he is insane. She thinks he's insane because he wants to marry her. Luciana tells Yossarian he is crazy, yet she justifies this belief with irrational thinking, proving herself delusional.Perhaps the best irony of the book however, is that Orr, supposedly the craziest of all the men, ends up being the sanest. In the beginning, Orr tells irrational stories and walks around with strange objects in his mouth. He does this so if anyone ever asks him why he has a certain object in his mouth, he can say that he doesn't have that thing in his mouth and pull out something else. He is, of course, utterly sensible in this belief. Orr is also, however, believed to be the luckiest man in the unit, because he is always crashing his plane and making it out alive. In the last chapter of the book, Orr crashes his plane in the ocean and disappears. Yossarian is at first shocked by this news, then stunned, as he realizes that Orr was not actually crazy. Rather, Orr feigned insanity in order to disguise his escape plans. The last time he crashes, Orr went to Sweden instead of simply dying like everyone thought. In the end, Orr used his insanity as his cover, and as his ticket to freedom.Typically, I am not a fan of any book dealing with historical wars. Catch-22 however, caught my interest quickly and held it throughout the book. I would recommend this book to everyone, no matter what kind of genre they usually enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"When this book came out in the 1960's the world was obviously a different place to todays world.WWII was recent history and the old guard establishment in the UK and US were in control of the media .The reviews were mixed because the reviewers did not understand or comprehend the subtleties and genius of this book. They missed the point.I remember reading it at the age of 13. We were brought up to be voracious readers in our house and this in truth got under the wire as my parents did not really understand what it was. They were about as pro-establishment as you could get. They blamed the downfall of the British Empire on The Beatles.Suffice to say I have probably read this a dozen times in my life at the age of 50.I used to stay up late in bed laughing till I cried re-reading individual chapters.

Heller managed to create a variaty of characters and then milk them for all they've got. For those of you who expect an anti-war book, go read something else. If, however, you enjoy quality literature and can stand the unexpected, Catch-22 is addicting.Note: This book is very confusing, and to those who can't make sense of it, it will be really bad.

A witty man, he constantly tries not to avoid being killed while serving his duty in WW II. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early in the book and uses the book's title phrase Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that soldiers will be sent home who are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doctor tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then must have someone vouch for his insanity. Yossarian then assumes that he will be dismissed after this, but the Doc adds one more stipulation: if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy, they can't be crazy because anyone who doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase \\"catch-22\\" now appears in the dictionary because of this book. If that fact does not suggest the importance of this book, I don't know what will.This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows a lighter side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle during wartime but Catch-22 uses humor to show how the conflicts between one man and the solders fighting along side him affect him in war. This book will be able to make you laugh about some very serious issues that effected people during WW II.One reason that I recommend this book so highly is that it has been banned. The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it. This book was banned because it refers to women as whores. The text does not dwell on that, though. Readers who feel offended by this term cans easily substitute another term. If you want to read a great book that will make you laugh, you definitely should read Catch-22."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I first read Catch-22 a few years ago, initially put off by the style of this book. For example, there is no true concept of Time, as you jump between the past and present continuously. Similarily there is very little unity between the chapters (when you first read it), as Heller jumps between Major Major Major's life story in between stories of Milo Minderbinder. If you are just a conventional reader who is looking for a fantastic or winding plot, this book is DEFINATELY not for you.However, what make Catch-22 so great is the flexibility of the novel: I can pick it up and read any chapter I want to at any time and STILL be entertained by the events. Each chapter is more or less self-sustaining (save the first and the last chapters), creating an entirely different reading experience. With light (and occassionally dark) humor, the novel remains in high spirits and occassionally brings you abruptly back to earth into the grim reality of war.I seriously believe if you DO NOT own this novel, you obviously have not been reading the proper literature all your life. So go buy it now, I can almost guarantee you will not be let down."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As I started to read this novel I was immediately overwhelmed with the persistence of new characters. But as I started to learn the little niches and such that I could attach to each of the characters it made it much easier to follow, and thus allowed you, by the end of the book, to really piece together the whole meaning of the book and sit back and really take in what Heller tried to give to his reader when he wrote it. And that is a feeling of utter dismay for all that has been thought to be of benefit to a military force; the unquestioned following of leadership, cold and detached attitude towards a human, and a bigger than thou regard for the rules that everyday citizens are expected to play by and keep in mind when they interact and function together."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It seems to me that almost all of the people that DON'T like this book and don't understand the humor are the exact same people that sit around watching sitcoms that base humor on bodily functions.

Something about the book just lets anyone identify with it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Without a doubt, the greatest book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Heller was, in my mind, a true genius. He not only changed my way of thinking in many respects, but inspired me to write in the hopes that I, too, might make someone think. I would like to point out that the absurdity and lack of logical progression that so many seem to find &quot;pointless&quot; were, in fact, the genius of the novel--they were meant to reflect the craziness of war. Sadly, it seems too many could still profit from reading this classic."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Joseph Heller has written a book of such broad scope, such immense power and such depth, that the reader is absolutely entranced to every page.It takes place on a fictional island during World War II, revolving around a group of bizarre, truly individual characters that are slowly going mad. Catch-22 basically means a 'lose-lose situation'. Each of these men get caught up in the insanity, the beaurocracy and hypocracy of the war that they are trapped on the island, prisoners of the military rather than the war. Despite whatever they try, the just can't get out: Catch-22. The author articulates the isolation of the island into an excellent backdrop for a brilliant character study.There's Yossarian, the main character, who is gradually descending into madness. There's Milo Minderbinder, the cold-hearted entrepreneur who is using the war to generate revenue and who bombed his own base so the Germans would pay him. Also, there's Colonel Cathcart who is so focused on getting a promotion that he volunteers his bombardiers for the most dangerous of missions, just to impress the general. There's Chaplain R.O. Shipman, who is losing his mind and his faith, and there's Hungry Joe, whose terrifying nightmares make him scream and swear in his sleep, causing the entire squadron to lose sleep. These are just some of the many characters in the book who are revealed through tantalising vignettes.The writing in the book is truly masterful; the author commands a strong grip of English vocabulary. The plot moves along in illogical, chronologically incorrect sequences, making for a very unique reading experience. There is little violence or language: the author generates tension from the psychological aspect of the story.This is an exemplary book, which should be studied in English Literature classes, rather than books such as 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstien', or 'The Great Gatsby'. It is tense, hilarious, black, cynical, satirical and formless. An absolutely brilliant character study."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Imagine M*A*S*H meets Monty Python meets Alice In Wonderland... this is as close to the mood of the story as I can get. I was amazed at the scathing wit Heller threw out from page to page, practically landing me face down on the floor in laughter more than once. What was even more wonderful was that such a humorous book carried such a powerful and harsh critique of war and our convaluted 20th century society.

Broaden your horizons, people, this is almost the twenty-first century) draws you in with fabulous humor and then hits you with such unexpected images of horror that you are left reeling.

Also, I was intrigued how a book's title could gain such significance with its concept becoming such a common term.The story is a tangled web of nonlinear narrative, unrelentingly logic looping, mental instability, military ineptitude, and satire. It took some time to completely embrace, but about half way through I found myself really gaining emotional attachment to the character ensemble and finally an admirer of the work as a whole. Now I can understand why this subversive work has lasted 40 years as a great American novel."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Like the imfamous catch itself, Stephen Heller's masterpiece is \\"beautiful in the intricate simplicty of it moving parts.\\" What is most fascinating about the story is the way in which the complex writing style reflects the round-about logic of Catch-22 and both combine to bring forth Heller's bitter attack on bureacracy and the absurdity of it all.The novel itself will make your head spin. It does not neccesarily occur in chronoligcal order, but rather events are revealed to you when Heller deems it fit to present their importance. Reading the first chapters will leave you with more questions than any true understanding of the plot, and going back an re-reading won't help you. Rather, by pressing on with a mingled feeling of hatred and love for the confusion, the reader will, through Heller's round-about writing style, learn the answers to his or her many questions. This level of complexity, while muddling the plot, add depth to the books over-all message in a way that few novels ever achieve.I highly reccomend this book to the thoughtful, patient and curious reader, but with the warning that it is not for the faint of heart."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Its about how one sees humour in destruction, endless moronity and loss of lives. Amazingly dealt with Heller talks about Catch 22 situation in all endless loops. All characters have an element of humour and suddenly you find that they are all in danger of loss of life.Major Major meets people only when he is not in his office, he asks people to wait when he is in office and to let them in when he is out. Lots of confusion and lots of fun especially with ladies. Use of language and the manner in which humour is introduced in serious situations is commendable.It shows that World War II was fought in confusion and the meaningless fight was made more meaningless by the leaders who themselves didn't know why they were fighting. In the process many lives were lost.I remember Orr's putting apples in cheeks as another humorous incident. Why the whore was hitting him when he was laughing was funny too. Heller has introduced characters and made them alive. Nobody can make one laugh in the face of death as best as Heller.It ends like a movie when the Hero Yossarian has run away to Rome to save his life and every thing is left to your imagination."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I do not know how I avoided Catch-22 during high school and college, but I'm glad I waited no longer. Catch-22 is the classic war satire and while some aspects of it are a little dated, it still rings very true in the contemporary political climate. Heller's characters are all quirky, intense and unique, but their conversations and actions really penetrate the absurdity of war and are very entertaining. I personally think the larger goals of World War II were noble and worthy, but when the impact of the war on those people who were actually fighting it are examined through Heller's off-kilter viewpoint, it becomes clear that there are tremendous costs and failings when trying to achieve those goals. This is a wonderfully amusing book and for people who are interested in more than a laugh, it also has an important message. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read it before."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"My name is Kayleigh Gunnoud, and I am a senior at Mercy High School, CT. Catch 22, by Joseph Heller is a novel which makes a strong statement about the effects of war. While there are many novels which address this topic, this novel is unique in that it comedy and sarcasm. These methods help show the overall madness and lunacy of war, and truly make the reader rethink their opinions on war.The main character in the novel is Captain Yossarian. Yossarian's view on the war change after seeing the death of his friends and after Colonel Catchart's continuous raising of the number of missions the men need to fly. Yossarian finds himself unable to leave because of a mysterious law, Catch 22. Yossarian becomes an extremely defiant of the military authority.This novel reveals another side of war. While people are very quick to think about the glory of war, Catch 22 introduces you to the many soldiers in the war and gradually shows you their demise and death. After developing a relationship with these quirky characters throughout the novel, one fails to see any glory provided to them after their death.I would recommend Catch 22 to anyone. The comedy in certain passages is literary genius. It is a very dynamic novel, with many unique characters and scenes one will never forget."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is a story set during World War II. A significant choice for what is, ostensibly, an anti-war satire, since that particular war was a universally popular one butressed by high moral motivations. But that is the point, for Catch 22 is not simply a lampoon of war, but a searing indictment of man's spiritual crisis in the modern world.On all fronts, the main character, Yossarian, is assailed by the dehumanized absurdities of mondern life, manifested most concretely in that perfected science of death, modern warfare. Yossarian, like all of us, is chained by rationality that has been stripped of reason, engineered thus for the purpose of control. That is the essence of Catch 22.The character of Milo Minderbinder represents the cold, opportunistic thinking of the corporate world, dead as it is to humanistic concerns in its tireless pursuit of profit and power. Chaplain Tappman embodies the impotence and self-doubt common to many people of faith who feel adrift in a culture of materialisticly driven insanity. But it is Yossarian's wanderings through Rome, the Eternal City, and as such, the representation of modern &quot;civilized&quot; society, that is the coup de grace. It is a moonlit, poetic scene lamenting the spiritual and humanistic decay and ultimate bankruptcy of modern Western society. Simply powerful stuff.Properly speaking, Catch 22 is more a series of vignettes or short stories rather than a novel. But it is told with a humor that bristles with moral outrage. While not perfect, it is an excellent read, and definitely recommened."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This was the most humorous book I've read recently! Very entertaining from beginning to end! It is about a World War II bombardier, Captain Yossarian, who desparately wants to be sent home but he is caught in the military's Catch-22. Catch-22 states that one can only be excused from flying missions on the grounds of insanity; one must request to be excused; one who requests to be excused is presumably in fear of his life, thus proof of his sanity so therefore he must continue to fly; one who is insane would not make the request and would continue to fly the missions despite the fact that he would be excused from them if he were to ask. The typical no-win situation. There are many characters presented in this book, adding to the confusion and enhancing the hilarity. The plot...well, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot but once the reader becomes caught up in the circular logic of the military, the plot doesn't seem important anyway. There are grisly moments of realism interspersed with the absurb humor. The time-line of the story is not chronological, but somehow it all makes sense. Throughout the book, I found myself cheering for Yossarian and his efforts, hoping that in all the confusion he would come out a winner in the end. If you enjoyed the T.V. series M*A*S*H, then you're sure to love this book as the writers of the sitcom were inspired by Joseph Heller's amazingly bizarre tale."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The phrase \\"Catch-22\\" didn't exist until this book coined it in 1961. The author, Joseph Heller inadvertently added it to the English language when he used it to describe an American regulation governing pilot's required number of combat missions.The rule was this: Pilots could only be grounded if they were insane; however they had to request this. But - asking to be grounded proved you sane and so there was no escape, and this was known as Catch-22.This simple problem becomes a metaphor for all that goes on in this novel and correspondingly, in virtually any warfare. The book is bitingly funny, filled with tragic incidents and is chaotic, much like war.The plot revolves around the lives of a group of American bomber pilots in World War II. The central character is Yossarian, who we first met in hospital. The book details events form his life in a seemingly random order, in some ways similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" where an American soldier becomes \\"unstuck in time.\\" In Heller's case, this isn't as blatant and you see the order is in fact carefully constructed to build towards a climax.Yossarian is surrounded by a cast of bizarre characters, including Colonel Scheisskopf, obsessed with winning military parades at the expense of just about everything else. Then there is the newly promoted Major Major, who once promoted, becomes Major Major Major and then spends most of the war trying to hide from his men.Each of the unique and colorful characters adds a bit to the pastiche of moods and attitudes deftly displayed here. Absurdities run through the book such as when Doc Daneeka was supposedly killed when the plane he was in crashed...he wasn't killed since he always avoided flying, but in the US Air Force, once it's in the paperwork, it's a done deal...so there's no going back - to everyone else, including his misinformed wife, he remains dead - no discussion.It's a simple idea to posit that war is absurd but it takes a clever writer to illustrate through the actions and inactions of his characters. Catch-22 is the kind of novel that welcomes a second and third read and is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Despite the fact that most of the characters seem to be caracatures and that this book is a very satirical look at military logic, this book threw me for a loop. The main character, Yosarean, is compelled after months of being put into the line of fire to stop. He no longer wants to follow the orders of his superiors who have no-one's interst but their own at heart. (This is best articulated by Colonel Cathcart, who longs to be featured in the Saturday Evening Post.) Yosarean's solution is to not go into harm's way any longer. Most of the novel is rapturously funny with characters who never answer a question with a satisfactory response. But toward the end the tone becomes dark and quite disturbing as Yosarean becomes more and more haunted by the memories of his fallen comrades, which amounts to nearly all of them. All-in-all this is most certainly a work that I would recommend to anyone looking for a laugh. But be prepared for an intensely dismaying end."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As a high school junior, one might think Catch-22 would be a challenge. This is true, for the writing is very different, and it is at times very hard to follow the story. But, if you can find it within your heart to forgive Catch-22 that minor misgiving, then you certainly would feel the same way about it that I do that Catch-22 is a very good book.There are several characters in the book, but the one that Catch-22 is rooted to is Yossarian, who throughout the whole book is always wondering why people he has never met are trying to kill him. His wondering why leads him to try to leave the army in any way possible, but he is always confronted with \\"catch-22\\", which in his case means he can leave the army if he is crazy, and he must be crazy to fly the dangerous bombing runs, but, and here's the catch, \\"anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy...that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\". Catch-22 is used in different situation throughout the book, each with its own underling meaning.A major point the book conveys is the line between sanity and insanity. As seen by the \\"catch-22\\" for Yossarian, it seems to us he is really crazy, for who would walk around all day for months naked. Yet, after getting into the book, the reader comes to realize Yossarian is the only sane person in the whole outfit. This new idea of those who are crazy are sane, and visa versa, leads in to the theme of the later half of the book, the stupidity of army politics. During the story, there are countless times when idiotic things occur because the ones in charge fell it necessary. For instance, in a mission that a member of Yossarian's crew is killed, Yossarian gets a metal.With what I have said, you can see how the book is confusing at times. But don't let that scare you away. Catch-22 is one of the best books of the 20th century, and it is also a very funny book. I recommend it to any who are willing to try something new, for Catch-22 is a challenge, and what could be better for to read than a challenging book full, of humor, about a war...kind of reminds me of \\"M.A.S.H.\\", but not as serious."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Bombardier Yossarian can be grounded because he's crazy, but if he asks to be grounded he will be declared sane and fit to fly; Major Major will permit any man to visit him in his office...as long as he isn't there; and Colonel Korn's education sessions only permit the men to ask questions who never do. These are just a few examples of the roundabout logic, self-defeating reasoning, and frustrating paradoxes that infest the text of Catch-22. Set in final months of World War II, Joseph Heller's novel depicts a world where the human language has become obsolete. Hardly a single exchange takes place that doesn't contain some form of self-contradiction or circular reasoning. Heller's stories of the horrors of war are a satire that is at one-moment whimsical and acidic the next.Featuring an abundant cast of memorable characters, Catch-22 is a war novel that is much more. It is an allegory, a collection of running themes and recurring storylines. Told in a nonlinear storytelling style, Heller's novel captivates and demands attention, making reference to events in casual passing, only to return to them in increased detail. During an education session in Chapter 4, Yossarian, the book's protagonist, makes passing reference to Snowden, a man killed during a mission in which he was in charge. This incident is returned to with increasing detail as the story progresses, and it is in the book's blood-drenched climax that the full horrors of the event are recounted.One recurring theme in Heller's novel is faith. The character Chaplain Tappman is the ideal vehicle for Heller's musings; he constantly preaches the word of God, questioning The Almighty's existence all the while. On the subject of the bible, Tappman recalls one soldier asking, \\"Did it indeed seem probable...that the answers to the riddles of creation would be supplied by people too ignorant to understand the mechanics of rainfall?\\" Yossarian also offers his two cents on the matter in Chapter 18, referring to a certain Supreme Being as \\"'a colossal, immortal blunderer,'\\" saying, \\"'When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. It's obvious he never met a payroll. Why, no self-respecting businessman would hire a bungler like Him as even a shipping clerk!'\\" Its insights like these that make Catch-22 the joy it is.This questioning of faith and religion is justified, particularly in the environment of war, where ruthlessness and corruption are the status quo. Heller creates a world where a redeeming character is a rare and unusual blessing. Many of the book's characters are so self-absorbed it's a wonder how they came to men of respected standing in the first place. Colonel Cathcart, one of the story's central antagonists, is a prime example. A brown-nosing, elitist, social climber, He cares more about getting his picture into the next edition of the Saturday Evening Post than the well-being of his own men. If it weren't for the characters' military titles, one would hardly know this was a book about war at all. Heller doesn't glorify war or hold it on a pedestal, and it is through this jaded perspective that his reader begins to understand what war is really about.By the end of Catch-22, I had been run through a full gamut of emotions. I laughed at the irrational interrogation of Chaplain Tappman in Chapter 36, and I felt a sickness in the pit of my sickness as Yossarian witnessed poverty, death, and desperation wandering through The Eternal City in Chapter 39. Catch-22 is a thought-provoking, entertaining piece of literature, and its declaration as a modern-day classic is well-deserved to say the least."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is satirical novel which pokes fun at many different parts of our society. It manly criticizes capitalism, the army, and the chain of commands that it consists of. Some readers may dislike this anti-military tone. I liked this novel because Heller's original and repetitive style of writing was funny as well as influential, but by no means is it easy to read. A less competent reader may not enjoy the book as much because the underlining humor may not be understood. The plot and character development is choppy making it difficult to understand the story line. In order to enjoy the novel you must enjoy the humor because the plot itself is not interesting enough to cary you through the book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In modern day, relatively few people read books which are written by contemporary authors, never mind authors from fifty years ago , but some books just stand out even to people who only have a minor knowledge of classic American literature. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 is one such novel. Set toward the end of World War II, the book follows a very vague plot line with a strange way of representing time but uses abundant, rich, and sometimes a little dark humor to weave an enthralling tale about the bombardier Yossarian and his struggle against reality, particularly the fact that he has to fly in a plane (with people whom he has never even met before shooting at him) just because he is told to.The book is well written and it draws you (the reader) in by really relating you to the myriad characters and their unique quirks. There is little historical accuracy in this book and some things are so wrong that its downright funny, for example Milo Minderbinder's mess hall syndicate (M&M;) which, run by a lowly mess officer, trades with countries and organizations all over the world (including Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia) turning a prophet using confusing tangles of twisted logic and the magic slogan \\"everyone has a share.\\" The humor is by far the book's most prominent strength but the writing is a close second. The astoundingly detailed and descriptive prose makes the funny parts all the more zany and the heavy, semi-depressing parts so vivid and powerful that they are extremely moving at times. This combined with Heller's sharp wit and snappy 50's slang make this book an immensely entertaining read and certainly an example of a great American novel of merit."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is my title: and I believe it. The greatest novel of all time.The reviews below will doubtlessly get further into the more complicated issues--the themes, the meaning of certain characters, the fractured chronology--but the fact remains that this will be, for a great number of people, the most profound work they ever read.Catch-22 is a riot from start to finish. There are plenty of hilarious books, but few that will make you laugh as often or as embarrassingly loud as this one. The book, however, is not just about comedy--that's just another level on top of the heartfelt sadness that consumes the book's greatest heroes (Yossarian and Dunbar). The true meaning lies somewhere between the moral decisions of every character of the book--Yossarian's decision to live through the war or die trying; Dunbar's decision to spare all innocents at all costs; Col. Cathcart's decision to win the war at all costs; Doc Daneeka's decision to complain about the war while doing nothing to counter the immoral acts taking place all around him.It's a book for rebels; fine. It's an anti-government book, anti-war book; fine. It's hysterical, depressing, life-affirming, epic, fascinating, and, at a basic, human level, true. Fine.The fact remains: Catch-22 has more to offer than any book I have ever read. Try the first chapter and you'll know it's for you; it's the fastest 463 pages you'll ever read; the world's greatest combination of comedy and tragedy in one work.I can only gush so long.

True, it can be said that it is an anti-war statement, but that is a shallow interpretation at best. It questions the establishment of course, but in a sense so do all novels. Its comedy is tremendous, but again, Catch-22 goes far deeper.Catch-22 is perhaps the greatest novel of our time because it explores humanity from a perspective and depth of insight never before seen. The significance of man in the modern world, the ironic yet inexplicably logical meanderings of man's mind, the wittiness, insecurity, hope, despair, failure, and, above all, the ultimate triumph that humanity possesses is utterly represented.This novel has never failed to make me laugh, cry, despair, and ultimately to appreciate life. Humanity is something to cherish, and Heller's Yossarian is the tangible embodiment of that ideal."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Can a writer create a classic work based on insanity?

A masterpiece of the absurd. The absurd of democracy. The democracy of the US armed forces. Any one has rights, but each right is blocked either because someone higher has the authority to block it, or because the implementation of this right shows that the subject does not qualify for this right. In such a situation there is only one solution : escapism. The situation is dramatic since we are in Italy during the second world war. Simple pilots and bombardiers have no say whatsoever on their fate or lot. Either it goes against the authority of someone higher up who makes them do what he wants to satisfy his own ambition. Or it goes against the general trafficking by the local entrepreneur in the armed forces who aims at making money on the war situation in the name of free enterprise, asking for the war to be privitized. Or it goes against circular rules that disqualify you as a beneficiary of these rules as soon as you ask for them to apply to you. Those questions are very serious. Where is the dignity of the warriors ? Where are the noble objectives of the war ? Where is the defense of the country in such a war ? Where are courage, loyalty, heroism when everything is mercantilized and speculated upon for the profit of a few ? And what does victory mean in such a situation where some are trafficking with the enemy in order to make money, even on the military operations themselves ? The world is absurd and one can only escape from it if one wants to retain one's sanity. But, as opposed to Kafka, this author uses humor and makes us laugh at such silly situations : it is a highly funny book, but in which any laugh or smile hides the sadness of the situations or facts with great difficulty. We would really like to get angry at such mediocre middlemen who dictate hell for other people in their own interest and can do that because these other people lack the courage to rebel, are like sheep following the flock without protesting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Well, I never had to read this for school but I read it becausemy sister majored in english and she lent me the book because Ive always liked books that hold a mirror to society (1984,Brave New World..etc...) This one is no different, the catch-22 runs all of our lives.....in just about every way when you think about it...I saw the movie of this book and I think it was true to the book completly....My favorite character is Yossarian...though Major Major is funny too.....I like this book because I am anti-war, there are more constructive ways to resolve conflicts without bloodshed....sports are a good way for example...but that would be too intelligent :) anyways....after you read this you will never want to join the military....period :) I wish one of my friends who joined the armed forces read this, perhaps he would have not joined....for all I know he could be dead now...anyways you should read it because you should be curious..not because I told you to read it :)"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a book that has a whole different spin on life than most others. It takes place during World War II and is primarily about John Yossarian, a bombardier in the war. Yossarian is an interesting character who looks at life very rationally, yet different from most people. He cares for his life like most people would. He doesn't care for authority unless they can hurt him. He is moral and immoral, smart and immature. With no central theme or story line it is hard to give an accurate plot summary. It does give an outlook on war and life that is not seen very often, with a humorous twist that will keep you laughing only if you are in the mood for it. The characters in this book are very stereotypical yet very unique at the same time. There are some you will love and many you will hate. One reoccurring theme in this novel is the title, Catch-22. There are so many catches and hypocritical events in this book that it is sometimes hard to keep everything straight. For example, Yossarian asked this girl to marry him. She said that she would not marry him because he was crazy, but she thought he was crazy because he wanted to marry her. This is just one of many catches in the book. The entire book seems to revolve around catches, which makes it hard to read at times. The best part of this book is how it gives a humorous outlook on a very serious subject, war. There were very few times I wasn't chuckling at this book. Everyone in this book seems to have lost his or her minds. One of my favorite parts is when some of the soldiers are driving back from a bar and one of the passengers in the back suggests that the driver turn off his headlights. This is obviously a stupid idea. As they are talking the officer in the front passenger seat demands to know why it is so dark and the driver responds, &quot;I turned them off. You know, Chief White Halfoat is right. It's much better with the headlights off.&quot; This is a great example of how no one in the book seems to be completely in reality and the cause of this seems to be the war. Over all I really liked this book. It was almost always funny. It took a while to get into it because it is very different from any book I've ever read. I loved the characters, Yossarian and Dunbar especially, although they were all very good. I would recommend this book who wants to read something new and different and get a good laugh."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch 22 is definitely THE BEST book I've read yet. Joseph Heller's characters are very believable, from Yossarian to Colonel Cathcart. The plot is clear, but has its twists and turns, leaving the reader expecting more and getting it. The amazing amount of paradoxes in the book leave you pondering, and the beauty of it is that they all fit in with the book. Truly a must-read book!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Having read this book for no other reason than I thought I should I must say I am frankly envious of those with the opportunity to study it. Anyone who reads Catch-22 will rave about it; no formal dissection is necessary to communicate the mutual wonder which shines clearly out of the ensuing rather incoherant duet of praise. Convincing the rest of the world is another matter, one I feel I should leave to those who have done more than just read the book. However I remain skeptical that anyone could ever do justice to this novel, no matter how effusive their praise.&quot;He knew everything about literature except how to enjoy it&quot;. Well Heller has created a book that won't let you avoid enjoyment. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Heller's novel did not dissapoint. I was not sure what to expect when I selected this book but I was thouroughly impressed. I am not a big fan of war books but this novel is much more than that. Heller's attention to detail and great dialogue made this book exciting to read. The conversations held by the characters not only make you laugh but also make you think about the points that they are discussing. Heller's use of vocabulary also inhances the quality of the book. He uses words that are specific to the war and time period. Although sometimes I was confused by the large vocabulary I kept reading because I knew that I would still understand what was going on. Heller describes the scene of war as a place that at some times people would hate to live while at other times a place of paradise. I think that his description of the characters is unlike any i have ever read. Heller describes the characters by writing about their actions and past expierneces. He uses their actions to write about the way they treated others and they way they thought about things. This method was very usefull because it didn't cause the book to stop and explain the character it just told the story and described the character at the same time. Many times in society we take for granted our views on others and ourselves. This book realates the tragedies and triumphs of war to the problems of human society. It opens the minds of those who cannot see the wrongs in society. I think the term &quot;catch 22&quot; which is used throughout the book in many different instances refers to life. In the book no matter what the pilots do they cannot get out of flying the missions, while in life no matter what a person does during there life all people will endure the same tragedy of death. This book is great for all people who love to ride rollercoasters. Heller takes you on an exhilirating ride through the emotions of the characters and tragic happenings of war. I would reccommend this book to anyone who loves to read books that open your mind and make you think."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"There are only a handful of books that go beyond literature, cross that fine line into the realms of real life and then challenge what we believe to be right. The Catcher in the Rye and perhaps One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest are perhaps two.For centuries brothers have murdered brothers in the pursuit of peace, and although we always 'try' to believe in the powers pulling the strings we never stand up and ask why?. Jospeh Heller used Yossarian to ask why, and he uses a wit to make the point so incredibly poignant.If passers by catch you reading Catch 22 many pass a knowing gaze and quite possibly feel a tingle down their spine. Whilst at an Airport in Texas a gentleman spotted the book and made a comment that was positively chilling: &quot;I read this book and laughed in college, and then read it a second time in Vietnam. The second time it was not as funny, the second time it was true.&quot;Before reading Catch 22 I read an interview with Joseph Heller, he was asked why he had never written another book as great as Catch 22, his reply was simple: &quot;Nobody Has&quot;. When you reach the end you have to agree."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this when I was eighteen and loved it ever since. I can't count how many times I have read it. I believe Heller once said that the book was not really about WWII but about 'the next war'. That is probably why it struck such a chord with the Vietnam generation for whom the war was happening daily on their TV sets. The surrealism of the novel seemed to be reproduced in the US Army officer saying about a devastated city 'We destroyed it in order to save it'. For there is a ferocious paradox in battle - why don't both sides just run away? This book does not try to resolve the paradoxes (leave that to Keegan, Grossman, Marshall and the military historians), it celebrates the 'grunts', the poor bloody infantry (or air pilots) who just endure the madness, hoping to escape the terrible combination of circumstances that may demand their deaths. Probably the soldiers who endured the trenches of WWI might understand Catch-22 better than those of WWII. Read and be amused, scarified and ultimately humbled."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is a masterpiece of a novel, one of the highlights of the last fifty years in literature. One of the saddest, funniest, most inventive books of all time. It's as creative and whimsical as Lewis Carrol, but set amidst the horrors of war. It's hard to find a book so original, so unprecedented, so clear in its convictions and message. A must read for everybody."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"With the recent death of Joseph Heller, I felt compelled to go back and reread his masterpiece, Catch 22. Thirty some years ago I read it as an undergraduate at San Francisco State in the midst of the Viet Nam War. Looking at it again in my fifties, Catch-22 seems a bit more over the edge, and yet the wit is still razor sharp. The absurdities of war still ring true. Heller reminds us that the insanity of war is not limited to pointless wars like Viet Nam. The craziness can even can be found in the so called Good War."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"One of the most hilarious books of all time. No other book has made me laugh out loud as often and authentically as maybe this except The Hitchhiker's Guide."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The reviews are interesting, because no two people see 'Catch-22' in the same way. There are those who don't get it, of course, as there always are with any ground-breaking book, particularly one as unconventional as this. However, even those who like it don't always like the same things. Many people fall into what I regard as a trap, trying to pigeonhole it. It's a war book, a comedy, a satire.... yes, it is, but it's also many other things. The genius of 'Catch-22' is that it defies categorisation.Almost any kind of human interaction you can think of, with the possible exception of sport which only gets a minor mention, 'Catch-22' takes on. Capitalism, communism, religion, sex, courage, loss, medicine, discrimination, authority, man's inhumanity to, well, just about anything really; they all get a good working over. The form of the book is bewildering, with multiple storylines weaved together in non-chronological sequence. It's best not to try and sort them out, but to let yourself be tossed and turned in the sea of images Heller creates. Gradually, as the book winds towards its conclusion, the incidents and people sort themselves out; the final section contains despair and hope in about equal measures.The more you read the book, the more you realize how much of it is relevant to everyday life. Some of you might remember reading Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' for the first time and noticing that it's full of what are now cliches. They weren't cliches when Shakespeare wrote the play, of course, they were brilliant examples of phraseology which passed into the language after Shakespeare coined them. So it is with 'Catch-22', which identifies truths that we all know but just couldn't put into words before Heller did it for us.'Catch-22' isn't a comfortable book. It will make you squirm, unless you are so blind to human frailty that you fail to identify with the travails of the characters. The fact that at the same time as you are feeling their pain you are laughing at them only makes it more disconcerting. Ultimately, though, it will perform the service of all great literature- it will make you think."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I read this book first in 1967. The fact that I still remember it well and am reminded of it often in everyday life situations speaks to its impact, at least on me.It is one of a very few books which can prompt the reader to laugh out loud while reading it. There are also passages which carry profound messages about the reality of war, life, and love. What more can one ask?We read many books and immediately forget them. That has not been the case for me with Catch 22, nor do I think it is with most readers. I would have no hesitation in numbering Catch 22 amongst the most inmportant 100 books I have read. I recommend it unreservedly."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is a must read. I read this book more than twenty years ago and I can still tell you the story verbatim.No library is complete without this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It's sobering to realise that it's 50 years since Joseph Heller's biting satire \`Catch 22' was first published. Through the 1960s and 70s, its famous title was slowly adopted into everyday idiomatic usage around the world and is now quoted by people who have never read the book and may not even know the origin of \`Catch 22' to mean any \`double-bind' situation designed to get you no matter which way you try to brook the system.Heller's novel is themed on the way an unfeeling bureaucracy conspires to marginalize the individual. It covers the same ground as much of Franz Kafka's work (notably \`The Trial') and has an Orwellian core, but \`Catch 22' is much funnier than almost any other work of this loose genre and is a joy to read.Earnest comedy combines with episodic chopped-up storytelling: on re-reading the book after several decades, it becomes obvious that Heller does in fact employ a tight and disciplined - though unorthodox - structure, where common themes are continually re-stated and reinforced with humor and for example the same scenes are described from the perspectives of different characters as the novel unfolds. Clever observation of the absurdity of bureaucratic thinking through a host of sharply-drawn and fleshed-out characters display human behavioural psychology in a way few other novels of the modern age manage to do. You put people in a situation like this, and this is what can happen: it all has its own peculiar logic where the insane can be comfortably in charge and the irrational appears normal. If you are prepared to exploit the system you can get away with almost anything, whereas if you follow the rules and demonstrate \`patriotism' and \`honor' - well, you're basically screwed.The characters who populate Yossarian's world are hard to forget: General Dreedle, the Chaplain, ex-P.F.C Wintergreen, Major Major Major, (who had a rank created just for him, to exploit his unique name); the incomparable Milo Minderbender and his grandiose money-making syndicate extending even to trading with the enemy and contracting to fly missions for them; the comparatively sane and rational Doc Daneeka, who explains Catch 22 to Yossarian; Nately, Cathcart and the rest.You could describe \`Catch 22' as a comic-tragedy, but above all it's instructive and entertaining. If you've never read this 20th century classic and real, solid books with paper pages are your thing, you now have the chance to get yourself a new edition of the long-out-of-print paperback- the \`50th Anniversary Edition'. Go on, treat yourself."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This book is absolutely priceless. Several things stand out. One, war is crazy. Two, people are crazy. Three, woman are hysterical.Our protagonist, Yossarian, spends a lot of his time in the military hospital, as he realizes that is perhaps the only place where he can't get killed.Around Yossarian revolve an unbelievable assortment of characters, from rabid war-mongers to meek pacifists, with the entire gamut of humanity spanning the gap in between. Some quotes:\\"McWatt was the craziest combat man of them, because he was perfectly sane and did not mind the war.\\"\\"Milo defended the historic right of free men to pay as much as they had to for things they needed in order to survive.\\"\\"Look fellows, we've got to have some confidence in the people above who issue our orders. They know what they are doing.\\"\\"The hell they do.\\"\\"Colonel Korn was the lawyer, and if Colonel Korn assured him that fraud, extortion, currency manipulation, embezzlemment, income tax evasion and black market speculation were legal, Colonel Cathcart was in no position to disagree..............\\"Perhaps the most entertaining and insightful book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I would only recommend this book if you aren't easily offended. It does have coarse language and is gruesome in parts.It has been a while since my first reading of this book. I read it when I really new to the military. It is much funnier now after having gone to war and been in the Army for longer than a year.I must admit that even though the characters in this book are a bit outlandish and far fetched, you do feel at times in the Military that your superior officers are exactly like the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Hidden underneath the parades and utterances of manipulative politicians there's always a real war with real people that get killed or have their lives and the lives of those who love them altered by the war. Heller in this novel portrayed war as satire. No flag waving just a good look at how war can sometimes become dysfunctional because wars are fought by bureaucracies. And sometimes,especially in this novel, bureauracies develop objectives that are different from the people who commisioned the war.Catch 22 is a law with perverted logic and is displayed in various parts of the novel:\\"There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.\\"During World War II, Heller was a member of the Army-Air Corps and flew 60 combat missions in Italy. I would make a guess that had he not flown those missions, he might have written a different novel where the airmen were more heroic - more ra ra. Heller is not the type of writer who churns out clever novels that look like a book by the numbers but sell well because people like the comfort of the same old thing. He said what he had to say and that was pretty much it. He continued writing throughout his life but he never duplicated or exceeded what he did with Catch 22. I would recommend that every young person read Catch 22. It certainly helped to me rethink my previous support of the Vietnam War.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I found this book to be a masterpiece in its own genre. I agree that Heller's writing might not appeal to everyone, but I found narrative to be excellently sarcastic, clever and enjoyable to read. Bitter humor intertwined with realistic descriptions of the war atrocities, as well as insane dialogs, which correspond to the insanity of the surrounded bureaucratic chaos are simply genius.The book's plot is not built in a traditional way, but at the same time, it is shrewdly completed as a whole, even if chapters seem to be randomly put together with description of memorable characters, as well as events in the military base. I didn't laugh out loud as some readers did, because I just don't enjoy the topic of war, but that is just my personal preference, which doesn't prevent me to see that book as a all-time classic read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I just want to say that I disagree with all those haters giving the book one star. I'm in high school and my AP literature class went through the book as part of the course. The collegeboard considers this a book of literary merit, right along with other greats such as Huckleberry fin, Moby Dick ect. I personally loved the book and found it quite hilarious, however, I'm glad I went through it with my class: had I not, I would have missed a lot. For instance one of the characters posions the men by putting soap into the food to show that the men couldn't tell what food was good. I missed the irony of something that we gennerally associate with cleaning or making one more healthy (soap) being used for the opposite purpose. Things like that are everywhere in the book, and irony runs rampant through the entire story. Also: knowing the history of the author helps as well. Joseph Heller has a philosophy that the more restricted the general population is the more their morals degenerate. This can be seen the the more desperate things Yossarian tries to do as the book goes on. Long story short: its a great book and a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is the most over-hyped book I have ever read.

I hate this book."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22, by Joseph Heller, stsarts out by introducing the characters. It takes place in World-War II with American soldiers in Italy. Yossarian is the name of the main character who often mentions wanting to be sent homw. Many of the characters are portrayed as crazy. This is illustrated when Yossarian stsates, \\"Then why don't you ground me? I'm crazy. Ask Clevinger\\"(54). By being grounded Yossarian is referring to being sent homw. The man he saks is Doc Daneeka, who wallows in his own self pity. Doc Daneeka answered Yossarian saying, \\"Catch-22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\\"(55). The characters aren't caught up in the usuall \\"American Spirit.\\" Many of the men are questioning why they're even there.Much of the humor in this book is based on irony and the idiosyncraises of the characters. Many events that took place portrayed them as children, and the battle field their play ground. Most of the characters, especially Yossarian, spend most of their time trying to get out of flying the number of missions required to be sent home. Everyone tries to get someone else to do their job for them, which I found irritating.Most of the storyline of Catch-22 are the flashbacks provided by the narrator, more than the characters themselves. It's almost as if each flashback is it's own little story, mkaing it hard to follow any kind of rising action.As much as this book is recommended, I would ask readers to stay clear of it. The story lacked a climax, and the characters lacked a certain depth making it hard feel any kind of emotional connection. If you are still interested, I would recommend reading the first few chapters, then seeing if it is something you enjoy."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I always wanted to read Catch 22 because it was a famous book (and of course the term was used in a Metallica song). I began reading it three times but after 50 pages or so, I always lost interest. I never could discover a story and the many dialogues and events are strange, to say the least. Someone once told me it is a great book after page 100 but I never got that far. So I can only say: don't even try reading Catch 22', read '1984' by George Orwell and listen to Metallica."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"In my words Catch-22 is overrated. This book could have been summed up in one chapter, and in all its wordiness the only point is that war is extremely boring. Although each chapter had something exciting, Joseph Heller droned on relentlessly about a single character. The climax of the book is when Yossarian is up in the bomber on a mission to Bologna and the gunners guts fall out, because a piece of flak went into his stomach. The whole time the gunner is crying out \\"I'm cold, I'm cold!\\" One side of the book that I liked was how Joseph Heller made each chapter about one person, which makes it slightly better, because the cast is always growing. Each character is unique, and I value that, but his subject matter poor.

Aside from the obsurd and unbelievable situation Yosarrian is in, the book was, in a word....MONOTONOUS! It is not the amount of characters, nor the repetative back story of each character that Heller takes every opportunity tell us, but it is more the repetive, cliche' discussions that yossarian has with just about every character he come across. It goes like this, \\"Your crazy. No I am not. Maybe I am. Maybe you are too becuase you are here and you think I am crazy. Oh yeah, maybe I am crazy too, blah blah blah.\\" I really wish I would have spent the money on cookbook instead, or really anything other than this.

After all these others no more that I can say. Makes me sick that some people didn't give it 5 stars"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch -22 seemed like it would be interesting and different. From reading the book jacket this looked like an interesting book and I looked forward to reading it. As I was reading it, I changed my mind; I thought that this was a terrible book.The book took place during WWII. The main character was Yossarian, who tried to run away from anything that he thought would turn into a problem. He never faced his fears or responsibilities. Whenever he did something that he thought was good something else happened and wound up causing something bad to happen. Damned if you do damned if you don't either way you don't win. So much so that the term \\"being in a Catch-22 situation\\" has become a part of everyday language.Snowden was a friend and inspiration for Yossarian. By the end of the book Yossarian had to choose between himself and others. Yossarian cared about this boy very much. Snowden's wartime death shocked him. He had always run away from the missions, he never dropped bombs, he just got the air hours on his record. He hated being in the army and wanted to leave, he did not want to die. Yet after his friend died he decided to help hid friends and run away.For most of the book Yossarian is a patient in a military hospital. All he does when he is there is pick on the staff and other patients. But when his friend Orr picks on Yossarian he gets mad, but never defends himself. He is afraid to die. When he is in the hospital he acts like everyone is out to kill him and thinks that all the people in the hospital are crazy.I think Yossarian was a capable person who got in his own way when he tried to do anything. He would run from his responsibilities instead of facing them. At the end of the book he proved to himself that he was running from his responsibilities and finally ran toward them. He faced his responsibilities by going to help his friends when he rejected an offer that he had been asking for because he didn't want to lie. Until then he had been a very selfish man and only wanted to save himself and his close friends in the process.I think that this book was too long and that it could have been better in less words. This book did not hit home with me as I thought it would."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I have read hundreds of books, and the enormous amount of hype surrounding this novel is unparalleled. Personally, I attribute most of it to the chance luck of Heller in creating the often used phrase \\"Catch-22.\\" Essentially, he coined a phrase that became an advertisement for the book. If his title had been something slightly less appealing like \\"Catch-33\\" or if the term \\"Catch-22\\" was used but hidden in the text, rather than used as the title, no one would have ever heard of this book.Another important attribute of this hype is the hipster element of Heller's title phrase. It seems to imply that someone who read the book is deeply philosophical or understands a truth not many know. This is not just my own imagination. In college, I knew a guy who having already read the book, brought it (on a plane, cross country) seemingly to display in his dorm room. Once, apropos of nothing, he picked it up and explained that it was his favorite book. Coincidently, he also happened to be a dandy who wore (I think) satin shirts.Heller's prose is plain and uninspired rather than brilliant or funny. Worse yet, it goes on and on. Incidents which might have made mediocre short stories get added together and filled out to a torturing tediousness. Characters are wooden. Dialogue and prose are mostly indiscernible from each other, except that the first is surrounded by quotation marks. The result is too silly and boring to be a satire. This is not Swift, or Graves's \\"I, Claudius\\", instead I would compare it to Graham Greene's horrible \\"Our Man in Havana.\\"This is the sort of book that you might hear people discuss at snobbish cocktail parties.

I got that in the first 100 pages. Were the next 400 pages simply meant to illustrate that point -- making me &quot;experience&quot; the absurdity?.

Yes yes, war is hell, and yes, the military has a lot of stupid regulations, but really, is it all really necessary?This book is apparently supposed to be funny. Perhaps the monotonous dialogue that I imagine is supposed to pass as witty banter was new and funny in the '50's, but now it is just tiring.An example:\\"...I have a liver condition.\\"\\"Oh yes, I forgot,\\" said Milo, in a voice lowered deferentially. \\"Is it bad?\\"\\"Just bad enough,\\" Yossarian answered cheerfully.\\"I see,\\" said Milo. \\"what does that mean?\\"\\"It means that it couldn't be better.\\"\\"I don't think I understand.\\"\\"...without being worse. Now do you see?\\"\\"Yes, now I see. But I still don't think I understand.\\"\\"Well, don't let it trouble you. Let it trouble me. You see, I don't really have a liver condition.

I had borrowed it from the library recently and tried sitting through it. I mainly borrowed it because of all the praise it got and the amount of hype surrounding it. I do enjoy a little \\"brain popcorn\\" now and then, so I'd enjoy it.I didn't.First off, the writing here is garbage. Actually, it's every bit as bad as Twilight. The worst crime with the writing is that, like the aforementioned Twilight saga, Heller does more telling than showing. Yeah, the gun is across the room. you don't need to tell us that. How about \\"Clevinger was surprised to discover the inexorable hatred of the Action board, which was the strangest of many things happening\\". That is way better than, paraphrasing here, \\"There were many strange things happening. The strangest of all was the inexorable hatred of the Action Board. Clevinger was surprised to discover it.\\" There are more examples of that throughout the book, and they are WAY longer than the one I provided. There are several run-on sentences and examples of bad grammar, which are annoying. And the dialogue is just \\"shoot me in the head\\" awful. Further, he abuses such tags as \\"He lied\\" or \\"He questioned\\", which gets repetitive.The plot? Was there even any plot? I could hardly distinguish one. Just random events happening. Also, the book tries to make itself like a movie by jumping around from character to character when it comes to certain things, something I hate. The names are stupid too- Major Major Major Major? Colonel Korn? I get that this book is meant to be a satire, but those names are just childish. Hell, even Family Guy is more creative with the names.Was the book funny? In some parts it was. I'll admit, the first three chapters are so absurdly funny, it's beautiful. And the ending was funny as well- I felt like someone had spiked my coffee with LSD by the time I got to the end.Lastly, the book's worst crime is that it's downright BORING. There's hardly any plot here, the characters, particularly Yossarian, are unlikeable and shallow, and the book is too long for its own good, yet simultaneously not long enough for the amount of stuff crammed in it.Overall, this book was incredibly frustrating to read. If you want a good satire, read Slaughterhouse Five. It's better than this.OK guys, I am now ready to be crucified for my negative review. Hammer away at the nails."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I didn't even finish this book. Completely lost me. I think I just didn't get it. Hopefully that is not a sign of my intelligence.

He was, of course, right on--that's another confirmation that this book is required reading for all military bureaucrats. The various quagmires and contradictions are fleshed out admirably in his characters. I especially love the Chaplain, who is described in one chapter in masterful literary way. Everything in this book is \\"true true!\\" So you have to read it knowing that the ridiculous fiction is a parallel of real life experience, told in a surreal way. He did a nice job with stream of consciousness that was not as overkill as in the other novel, Something Happened. If you are in the Military, make this book your next purchase and plan on re-reading the book seveal times. I can't imagine a better present to send a soldier in Iraq or Afghanistan. The ending is perfect, the beginning is awkward so you have to power through! I give four stars only because I felt he could have done even better with a couple issues, and he tends to hammer home his points just a little bit too forcibly. So what! Just buy it and start reading it tonight."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This was an extremely entertaining novel.

Catch-22 was certainly more modern in its references and it covered things from multiple viewpoints. Catch-22 was more slapstick comedy whereas in Hasek's classic you were never sure if Svejk was a genius or an idiot with his simple minded torpidity and senseless compliancy. At the end of the good soldier I leaned towards Svejk being a genius underminer and from reading Heller's book, he too probably thought this. It's almost as if Hasek's protagonist, Svejk, was reincarnated into catch-22's hero Orr.My own favorite characters in Catch-22 were Milo who's ludicrous economic machinations were sheer brilliance and the despotic old Italian man who's ruminations on life were genuine.The plot did bounce around a bit too much for my liking, and the time shifted without warning. Hilarity and riot were mixed sad and poignant scenes such as in which Snowden's murmurs morbidly about being cold while being cradled in Yassarian's arms, sheltered by comforts of \\"There, there.\\"In all a good book, especially after tumbling past the first 200 pages or so."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I can't believe I didn't read this forty years ago.

The considerations on the plot touches the human nature down to the basics in its quest to survive. Every chapter focus on the existential problems and quirky behavior of a given individual or situation, then pulls the subject apart and break its down for analysis as a tale taking the different approaches my review caption statesAt some points, it is difficult to understand the purpose of the author, in others you get rich \\"ridiculous\\" dialogues and great sparks of excellence like, quote \\"..He was a guy with intelligence but no brains\\"..), I loved this so called piece of wisdom and it is something that I incorporated to my life from now on.

Heller takes you on an absurd ride through Captain Yossarian's time at the Air Force camp in Pianosa - showing the tragedy of war from the facet of what it does to those who engage in it. Chapter by chapter, you meet characters for whom the heat of war has further fractured the cracks and fault lines in their souls - from young men who go crazy trying to keep themselves sane, to opportunists who take advantage of the most ridiculous circumstances, to generals and colonels who play power games simply to indulge in their own power.What Heller's book shows us, when we laugh at the characters and their actions, is that we are not so different from this lunatic cast - that our own offices, churches, and homes are filled with the same characters and the same flaws. Some of those characters and flaws are funny, and some are downright frightening - but none of them is without critique. We are all cracked and we will all shatter - the only hope is escape.Heller's book is unapologetically escapist. When you see the world as an absurd series of events, there is little else to do but escape. If you become a part of that landscape, you lose yourself. Yossarian, the protagonist, refuses to let himself completely melt into the canvas of the scene that is painted around him and seeks a way out. In the life of a Christian, this way out is Christ - the escape for sinners who would rather not go on sinning, even though they have already done so and have broken themselves and others in that process. Heller does not paint Yossarian's escape so clearly, but does give us hope that Yossarian will escape.I enjoyed this book for the most part. It was a little dense reading at times, but well worth the time spent in finishing it. I hope you'll enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I still can't decide if this difficult and cumbersome read was worth it. It was like watching Dilbert devolve into a horror movie... I kept reading with a mounting sense of terror, I was actually biting my nails by the last few chapters.This novel *is* a work of genius - the repetitions that so many readers find unbearable demonstrate the way Yossarian's mind travels in circles around the traumatic events he cannot face without going completely crazy (they remind me of the writing of Connie Willis - a favorite of mine). I don't think anything else I have read has brought home the horror and senselessness of war quite like this book, and I can see why it is taught in so many literature classes, you could discuss it for hours.....however, that being said... I have no desire whatsoever to open this book again."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I don't really have much to add to what everyone else has already said here, but this is a book that is worth coming back to every once in a while.

To those who can't or won't see what Heller did here, I feel sorry for you. We've all in North America been born into a place forged out of wars, wars for independence, for life, for humanity, it is a pity to see how little we understand how valuable a gift all those men and women gave up for our liberty. Catch-22's true brilliance is in showing us that most of the time, those who fought in all those wars didn't themselves understand how valuable their lives were, until they were always on the verge of losing it. That's probably the greatest catch of all. Heller's message in the book is clear, take Snowden's secret to heart as Yossarian did. Man is not special or invincible - &quot;The spirit removed, man is garbage.&quot; See past patriotism, nationalism; see past all the &quot;isms&quot; and think for yourself.

When Yossarian and his friends begin asking clever questions to disrupt boring educational sessions, Colonel Korn decides that only those who never ask questions may ask questions. When they want to discuss a problem with Major Major, they are allowed into his office only when he is out. Even when Yossarian is offered an apparently harmless deal that would allow him to go home as a hero, there is a catch. He must betray his friends by praising the officers who caused many of them to die. Life is reduced to one frustrating paradox after another."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"A little long, a little tedious, but ultimately rewarding! Heller dances between sanity and insanity, comedy and tragedy in this great read.

None of that is necessary when speaking about Joseph Heller's masterpiece, Catch-22. Every year, in high schools throughout America, a rather large percentage of english teachers introduce this novel to yet another class of high school english students. What a good thing it is that these teachers do.Catch-22, from the moment of its publication, redefined the anti-war novel. Witty, ironic, savagely sarcastic, yet all the time retaining the poignancy of truth, this book has played a substantial role in teaching people to question authority.If you've read Catch-22 before, grab it off the bookshelf and read it again. If you've been given this book as a class assignment, thank your teacher and relish your good fortune."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It takes genius to write a novel like this. I admit it is not for everyone. Only serious readers should attempt it. Crazily written, it will make your head whirl. Readers who didn't like it probably thought it was too crazy, confusing, cartoonish and unrealistic. Then again, life is too sometimes. By the end of the story, Yossarian discovers &quot;how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts...&quot; A great novel that will stand the test of time, or at least as long as we fight wars in the name of patriotism."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Despite being very repetitive, this book entices anyone who reads it with the thought provoking plot, and different view points from different characters.

Whenever he's in, he's out- and whenever he's out, he's in. There's also Yossarian who somehow is the only sane man in a world of lunatics. Fitting directly with the time period it was written in, this novel doesn't only incorporate a number of Catch-22's, but it is a huge Catch-22 that keeps revolving around the same basic principle, but ends up with different hilarious results.

It will make you think more than some people are capable of but don't let their bad reiviews fool you. Go out and read this book. Don't buy it from here though. Get it at your local bookstore.

The parts at the end of the book where Yossarian walks through the sreets, totally helpless as he watches all sorts of evil things being done to people, are really powerful. CATCH-22, as I see it, describes a world that has become so hard and evil that it paralyzes the people living in it, and a war serving the interest, not of the people it's supposibly fought for, but the interest of the officers and the capitalists (Milo). A world where every glimt of common sense is seen on as insanity, and a world populated with people desperately needing someone to hold on to, someone to touch."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Really good book, it was a great change for me from my usual boring technical books.

Read it because it is damn good.Catch-22 is the type of book that will make you laugh, make you cringe and make you think. This is a story that will enchant you with its characters, its humor, its descriptions and its truths.Catch-22 is not a pacifist rant. The morality of fighting World War II isn't the issue here. It is about the abuses of power, politics and hypocrisy that occur within military organizations during war. Yossarian is a man who has already gone beyond the call of duty for his country, yet is forced beyond his breaking point by men who are more interested in wealth and power than in concluding the conflict.In our lives and work, most of us observe people making decisions driven by personal ambitions and ego to the detriment of all around them. Catch-22 is a dark comedy of those traits when they play out in the most lethal business of all: the business of war.Heller's writing style breaks many of the literati's proscribed rules. He makes heavy use of repetition, along with strings of adjectives and adverbs. Although the story spends a lot of time exploring the characters, it does little to develop its nonlinear plot. Nevertheless, I found the rhythm of his writing hypnotic and engaging. You'll find yourself turning the pages to learn more about the people of the story."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I cannot think why it has taken me nearly forty years to read Heller's masterpiece. It lived up to all I had ever heard. The hero (?) Yossarian is desperate to get away from the insanity of war. The Catch is that he cannot convince the authorities of his madness because anyone wanting to get away from the war must be sane. This is the thread, which runs through the book. In the process we meet a host of bizarre, comic and tragic characters. There is the brilliant Major Major Major who will only allow men to come in and see him when he is out. In fact the higher they go the madder they get - Cargill, Cathcart, Dreedle and the wonderful Scheisskopf whose dream is to put his men in a parade. But for me the genius of the book is in the creation of Milo Minderbinder who manages to turn the war into an unrivalled business opportunity. Throughout the book there is the haunting spectre of Snowden - what really happened to him.I cannot imagine that there is a more entertaining, more gripping and more powerful account of the insanity of war. Nobody should go through life without reading this."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"While this was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read it does one thing poorly.

I'm going to go ahead and base this review on my first reading with the qualification that the book may not hold up quite as well on multiple readings.The first time through, however, I was blown away. This book is really not like anything else I'd ever read. I know that statement sounds cliche, but it was true for me. Joseph Heller invents an entirely new prism through which to view the world, and I suspect the humour and zaniness in this novel will either work or not work for readers based on personal taste. It worked for me, and after reading it, the only thing I could think of was what had prevented me from reading it sooner.Actually, my wife couldn't wait until I was done with the book, because at times I was in such a black mood while reading it. That's not a criticism of the book but rather a testament to Heller's skill as an author. He so perfectly controls the story that you will have tears of laughter rolling down your face one moment and a sick feeling in your stomach another as the story moves effortlessly from rollicking comedy to horrific tragedy.I won't bother trying to summarize the plot or characters. I have read other comments that criticize Heller for not inventing developed characters, which I suppose is a justified criticism. Many of them have a cartoonish quality and exist solely for the purposes of making a point or moving the plot along. However, they're not totally devoid of depth, because when a character dies, I felt genuinely moved and actually mourned the loss. Their individual traits and quirks (even if that's all you get of them) are so delightful that their absence from the story is keenly felt.I can't praise this book enough and only hope that as I continue to re-read it, the genius of it will emerge once again. One thing is for certain: I doubt I will ever read anything quite like it again, because I doubt that anyone will ever again write anything quite like it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I've been seeing this book around forever. My roomate had to read it in highschool, but he never finished it. In fact, he had to write two research papers on it, and STILL never finished it. After reading up on it, I decided to give it a try...it being a classic and all. And let me tell you, I was impressed.Lately I've been on a Vonnegut reading spree, and this fit well into the same mindset. Plenty of hilarious conversations and occurances. You just can't go wrong with clever humor. I finally know where the phrase &quot;My name is Mudd&quot; comes from (Primus fans will feel nostalgic)!This book is a challenging read though. No rookies want to tackle this puppy. You have to keep track of the characters, or you'll get a little lost. Still, I do not even consider that a negative thing. It's just something you have to deal with, right?Anyways, this was a great book. Who would have thought that a war satire could be so funny? One last thing, my favorite character was Major Major Major Major."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"As a long-term prisoner, I'm frequently struck with the comical absurdity of the rigid rules and manner in which adult human beings interact inside the federal bureau of prisons. It doesn't matter whether one is held at USP Leavenworth, or the federal prison camp at FPC Montgomery. A pecking order of personnel exists in every institution which mandates that staff members who want to advance must like the boots of their supervisors, enforce and support every rule assiduously regardless of the ridiculousness of the rule itself. No staff member can befriend or fraternize with a prisoner. Although prison guards fancy titular titles like correctional professionals, they not only fail to \\"correct\\" anything, but they absolutely thwart the progress of individuals who aspire to grow. Living as a prisoner places one in a perennial catch-22.I had heard the term \\"catch - 22\\" for years, and I knew there was a book of the same name. That's all I knew. Then, one afternoon while listening to National Public Radio, probably NPR's Fresh Air with Terry Gross, or Radio Times, I heard one of the guests describing Joseph Heller's Catch - 22 as an exceptionally great American novel. I was almost finished with an Anthony Robbins self-help book when I heard the NPR interview, so I walked to the prison library to check it out. Heller's Catch - 22, a Voltaire-like satire of the military's rigidity had me laughing from page one.Heller uses a dry wit to poke fun at the obsequious, phony interactions between military personnel. As Voltaire's Candid brought to surface the hypocrisy that comes with institutional thought patterns in general, and organized religion in particular, Heller makes readers laugh by bringing his protagonist into contact with his superiors, his equals, his subordinates, and civilians. As a federal prisoner, I live in the midst of the same culture Heller describes. Catch - 22 reminds readers that institutions and the insular culture they propagate cause many of the personnel who work for institutions to forget that we're all human beings and not part of a bureaucratic machine.Heller uses each chapter in Catch - 22 to dramatize another ludicrous episode of military life. We laugh while reading how individuals become blinded by their positions and the power that comes with rank. In several chapters we follow one ingenious military man as he exploits the greed of human nature to build a massive military-sanctioned black market enterprise, the syndicate, in which \\"everyone has a share\\"; enabling them to profit through layered global transactions that frequently deal with war-time enemies. In other chapters Heller entertains us by exposing the insecurities and pettiness of high-ranking officers; it's funny to see those whom the officers belittled and stepped on earlier become direct superiors later in the novel.Heller's Catch - 22 is so powerful that he book's title became a dictionary work defining paradox. It not only made me laugh, but also inspires me as a writer. One day I hope to emulate Heller and Voltaire by writing a satire in the same vein, exposing the absurdity and waste of the criminal justice system in general, and prisons in particular."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"If you are looking for a book to sit down and read on a Sunday afternoon, &quot;Catch 22&quot; is not the book for you, however if you are looking for a book that will make you think, and is accompanied by off beat humor then &quot;Catch 22&quot; is the book for you.The humor in &quot;Catch 22&quot; is not your typical slap stick humor. It is, however, a way to understand the crazy timeline in which the book is written, and a way to realize how crazy the characters really are. The book's humor shows the insanity of war. The humor in this book takes away from the reality of war. The book seldom mentions fighting, it is more focused on the characters getting out of the war, and the crazy action of the characters. Without humor this book would be extremely dry, and confusing. The humor however does not appeal to all readers.Yossarian, as well as the other main characters in this book, are all stuck in a &quot;Catch 22.&quot; Each way they turn, there is another obstacle preventing them from getting out of the World War II. Whether it be the rise of the missions required, or the increasing bureaucracy among high-ranking officials. There are examples of \\"Catch 22\\" such as this throughout the book.The humor shows how truly crazy the characters are. One character, for instance, puts crab apples in his cheeks because he likes the way they feel inside his mouth. Can you image seeing one of our troops walking around with crab apples inside his mouth, and how comfortable with our army would you be?If you are looking for a book to really stretch you mind, as well as make your stomach hurt from laughter then &quot;Catch 22&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The novel Catch-22 deals with the soldiers stationed on a small island just off the coast of Italy during World War II. The main plot is focused around the story of Yossarian, one of the many soldiers on the island. Yossarian is different from many of the men stationed there as he takes the war personally and gets annoyed that he has to be there, facing danger everyday. He continually tries to find ways to get out of the war and go home, but every plan he comes up with always has a catch, catch-22. This catch ruins all his plans and makes them seem illogical. Throughout the novel Yossarian has to fight against everyone to gain back his life and get what he wants.I enjoyed this novel because of the serious yet satirical tone that is used to convey the major theme. Heller used humor to make the book less controversial and to entertain the reader, while trying to make a statement. He also dealt with a very serious subject matter, the topic of war, which everyone has differing views on. He discusses the fighting and death that occurs in any war and is very graphic in his descriptions of what happens, but through being straightforward and blunt, Heller makes a stronger statement about war and its brutality. The descriptions affected me and my heart went out to all the soldiers involved in the war. Then, when Heller brought the humor back in I began to laugh out loud at the experiences he discussed. I truly enjoyed the way Heller wrote the novel and found that the mix of humor with the serious topic of war worked well to convey his message and made the novel truly original.The novel does not only discuss war and cannot just be considered an anti-war novel. The novel can relate to any aspect of human life and make sense in almost any situation, making it a universal novel. The issues that Catch-22 deals with are issues and emotions every person has confronted at one time or another, such as anger, loss, pain, determination and selfishness. All the characters have to overcome these emotions if they want to survive the war and make it in the world.I found Catch-22 to be an excellent novel about gaining your own freedom and becoming your own person and enjoyed the fact that it used such a controversial and universal topic as war to convey that message.A great read for anyone."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This satirical novel tells the interconnected stories of Yossarian the bombadier and the men who serve in a military camp on an Italian island during WWII. Nearly every character in this story is crazy, some because they have become unbalanced through their horrific battle experiences and others because they serve so well as functionaries in a system that has normalized the killing of other people. Yossarian retains his sanity through a tight focus on the necessity of his own survival. He becomes a hero by ultimately refusing to capitulate to the forces that demand him to sublimate this most basic and healthy of natural urges to the convenience of a system of death based on the spurious logic of \\"Catch-22,\\" a series of mutually exclusive choices that make true choice impossible and lead one by default down the most destructive path.This is a very funny book, although I felt that some of the more outlandish satire didn't sit well with the more graphically realistic elements of the novel. The narrative is presented in a disjointed manner that heightens the chaos of the situation.Some may be put off by the manner in which Heller attacks the mentality of war without any consideration for the specific conditions that may have provided some justification for the prosecution of WWII."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I wasn't sure what I got myself into when I chose this book for my World History book report. I sorta thought I might have chosen the wrong book. That is, until I actually started reading. This is the funniest book I have ever read and the only one to make me laugh out loud.This book tells the tale of Yossarian, a bombardier captain, stationed off Italy. The thing that separates this novel from every other war novel is that all of the characters are so dysfunctional: Yossarian, the main character, doesn't want to fight. He even tries to convince his superiors that the place he was supposed to bomb already was. Orr, his best friend, carries crab apples in his cheeks. Chief White Halfoat keeps threatening to die of Pneumonia if people don't pay attention to him and the soldier who sees everything twice, sees everything twice.This book is incredibly funny one moment and incredibly sad the next. The horrors of war penetrate the wall of humor in this book quite frequently. Because all of the characters are so weird and cartoonish, it makes everything much more depressing than if a character in a less zany book dies. They aren't supposed to die, they are larger than life.Everything is displayed in a very sarcastic tone, from the Major who states \\"Whenever I am out, I'm in, and whenever I am in I'm out\\" to Milo, who contracts his planes to bomb and defend the same bridge.This book cannot be read without cracking a smile and is a much needed change of pace from the other books in this genre. This should be required reading for anyone and everyone with a sense of humor."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is a very strange novel. It definitely has its high and low points like every novel. This book however seemed a little more confusing than some other books that I have read in the past. There were definitely many twists and turns throughout the story.Catch-22 is about a fighter pilot named Yossarian. Yossarian is a man that finds himself in the middle of World War II. He is very confused about what is going on but he is the only man that seems to know that his life is in jeopardy. During the novel he takes you on many different adventures. Some of them are quite funny while others are totally confusing. He does not like the position he is in and he wants to get out of the war before he is killed. Throughout the novel he runs into many different and interesting people. While all of this is going on he is still trying to save his own life by trying to get out of the war. This is where he runs into all of these different catches which forbid him from exiting duty.Overall I thought that this was a very good novel. Throughout the book I ran into several confusing and misleading parts but it all seemed to make a connection later on in the book. I think that the author did a very good job writing the novel. It kept me very entertained. I would highly recommend this book, although the reading level is a little more advanced I think that it is suitable for any high school student looking for a bit of a challenge."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"What can I say...I was blown away by this book.

Published first in 1955, Catch-22 is an incredible story of life during World War II and many stories of soldiers during battle. Although, there are handfuls of characters, the storyline follows the life of a young American bomber by the name of Yossarian, and his struggles to break free of the war. Life for everyone living near and around Yossarian off of the coast of Italy is tragic and very authentic. The men experience fear, love and hatred, murder, confusion, and the yearning desire to go home.Review Catch-22 is an astounding view of war, and its effects on its participants. Although slow and complicated at first, the conversations and humor make it a favorite read and one that can't be put down until finished. It shows the realities of World War II and how victory comes with consequences.Through Yossarian's stay in Italy, the reader becomes sympathetic to Yossarian and his comrades. They struggle through fear of the slightest things and are almost certain they will not arrive home alive. The men are classified as psychotic, and through their conversations the reader gains a sense of humor of all the many predicaments they get themselves into.Heller emphasizes the importance of every page through tricky conversations that requires the reader's devout attention. He doesn't leave one stone unturned. Catch-22 is very descriptive and not an easy read, but one that will leave the reader with better knowledge of life during World War II. It is a moving novel for both young and old, and reminds the reader that World War II will not be forgotten."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"I am one of those rare people who somehow was never required to read CATCH 22 whilst still in the clutches of high-school English teachers. Recognizing this deficiency, I recently read CATCH 22 for the first time, and found it wonderfully comic, yet simultaneously dark and frightening in its implications.Intended as a scathing satire of war and the military, CATCH 22 is firmly rooted in the bizarre. The characters are delightful in their insanity (also evidenced by their names, i.e., Colonel Korn, Major Major Major Major), and each portrays some aspect of the horrible side of human nature (Nately's sad naivety, the gnawing self-loathing of Major Major), mostly to the total exclusion of any happier traits. With such a cast, thrown into the confusion of World War II, CATCH 22 can only be a strange tale. Personally, it reminded me of the sort of black comedy that leaves you feeling dazed afterwards (for movie lovers, think NIGHT SHIFT), reeling from the confusion and horror of it all.It elicits strong emotions -- frustration and anger not the least of them -- which I suspect was the author's real intention. I often wonder why books touted as &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;great&quot; must be so bizarre. CATCH 22 is not necessarily easy to read, and it seems that only adds to the praise it receives. Perhaps CATCH 22's ability to make the reader a part of the confused, rambling story is based firmly in this bizarreness.Personal hint: read this book twice. You'll catch much, much more the second time through."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is truly one of the best pieces of liturature I have ever read.

How could I possibly have related so strongly to the book? _Catch-22_ is about the absurdity, the wrongness, the evil which is part of many familiar institutions. It is a primer in how to say &quot;No&quot; to meaningless demands, cruel commands, nonsensical orders. It is also funny. Certain passages still cause me to laugh out loud. The ending nearly stirs me to cheering. Like _Slaughterhouse Five_ and _Gravity's Rainbow_, _Catch-22_ is not *really* about WWII. Far from being a poke at those who fought the 'good war', it is a take on the society of the Cold War.

Cynical behaiviour abounds as the pilots try to reach the ever increasing number of missions needed to be flown in order to go home. Peppered with vivid and intense scenes, Catch 22 is one of the funniest and amazing books that exist. It is an emotional and cynical tale that reveals Heller's genius as he turns the reality of World War II into important commentary.

It was so powerful that, at that moment, it frightened me.Re-reading the novel as an adult, I realize that author Joseph Heller was a bona fide genius. In hindsight, it is difficult to believe that CATCH-22 won none of the predictable prizes at the time of its original publication.The absurdity of war, and the struggle of the average soldier to survive his tour of duty, never has been more successfully communicated in literature than Heller did here.Forty years after its first publication, the expression &quot;Catch-22&quot; and the concept behind it have become accepted usages in everyday vocabulary, referring to the cycle of irrationality of problem defying the solution, solution causing the problem.The information on the Amazon website that author Heller lives in East Hampton, New York is out-of-date. Sadly, Heller died in East Hampton a few years ago; as a resident of the town myself, I am certain of this fact.Time has proven that CATCH-22 is classic literature."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22 is a roiling, boiling, oscillating set of absurdities flung at the reader at breakneck pace. The fictional Italian island of Pianoso serves as the backdrop for Joseph's Heller's satirical skewering of WWII and the American military. The storytelling is nearly manic as a cast of surreal characters strive to survive their military obligations amidst chaotic plots and implausible scenarios.Somewhat problematically, Catch-22 has been hailed for decades as among the ultimate in anti-war novels. It is beyond question anti-war, but it is also beyond question a work relying so completely on the absurd as to launch it well beyond satire into whimsy. One might think such pacifist acclaim might cling to something more sturdy.Nevertheless, Catch-22 does have it's heartbreaking moments of war-is-hell horror. I'm not giving anything away by noting that the final description of Snowden's death is emotionally disturbing. These instances, however, are rare. I enjoyed Catch-22 and consumed it quickly. One cannot read this book without developing a fondness for it's protagonist, Captain Yossarian, and a host of other characters far too eccentric to dislike.In the end, Catch-22 is a worthy reading experience, but I will forever wonder how such a fanciful tale can claim to seriously challenge the notion of national defense, an applied foreign policy, and the U.S. military's role within it."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"The funniest book I've ever read in my life..But some not so funny truths are buried under the humor"},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"That's about it.

Mr Heller Americanised the setting and the dialogue but the entire book, the ideas, the storyline is virtually identical to V.A.B.D.L.N."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Of all the books I've read, I've never read one that made me as confused as Catch-22. I believe it's a great book that shows you just how crazy war can be. My favorite character was Yossarian because I related closest to him. It's hard for me to imagine what it would be like to have to fly an armed aircraft over a battle zone and risk my life numerous times. Yossarian and I are on the same page. I've been taught that I am the most important person in the world to myself just as you should be the most important person to yourself. Every decision that I make will always effect my life therefore I am the most important person to me. Yossarian is much like me because he values his life a lot. He doesn't understand why he should have to go to war and risk his life for his country, because he could die while in battle and not get to enjoy what he is fighting for.I think Joseph Heller did a wonderful job in letting the readers get a feel for the insanity that war brings to people. Many of the soldiers started out as sane human beings, but the effect the war had on those men was horrific. Think of how crazy you would have to be to fly a jet, that you know will get attacked, over a battle zone for 50 or 60 times. Several men realized how much danger they were in, and they would try to get out of battle by making excuses or faking illnesses. I think that if I was in their situation, I would've done the same thing.My least favorite character was Colonel Cathcart, because he kept increasing the number of flights that the men had to take. All the men got their hopes up when they were near the required amount of missions, but Colonel Cathcart would make the amount needed a little higher each time so that the men would have to stay and fight. Imagine how frustrating and disappointing that would be. Every time you got close to your goal, it was always set a little higher. After a while the soldiers started to give up hope, because they realized they would never reach the amount required.Overall this was an interesting read. I was often confused due to the craziness of the characters, but I believe that that craziness is what made the book so good. It brought a weird humor to the story and lightened up the atmosphere."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Book description: Set in late World War II, Joseph Heller's Catch-22 starts out with Yossarian meeting the Chaplain in the hospital. Yossarian was a pilot and was the main character in the book. Catch-22 tells the story of World War II through Yossarian's point of view, from hospital visits to bombing missions to showing up to his medal ceremony naked.The book also ranges in topic from a Major who everyone was too afraid of to ask his first name to a mess officer who runs a bogus company. Many topics are amusing, but the majority is not. They are very human.Review: Catch-22 is the most honest book I have ever read. It feels like I am sitting on Yossarian's shoulder for the whole book. I feel all his emotions and thoughts, and they seem so realistic. The characters are completely believable and I can imagine a real person behaving as they do. I feel like a part of the scenes in the book.The writing style is very good, too. Heller doesn't use flowery language or over describe situations. His language choice is absolutely perfect for the situations he is describing.Many novels from World War II seem unbelievable and overly heroic, but Catch-22 is not either of the two. It comes across as very human and realistic, and that is the main reason that I think it is so good."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"This is one of those books that bothered me while I was reading it. Sure it was funny but I also felt insulted as I read. Nonetheless, I always picked it up the next day and read on.Let me start by saying that I preferred M*A*S*H much more because it didn't take itself too seriously. It was raunchier and 100 times funnier. Catch-22 simply tries way too hard. The paradoxical, catch-22 situations are too many and grow tiresome. The whole book is that way! It could have been about 200 pages shorter!The insulting part is how military professionals are all portrayed as complete and utter idiots. Sure, all the characters are very quirky and idiosyncratic, but the military pros are absolutely unlikable and seem to possess no redeeming qualities like the others. As one who has read a great deal of WWII history this was bothersome. I understand the literary technique but it's just too much.READ M*A*S*H INSTEAD. SAVE THIS FOR LATER. YOSSARIAN LIVES."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"Catch-22, the ironic rule that keeps Yossarian and his fellow men in his squadron in the war. They are all crazy in their only special little ways, each fighting their own battle for freedom. Yossarian knows their all crazy; he knows he must get out, not for a loved one or for just the hatred of war itself. Yossarian fears for his life, he fears it every time he climbs aboard his bomber. Some man fly for patriotism and others fly because it needs to be done; the younger men believe war is a great and fun thing. When they do fly many do not come back, as Yossarian can testify. Before his eyes he has seen many of his comrades die, which only depletes what is left of his sanity. The squadron's lack of sanity is at most times the source of great humorous occasions. From Milo's crazy antics of buying and selling of merchandise to Major Major's rules, the laughs far outnumber the moments of tears. Heller uses such great detail to bring the reader to the limits of sadness, and the characters means to dealing with it are the craziest of all. The book is a great read, it offers so many great lessons to be learned and to be taught to further generations. As I began to read it I was unaware of how the book had touched the minds of some many people before me."},{"Title":"Catch 22 (catch-22)","review":"It literally took me YEARS to finish this book.

I concur with the other reviewer that Lovett is preachy and he sure does complain a bit. Certainly it is not easy to take on such an adventure, but he could dispense with the opinionated complaints. Anyone can expect a draining experience traveling by bicycle through Kansas in the summer heat.Lovett is inconsistent on providing background information on some of the places he travels through. When he does provide this information at times in the book, while helpful, sometimes it is a bit too much information.

Thurber writes at a time when the mass media, common culture and common sense of a melting pot nation were shared by most citizens of all classes. Racial minorities were not truly included. A growing awareness of misunderstanding between men and women was a familiar Thurber theme, mostly from a man's perspective.Setting aside modern views, this collection is a treasury of wit, psychological insight, humor, irony and shared experience. Everyman is portrayed in the small town and big city from the perspective of one raised in Columbus, Ohio. The picture of middle class socializing, striving, fears and wisdom captures a time and place, but resonates today. The long shadow of small town/ farming culture in the modern, progressive, urban world shapes daily life.We're missing this world of shared experiences and shared meaning today."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"This sampling of Thurber's genius is a must for every library.

His drawings are wonderful - simple and look so easy. I liked the essays and I loved the cartoons - the one I like best is a chap introducing his wife to a friend 'That's my first wife up there (she is crouching on top of a bookcase and this is the present Mrs Harris.'

The Thurber Carnival is a hodge-podge of essays, stories, and drawings culled over several decades and from several other collections. Some are better than others, of course, and quite a few of them are very dated--unsurprisingly, since the book was originally published in 1945, and compiled at that time from earlier sources.It doesn't really seem to matter. Even though I can't really relate to the early days of the automobile, it didn't stop me from laughing aloud at \\"Recollections of a Gas Buggy.\\" Human nature hasn't changed all that much in the past 60 or 70 years.There are quite a few classic stories in here, including \\"The Catbird Seat,\\" which is a delicious story of revenge, and \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" which I hadn't even realized was Thurber's.His drawings are just as entertaining, which is even more startling after reading in the biography what poor eyesight he had. With just a few lines, he manages to do the same thing he does in the stories and essays with just a few words.Most of the humor has to do with human nature--specifically, with the way people communicate, or don't. One of the best (i.e. most hilarious) examples is \\"What Do You Mean It Was Brillig?\\" in which he lampoons both his housekeeper's accent and his own misunderstanding of and reaction to it. There's also a darkly humorous story, \\"The Breaking Up of the Winships,\\" about a couple who divorces over a disagreement about Greta Garbo. Change a few minor details, and these stories are as true today as they were when they were written.I'm really happy I bought this.

No, he won't have you rolling on the floor with laughter, but his humor has already stood the test of time, as he died more than 50 years ago but is still read and enjoyed.

How did I miss reading him? I love this book so much I bought a second copy for my son. Great wit!!"},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"&quot;The Thurber Carnival&quot; was a beloved companion of my early youth; I laughed out loud again and again at the stories of &quot;My Life and Hard Times,&quot; the hilarious &quot;Fables for Our Time,&quot; &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,&quot; and other classics. What was really important to me about Thurber was that he came from the same part of Ohio that I did, and actually had had relatives and attended family reunions in Sugar Grove, Ohio, where I grew up. That meant all the world to me, because it showed me that someone who had ties to Sugar Grove could be a famous writer. Now, I love Thurber's work more than ever; as an adult, I can better appreciate the nuances of a story like &quot;The Catbird Seat.&quot; Thurber's work is a precise, funny, yet deeply serious portrait of an America which had just recently completed the transition from a frontier to an urban society. Women, having just won the right to vote, were flexing new-found muscles; men, divorced from the need to wrest a living from the soil, felt suddenly unmoored and emasculated; a new breed of self-help authors arose to make a quick buck from the newly uncertain populace; and oceans of alcohol fueled the newly stirred resentments between the sexes.Thurber recorded it all, in a prose style as elegant and lucid as any in the history of American literature. &quot;The Catbird Seat,&quot; &quot;Fables for Our Time&quot; and the self-help parodies of &quot;Let Your Mind Alone!&quot; are every bit as fresh and pertinent as when Thurber wrote them 60-odd years ago. Unfortunately, some aspects of his work--most glaringly his portrayal of African-Americans--have not stood up so well. But one can only say of Thurber what the Duc de Saint-Simon said of Louis XIV: &quot;His virtues were his own, his faults were his times'.&quot; The best of James Thurber ranks with the best of Mark Twain, Ring Lardner, Woody Allen and any other American humorist you can name."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"A few years back I used to travel to work (some 15 miles) by bus. As is the custom with commuters just about everywhere, my fellow travellers and I seldom spoke..a nod and a half-smile would be about as much communication as we managed. One morning I unwisely picked up a copy of &quot;The Thurber Carnival&quot; to while away the time on the journey: unwise because about halfway through &quot;Travels With Olympy&quot; I let out such an unrestrained hoot of laughter that I startled myself and everyone else on the bus. For a moment it seemed that the driver was about to stop and come back to check on the commotion. Things got back to normal, however....but I couldn't help noticing a few puzzled looks in my direction when I found myself choking back the tears while reading about Thurber's dog Rex: I don't even like dogs much, but such is the punch of Thurber's writing that I was howling my eyes out over the demise of this pooch. As the passengers were getting off the bus one kindly lady stopped by my seat and asked what I had been reading. The next day I got it into my head to buy a bicycle and started cycling to work each day. I recall one morning as the bus hurtled past me, seeing the kindly lady reading a book and smiling...I can't be sure, but I like to think it was the Thurber Carnival. These days I drive to work."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"THE THURBER CARNIVAL is an excellent collection if only because it contains the complete MY LIFE AND HARD TIMES. In the early seventies, when my grandmother gave me a respectful and wonderfully brief biography called THE CLOCKS OF COLUMBUS, I became a THURBER fan. I was in Junior High and Thurber, dead more than ten years already, was enjoying something of a vogue. Most of his books were back in print. Today, we're down to about a third or less of what he wrote. The Library of America's collection looks fairly complete, but THE THURBER CARNIVAL was his own selection of greatest hits, if you will. In both cases I miss the separate volumes from which these stories and cartoons are culled. If there are concept albums, Thurber had concept collections. You don't get the sense of a Beatles album listening to bits from different albums. This is true with Thurber. You need all of LET YOUR MIND ALONE, which you can only get used now. You need all of THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE; his most representative collection.He tried writing a novel once or twice, but found he could only write short stories. This bothered him. The chief thing to remember as you read him is that he was deeply ashamed of being a humorist. His literary hero was Henry James. During Thurber's time at the New Yorker (and he arrived there about a year after its founding, staying until his death more than three decades later) the magazine was a showcase for humorists. Think of the original cast of Saturday Night Live and you'll have something of an idea of the atmosphere at the magazine in its first ten years or so. Competitive humorists travelled from all over the United States to work for THE NEW YORKER. The Algonquin Roundtable was largely a haven for NEW YORKER staffers. James Thurber learned from E. B. White and a few others and then outstripped them. If you read E. B. White's forays into humor, you'll see his clean prose shining, but you won't feel you know him. Thurber, on the other hand, leaves you with the impression that he wishes to God he never left Ohio. There is a sense of loss in Thurber's rhythms.He is as dated as a Studebaker. If you're not willing to put yourself back in time, Thurber's not for you. But, if you notice his pain, you might notice how mightily he strove against it. Thomas Wolfe once met him at a party. Someone said, \\"This is James Thurber, the New Yorker writer.\\"Wolfe shook his hand and said, \\"You call those little, tiny things writing?\\"All Thurber had was his writing. He was a mess otherwise. Even when his writing practically barks its bitter sentiment, Thurber turns a phrase as if he owns it. The actual content of the stories is immaterial. He should be read outloud, because he was essentially a poet."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"I grew up with this book. First published in the mid-40s, it lived in the center of a built-in bookcase over my father's desk in the family room, and I was drawn to it time and time again during my childhood.At first, I was convulsed by Thurber's uniquely hilarious cartoons. His dogs and his women are priceless...drawn in a style that nobody has ever been able to duplicate or capture.It was only later, as I grew older, that I could appreciate Thurber's written humor. The &quot;Thurber Carnival&quot; (and it is) is a compilation of essays and excerpts from &quot;My World--and Welcome to It,&quot; &quot;The Middle Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze,&quot; and others. These were Thurber's earlier works that were very much a product of their times, but oh, so funny! Thurber was one of the great commentators on the vagaries of everyday life. Along with Robert Benchly et al., he set the tone for an entire generation. I still have this book, and I absolutely cherish it. It's hard to do Thurber justice in a review. All I can say is--buy this book and wallow in it. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"This compendium will give a thoroughly entertaining taste of one of the twentieth century's greatest humourists. Thurber's imagination and wit have an appeal all their own.This anthology brings together a number of his short stories as well as selections from amongst his modern fables and cartoons. 'What Do You Mean, It Was Brillig?' and 'The Night the Bed Fell' are two excellent and hilarious tales that serve well as an introduction to Thurber's surreal world. Don't read these in public unless you are prepared to draw attention to yourself - they will have you laughing out loud. In his fables, modelled after Aesop, but with a twentieth-century bent, Thurber delights in catching the reader unaware with his own particular brand of irony.The cartoons are ingenious. Sometimes you will read a cartoon in a newspaper and it will make you laugh. Go back to it again and it no longer has the same effect. Thurber's cartoons, on the other hand, are so utterly inspired (I do not exaggerate), that they will improve upon a second and third look. You will discover subtle nuances you didn't perceive before. His funniest offerings draw on the theme of marriage, and frequently involve the chasm between a husband and wife trapped in a marriage out of which the love and romance has long since disappeared. You will be left baffled as to where exactly Thurber came across such a natural talent for finding (and exploiting) the absurd in everything."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"One night my wife read to me from one of her textbooks, &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;. I had never heard of James Thurber up to that point. The next day, I bought this collection, mainly because it had Walter Mitty in it. I lucked out, the rest of the collection is incredible--especially the semi-autobiographical material. It's hard to chose favorites but I'll try. I loved &quot;The Owl Who Was God&quot;, &quot;The Dog That Bit People&quot;, &quot;The Catbird Seat&quot;, &quot;The Unicorn in the Garden&quot;, &quot;The Car We Had to Push&quot;, and &quot;Draftboard Nights&quot;. Considering the length of my favorites, I might as well have just copied the Table of Contents.That been said, Thurber is a fantastic writer, with great humor, and penetrating insight."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"Fans of humorous writing argue as to whether Thurber or Twain is the greatest American humorist. I vote for Thurber. The Carnival is the best collection of Thurber. Read it and you'll go looking -- happily -- for everything the collectors had to leave out for lack of space."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"This book provides the most complete single-volume picture of Thurber I've seen. Includes classics as well as distrubing, depression-induced stories. Practically an anthology."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"One of my all time favorite books. a great compilation of short stories gleaned from several collections that can be enjoyed again and again. My favorites include the classic The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, If Grant Had Been Drinking At Appomattox, the Night the Bed Fell and A Sequence of Servants. This delightful tome includes original illustrations of some classic poems (Excelsior and Barbara Frietchie, et al) as well as a collection of original Thurber cartoons."},{"Title":"The Thurber Carnival","review":"The Thurber Carnival is an excellent collection of short fiction, essays and drawings by the late great master of American fiction. Included are such gems as the original Secret Life of Walter Mitty. I thoroughly enjoyed these stories - I think I preferred the fiction to the cartoons near the end (many of which if not all appeared in the New Yorker) but those did not disappoint either.Thurber's eclectic mix of humor and tragedy, hope and desperation, take the reader easily and wholly into his stories. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"Starman: Sins Of The Father is the perfect book for people who think comics are infantile and insipid, because it proves they are idiots. The protagonist, Jack Knight, is a refreshing change of pace from typical comic hero. As the son of the legendary hero Starman, Jack has no desire to take his fathers place as defender of Opal City, and is content to run his &quot;antique&quot; shop(He sells 1950's Hawaiin shirts, old comics, vintage transistor radios, etc.) But Fate intervenes and Jack must become the new Starman to save his city, his Father, and himself. Mature without being vulgar, sentimental without being sappy, and all around well written, Starman: Sins Of The Father is a must have."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"I've been reading books and comic books for about 18 years of my life, and seeing how I'm only 21, that's quite a portion. This book was the first comic book I read where the writing impressed me enough to notice that there was GREAT writing in comics, and that I didn't have to settle for the usual X-men tripe or the hackneyed retread versions of the same story over and over again that comic books had been doing for the last 10 years. It truly opened my eyes to the literary (Yes, just because there are pictures, does not make it any less a book, or a literary artwork) skill in many books. I began with James Robinson, found Alan Moore, Warren Ellis, Grant Morrison, Garth Ennis, Mark Waid, Kurt Busiek, and many, many others. I think that comic books, (which are in desparate need of a new name, much like scifi), often get a bad view as childrens books, but books like this one helped me to mature, and showed me mature things that I was desparate for. In the pages of this! book, we see Jack Knight's growth from a rebellious, even repellent boy and into a powerful, responsible, respectable man. This is truly a literary work of art, in both the writing and the art. I highly recommended it."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"I've always heard good things about Robinson's Starman and I finally got around to reading it. I have to say I wish I had read it earlier. It is such a unique way of looking into superheroics that its seems fresh even though its fifteen years old. The art by Tony Harris is perfectly suited for the book. I look forward to finding the entire series now. Really good stuff!"},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"When someone tries to blow up Jack Knight, and in the process gets some of his family, he will slowly come to the realisation that he has some growing up to do.He kicks against this for some time, but his father, a couple of local cops, Opal City herself, and the need to do something about The Shade and The Mist start to move him in the right direction."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"James Robinson shows his brilliance in crafting vivdly fleshed out characters in his highly entertaining revision of the superhero genre in the 'Starman,' series. This first volume opens up in typical anti-hero fashion with a mortal character reluctantly thrust into the role of superhero and his subsequent struggle to assume such a larger then life identity. While the story and plotting in vol. 1 is decent and perfectly serviceable, the strength of this series is ultimately found in the wonderful character development that takes shape through dozens of chapters. Jack Knight, the hero of this tale, comes across as an everyman with a fascination for kitsch collectibles and pop culture while constantly struggling to find comfort from his transformation to super-being. Good heady stuff without taking itself too seriously."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"I think what's most amazing about this collection reprinting the first issues of James Robinson's EXCELLENT Starman series is that Robinson follows through on the promises he makes in these first issues -- the foreshadowing, the hints, the untold backstories -- and the result is an epic story spanning over 80 issues that actually has cohesion. That's very rare in comics these days -- especially at the &quot;Big Two&quot; publishers where the creative team on any given title almost never remains the same over the long-term. Robinson ranks as one of the best superhero comic writers in the business, and these first issues of Starman were one of the things that established that status for him."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"Sins of the Father starts James Robinson's Starman series with the death of a Starman. David Knight, the oldest son of the original Starman, is murdered by the son of his archenemy The Mist. Forced to take on the role of hero is Jack Knight, Starman's second son, who has no interest (or so he thought) in becoming the next Starman. This series takes a fresh look at superheroes, showing how a callow young man can grow into the role of hero. Robinson takes the idea of the new hero and shows the reader all his faults; the fears he faces, and his anger at events outside his control. Despite these factors, or in spite of them, Jack Knight becomes Starman. This is as good as superhero comics get."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"Really only the hardcore fans of DC remember Zero Hour today, an event that was supposed to be the next Crisis and affect the DC universe for all time but which really had little long-standing ramifications. Some recall this crossover because a few Golden Age heroes were killed off in its pages. Some remember it for its rebooting of the Legion. I remember it most for the brilliant book that leapt from the pages of the crossover, one of the most seminal works of the 1990s, in both the superhero genre and in all of comics, a book called Starman.Those who know me in real life know I adore this book with a depth of passion that is unfathomable. Even my friends who are not comic fans could tell you this is my favorite book of all time, and the evidence to prove that claim can be found just by looking around my home and my office. I proudly display several Starman posters in both places and have a few action figures on my desk at work. I even have a Starman watch that I've worn for the past six years, having gone through numerous replacement batteries and watch bands.As if that weren't enough to show my devotion, you can find proof in the book itself, amongst the letter pages. I loved this comic so much that I wrote at least one letter to the editor for every issue published in Starman's first two and a half years of publication. Once I actually wrote three letters in one month, and this loyalty was rewarded when my letters were published three separate times in the comic itself.Now those who don't know me are probably thinking that I'm an incredible geek, and in this case you would be right. But this behavior is not the norm for me. No book before has inspired such zeal in me as a fan, and I doubt any book ever will again.If my enthusiasm alone is not enough of a recommendation for this book, then I'll let the work speak for itself. I challenge anyone out there to read the first four pages of the first Starman collection (subtitled Sins of the Father) and try not to be drawn in. The story instantly grabs your attention with the beautiful combination of lyrical prose and ornate illustrations. Then it continues to hold your interest with its intensely realistic characterizations as you read on through the rest of the book.DC has always been known for its generational heroes; this series is in the same vein but with a twist. Our protagonist Jack Knight is one of two children of Golden Age hero Starman, and Jack wants nothing to do with the family business. But the events of those first four pages of the story force him to take a more active role when his father's archenemy the Mist returns to town and wreaks havoc with a crime spree led by his own children.Not only do the creators weave an intriguing and engaging tale focusing on themes of family loyalty, but they also invent a whole world of secondary characters in the fictitious setting of Opal City. Every individual we meet in the pages of this book, people like Silver Age Flash villain The Shade or Irish cop Hope O'Dare, becomes real to us as the story progresses, taking on a life of their own that elevates them beyond being mere supporting players. Similarly \\"the Opal\\" itself feels like a genuine place; the cityscapes as drawn by Harris truly leap off of the page.Writer James Robinson and artist Tony Harris really captured lightning in a bottle with this book. It is an unconventional story of a reluctant hero who'd rather be collecting old junk than fighting crime. Starman: Sins of the Father introduces readers to the world of Jack Knight and Opal City so skillfully, so artistically that it will literally be impossible for you to not keep reading once you've tried it."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"This excellent reprinted trade of issues 0-5 of the rgular Starman series, perfectly sums up everything that should be good in comics.The art is tragic in a way, yet absolutely spectacular. And the writing and character information is absolutely the best I have ever seen in a comic.Do yourself a favor and get this book!"},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"I have to admit I like the new Starman alot. But I donthtink everyone would.Great stories, great art, coloring...I have all the 7-8 volumes in the tpb format. The character is written very well. The Sandman stories are especially good, as well as JSA related and even the filler stories with Starman's brother, and Opal City's historical characters. Bank robbers, pirates, aliens, poets, fantasy, sci fi, tattoos, etc...what more could one want?! Also the substitute/guest artists are as good as the regular artist.However I am a little dissappointed that DC never mentions any ratings for their books similar to Marvel. The new Starman Series by James Robinson is NOT FOR KIDS. Although not overly gratuitous visually, there are bedroom scenes, with semi-nudity(no full frontal), drug use(only one issue), as well as homosexual characters(which is not overly emphasized or distracting to the comic. only noticed this rare&few; times. no sex, just words of \\"love forever\\")but it may offend some people, and confuse or harm children's moral upbringing. As an adult, they dont get in the way of the main characters virtuous and heroic qualities but they may cause some people who are offended by that kind of thing to miss the overall well-crafted story plots. For others it may cause them to imitate those scenes. I dont like them in a comic book. Personally the parts of the story that show those scenes really dont add that to the plots very much. But I dont believe the writer was trying to shock anyone, just make society more comfortable with this type of relatonship. I would have rather those ideas/characters remained out of the books, or \\"faded to black\\" (as one homosexual scene was). I still give the books the highest marks for overall artisitic presentation.Starman has since departed from the superheroe scene(i think?) but this run of stories has many many great moments in the modern super hero context. Just be careful if you are scensitive to the \\"adult\\" situations. They show this Starman superhero and related friends, associates, as very human persons, equiped with fallen human nature, and have to go through their own personal, yet in some cases, universal, spiritual and vocational superhero trials and tribulations. These trials are moral & emotional, that many people can relate to on a down-to-earth level. I tend to think of these stories as kind of modern greek mythological hero/fable stuff anyway. But just because greek stories have all the sex and stuff doesnt mean I like to read, or see, in contemporary novels. I pretty much find it insteresting how Robison included the adult situations, but ignore it overall. However, there is more to emotional maturity then sexual relationships, or positions. At least Robinson provides enough character depth & developement to overshadow these unnecessary plot developments. That is where his writing talent really impresses in dealing not with physical strength, but virtuous strength, in terms of acquiring courage, and in some cases, emotional & spiritual growth. Interpersonal relationships between family and friends also play a strong part in the stories as well.But if you are senstitive to the adult themes maybe the original Starman Archives is your style. There are moments where Harris's & Robinson's modern Starman stories really are the best I have ever read. All though there is alot of art deco, art nouveau, and film noir symbolism throughout their work that allows their style to be respectful of the past. Some of Harris's visual treats could make terrific posters. The inker is especially sensitive to his style. The modern Starman handles the adult themes well in many instances, but they couldve been done even better. If you look at film noir, alot happened that you didnt need to see to help create drama. I am afraid Robinson couldve been more graphic, but he also couldve been less so. For instance issues about adultery(not shown in this particular issue) had wonderful, morally and spiritually uplifting conclusions, with effects that run throughout the Starman series, but he didnot have to show the adulterous act to make us know it happened. For me the resolution was marvelously handled, that it overshadowed what was \\"shown\\", however many people might have missed the great ending because of being \\"shown\\" too much. \\"One does not have to see the sin, to learn from it.\\" However, I must restate, Robinson didnt necessarily cross the line of decency, but got right up close to it...even dance over it...to close for me, but still accomplished a great piece of story telling.No offense meant by my comments, just some thoughtfulness that I think DC should include in its packaging, or on its website. Right now one would think Starman is just like any other comic for kids, when SOME issues, NOT ALL, are more like R rated, G, or even PG.I hope DC puts out the remaing issues. I believe about 20 more need to be released in tpb.Yankstar"},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"With the ill-conceived and pitifully executed &quot;Zero Hour,&quot; the DC comics universe was left with little good to work with. Some new characters were created, some current characters were killed off, and other currents were &quot;re-worked.&quot; After all the huss and fuss, only two re-worked post-Zero Hour characters have earned any real following, and only one has earned a consistent following. Green Lantern's mailbag is mixed - there seem to be just as many readers who hate the current GL as those who love him.And then there is Jack Knight, a character that has earned a true cult following. We Starman fans are legion, but we are a quiet although enthusiastic bunch.Why is Jack so popular? My personal take on it is that he is the only Gen-X'er DC character with a regular book who truly personifies heroism. No fancy trappings, no hidden agendas, no driving psychoses...Jack Knight is a hero of the Superman and Hal Jordan (Silver Age Green Lantern) vein - motivated to do good because it is right to do so. At first, it is a fight for survival and a reluctant duty, but by the end of this collection, we begin the see little hints that perhaps - just perhaps - he's beginning to enjoy his new-found role.Jack is also the most human of all the DC heroes...not only do we see his heroic role, but with later books, we see more of his personal life than those of other heros...not just his relationships with women, but his day-to-day interactions. While he fights, he enters a sort of Zen mode and his thoughts often wander to other things in his life - usually to aspects of his job and hobby as a junk/collectibles dealer and scout. At love with the past but comfortable with the present (althought a little nervous about the future), our man Jack is a person whom I believe many of us would like to be, if only for a short while. His easy-going nature lends an air of light to his earthbound side, and his concrete sense of responsibility is tempered with a good sense of humor. He is a contemporary person. And he is a human being, first and foremost. Jack also has (as you will see in later volumes) a bit of the old hero in his makeup - a Knight clad in black leather jacket and night-vision goggles as opposed to the traditional armor.In this first volume, we are introduced to the relationships within the Knight family and some of the histories which have caused a strain on the family ties. We are also introduced to The Mist and his family, and by the conclusion, we see the creation of who I feel to the most devastatingly cunning and psychotically diabolical villian in DC's current lineup - Nash, the new Mist. In addition, the rest of the cast and company begins to take shape in the form of Shade and the O'Dare family of law enforcers.Robinson's writing is top-notch, as usual, with flowing dialogue and engaging internal monologues. However, it is the artwork of Harris and the inking of von Grawbadger that hooked me in initially. Creating an odd balance between the portrait-like &quot;realism&quot; of other mainstream comics and the linear art-deco sense of the &quot;Batman&quot; animated series, Harris and Grawbadger blaze new ground in sequential art by bold use of shade, line, and angle. The faces are unusually expressive, and the lack of muscular exagerration is wonderfully refreshing and adds a sense of humanism to the characters (in a later volume, Harris' depiction of Batman is wonderfully &quot;ordinary&quot; - a regular-looking guy in a Batman outfit).&quot;Sins of the Father&quot; is a wonderful start to the Jack Knight &quot;Starman&quot; years. At the time of this writing, Robinson is preparing to hand the Starman mantle to a new hero, but, for this moment, sit back and let Opal City surround you as Jack shines a new light onto the medium of the monthly superhero comic."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"Re-reading Sins of the Father (the first of the many Starman collections), I'm struck by what a jerk Jack Knight is. Yeah, he's not a typical hero. He has a smart-mouth, and I remember when collecting view-master reels, old t-shirts and records were far more important to Jack than fighting crime. But it's amazing just how much he did grow up in the series.Starman is about many things. It's about a man -- Jack Knight, son of a retired superhero, brother to a hero that's just been murdered. It's about the Starman legacy -- not just through the Knight family but the unrelated heroes who have used that name. It's about Jack's home Opal City, a city which doesn't exist on any real world map but with in a few pages, becomes a real as any city you know. It's about the junk that Jack collects. Little snippets of history. Dealing his father's greatest enemy who is out for revenge, Jack has to put aside his junk collecting business and fight crime. And deal with the far worse emotional burden of Jack coming to terms with his own family.For decades, Starman was pretty much a cypher. A costume, a &quot;cosmic rod&quot; (or gravity rod, as it was once known) and very little else. But within this collection, writer James Robinson and artist Tony Harris have given the Knights a history, home and supporting cast as rich as Batman or Spider-Man.Yes, there's lots of action. But the real heart of the story is emotional. Jack is a very real character, his concerns and feelings are true to life -- even if you or I can't fly.The shadowed, angular, highly stylish and stylized art of Tony Harris perfectly complements this story.Jack Knight doesn't wear his father's red and green tights. He favours antique WW II anti-flare googles and a worn leather jacket decorated with a Crackerjack sheriff's badge and an zodiac star design. Jack's a very modern guy, but one obsessed with things of the past. (Although oddly he intially rejects his own personal history.) This book charts a new direction, but also celebrates superheroics.So, I think it will appeal to those who both hate and love superheroes."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"Almost everyone in comics got the wrong message from &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns.&quot; Rather than learning that superhero comics could be about more than adolescent fantasies they simply embraced the violence of those books and created comics that catered to a darker set of adolescent fantasies than the old Superman or Spiderman comics did. Comics didn't grow up; they just went from being geeks to juvenile delinquents.I say almost everyone because there are a few notable exceptions where people have written superhero comics for grown ups, or to use Neil Gaiman's words comics that are &quot;about something&quot; (about something other than muscles, spandex, and maiming and killing &quot;evil doers&quot; that is). Kurt Busiek of course, and strangely enough Alan Moore himself are the examples everyone knows about. Unfortunately, James Robinson's work often falls between the cracks, and that is a shame, because &quot;Starman&quot; is a comic that is truly about something.Aptly enough a good bit of what the comic is about is growing up. Early in the series Knight mocks things like family, duty, and honor, but Jack coming to embrace those things as well as responsibility is the heart of the whole series. Spiderman and Superman are great metaphors for adolescence, &quot;Starman&quot; is a story about coming out of a prolonged adolescence. Jack Knight isn't an obsessed Rorschach or Batman driven by internal demons in a near psychotic quest for vengeance. Rather, he's a self-centered hipster who gets in the superhero racket out of duty, family oligations, and loyalty to his beloved home town.But really I make it sound all stodgy and positively 19th century Prussian, and it isn't. As well as being about something the series is a lot of fun. Robinson clearly loves all those old guys in tights and all the baggage that goes with them, but in his hands it really isn't baggage. You get explosions, evil plots, crime waves, superhero team ups, and everything you expect in comics, but you get meaning too. On top of that Robinson has a knack for creating characters and enough attention to detail to bring them to life. The O'Dares could have degenerated to Irish-cop stereotypes, the Shade a mere metropolitan killer, or Knight a hipster with superpowers, but none of them did. They all seem like living breathing people, and that's not something you can say for characters on a good many acclaimed television shows.&quot;Starman&quot; was one of the best comics of the 90's and the best place to start is at the beginning."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"The is a perfect example of great collaboration. Writer and artists work together to create a sum which is greater than the parts. Character development is equally weighted with action and plot. If anything there might actually be too much emphasis on Jack Knight's reluctance to play the hero. But that's a minor quibble. There's a great balance between Jack as a regular guy: brother, son, and small businessman; and Jack as Starman: soaring through the beautifully depicted skies of Opal City and mixing it up with the bad guys.Opal City looks fantastic, and is a distinctive environment for Starman to flourish. Robinson and Harris have created their own world here, separate from our own. Opal City works on a similar level as Astro City works for Kurt Busiek's excellent series, and Gotham works for Batman. There are several panels where Opal City is featured, without the benefit of any of the stories' characters. This effectively enhances the impact and depth of the Starman saga.The initial story arc included in this collection is phenomenal, introducing us to Jack and presenting his origin as Starman. The middle bits, including a few intriguing epilogues and prologues, hint at larger story arcs to be pursued in later collections. The final story detailing an encounter between the two brothers is both entertaining and insightful. I look forward to reading the second installment in this series of graphic novels."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"Starman, written by James Robinson,with art by Tony Harris, Peter Snejbjerg and others, details the exploits of Jack Knight, the son of the aging 1940's Starman, as he struggles with the family business, his personal business and Knight's Past, his, um, business business. It's got science, mystery, romance, cowboys, pirates, and some of the most pure heroism that was presented in the grim and shallow world of 1990's comics. This is one of those great series, Sandman-style, which is loved by comic and non-comic readers alike. This is where I first saw the pencils of Ex Machina artist Tony Harris. I had such a man crush on this creative team, when I met them at a convention in 1996 I giggled Japanese schoolgirl style and averted my eyes. I palpitate at the thought! James Robinson complimented me on my shirt, which I had cleaned especially for the occasion. This is the comic that made me love DC comics, made me embrace my inner collector, and kept me returning to the comic store."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"I grew up reading Marvel Comics. Time was when comics meant seeing characters in colourful costumes spouting macho nonsense and punching each other out. This book here showed me otherwise. And introduced me to new worlds of reading and the imagination!The original Starman is Theodore (Ted) Knight. He appeared in comics around 1941. This here story, however, is about his sons, David Knight and Jack Knight. David inherited his father's costume and took over the family superhero business. Jack is cynical about his roots and moved on to become a junk-peddler! An old nemesis of the Starman, the Mist, shows up with his own children and waged war on the Knights - injuring Ted and killing David. Jack is then forced to reluctantly take up his father's mantle.This first volume of the Starman paperbacks help the reader get into the setting of Opal City (beautifully designed in an art deco style by artist Tony Harris) and its many residents - the Knight family, the O'Dare family of cops, the Shade, the Mist family, a fortune teller, etc. The reader does not need any background knowledge of Golden Age comics to enjoy this - although, like me, you may want to track down the old comics in the Archive Editions just to get more into the history of it all. After all, Starman is ultimately about history. History and family. This is, to me, the most human comic in the world. You'll laugh and cry with the Knights. And you'll grow with Jack. And speaking of Jack...James Robinson has done an absolutely amazing job creating Jack Knight. In many ways, James IS Jack - and in other sense, we all are Jack (we, as in, all those who grew up in from the materialistic '80s into the cynical '90s). Jack is about finding the old values without looking campy or sounding corny. Jack is about making being a hero without necessarily having to wear spandex. Jack is about clinging on to everything you love - whether it be junk or family legacy. Finally, Jack is about romance - the romance of chivalry and standing up for what's right.Read this book.

As the title suggests, the theme of this series is \\"family\\". David dons the cape in hopes of winning his father's approval, while Jack is driven more by a sense family obligation. Jack Knight is a modern anti-hero - a dealer in 20th century antiques who finds himself thrust into a role he never wanted. The theme of family is re-inforced by the introduction of the O'Dares (a tight-knit family of police officers) and even the villains: the Mist and his revenge-hungry progeny.To his credit, Robinson does a fine job of linking this modern Starman to the past without being tied down by it. The older generation of heroes and villains get their fair share of panels, dialogue and even action, without stealing the focus away from the youngsters. Longtime fans of the character will be pleased to note the brief but pithy references to the \\"other\\" Starmen of the past, bringing them into continuity as well. As a storyteller, Robinson favors a lot of exposition, often waxing poetic about the Shade's beloved Opal City, or Jack's fascination with the kitchy curios of a bygone era.After the main story arc (a dark tale of family and murder and vengeance) we get a day-in-the-life story, followed by a visit from beyond the grave. On the art side, I think I like Harris' pencils more than the inks and colors, which tend towards the dark and clunky. So overall, this is a thoroughly satisfying work and I heartily recommend it, but despite the series' stellar reputation, this opening volume is no great revelation. Four and half stars."},{"Title":"Starman: Sins of the Father (Book 1)","review":"'Starman' is the adult's super-hero; not because it's filled with gratutious nudity, violence or swearing (which it isnt, of course) but because it's story deals with themes that sometimes feel out of place in a super-hero comic. First off, it's hero refuses to wear a brightly colured costume, opting more for an outfit thats functional (he wears leather jacket because the air is too cold when flying). It's these elements that make 'Starman' and original and interesting read. Its 'reluctant hero' themes or ones that are used often in other books, but not as well as they are here. I really enjoyed reading about these characters, all well written and full of depth. This is a great book for comic fans looking for something a little different."},{"Title":"Terence: Eunuchus (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)","review":"I am a Classical Studies Major at the University of Houston. This book really helped me on translating this ancient Roman comedy. The notes help you with Latin slang and phrases that would probably not be in a standard Latin-English dictionary. It also helps the reader understand what is happening ( especially in regards to stage direction) since it is indeed difficult to read an ancient play which was really intended to be acted out, not read. It was a really great help."},{"Title":"Terence: Eunuchus (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)","review":"This is a review of John Barsby's commentary on Terence's Eunuchus. I made use of this book as I was preparing for a PhD examination in Latin Literature, and I found Barsby's commentary especially helpful in allowing me to read the play smoothly and efficiently. Like other exceptionally good entries in the \\"Cambridge green and yellow\\" series, this commentary does an excellent job of anticipating and addressing the reader's questions about obscure vocabulary and syntax. In particular, Barsby's clear explanations and felicitous renderings of instances of colloquial language mitigate what are inevitably the most vexing stumbling blocks to a new or, in my case, unpracticed reader of ancient comedies. The layout of the commentary, although dense, is easy to follow, with each line or series of related lines being given its own indented paragraph.Barsby's commentary also includes extended analyses of each scene that can run up to several pages long. These mini-essays discuss the logistics of staging the scene, to what extent the characters on stage conform to or differ from stock archetypes, how Terence has gone about adapting the scene from his source material, and so forth. Barsby discusses these and other such issues in the line-by-line portion of the commentary as well, and he also includes discussion where appropriate of relevant bibliographic resources, textual problems, parallels with Plautine or other Terentian comedies, the commentary of Donatus, and metrical anomalies. At the end of the commentary there is a fairly thorough appendix on meter, and there is also an appendix that collects and translates the few extant fragments of Menander's Kolax and his Eunouchos, the Greek source material from which Terence has adapted this play.For a Cambridge green and yellow, this commentary is exceptionally long and detailed. The Eunuchus is about 1100 lines long, and Barsby provides over 200 pages of commentary in fairly small print, in addition to a 30 page introduction, the appendices, and a 12 page bibliography. Overall, then, this book provides a very complete picture of how the Eunuchus works and how it fits into Terence's oeuvre and into the genres of Greek and Roman New Comedy more generally. I think, too, that this book would work well as an introductory text to ancient comedy and that, on the whole, it would be accessible to anyone with at least 2 or 3 years of Latin. Of the play itself, I should add that I found it remarkably sophisticated and consistently entertaining, having a rich and varied array of characters, plot-lines, and delicacies of language that certainly merit the attention Barsby has given them."},{"Title":"De Fun Dont Done Les Norton","review":"In this book the author once again introduces the reader to Les Norton who appears in most of Barrett's books. Les works as a doorman (read \\"bouncer\\") in a Casino owned by a criminal. As usual Les finds hismself in all manner of predicaments which he manages to escape from. Les Norton's Life would have to be every Ausralian man's (aussie bloke's) Ultimate Fantasy. He drives expensive luxury cars, always wins whenever he is in a fight, always manages to 'hook up' with the best looking girl and is never impotent in bed no matter how much he has had to drink and of course, he never suffers from a hangover!!! I give this book 5 stars because Mr. Barrett has succeeded in writing about the same guy who is a figment of his imagination and bears no resemblance to any Australian man.Why on Earth Les has Legendary Cult Status in Queensland is a total mystery to me."},{"Title":"Secure Electronic Commerce: Building the Infrastructure for Digital Signatures and Encryption","review":"This book is great at understanding the major components of a Public Key Infrastructure and the surrounding issues. You certainly would not walk away being able to set up a PKI, but you would be able to discuss it intelligently. If you are trying to come up to speed on PKI, this is the book for you. The subject is too big to cover everything in one book; so, I would also recommend picking up some more books that look at security issues specifically. One recommendation is E-Commerce Security by Ghosh."},{"Title":"Secure Electronic Commerce: Building the Infrastructure for Digital Signatures and Encryption","review":"Highly recommended - This is still the best intro book I've seen on PKI. Precisely and clearly written. Can't wait for the second edition, though, as this edition is getting a bit dated."},{"Title":"Secure Electronic Commerce: Building the Infrastructure for Digital Signatures and Encryption","review":"Ford and Baum do a great job explaining the ins and outs of public key infrastructures, covering both the technical and non-technical (legal, administrative, financial, etc.) issues with clarity and insight. Chapters 6 and 7 are especially worthwhile for those looking at the latest IETF PKIX standards."},{"Title":"Secure Electronic Commerce: Building the Infrastructure for Digital Signatures and Encryption","review":"I purchased this book for my class and its good enough where I didn't sell it back. Its not to highly detail but give a good primer on the subject. Well worth the read but I would recomend buying it used if you just need it for a class. Actually I would buy it used for all needs."},{"Title":"Secure Electronic Commerce: Building the Infrastructure for Digital Signatures and Encryption","review":"A very well organized and useful reference text regarding encryption na dcertificates. I was pleased at the singling out of PG and its differences versus other X509 standards."},{"Title":"To Love and Honour","review":"Set in London in the 1920's, Tess and Amy are housemaids for a wealthy family. Theire one escape from the drudgery of everyday life is the cinema. Together, they dream of being the heroines, sweot off their feet by handsome heros. Amy, large and plain looking (at least in her eyes) doubts this will ever happen to her, especially with the skinny, goregous Tess about.One day, a man approached them, and changes their lives forever. This is a love story with quite a few twists and turns in it. Tess is also anorexic."},{"Title":"Dear old Kit;: The historical Christopher Carson,","review":"This is a readable and scholarly work that should be part ofthe library of anyone who is an aficionado of the Old West. This bookexplained to me not only who Kit Carson was, but why he was significant. Although the author makes a good case for why Carson can be considered a hero, he also doesn't shy away from commenting on the man's mistakes. The biography seemed thoughtful, balanced, clear, concise, and thoroughly researched. Moreover, this book is particularly special because, in addition to the author's biography, it contains the complete text of Kit Carson's own autobiography, along with biographer Carter's helpful annotations to it. There are also some photos giving the biography and autobiography an added dimension. Two more points: Carson's life is exciting-- he was a mountain man, an explorer, a scout, a cavalry officer, and more! Also, this biography is only about ten years old, so you know that Carter is basing his inferences on fairly reliable, up-to-date research! All in all, I'd say that whether you're a novice or an expert on the subject, if you had to read or own just one book about Kit Carson, this should be it."},{"Title":"Dear old Kit;: The historical Christopher Carson,","review":"Kit Carson is one of my favorite historical figures and this is my favorite book about him. Carter republishes and annotates Carson's laconic autobiography of adventures as a fur trapper, mountain man, indian fighter, soldier, and explorer. Carson went from being an illiterate saddlers's apprentice in 1825 to one of the famous men in America by the end of his life in 1868. A small, unprepossessing man, he never learned to read or write, never made any money, and was modest, even ashamed of his fame. Arguably, Carson lived through more adventures than anyone else in American history.Carter admires his subject which is good because Kit Carson is sometimes portrayed these days as a monstrous genocidiare because of his role in defeating the Navajos and forcing them to move to a reservation on which many of them died. In reality, Carson was a relatively humane soldier who often defended the rights of the Indians and who became a good agent on their behalf. But, unlettered and overly impressed by the authority, judgments, and education of his superiors, Carson didn't possess the moral courage and confidence to challenge his orders to suppress the Navajos.Carter's research into Carson's life is thorough. He employs the unusual technique of publishing Carson's autobiography as written and commenting on it in extensive footnotes. Some might find this irritating as your eyes must move from text to footnote constantly. Carter also publishes a large collection of photographs of Carson, examines his fame, and extolls his virtues.To my mind, Kit Carson is the premier hero of the western expansion of the U.S. Carter's book is one of the most accurate and well-researched accounts of Carson's remarkable life."},{"Title":"Dear old Kit;: The historical Christopher Carson,","review":"Dear Old Kit: The Historical Christopher Carson, is without a doubt a must read for anyone interested in Kit Carson. It is thorough, entertaining, and true to the greatest western scout in American history."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Another great book from Adriana Trigiani! I always love going back to Big Stone Gap. This book was poignant and showed the reader how it can be so hard to be a mom and watch your little girl grow up. I recommend it to any Big Stone Gap fan!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"The continuation of the Big Stone Gap story finds Ave Maria with a maturing daughter and maturing friends. This was better than the second book, more fun, faster pace. Predictably we are left with the opening of yet another book. They must be read in order. I'm looking forward to the next!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Adriana Trigiani hits another home run with this 3rd installment in the Big Stone Gap novels. Actually the first and third were better than the middle novel, Big Cherry Holler. In Milk Glass Moon, Ave Maria and Jack go from parents of a pre pubescent to parents of a full grown woman and discover their love for each other is still going strong. Ave and Jack weather teen angst, breast cancer in their inner circle, the return of some old flames, and the question of \\"what to do with the second half of our lives.\\" Somehow by the end of the novel, the reader knows that no matter what Ave and Jack decide to do with the next 50 years, they will still be together and still be happy. Milk Glass Moon lets us revisit some of our favorite characters from the series and ends just at the right moment. No hanging on too long to become insipid and boring. Trigiani spins a great tale that fans of the series will want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"The first 2 books were great! I couldn't wait for Milk Glass.Maybe my expectations were too high. There wasn't much of a story line in this one. It was just day to day. No big news or anything to keep the pages turning. It was still a pleasant read, and easy to follow but it just lacked the impact of the other 2 books. I'm still a fan and can't wait for Trigiani's next."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I was very sorry for this book to end..It made me laugh and cry.Jack Mac and Ave life's are just beginning, I hope that the author continues to write about them...I see grandchildren, a new career. Lots of joy and pain to come. I only wish that I was just beginning the books..."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"This is the third and final (?) installment in Trigiani's series about the people of Big Stone Gap and the MacChesney family. The second book was an unrealistic portrayal of life after the death of a child, but in this third book, Trigiani really hits home with her central theme of mother/daughter conflict during the teenage years. She knows her stuff and paints a compelling portrait of a family adjusting to the fact that their little girl is growing up.This book ends with all the characters having completed 180 degree turns on their lives. Will this be the last we hear from the residents of Big Stone Gap?"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Loved - loved this series of books by Trigiani. Well written, good story and believable characters. Read them in order. Her other books are excellent as well."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I fell in love with the Northern Virginia hills and valleys. Loved the characters and the humor. Big Stone Gap is a real town that is struggling with lots of change, but held together by love."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"After reading book one, Big Stone Gap, it was a treat to be able to continue to follow the lives of the characters. Trigiani paints a great picture of not only the town of Big Stone Gap, but also makes the characters come alive."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Although they aren't great fiction, the Big Stone Gap stories are entertaining and easy to read. I must admit, however, that I do find the technique of writing in the present tense to be somewhat annoying.There is one error in \\"Milk Glass Moon\\" which I feel compelled to correct: The pasta dish the group was served when they first arrived in Florence was most definitely NOT pasta puttanesca, which is a tomato-based sauce supposedly created by Neopolitan prostitutes (hence the name). What they appear to have been eating was pasta carbonara (eggs, pancetta, parmesan cheese). And by the way, whatever happened to Jack's passion for cooking and opening an Italian restaurant?"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Milk Glass Moon written by Adriana Trigiani is book three of a triology in the Big Stone Gap series, (Big Stone Gap, Big Cherry Hollar and Milk Glass Moon). This book takes us six years further into the lives of Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney and her family and friends.All of the characters that we loved in the previous books are growing up or matured and their character is coming out well in this book. The mother/daughter relationship is strong in this book, as Ave Maria doesn't want to let going of the little girl that is now maturing, her daughter is facing her first love and mother is experiencing heartbreak.This book is about life through Ave Maria's eyes, in the Southwestern part of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia with all of the flavor of that small town distilled into this book making it a wild ride throgh the emotional roller coaster.With twist and turns woven into the main story we learn what's happening to Ave Maria's friends, Iva Lou, Pearl Grimes, Theodore Tipton, Jack Mac, and Fleeta. With humor, you will laugh along with the characters as life in Big Stone Gap is changing.You'll love reading the book as the narrative is simple but very effective and you can imagine the characters in your mind as you read on, making this book engaging. There is drama, mountain wisdom along ith a sprinkle of humor and romance all rolled into a very well told story."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Readers of Adriana Trigiani's first two books in this trilogy, Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Holler, certainly have a great deal to look forward to when they pick up and read Milk Glass Moon. What reader wouldn't enjoy another visit to this mountain town in West Virginia, which the author describes so beautifully and fills with such vivid characters and events. And if by chance you read this book without realizing it's the third installment in a series, you have the added pleasure of being able to go back and savor the first two books putting all of the pieces in the puzzle together.At the beginning of Milk Glass Moon, which refers to what Jack's grandfather described as a smoky, hazy moon, life is pretty much the same for Ave Marie and Jack MacChesney. Their marriage is a good and fulfilling one after several years and they look forward to the future together. Ave Marie continues to work in the pharmacy she once owned while Jack is busy with his construction company. Rounding out their lives is their daughter, Etta, a bright and adventurous 13 year old who is bound to turn Ave Marie's hair gray. But life really never stays the same and once again Ave Marie is faced with new challenges in her life as well as the changes in her friends lives. Once again, we get to spend time with Ave and her beloved mountain friends from the first two books. Theodore Tipton, the former marching band leader who suddenly moves to New York City, Peter Rutledge who Ave Marie first met in Italy five years ago, Iva Lou, the brash and sexy book -mobile driver, Fleeta, the grouchy but big hearted employee of the pharmacy, Spec the paramedic Ave Marie used to work with and Ave Marie's large family in Italy. But ultimately it is the relationship between Ave Marie and Etta which Trigiani explores as Etta marches into adolescence and love.This is an old fashioned book with old fashion ideals about family, friends, unconditional love and loyalty. As Ms. Trigiani wrote so eloquently about love and marriage in Big Cherry Holler, this time the author writes beautifully about the pains of motherhood and children growing up. The saying that \\"we give our children roots and wings\\" is never demonstrated better than it is within the pages of this book. This is a wonderful book and evidence of why the first two books have captured so many reader's hearts and imaginations. Although the author hasn't said definitively that this is the end of the series, I for one am hoping that she will continue to amuse us with the antics of the people both of Big Stone Gap and Italy. If not I'll be rereading this trilogy for some time to come."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"The third book in the Big Stone Gap Series, life with Ave and Jack Mac continues like a slow sun rising over the mountains. The love and warmth of the people that we have come to know and care for, their trials and tribulations, life and death, it is all here in the Holler.In this book we find Etta to be a blossoming teen with a mind of her own, and mom (Ave) has some hard won lessons to learn. This book spans several years and the road gets rocky at times, even down right hard to swallow, but our characters trudge on to the rewards that lie in wait around the corner. Ave comes to terms with the love, and men in her life and finds balance and peace in doing so.The author left this book open in a way that leaves the reader to believe that another book might be on the way. I will be on the look out for more of this authors talented writing and heartwarming characters. Kelsana 8/7/02"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Adriana Trigiani is truly a wonderful and masterful storyteller and I certainly hope this isn't the last visit we have to Big Stone Gap. I have fallen in love with all characters from hip sexpert Iva Lou, to crusty but loveable Fleeta not to mention late-bloomer, Ave Maria and the love of her life, Jack Mac. When I startred this book, I felt like I was taking a walk through Cracker's Neck Holler getting reaquainted with everyone, I felt welcomed back into the fold, that I missed everyone and I was anxious to see what they had been up to.This book tells the story of the struggle between Ave Maria and her her now teenage daughter, Etta. Ave struggles of course with what every mother struggles with and that is letting go. Etta can be rebellious at times and is struggling to find her own way in the world and it is Etta's father, Jack Mac that seems to understand this better than Ave, who, throughout the course of this heartwarming, spirited novel is forced to learn a lesson or two from her daughter and all the people in this close-knit community that love her.This novel, as well as the other two books in this series has something for everyone: The characters are extremely well-drawn and lively, the romance is timeless, one sentence can make you laugh wholeheartedly while the next breaks your heart. And for those who like adventure, Milk Glass Moon transports us from the mountains of Virginia to the Tuscan countryside and the Italian Alps for a visit once again with Ave's family.I am very sad to see this book and the series end, but I look forward to anything else written by Ms. Trigiani. For those who have not yet discovered this talented author, pick up Big Stone Gap, Big Cherry Holler, and Milk Glass Moon and READ THEM!!! they are better than a five star rating can say and should not be missed!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Adriana Trigiani's Milk Glass Moon is a return home for fans of the first two books in the Big Stone Gap trilogy. Ms Trigiani skillfully allows her characters to age and their relationships to develop, leaving the readers to feel as if we have come to know them as friends. Ave Maria , her husband Jack, and her daughter Etta remain the main characters, and we are also able to follow the stories of Pearl, Fleeta, Theodore Tipton, Spec and the rest of the quirky characters who reside in this small town.An overall theme of the book is growth -- Etta is growing up and Ave is growing comfortable with the choices she has made in her life. Along with growth comes change, and Ave's struggles with the changes in her life are poignantly depicted.I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Big Stone Gap and Big Cherry Holler, and if you have not read those yet, you have a treat ahead of you!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Big Stone Gap is populated by a basket full of basket cases, a host of eccentric residents who make for good tales told by story-teller A. Trigiani. In this final installment of her trilogy, it feels at the outset that heroine Ave Maria Mulligan MacChesney is finally on the right track. But if that's the case, there's no story - so of course Ave is wrong, and more adventures lie in wait. This time it's mostly mother/adolescent daughter Etta angst, and we watch as not only Etta matures toward independence, but also Ave, as she \\"redreams\\" her future and tentatively heads down yet another path on the map of Life.Earthy wisdom, wacky characters, and a good story await readers."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"A week before reading this book, Adriana Trigiani &quot;visited&quot; one of my book club's meetings via a phone conference. It was an outstanding experience speaking with her about Big Stone Gap. By the time I read Milk Glass Moon, I was sold on her writing.This book completes the Big Stone Gap trilogy in a warmly satisfying way. According to Adriana, the first book was about asking and answering &quot;Who am I?&quot;; Big Cherry Holler is about asking, &quot;Now that I have some answers, why do I keep making the same mistakes over again?&quot;; and Milk Glass Moon is about the idea of letting go and redefining our lives. The book covers Etta's years from age 12 to 18, a span any parent would find challenging. Naturally, one of the big concerns is Etta and Ave Maria's relationship. Because this is a situation all mothers can identify with, it is easy to see oneself in the book. Etta, like all daughters, grows up whether or not Ave Maria feels she's done enough to guide her, or whether or not Ave agrees with her decisions. As father, Jack Mac is much more objective in accepting that Etta is growing up. Etta, after all, is not Ave, and yet ironically, what she chooses for herself shows that she's quite self-aware. What Ave sees as a contradiction, Etta is able to explain perfectly soundly, if not logically. No character is static in this novel; each has an opportunity to &quot;let go&quot; or to &quot;redefine&quot; his/her life. Iva Lou lets go of what she's always believed is her fundamental self-image when she's stricken ill. Ave faces the sudden letting go of her friend and co-worker Spec Broadwater. Pearl, too, a far different character from the insecure high school girl she was in B.S.G., redefines her life. Even the cantankerous Fleeta Mullins' rough edges soften a bit. Most importantly, Jack and Ave Maria's relationship is cemented in this book, as Ave becomes truly secure in her happiness with him, and he proves to be a risk taker willing to redefine the direction their lives will take now that they are in (yes!) their 50's. It's been heartwarming reading the trilogy. Adriana proves that the big passages in life are universal, happening in the small towns of America such as Big Stone Gap, as well as in those nestled in the Italian Alps. I look forward to more from Adriana Trigiani!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Ave Maria and the gang are back for another story of life in Big Stone Gap. This time things have changed and people have grown up.Ave Maria and Jack have been married for many years and there daughter Etta is growing up faster then Ave Maria wants to accept.

Iva Lou is back and she is having to look at things in different light when she gets some bad news.This last book in this series was wonderful, I loved how Ave Maria, Etta, Fleeta, Pearl, Jack and the entire gang grew up and how things changed in Big Stone Gap and many other places. I wish that there would be more books about this family because I really love reading about the good people in Big Stone Gap."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I've been waiting for months for the third book in the Big Stone Gap series to be published, and it was well worth the wait! This is the best of the three. I love reading about Ave and Etta's mother/daughter relationship, and the pain and pleasures it brings. I feel at times this story is my life! I laughed, I cried and I never wanted it to end!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Reading the last book in the Big Stone Gap trilogy felt like coming home. I loved everything about it - all my favorite characters and that nice comfy feeling you get when turning pages was there. I couldn't have asked for a better way to end the story.This time around the novel focus mainly on Ave Maria trying to raise her daughter, Etta. The story spans about six years and so we get a nice glimpse into what Ave Maria goes through when trying to rear Etta through her teenage years. And of course, Big Stone Gap wouldn't be complete without cantankerous Fleeta Mullins, Ave's help at the Mutual Pharmacy; all of Ave's wonderful family from across the pond; as well as one of my favorites, Iva Lou Wade Makin, who has a struggle all her own.Chock full of homespun humor and as comforting as a warm glass of milk, Milk Glass Moon was everything I expected it to be. I feel sad to say good-bye to all my wonderful friends at Big Stone Gap, but the ending of the book left me with such a nice feeling. I highly recommend this trilogy to readers. Thank you, Adriana, for this awesome gift."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"How is it possible that I can relate even more to every one of these books in this series? This one was about parenting and I can't even begin to say how much it touched me. It reminded me of how I parented my son and never realized what it really looked like. Ave was the type of mother I am and it was scary.Emotions always run deep in these stories, well, in all her books, but she does it so well. I can't even say enough, except these books, all her books, are must reads."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I am Italian so I loved reading all her books . I feel like I learned so much from reading her books. And yes I would and have told so many people to read this and all her books."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I love all the characters in this book. Because Trigiani lets you get to know the characters so well, you get a feel for Big Stone Gap's smallness. Ave Maria is such a lovable character that you're always on her side, understanding where she's coming from. I liked this book, but I have two issues with it: One, Ave Maria is compared to Jack Mac and comes off looking like a crazy woman even when I think she's in the right. When her teenage daughter comes home drunk in Italy, Jack just shrugs it off. \\"Well, at least she made it home and was with an adult. She's sorry. Oopps. Oh well.\\" Maybe there are parents that wouldn't find it a big deal, but I found Jack's nonchalant attitude a little unbelievable. Two, Etta grew up so fast! One minute she's 12 and just a kid and then there are huge jumps in time and oh, four years have passed with no commentary. It made the book feel a little rushed.This entire series {and writer} is really fantastic. Plus, she always writes about Italy and Italians, which I love. She's able to write entertaining stories without coming off as an airhead, chick-lit writer. Not that I don't like those kind of books...."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"This series was recommended by a friend and on the Today Show. It took me a minute to get into this first book. It definately picked up in the middle to end. The 2nd in the series was the best!! The characters evolve and the story line heats up. Definately worth getting through the first. I became attached in the 2nd book and read straight through all 4 in a matter of 2 months. Couldn't put them down. I have also heard the author has written the screenplay and will be directing the movie sometime soon. Looking forward to seeing the story unfold on the big screen.

In the first two books I really loved her character and her choices in life. This time I wanted to shake her more than once. Instead of the strong character from the first two books she seemed whiney and even shrewish at times, especially within her relationship to her teenaged daughter. I also felt he book seemed rushed, going through years with the turn of a page.That said I still enjoy the eccentric characters, and the beautiful descriptions, especially of Italy. And I love Jack Mac, Ave's true blue husband; even though I think his appearances here were mostly to calm down Ave after one of her outbursts.Not as good as the first two, but still gets extra points for bringing me on another trip to Big Stone Gap, which probably won't happen again, as it appears as if there is another book in the series it will be centered elsewhere."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I loved this book, but I am very partial to her books, as I think Adrianna is a wonderful author. This is a great addition to the Big Stone Gap series. I think there is another book after this,if so I will be sure to read it."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I have loved all of the Big Stone Gap Novels - \\"Milk Glass Moon\\" is the third in this series which will charm anyone who enjoys a kind of \\"down home\\" story, as we journey through life with Ave Maria, her husband,Jack, and their daughter, Etta, and all their friends in Big Stone Gap. I call this one of my \\"feel good\\" books (Please note, I feel the same way about Fannie Flagg's books) - you want to pack up and move to Big Stone Gap and be a part of their lives."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"After following the troubled MacChesney marriage in the second book, readers now focus on the adolescent Etta as she struggles with growing up. Her mother Ave Maria, too, has difficulty allowing her daughter this passage, especially after losing her toddler son Joe to leukemia.Yet, like her mother, Etta promises to become a strong young woman. This doesn't make the MacChesneys any easier, though, when longtime family friend Stefano Grassi comes to visit from Italy...This book is the second of the \\"Big Stone Gap\\" quartet; the fourth book is scheduled for release at the end of October 2006."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"Adriana Trigiani has tackled the basic themes of love, friendship, and marriage in the first 2 books of her Big Stone Gap series. In the third book, she brings back all of our favorite characters and shows us that they are always growing, changing, and evolving. The fact that Ave Maria's daughter Etta is growing into a young woman does not please her very much. She would like to \\"freeze\\" Etta into a little-girl mode, but Etta is too much her own person to allow this to happen. Jack seems able to except the changing person who is his daughter, but Etta has a hard time with it. She has envisioned a perfect life for her daugher which includes college, and eventual marriage and family. When Etta decides otherwise, Ave Maria has to accept the fact that her daugher is growing up. This book is the perfect ending to the trilogy, though it's hard to give up the delightful characters that populate these pages. The stories give us gentle laughs, but most of all they touch our hearts."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I just want to say that &quot;Milk Glass Moon&quot; was fantastic. As were all three Gap books. I too hope there will be more. I loved them all. I will miss all the characters including the ones in Italy. This is a great read, but please read the other two first. Hope to see more Gap books......"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"If this is the final book in the Big Stone Gap series, I will be disappointed. Ave Maria and Etta grows up over the years together. Etta resists her mother's attempts to make her over into a different person and Ave Maria resists the fact that her baby is growing up. It is a wonderful book about growing up, loving and learning to let go.All of the main characters are still in this book though they, too, have grown older. Iva Lou is still the loyal best friend though she undergoes a crisis of her own. Spec is still the crusty father-figure for Ave. Theodore is still the best friend, only now he lives in New York and happily in love. Fleeta is still the crusty woman who wows everyone with her baking skills. Pearl is still the young girl that Ave befriended, only she is married and has a child of her own. Jack is still Ave's husband and this time, the tension between them is not there. They too have grown up together over the years.This is a bittersweet story of friends and family growing together as a child comes of age. No matter where they are, the gorgeous mountains ~~ either of Gap Creek or of the Italy Alps ~~ are in the background. This book is more lyrically-written as if the author has come into her own and found her voice. It is a sweet novel ~~ one that makes you wish for more after the last page is turned. If this is the finale of the Big Stone Gap series, then it is worth every drop of tears I've shed on this one!10-3-03"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I adore the Big Stone Gap series, and wish there were more to look forward to. This third one was different than the previous two (what fun would it be if they were the same?), and had a different tone all together. A lot of it centers on Italy, and less on Big Stone Gap-- and I missed it. But all the same characters are there, and it is great to watch Ava Maria change and age, as well as her daughter. Lots of good surprises in the end."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"it didn't have that special something that Big Stone Gap did. I loved Big Stone Gap, liked Big Cherry Holler, but there was something missing in this one. There is nothing new or exciting here. New characters are introduced then not truly developed, the old ones don't get nearly as much attention. I just don't understand why Ave Maria doesn't make her break out of Stone Gap when she has the most stimulating conversation with Theodore than she's had for months at home and still feels like such an outsider. Surely a pharmacist could find work anywhere she would choose to. We are all set up to see Ave Maria and Jack Mac again, next time in Italy. Hopefully Adrianna Trigiani will be able to recapture the original magic of the first book again."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I absoltely loved this book as well as the first two in the series. Warm, heartfelt story that encourages you to live life to the fullest and to hold on to what you love with all your heart."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I took this book (audio version) on a drive through the Blue Ridge Mountains, as the subject matter seemed appropriate. What a disapointment! I have read the first two books, and thought they were OK but you can see the material (mostly fresh in the first book) getting staler and more tired with each outing.Same old characters...Ms. Trigiani kills off one character per book, I guess. She doesn't introduce any new or challenging characters. Everyone -- Iva Lou, Spec, Pearl, Jack Mac -- make an appearance with absolutely nothing new to say. Many old scenes are revisited to no point (Ave Maria and Pete headed back to the blue bell field).I think this is just a money machine now for the author. Anything charming or authentic to the locale has been sucked dry. The characters seem old and tired, without nothing new about them to explore.One thing nobody talks about with this series, which I think is a real cheat, is how in each book Ave Maria and family get to take, not one, but several incredibly long, expensive Italian vacations.In the real world, in the REAL Big Stone Gap, about how often do you think this happens? Most of the people in this region live modestly. Even a pharmacist wouldn't be rich by any means (and Ave gave up ownership of her store and house -- improbably in my view -- in the first book). Even with relatives, just the plane fare for all these trips would be a fortune and that's not taking into consideration that they aren't normal two week vacations but whole summers.Honestly, the only people who can do this -- time AND moneywise -- are...rich authors and screenwriters, like say...Adriana Trigiani.It certainly tells us NOTHING about real life in Southwestern Virginia, to hear that these lucky individuals get to take mindbending shopping trips in the Italian Alps every few pages.In the first book, it was maybe excusable as Ave had just reconnected with her Italian family. But to incorporate into every book seems forced, improbable and more like Ms. Trigiani is bragging about her own luxurious lifestyle than telling us anything remotely believeable about life in a unique and distinctive part of the US.Yes, I get it...it's a fantasy. But the charm of the first book was that it was a sweet fantasy that incorporated a very real and distinctive view of the Big Stone Gap region. If the characters flounce off to New York and the Italian Alps all the time, you might as well be reading Jackie Collins.Adrianna Trigianni, it's time to move on. You have some writing talent, now give up Ave and write about something else for a change."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"After reading all four books I realized that it bothered me concerning the story about Ave and Jack. It seems impossible to think that Ave would have just put the fact that her husband Jack would supposedly \\"Not have had made love\\" with Karen as stated in this book. Ave would NOT have reacted in the manner that was written in the books-not a normal reaction. I think it was a good book but also realize that nobody would have reacted like -neither of them- as written and if they did huh something must have been wrong with both parties especially with Ave. Now Jack is a simple man -very simple-and in the end Karen would and should have been his soul mate as Ave was to good for him and Pete turned out to be her soul mate. Jack wanted what to be first and foremost and instead of talking it out and trying to work things out he started looking around for someone else which is typical but to profess his love repeatedly to Ave before and after and then act like what he did is not love at all but selfish desire. Sorry the entire series leaves much to be desired. It simply is not normal for anyone to react like this and not believable. Also what bothered me was the fact Ave did a complete turnaround and started doting on Jack and only then was he happy! He acted like it was Ave's total fault in everything and WHY did she feel like it was anyway um they should have talked it out at some point. Again a very simple man! What woman would in their right mind would have reacted like that-I can't think of anyone-Can YOU?"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I've read the first two in the series. This book was a disappointment. There just wasn't much of a story ----- just a narrative without any real plot.I don't think I'll read the 4th in the series, after having to plod through this one."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I was disappointed by this book, the first (and last) one I have read by this author. As another reviewer said, there is little to no character development. The protagonist comes off as a shallow whiner who thinks her moronic pithy sayings pass for philosophy. I only finished the book because I paid too much for it On Kindle. I have a hard time knowing how books are priced on Amazon: too often I don't feel I get what I paid for. And then again, I have totally enjoyed older classics and books priced at less than a dollar!Anyway, it's unbelievable that this book got so many 4 and 5 star reviews? Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"I loved Big Stone Gap so much that when Big Cherry Holler came out I grab it without hesitation and enjoyed reading about the evolution of all the realtionships that I came to love in the first novel. BUT Milk Glass Moon is soooo boring I can barely keep my motivation to read it through to the end. Ave Maria is so annoying and still has all the same insecurities as the first novel. I thought that she resolved alot of her insecurities in Big Cherry Holler. Poor Jack Mac and Etta, they have to live with her. There were so many opportunities to turn this book around. With a focus on Jack or Etta and how they have dealt with living in the Gap, the loss of Joe or just living with Ave.Sorry to say, but I just can't recommend this book to anyone. The first and second novels were such hits but this one is such a miss. Please Ms. Trigianni end the series here before I forget why I loved your writing in the first place."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"The book arrived in perect condition and in a timely manner. i would order again."},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"In the third installation In the Big Stone Gap trilogy we arereunited with our beloved characters from Big Stone Gap, Virginia. After the long, winding road we took with Ave Maria and Jack Mac in Big Stone Gap, and the introspective look we got at the realities of their marriage 8 years later in Big Cherry Holler, Milk Glass Moon lets us into these treasured characters lives even deeper. This is another sequel that does not disappoint. The gang of favorite towns folk are back: Iva Lou, Pearl, Fleeta, Spec &amp; the like. Beginning four years after Big Cherry Holler leaves off, Ave Maria is experiencing the challenges of unchartered waters in the territory of motherhood. She's learning how to deal with a teenage daughter, Etta, who it seems has more in common with her father-..&quot;she's all Macchesney..&quot;As Ave struggles to form a bond with Etta, she must find a balance between trying to protect her daughter from the mistakes she made, and allowing Etta to be her own person.Milk Glass Moon maintains the charm that it's sister novels possessed, but opens the heart even deeper. You'll struggle through more of lifes twists and turns with the Big Stone Gap family and share more joys. Not only does Ave cope with learning to let go of the reign of motherhood, she is also forced to re-examine some old story lines with Pete Rutlidge and the effects this temptation has on her marriage. Ave also faces the changes time inevitably brings, as friends grow older and life as she has known it is being redefined. Trigiani's writing and gift for story telling continue to be magical. In Big Stone Gap she will make you fall in love with the town &amp; it's family. In Big Cherry Holler she lets you in to some heavier issues and the path that true love and years of marriage can find itself on. In Milk Glass Moon we see how years of struggles and triumphs work together to make the Big Stone Gap family who they are. We get some closure on some still unresolved issues and Trigiani's usual insightfulness on relationships and human frailties. I couldn't read this novel fast enough, but was sad when it was over. This is one reader who can't wait for more from Trigiani~"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"As in her previous Big Stone Gap novels, Adriana Trigiani's newest title offers more than just an update on the lives of Ave Maria, Jack Mac and their daughter Etta. It's a chance for us to dip into the lifestyle of small-town America (and Italy) and the sensual landscapes of the southwestern Virginia mountains as well as the Italian Alps. It's encounters with unique and sometimes eccentric individuals who, in spite of their quirks or problems, endear themselves to us when they show they care about the people around them. It's a study of changing relationships between parents and children, between best friends, even between good friends of opposite genders. It's also a search for a personal sense of place: finding the exact spot on Earth where you are supposed to live, what you're supposed to do, and who you're supposed to be doing it with. And the ending leaves the door open for further adventures._Milk Glass Moon_ is such an engaging and easy read that, if you've got the time, you can easily finish this book in just one sitting. But that's almost cheating yourself of being able to spend valuable time with these intriguing characters. Perhaps we should savor every moment.If Ms. Trigiani is scheduled to appear at a book signing near you, don't hesitate to go to see her.

Meanwhile, surprises emerge in the blossoming of crusty cashier Fleeta Mullins, the maturing of mountain girl turned savvy horsewoman Pearl Grimes, and the return of Pete Rutledge, the handsome stranger who turned Ave Maria's world upside down in Big Cherry Holler.This book is simply warm and wonderful and reminds us of what it was like 'down home.'"},{"Title":"Milk Glass Moon","review":"In this long awaited conclusion to the Big Stone Gap trilogy you will once again meet up with all your friends.

Ave and Jack Mack have come a long way in their marriage, and have settled into a life at the center of Big Stone Gap. Jack Mack has aspirations beyond Big Stone Gap, but Ave seems very comfortable in her current life. In this book, Etta goes through the teen years to graduate from college. These are tough years for Ave as she copes with a daughter who is nothing like her, but has all of the spirit and stubbornness of the MacChesney's. Even after all of these years, Ave's Italian heritage still sets her apart from the mountain people of Stone Gap, and she's not a \\"native\\" like her daughter and husband. During Etta's high school years, the family travels back to Italy, where Jack Mack hones his passion for cooking and Etta deepens her relationships with her Italian relatives. When Etta heads back to Italy after high school graduation by herself, she calls home with shocking news that changes Ave and Jack's lives forever.

Trigiani takes us from her daughter being 11 to 13, then it seems as though she rushes us through the book to marry off the daughter.

Buy it in the paperback version. A class I am taking requiresBookkeeping the Easy Way, a truly dated, confusing text. I read the sample pages of Schaum's Outline on Amazon's \\"Look Inside,\\" saw how helpful it was, and then got cheated by buying the Kindle edition.The Kindle format evidentially does not allow for tables and charts, so those are presented as embedded graphics, and this book has millions of them. These graphics are too small to read on my laptop, and vanishingly microscopic on my iPod. They can be enlarged on the iPod, which then requires tons of scrolling about the small display. When it becomes large enough to see, the resolution is too low to read easily.Worse, the graphics are clipped just as small as possible, likely to create a smaller electronic file. The text is shorn hard to the edges, without any margin. The failed assumption appears to be that it would make no difference, since the white background of the graphics would match invisibly with the white background of the Kindle. This neglects that, on PC and iPod, Kindle reader can display black or beige backgrounds, which are important to those of us with visual impairments or folks who want to read at night. With the black background of the Reader app so tightly skimming the black text of the graphics, the display is nearly impossible to read.Kindle is turning out to be a bit of a con. Sure, it's convenient for buyers and cheaper for publishers to distribute electronically, but with about a dozen Kindle books in my collection, not one is worth its money or even ready for distribution. Kindle books are riddled with spelling errors, improper hyphenation, and cheap-shot substitutes for proper tables. We would have been better off with something more like the plain text files of Project Guttenberg. At least those were honest about what they were. Amazon needs to proofread Kindle books, format them correctly, and enable all the features of the interface in every book.

It deals with cultures that arose across the globe -- so many prehistorical and ancient historical texts concentrate almost exclusively on the Fertile Crescent of five thousand years ago, to the exclusion of city cultures that arose in the Indus Valley, China, and the Americas.The first city cultures (from which our civilisation ultimately derives in large part) arose largely independently of each other, in what are present day Iraq, India, Egypt, China, and Central and South America. This book was a bit of a self-discovery trip for Wood, as he had hitherto concentrated primarily on British history (from whence I know his work), venturing only to the limits of Europe previously.Perhaps the Fertile Crescent of Iraq is highlighted both because it is the precursor of Semitic cultures (which give us Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, among many other things), but also because it was the first city culture to arise. All old cultures arose around rivers, for the sake of basic food necessity. In Iraq, there were agricultural settlements coalescing into cities as early as the seventh millennium BCE. These first settlement-builders were not Sumerian; they came later, about 4000 BCE, into an already-existing cultural structure. Who exactly the Sumerians were prior to this is still a mystery.'Their language has no known affinities with any language, living or dead. But new discoveries concerning Elamite, the ancient language of Persia, may hold the key to Sumerian origins.'Iraqi early cultures boasted the cities of Eridu (quite possibly the first city on earth), Ur, Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, and of course, Babylon. None of these ancient cities is still inhabited, mostly having been abandoned due to changes in the course of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. Sumer has been conquered and war-ravaged many times, most recently again in the 1990s.Indian history too is fascinating. The prehistory of India mostly went unknown until this century, when scholars began to take a serious look. While linguistic studies of Sanskrit have been going on for hundreds of years, it has only been in this century that the antiquity of Sanskrit and its place as a proto-language has been understood.The lost cities of the Indus show that there were people before the Aryans in the subcontinent, particularly with the discoveries of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa, and settlements occupying a space the size of western Europe, with extensive trade and culture. However, there was a period of about 1000 years in which there was no real urban culture in India, with the decline of the cities. Toward 600 BCE the Ganges and Jumna civilisations grouped in kingdoms, largely Aryan, began to arise. Hinduism and Buddhism are largely products of this process.China has a long, unbroken history. China was the last of the Old World civilisations to develop, nearly 1000 years after Iraq. The Chinese concepts of civilisation are very different from the West, and different from Indian, too. Cities began not as grouping for residence or trade or manufacture, but rather as royal enclosures surrounding the king, in which all the dichotomies of life were played out. This remained true to the days of the last emperor.Culture grew up around the Yellow and Yangtze rivers in China. Confucius was the great shaper of tradition, and China experienced a cultural advance unparalleled by the other Old World civilisation. In fact, China remained possibly the strongest power culturally and militarily on Earth until about the year 1000; only its relative isolation from all other powers kept them out of China's influence. China's self-centred decline in the past millennium allowed the Western cultures to surpass China.Egypt is discussed in terms of tradition of the pharoahs, city developments along the Nile, trade and literary achievements that are still fascinating today. The Pyramids are the only remaining of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Egypt had an unbroken pharoanic rule for nearly 3000, until the time of Alexander the Great, and the continuing dominance thereafter of European-based empires. Egypt in fact consists of two kingdoms, the upper and lower. Strong natural frontiers kept Egypt safe during its development. Perhaps the first true city was Hierakonpolis, in the upper kingdom, with settlements able to be traced back to 4500 BCE.In the Americas, Wood only really discusses the Central American cultures that arose around Mayan cities -- he does not do much work in the Peruvian/South American cultures. This is perhaps the one great flaw in the book. By 3000 BCE, there were settlements developing into cities in the Americas, but perhaps the first true cities was Teotihuacan, in Mexico. In 500 CE this may have been the largest city in the world, with 250,000 people. Independent of other cultures, they built pyramids and temples comparable to the Old World examples, a testament to the similarity of the human mind to response to the same symbolic ideas. Mayan culture spread throughout Central America as a result of indigenous efforts most likely, but Teotihuacan was a place of trade and pilgrimage and learning for these people.With the collapse of the Mayans, the Aztecs gained ascendancy in the older region around Teotihuacan. The Aztecs, given to bloody sacrificial rites, were perhaps the first civilisation to be exposed to the Old World orders, and the first to suffer conquest at their hands.Wood concludes with a chapter on exploration, conquest, investigation, research, and finally, some small understanding of the world which has been lost, but which generated ours."},{"Title":"Living WHI: Writings on Race, 2000-2005","review":"Robert Griffin's Living White offers solid reportage, analysis, and counsel for racially conscious American whites interested in effective thought and action on behalf of their beleaguered kind and country. Griffin, a professor of education at the University of Vermont, is that rarity: a knowledgeable student of contemporary American white nationalism who is an emphatic and empathetic partisan of his people. He is the author of two valuable books on white America's fledgling racial-nationalist movement, The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, based on interviews with the late William Pierce and One Sheaf, One Vine, which gives voice to ordinary European-Americans who have embraced racial consciousness in ways currently acceptable for nonwhites and for Jews in this country, but long since taboo for whites.In Living White, Griffin brings well-honed critical skills to addressing questions of individual demeanor and conduct that the committed very often neglect: the search for self-knowledge, the struggle for personal effectiveness, the resolve to act in the public arena, and the ability to communicate racial concerns to other whites. The score of essays included in Living White encompass the wide range of Griffin's observations of the racial right, observations sharpened by his learning in the psychology of education and by his comparative detachment as a latecomer to white racial politics. The pieces collected here run the gamut from practical advice for activists to meditations on the careers of men as disparate as Stanford University president and eugenics enthusiast David Starr Jordan and American Nazi agitator George Lincoln Rockwell, demolitions of books by academic denigrators of white people, and valuable personal vignettes of his own path to self-fulfillment in service of his people.Besides being uncommonly objective, Robert Griffin is unusually thoughtful, and much of his thought has been devoted to gaining knowledge of himself. This self-knowledge, and his observation and experience of life, make Griffin a sympathetic listener and a sound adviser on the challenges of living white in today's America. His essay on how to educate one's children to live honorable white lives is notable for his grasp of the essential issues: too many white parents (and not just nationalists) still believe that it suffices to remove their offspring from minority milieus, neglecting the tentacles of the education industry and the entertainment media. He is particularly good on the loss of community and on considerations of how to rebuild it, in writing free of both lamentation and cheery assurance of easy restorations.In just a few years Robert Griffin has emerged as an author, analyst, and public spokesman for white Americans, despite his very public status in the fishbowl of campus life at a state university. The fact that he has tenure has not preserved him from wounds to the ego and the heart, wounds which he wears openly and bravely. The deafness which afflicted Griffin suddenly after he had completed his second book on white nationalism has been if anything a goad to his work and action: It lead him to write, here, \\"While--for me--there is still time, in my life, I want, day to day, hour to hour, in my own unique way, to live as an honorable white man,\\" thereby giving body and soul to Friedrich Nietzsche by now hackneyed \\"What does not destroy me makes me stronger,\\" and reminding that, as George Eliot wrote, \\"It's never too late to be what you might have been.\\"Living White, a collection of essays and commentary, is rather larger than the sum of its parts. Everyone interested in understanding the better angels of the psychic struggle for collective preservation of the people that created America and the West, as well as everyone interested in white nationalism--pro or con--should read this book."},{"Title":"Living WHI: Writings on Race, 2000-2005","review":"I enjoyed each page of this thoughtful, brave book. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Living WHI: Writings on Race, 2000-2005","review":"My book came in today.

Griffin, but the actual book INSIDE is \\"Attracting Abundance with EFT\\" by Carol Look!You've been warned. I don't think this was an accident."},{"Title":"Living WHI: Writings on Race, 2000-2005","review":"I'm coming at this from the viewpoint of a 40 year old, Christian conservative, white male with more than 20 years experience in the U.S. Army. From that perspective, my opinion of the book Living White is it is a bloated, self-indulgent collection of writings by Robert S. Griffin. The writings are centered on the thought that being a racial apologist is wrong, at least for white European Americans. Griffin claims to be objectivist in his views on racialism, but he continuously refers to his own opinions as a basis for why whites should separate themselves from other races.Griffin includes summaries of many of his previous works as well as summations of interviews he has conducted with controversial individuals. The interviews in the book are with white nationalists. He does not use the term racist to describe his view. Instead he uses the term \\"racialists\\" to describe his interviewees. It is obvious within the first 60 pages that the terms are fairly interchangeable though. Racialists in his view work to keep racial groups segregated in order to maintain their moral values; they view mixing races as an egregious wrong in his opinion.The first 30 pages seem fairly benign as Griffin gives compelling reasons for whites to not be apologists. He backs up his findings with seemingly valid research to show that whites should be proud of their heritage and should not bow to pressures from political groups to hide their pride. That seems fairly innocuous, but he transitions this viewpoint in chapter five titled Rearing Honorable White Children. In this chapter he interviews a white couple who home-school their children and believe public schools are corrupt. Griffin's bias is obvious. He makes numerous mentions of how affluent neighborhoods populated primarily by whites become slums within a generation of blacks moving into them. He goes so far as to mention how a woman was mugged for her purse because black teens moved into her area.In chapter 7, titled The New White Nationalism, Griffin reproduced a book review he had written. In this chapter he makes a failed attempt to show that he is being objective by reviewing a book on white nationalism written by Carol Swain, a black female author. He spent most of this review tearing down Ms. Swain and displaying why she is not a valid source for reviewing the white nationalist agenda. I will agree that Ms. Swain does make a number of misjudgments of her own in her work, but I think it borders on the ridiculous that Griffin would choose this work as the single source for proving that black people cannot understand or appreciate white people.There are many other works he could have chosen to display here that would make the opposite point. Griffin tries to show that he was genuinely looking for a book that favored integration. But his review of the text shows great contempt for the author's views and again shows his bias. He should have offered a comparison of different texts for his readers. Instead he found one book that really bothered him and used it to base his opinion that all books written by blacks on the issue of integration are bad.Griffin makes his strongest case for why whites should take back their culture and stop being apologists in chapter nine, titled David Star Jordan. In this chapter he claims that being apologists, whites have allowed many historical heroes to fall away from our common history. Chief of these heroes is David Jordan, a famous white racialist. Griffin makes claims that this individual was a great philosopher, educator and patriot, but he does not give evidence of any accomplishments other than that Jordan moved the cause of white nationalism forward in America.I have not looked up Jordan's name to see what else he may have accomplished, but it is telling that nothing else is mentioned in Griffin's book to substantiate that Jordan is a man worth keeping in our school's history books. If Griffin wanted his readers to be more persuaded to take up the cause of reintroducing white heroes in textbooks I think he should have used more than one example to back up his case. He also should have used a better example than a white supremacist known only for his racial agenda.I would not recommend this book to my peers or to anyone wanting to objectively study race relations. I say that not only because of Griffin's bias, but also because of his shoddy research. The largest flaw in Griffin's logic throughout the book is in how he comes up with his data. Griffin is singly focused on race being the fix or flaw in relationships. He makes no mention of how mixed neighborhoods perform nationally. He picks and chooses only communities that have significant racial tension already within them for study. Griffin does not take into account religion or any other differences in culture. This skews his data. To research race properly he should take into account all measurable differences and then work to exclude them to see how race in and of itself makes a difference within communities."},{"Title":"10 Days to Faster Reading","review":"This actually work. Initially I was very pessimistic about speed reading as most of the techniques located on the web will tell you to automatically skip lines or other obviously erroneous techniques. There is no substitute for actually reading everything, but there are ways to do it faster and more efficiently. These includes:1) Training your eye span and movement.2) View larger word clusters instead of single words.3) Use a pacer that works for you (this is highly individual and this book wisely contain many choices).4) Limit sub-vocalization (internal whispering)5) Read with a purpose.6) Vary you reading style in accordance to the materialBesides all this the book contains a multitude of tests, pointers on screen (computer) reading and lots of other useful stuff.The book is not without its limitations, the biggest problem being that it is simply to ambitious; it's material on note taking and technical reading is so short and over simplified that it ends up doing more harm than good, for people interested in this important subject I suggests you look to the bookWhat Smart Students Know. Another and perhaps more important area that lacks attention is the speed techniques themselves, although many are presented only few are backed with exercises which is crucial to their development and understanding.For all it's problems the book still deserves four stars, simply because it will install confidence in you that this actually works. I went from 220 WPM to 330-350 WPM within a week, with my comprehension rate rising from 50 to 70%. However if you want to go up to 400-600WPM, extend your mental abilities to concentrate (read) for longer intervals and get your comprehension rate up to 80-90%, you will have to look to more compressive (and time consuming) programs such as the one brilliantly outlined inBreakthrough Rapid Reading.

Wow, really?The only value for me was realizing that it's ok to preview texts before reading (or even instead of reading). But that's a bit of a personal realization and any speed-reading guide probably would've given me that.

Marks-Beale gives great tips (most of which I had not found in other speed-reading books) and the exercises are great.

No, instead she simply starts immediately with the drills and the tips that, with some effort, give results in a matter of days or less. Not so much theory, but practice!This is a book that I warmly recommend to PhD-students and colleague-professors at my faculty (Theology).

When I began I was a slow to average reader (200 WPM). After four days I was able to read at nearly 650 WPM. However, comprehension is a different story. When I read quickly I find it hard to retain information. The book assures me that with practice I will begin to retain more of what I read. I am finding that this is true.In conclusion, you should be able to learn how to read much faster (not necessarily triple your speed though) in just 10 days.

She constantly reminds one that because they are currently a slow reader, they do not have to remain that way. There are chapters on the key issues such as speed, concentration, previewing, comprehension, technical reading and studying. There are also important sub points on things like note taking, key words and phrases, newspaper and E-Mail reading. There are good summary tables (pgs 64, 76 &amp; 118 for example) as well as tests for speed and comprehension to give you feedback on your progress.The author also uses her experience as an &quot;excutive coach,&quot; to help people use their time better; to determine what they should and should NOT be reading or doing, how to manage their day for better productivity, as well as how to make more time in your personal life. Even if one is not interested in improving their reading speed, I would recommend reading this section of the book.Overall, I found this an excellent book, would recommend it not only for people who want to improve their reading speed, but also for those who would like to get a better handle on their professional and personal life."},{"Title":"10 Days to Faster Reading","review":"I worked through the 10-day program illustrated in the book.

I have started reading books that I always wanted to but was too slow/lazy to read.You should read the book slowly to understand till chapter 4 where most of the techniques are explained. The rest of the book can be read faster using the same techniques that you learnt.Some of the techniques are- Read group of words ignoring a, an, the, this, as- Read thought groups- Read only important words in a sentence and you can still understand pretty well- Try to read vertically rather than horizontally- Make 2-3 stops per line and gradually reduce the number of stops- Start reading from 2nd word from left margin and read till 2 words before the right margin. You will still see the remaining wordsThe best of all are called right and left pull, where you place your finger (pacer) besides left or right margin and slide your finger down one line at a time.

I am pleased that bought this book."},{"Title":"10 Days to Faster Reading","review":"Ten days ago I started following the day by day lesson plan of a little book called 10 Days to Faster Reading, by Abby Marks-Beale and the Princeton Language Institute. The original post can be found here. The purpose of the book is pretty well summed up in the title. Yesterday, I finished the program.So, William, are you a faster reader now than you were before you started? The short answer is yes; significantly. The long answer is a bit more complicated.The BookI'm generally not a fan of books that make huge promises and claims in the title (i.e., Your Best Life Now). I always expect them to read like an inaudible infomercial. \\"In only fifteen-minutes a day, you could be on your way to so much money you'll want to puke!\\" The cover of our current book, while modest in its design (purple, white and black), reads in a manner that's difficult not to hear in the voice from the guy on the Oxy Clean commercials. If you can't tell, self-help type books don't generally sit well with me. However, despite my judging this book by its cover, it proved itself in its pages.The book stays largely academic; something I appreciate. Where many books in its genre sound something like a hokey life coach speaking, this one sounds more like a patient, caring school teacher. The book is divided evenly into ten chapters. The chapters generally focus on breaking old habits and forming new ones. Each chapter includes a benchmark to test your speed and comprehension. Each day introduces you to some new techniques to help build speed and comprehension and encourages you to practice those techniques, then of course to try the techniques you're comfortable with on the next benchmark.The beginning of the book focuses mostly on the bad habits we form when we first learn to read. Marks-Beale gives some helpful advice for breaking those habits; advice which I will attest is surprisingly effective. Things such as not reading to yourself out loud or in your head; that one I found especially effective. As she presents some helpful hints for breaking those habits, she also offers some useful techniques to replace those habits. Pacers, key-wording, reading between the lines, are among them.Toward the end of the book, she starts to move away a bit from the academic topic and more into, what feels sometimes, like out of place life advice. For example, how to prepare for a board meeting you weren't ready for or how to determine what emails you should and shouldn't read. Per Ms. Marks-Beale's advice, I skipped these sections altogether.My ExperienceOn day one, I was reading at 185 words per minute, at 70% comprehension (technically a slow reader). Newly aware of my bad habits and actively trying to implement good habits, by day two, I was up to 220 words per minute with 90% comprehension (just barely making the cut as an \\"average\\" reader.) Clearly by the second day I was seeing results. Throughout the program, I fluctuated with my speed and comprehension because of experimenting with different techniques, but finally I ended at 345 words per minute with 70% comprehension (finally a \\"good\\" reader). At nearly twice my original reading speed, I'd say that the program was a wild success.Each chapter Marks-Beale shares a new \\"pacer\\" method to help speed up your reading. Of the many offered, I felt the most comfortable using the white card method. The idea is to use an index card to keep track of where you're reading. The only difference here is instead of placing it, in the traditional way, under the words your reading, she suggests placing it above the words your reading. This helped stop me from rereading things I'd already read. It also helped stop me from day dreaming.Another technique she suggested was to read between the lines. As ridiculous as it sounds, it ends up working shockingly well. Much of the idea of speed reading comes from the thought that we can read word chucks, not just words. Every time our eyes stop, our mind picks up information. The more information you can pick up on one stop, the faster you can read; it's reading with your peripheral vision. Reading between the lines is literally just that. Instead of placing your eyes directly on the words you're reading, look right above them at the white space. This helped me to stop focusing on specific words and pick up more information in one glance.My eye span I think is my biggest problem. I don't confidently pick up as much in my peripheral vision as I probably could. The solution to that? Exercise. Throughout the book, there are various eye exercises to help expand your eye span; helping you become better at picking up more information in one glance. One problem, however, was that the exercises weren't really adequate. They were often too short and once I memorized them, I wasn't really gaining much. However, this has not been a problem thanks to a great program, Ace Reader, which Marks-Beale suggests in one of the later chapters. The program is full of tests to help build speed and comprehension, but most helpful, I think, are the games to help expand your eye span. The program alone I think would be insufficient to dramatically increase reading speed. Ace Reader is available for 30 days free from their website; then $49.95 if you want to keep it.As a whole, my reading clearly became faster in the ten day period. I definitely learned some great new techniques for reading faster, which will only open the roadway for me to continue to improve my speed and I became aware of some really bad habits that were blocking me from reading faster. I would say this book lives up to its title and anyone who will stick with this reading program will almost definitely experience an increase in speed and comprehension. You'll have to stick with it though!Kudos Abby Marks-Beale; you've written an effective and useful book!"},{"Title":"10 Days to Faster Reading","review":"The first few chapters of this book are helpful for improving your reading speed.

After re-reading it recently, I found it just as relevant now as it was then."},{"Title":"The Caretaker & The Dumb Waiter: Two Plays","review":"\\"The Dumbwaiter\\" (1957) is a long one-act play by Harold Pinter displaying his Theater of the Absurd traits, but in a more tightly focused view than in some of his other work. Ben and Gus are waiting in a play reminiscent of Beckett's \\"Waiting for Godot\\" (1952). They are like Estragon and Vladimir in the Beckett play except those two hapless souls are still waiting.Ben and Gus are sticking around to do a job, something sinister, apparently a killing, but these two hit men, if that's what they are, are rather pathetic. There's an antipathy between the two. They have revolvers. In the claustrophobic set, a basement room, the two men get cryptic and hilarious food order notes from the dumbwaiter up above. They send up little snacks that Gus had brought with him (the food proves to be unsatisfactory). A speaking tube also connects them with whomever. Ben is the leader, and his cohort Gus seems like a fumbling clownish oaf.As usual the dialogue has its comic riffs, repetitiveness and inanity. The two petty criminal are under the direction of a boss just as Goldberg and McCann were in Pinter's \\"The Birthday Party\\".What happens is puzzling and baffling in this dark comedy. There is an undertone of violence with terror lurking. Neither character is quite sure of anything. Things are unnerving, uncertain, and menacing. The unknown is often scarier than the unknown. In a Pinter play people don't seem to be able to exert their wills; they are manipulated and toyed with just as Pinter is manipulating and toying with the audience.It has been said that Pinter's characters lack sympathy for each other, spirituality or any craving for it. It's an existential world. The evil presence offstage must be obeyed. It's a mystery within an enigma, but fun for adventurous theatergoers."},{"Title":"The Caretaker & The Dumb Waiter: Two Plays","review":"Despite saying to myself on several occassions as I read these plays, \\"what's it all mean,\\" (kind of like I did while watching the Matrix movie series), I could not stop reading. There was suspense, and more importantly, definite character development. I enjoy reading Pinter even though sometimes, I really have not clue what it all means."},{"Title":"The Caretaker & The Dumb Waiter: Two Plays","review":"One review, until now, is pathetic. This book, featuring two of the absurd, menacing, weighty master's early works is terrific.The Caretaker, along with The Homecoming, The Birthday Party and Old Times is one of Pinter's best, ultimately important, works. It is in my opinion one of the great post-WWII English plays.The Dumb Waiter, similar to The Caretaker in it's setting and brother-like characters, while being a long one-act, is creepier still and more enigmatic.The Caretaker is about a vagabond named Davies, who is taken into a run-down room in a run-down house by Aston, who lives there, and collects things in it, and is the brother of Mick, who owns the building. Initially the relationship between Davies and Aston is kind, generous and progressive. Davies, used to trudging through life homeless is taken aback at the trust and goodwill offered by Aston. When Mick arrives later, Davies must feel out the differing attitude, as Mick looks after his brother, and isn't so easily trusting of the ragged and scruffy Davies. But eventually Aston seems odd (and delivers an amazing monologue testifying to his possible insanity), and Mick more level headed, and both at different times offer Davies a job in the house, as Caretaker.But Pinter being Pinter, the goodwill is possibly unreal, or something else entirely. There is a vague confusion to the play, a lack of specifics, and the characters, in classic masculine style, only say what they think they need to, i.e.:Davies: What do you do-? What do you do...when the bucket's full?Pause.Aston: Empty it.Pause.Davies, somewhat boxed into the house by weather and possibility never knows his place, as the brothers, who rarely are in the room together, keep him off balance. The truth becomes elusive, as do the facts. One never knows one's place, or how each feels about the other. A scary moment comes when Davies, flustered by the erratic behavior of Aston, calls him \\"nutty\\" to his brother, Mick. To which Mick replies: \\"You get a bit out of your depth sometimes, don't you?\\"The Dumb Waiter is more absurd then The Caretaker. Two guys, possibly hitmen, possibly waiters, staying in a basement room, awaiting orders to do something, must contend with a dumb waiter that begins to descend with notes requesting food. The room clearly not a kitchen, and they not sure what is going on upstairs, instead put the little food they have in the dumb waiter, which ascends and descends several times. The trapped nature of Gus and Ben lends that Pinter menace to the story. Each has a gun, and seems ready to kill. But a lack of information, either known to them, or expressed by them so we know, keeps the lid on the proverbial pot.These both are classic plays. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Caretaker & The Dumb Waiter: Two Plays","review":"Both of these works are wonderful in the sense of making the reader think. Not only are you thrust head first into the plays, but your perception is what makes the endings. Pinter's stlye, form and intellect deliver in both of the works and are challenging without being difficult. Both works have character that people can relate to, wonderful dialogue, and mental involovement. I highly recommend both works!"},{"Title":"Head Of A Traveler","review":"This Nigel Strangeways mystery, Head of a Traveler (1949), offers a traditional manor house setting, erudite suspects, poetic allusions, and a satisfying, layered solution. Poetry and murder become intertwined as the poet Nigel Strangeways investigates a rural murder that involves the family of Robert Seaton, one of the most distinguished poets in England.For those new to the Strangeways stories, Nicholas Blake was a pseudonym for Cecil Day-Lewis, a respected English poet himself. In fact, Day-Lewis served as poet laureate from 1968 until his death in 1972.As is typical in a Strangeways mystery, this murder has its roots in the past. Critical past events and hidden relationships are gradually revealed, shifting the spotlight from one suspect to another. In the concluding chapters alternative solutions are considered in rapid sequence, each successive solution fitting the evidence more closely.Head of a Traveler is an entertaining mystery that would make a good introduction to the Nigel Strangeways series."},{"Title":"The Emergence of Christian Theology","review":"The author begins by looking at five 2nd century theologians: Justin (the Martyr), Athenagoras, Iraneus, Clement (of Alexandia), and Tertullian. E.F. Osborn displays his ability to draw together within pages the heart of the matter. Osborn masterfully looks at how these five used the new testament - Matthew, Paul and John, especially to answer to contentous individuals and groups with a theology that properly presented and properly represented the one God in a new way: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. This is a book that clearly brings together the emergence of Christian theology. Osborn is amazing in his ability to write clearly as he covers a significant period of history in a conservative amount of pages. He researched the topic, brought the facts together in a very readable and understandable format - all within 334 pages which includes a conclusion, 3 appendicies, a bibliography and index. As with all scholarly books, the price is high but Amazon will help you find better pricing be it new or used. Alright, now, stop reading this, call your library or invest in your own library. This is worth every penny you spend and/or minute you invest reading it."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Waystation","review":"I began WAYSTATION without high expectations, since spin-off novels from video series or films are rarely masterpieces. I was pleasantly surprised. The novel shows some surprising quality in places. It really had me turning pages and enjoying myself. Too bad that, overall, it lacked a satisfying ending and -- at the end -- just sort of twittered out into limbo.At first I was a bit put off by the constant flip banter between the characters. However, this constant banter became more familiar by the second chapter and I started to flow with it. Perhaps because I came to enjoy the characters. I have seen the Andromeda TV show and expected the characters to be cardboard cut-outs from the show, but the author did a surprisingly good job of bringing them to life. The best developed character by far was Trance Gemini, that peculiar little elfin woman whose role I never understood in the TV series. She becomes the focus of this book, and carries it. I need to give Mr. McDonald a gold star for developing her into an interesting character for the reader, given that I am not sure the TV show provided him with much to work with in this regard.The novel also helped me to understand some riddles of the TV series that never made sense to me. Like, why there are TWO Andromedas -- one a hologram and one an android. Turns out they are two different characters. At times they even begin to argue with one another.The plot started so well. The ship Andromeda Ascendant has been badly shot up in a battle with defense forces of the planet Kantar; she escapes, limping, into Slipstream drive, but is forced to drop out of hyperspace when systems fail. The ship thus defaults into a very bad location, a quadrant with little but empty vacuum. No planets, no moons, no asteroids. However, by good fortune Andromeda's star charts reveal an old waystation, built centuries earlier to service starships in the early days of exploration. The plot centers on a desperate effort to (1) travel to the waystation, (2) find materials necessary to effect repairs on the Andromeda Ascendant, and (3) return.Here's where the book runs into major problems. At least three-quarters of the book (roughly 200 pages) has concluded before members of Hunt's crew even REACH the waystation. Thus the author has only about 65 pages to roll out most of the plot and wrap up the book. Scene follows scene in a rush, blurring past the reader as the author tries to tie everything up in a few tens of pages. Even with all this haste and compression, a lot is left hanging as the book ends.Perhaps the author might have had more room to conclude the book if he did not devote so many pages to Trance Gemini's dimension doors and encounters with quantum alternates of herself. While this element worked well for a while, and was genuinely interesting when first introduced, it eventually got to be very repetitious and overworked. I kept asking, \\"oh, no, not again -- haven't we been there before-- like four times at least?\\" A sub-plot that got out of control?To wrap this up -- this novel had many elements I liked a lot. The characters, plenty of drama, great sense of humor, and a fast-moving action plot that takes us to about page 200. At that point structure seems to break down. The ending is compressed, cursory, and disappointing.This book is too good to pan, but too weak to praise."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Waystation","review":"This is a very enjoyable read. The story is fast paced and all of the characters have their opportunities to shine. The story is primarily centered around Trance who is experiencing quantum leaps of reality and living other potential time lines while the crew of the Andromeda are desperately trying to find a way to repair the ship and a dark secret awaits them on the 'abandoned' Waystation.... pretty good stuff! I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Waystation","review":"This is a surprisingly good entry in the Andromeda tie-in series.While it reads much like two sequential episodes from the series, it is nonetheless tightly plotted, and takes advantage of some of the untapped potential of the complex universe the Andromeda inhabits. This is a Trace-centric book, but nonetheless all the characters are given their moments in the spotlight. More importantly, McDonald took care to have a sustained, believable, rich plot.This is one I'll re-read."},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Waystation","review":"The last remaining High Guard Starship from the defunct Systems Commonwealth, the Andromeda Ascendant, heads to Kantar on the outer rim of the galaxy in their quest to rebuild galactic society. However, instead of a friendly welcome, hostile fire batters the Andromeda forcing the crew to flee the planet in a crippled vessel.Desperately in need of repair, but near nothing except a three century abandoned Waystation, Captain Dylan Hunt lands on the frozen orb over the warnings of time traveling crew member Trance Gemini. The Captain will find his belief system, already shaken to the core, further wrecked on this tundra as the so-called empty station has a creature stalking the crew with a different justice system than the corrupt Commonwealth had.WAYSTATION is a fine fast-paced entry in Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda universe that is clearly targeted for fans of the series though newcomers will enjoy the unique cast, the moral question of what is justice, and the outer space action. Trance steals the show, but she is a two edged humanoid like heroine as she is an intriguing distinctive protagonist, but her time travels can become quite confusing when the audience tries to follow her non-linear movements especially when she argues with herself at loci when \\"two\\" of her converge (will need more than a scorecard to keep track). The Roddenberry faithful will especially take delight with Steven E. McDonald's entry in this long running space opera.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda: Waystation","review":"Loved it 5 stars all the way. Loved the story line.

Maybe because both languages were independently translated from the original Hebrew and Greek texts into English and Japanese respectively. So sometimes (actually quite a few times) there are no one-on-one equivalents. This aspect makes a bilingual bible less meaningful, especially for English speaking people who want to learn Japanese or Japanese speaking people who want to learn English. I hope one day Japanese scholars will directly translate the NIV English version into Japanese version, just like the Living Bible and the Goodnews Bible having their own Japanese counterparts. Also the print size is way too small. Other than these two aspects it is a pretty good bilingual bible for reference purpose only. One very good feature is that all Chinese characters come with pronunciation marks, which makes looking up the dictionary a much easier task."},{"Title":"Japanese-English Bilingual Bible (Japanese and English Edition)","review":"The English and Japanese texts run alongside each other, with the English at times spaced out so that the two translations of the same verse in the two languages are lined up as much as possible.

Since the Japanese is oftentimes longer than the English, in the English side of the Bible there are periodic large empty spaces left that allow the Japanese to catch up with the English. This makes for great note taking spaces. Its like a wide margin Bible in that way.2. Many Japanese Bibles do not have topical indexes.

It also has some interesting sections on the history of dowsing and true stories of dowsers in action.If you are going to pursue this endeavor, I think it is important to realize that practice makes perfect. The authors suggest spending one week of practicing several times a day, just watching the pendulum move various ways strictly under the influence of your will and desire. This is extremely important, because it teaches you to relax, let go and trust your subconscious mind.The second important step is to understand that there is \\"no order of difficulty in miracles\\", to paraphrase A Course In Miracles. It is no more difficult (or easy) to find a missing child in another state via map-dowsing than it is to successfully dowse for your car keys. The apparent difference in difficulty is artificial and all in one's belief system. Both events are \\"miracles\\" in that there is no rational explanation for how you found either. So your faith in the connectedness of all things must grow considerably, or you will simply fizzle out as a dowser.

While not glossy, if you buy only one book about pendulums, this should be the one. This book in this or previous form(s) has been around for years - a testament to its worth."},{"Title":"Pendulum power : a mystery you can see, a power you can feel","review":"Although Pendulum Power, by Greg Nielsen and Joseph Polansky, has been around for several years, its message is more relevant than ever in the confusing and turbulent times in which we now live.A pendulum is simply a suspended object which is allowed to swing as dictated by the force of gravity. Pendulums are commonly used in grandfather clocks. Pendulums have another, far more ancient use, however. For thousands of years, they have been an essential part of divination. Nielsen and Polansky say &quot;the pendulum is simply one method of many for communing consciously with our deeper being and allowing it to guide our everyday actions.&quot;Their book introduces readers to the extensive history of the pendulum, from early divination to 20th-century medical practice. They then explain how the energy that is a part of every living organism makes the pendulum work. They say that the human nervous system &quot;is the communication system of the body&quot; and using a pendulum allows you to interpret the signals your &quot;inner higher intelligence [communicates] through the nervous system.&quot;Pendulums are very easy and inexpensive to make. A ring or button suspended from thread makes a simple pendulum. For readers wanting something more elegant, the authors provide detailed instructions for constructing a pendulum from doweling. Extensive directions are given for using pendulums. Readers will learn what kinds of questions to ask, and how to interpret the various movements of the pendulum. Nielsen and Polansky provide examples of how pendulums have been used to find lost objects, choose a career or change jobs, select a healthy diet based on personal needs, and aid in other types of decision making.Pendulums are also used in healing. Anyone trying to determine the best decision or course of action, based on their personal needs, will find the techniques provided in Pendulum Power useful and enlightening."},{"Title":"Pendulum power : a mystery you can see, a power you can feel","review":"This book is a must buy for anyone interested in EVERYTHING about pendulums.

For one thing, there is an awful lot of internal dialogue and that's difficult to deal with because usually, when it comes to internal dialogue, a lot &quot;gets lost in the translation,&quot; so to speak, but not here. Gaige handles Chris Bradshaw's evolving internal confrontations expertly. The Midwest Book Review called it, a &quot;highly recommended...literary work addressing fundamental issues of purpose and existence within the context of a deftly written and memorable story.&quot; I couldn't have said it any better, so I'll just second that assessment.If you pick it up, clear some time because this is a book you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"A Kerouac Christ","review":"Clint Gaige's A Kerouac Christ is an original novel of personal growth and evolution relating Chris Bradshaw's quest to find the source of his disenchantment with his own life. This search leads Clint on a seven-year quest for answers to life's ultimate questions. But enlightenment comes at a price, one of confronting both internal and external demons, and the profound consequences of his conclusions. A Kerouac Christ is highly recommended as a thoughtful literary work addressing fundamental issues of purpose and existence within the context of an deftly written and memorable story."},{"Title":"A Kerouac Christ","review":"As a person that normally does not read a lot of fiction, I was totally collected up in Chris' journey. I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend and could not put it down! The characters were so real that I could see people I've known, people I've run into, or even myself at times. The way that Clint Gaige has addressed several society issues in this book were wonderful and at times, unlike a lot of fiction, were actually very thought provoking. This book does have two flaws, in my opinion: (1) It's hard to put this book down once you start reading it, and (2) I finished reading it too fast! I have never read one of Gaige's books before, but I can assure you that this will not be the last."},{"Title":"A Kerouac Christ","review":"&quot;A Kerouac Christ&quot; is one of the most compulsively readable books I've read in a long time. I actually woke up early, couldn't sleep, so I picked up the book and started reading, that was at about eight this morning. I just finished, and I wanted to tell everyone that I think Clint has really written something that people need to read. It's not necessarily about the truth that the characters were seeking, but more about what Chris found in the end, after spending those years on his journey. The character of Chris was very believable, and I actually felt like I knew him by the end.I was really impressed with the way Clint handled the consequences that came from the book Chris wound up writing, the two teenagers who took their lives after reading it. I've found this to be a difficult thing to deal with in this country, how people want to blame everyone and everything for the bad things that happen. People found fit to blame Chris Bradshaw for what he wrote, when he didn't even know that he had accomplished anything. The teenagers took his tale of what to him hadn't worked out in his life, and saw in it all they believed they couldn't accomplish. It's fairly ironic, the unforseen affects of what he wrote.All in all, this is now one of my favorites, a book that I would list among the likes of &quot;The Catcher In The Rye&quot;. Clint may not be today's Salinger or Kerouac, but his ideas are incendiary, and his words fresh. This is the kind of book you won't be able to stop thinking about."},{"Title":"Some Welcome Home: An Elizabeth Pepperhawk/Avivah Rosen Mystery","review":"SOME WELCOME HOME by Sharon Wildwind puts a face on the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Wildwind writes from experience as an army nurse in Vietnam in the early 1970s and a year as head nurse on an orthopedic unit at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where this novel is set. Her experiences and insights give the book authenticity. Nothing seems pasted on. It's the real deal.Opening line: \\"Through the slit in the closed drapes, a thin bar of afternoon sunlight fell across the soldier's chest, highlighting the dark, small bullet hole.\\"Such is Captain Elizabeth \\"Pepper\\" Pepperhawk's \\"welcome\\" to the Transient Officers' Quarters at Fort Bragg. The body is wearing a World War 2 uniform but his hair is long. She thinks: \\"Maybe he wasn't a soldier; maybe someone dressed him in a uniform. But there was something about him, even in death, that said 'soldier.' He was one of us ...\\"I was reminded of Shakespeare's \\"band of brothers\\" as I read. This emotional bond, this shared experience, runs through Wildwind's story. It also drives a key character who keeps applying for combat service, convinced that her request is routinely denied because she's a woman.The story is told through three main characters. There's army nurse Pepperhawk, who survived Vietnam but is troubled by flashbacks. There's Benny Kirkpatrick, a Green Beret just returned from the Panamanian jungle, who wants to chuck it all, get married and raise a family. There's Captain Avivah Rosen of the military police, who envies their bond and wants to share it.So who is the dead man on Pepper's bed? We get pieces of the puzzle one at a time. The investigation begins with a World War 2 veteran who reports a stolen uniform, and leads to three lifelong friends who served in Vietnam and swore to look after one another, no matter what.How many of those now stationed at Fort Bragg could have been in a certain location in Saigon on January 20, 1969? Quite a few, as it turns out. A crime committed then and there has finally come to light a world away.As Pepper, Benny and Avivah track the clues to a small mountain community, Pepper finds herself drawn into the lives of those who thought they had put Vietnam behind them. Wildwind writes with a sure hand of both the military community and the civilian community, and the arrest of a high-ranking, well-connected officer takes this complex mystery to a suspenseful ending.SOME WELCOME HOME is the first in a planned five-book series. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and look forward to the next one."},{"Title":"Some Welcome Home: An Elizabeth Pepperhawk/Avivah Rosen Mystery","review":"Nurse Corps Captain Elizabeth Pepperhawk has returned to the states after a tour of duty in Viet Nam. Her latest assignment is at Fort Bragg where she will head up a wing at Womack Army Hospital. However, her stay in guest quarters is SOME WELCOME HOME when she finds a corpse wearing a World War II uniform inside her room. She calls the MPs who inform the Criminal Investigation Division of a possible homicide. All military law enforcement is jittery as the MacDonald fiasco still lingers here at Bragg. MP Captain Avivah Rosen and CID Captain Delaney arrive with other military police.The case takes a surprise spin when the victim turns out to be Dermid Hagan, who officially died in Nam two years ago. As Avivah and Elizabeth become friends and neighbors along with a third compatriot Benny Kirkpatrick, each has a personal problem to cope with. Elizabeth begins digging into what happened finding a tenuous link to the hospital; this endangers her, her friends, and others from a trained killer who will murder to keep secrets hidden.This is a superb historical military police procedural that grips the audience from the moment Elizabeth finds a body in her room and never slows down until the final good-byes. Besides a strong murder mystery, the tale provides insight into the minds of career officers struggling at a time when the Viet Nam War has begun to look helpless with no exit strategy (sound familiar?). The key to the tale is three buddies and the support cast that sheds more light on three protagonists. They provide an insightful look 1971 military life inside a terrific who-done-it.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Sky Island,: Being the further exciting adventures of Trot and Cap'n Bill after their visit to the Sea Fairies","review":"Being a L.Frank Baum fan, I loved Sky Island.

It was adequate but not up to the superlative quality I expect from L. Frank Baum. This book, however, sets things to right. It reads more like the Oz books and even includes characters such as Button Bright and Polychrome who make numerous appearances in the Oz series. It is a fun book that I enjoyed even with my youth far behind me.In this story, Trot meets Button Bright who has a magical umbrella which takes him where he wants to go. Trot, Button Bright and Cap'n Bill decide to use the umbrella to take them for a picnic out on an island just off the coast.

Frank Baum is best known forThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Dover Large Print Classics)and its long string of sequels, but he also wrote numerous other excursions into what he and some of his characters called \\"fairy countries\\"--all of which have, happily, been returned to print by Dover in sturdy, affordable paperbacks. After turning out half a dozen Oz volumes, he wrote this book and its prequel, which might be called \\"The Adventures of Trot & Cap'n Bill,\\" and which in this instance are linked to the Oz Universe. Trot, born Marye Griffith, lives on the California coast with her mother and their boarder, the one-legged seaman known as Cap'n Bill, while her father, a ship's captain, is off sailing the oceans. She and the Cap'n are great friends (he calls her \\"mate\\"), and have already had one magical adventure, chronicled inThe Sea Fairies, when Trot, on her way back from an errand to the nearby village, encounters a little boy from Philadelphia, who calls himself Button-Bright, and who has ended up in her neighborhood by way of a magical umbrella he accidentally found in his attic. Fascinated by the prospect of flying through the air, Trot persuades Button-Bright (who was introduced inThe Road to Oz) to take her somewhere by \\"the umbrel,\\" and Cap'n Bill contrives a sort of swing-seat to hang underneath it so they can both ride it. Their first ride is everything Trot hoped, and now she's hooked. Cap'n Bill insists on coming along next time, and it may be a good thing he does: in trying to fly to what he and Trot call \\"Sky Island\\" (a barely-visible landmass they've always wanted to visit), the trio end up in the Laputa-like floating island of the title, which is inhabited by two rival peoples, the Blueskins and the Pinkies. Falling afoul of the tyrannical Boolooroo of the former, the travellers temporarily lose their umbrella and are forced to flee to the Pinkie country, where they are welcomed and Trot is eventually elected Queen. How she uses this to her advantage to get the umbrella back and bring peace and harmony to Sky Island is the meat of the story.Trot is a character who will be liked by any reader fond of Dorothy Gale (indeed, many of Baum's \\"little correspondents\\"--he received bushels of letters from his young readers--said they liked her \\"almost as well\\"): she's brave, resourceful, and (unlike many girls of 1912) not at all given to scatterbrained-ness or fainting. Button-Bright seems to have gotten more competent since his first appearance, and Cap'n Bill is a delightful old salt who will have young readers wishing they knew someone like him. And, happily, Dover has reprinted the book in its original typeface and with all the original, ornate John R. Neill illustrations intact (Neill's rendition of the Blueskins is even more elaborate than the written description of them). Any child who enjoys imaginative literature should be familiar with Baum, and this little-known duology shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Sky Island,: Being the further exciting adventures of Trot and Cap'n Bill after their visit to the Sea Fairies","review":"A fast-moving, well-woven plot, a loving trio of resourceful protagonists, and one (actually seven) of the most fun-to-hate villians in Baum. For spite, impulsive violence, and cruelty elevated to a creative art, the Wicked Witch of the West and even the Nome King have nothing on the principle villian of SKY ISLAND. On Sky Island, as in Oz, no one dies or suffers pain, even those who get cut to pieces. The Boolooroo of the Blues exploits this so barbarically that the reader is tempted to wish he could simply kill his victims instead. The dramatic climax (involving a goat) is difficult to read without cheering out loud. Baum's special blend of tension and humor in this non-Oz book rivals the best Oz books.Readers of my reviews know that I like to note Baum's references to Wagner. Polychrome is an obvious derivative of Brunhilde. Polychrome's father is the Rainbow; Brunhilde's is the god of storms as well as of war. Just as Brunhilde favors the hero Siegmund, so Polychrome favors our hero Button-Bright, and her assistance is more useful to BB than Brunhilde's is to Siegmund! She persuades the Pinkies to let the protagonists live, using a singularly Wagnarian argument:\\"Why have you decreed death to these innocent strangers?\\" she asked.\\"They do not harmonize with our color scheme,\\" replied Tourmaline.\\"That is utter nonsense,\\" declared Polychrome, impatiently. \\"You're so dreadfully pink here that your color, which in itself is beautiful, has become tame and insipid. What you really need is some sharp contrast to enhance the charm of your country, and to keep these three people with you would be a benefit rather than an injury to you.\\"That's DIE MEISTERSINGER VON NURNBERG for kids. Compare Hans Sach's speech to the Mastersingers:\\"Gesteht, ich kenn' die Regeln gut,und dass die Zunft die Regeln bewahr',bem&uuml;h' ich mich selbst schon manches Jahr.Doch einmal im Jahre f&auml;nd' ich's weise,dass man die Regeln selbst probier',ob in der Gewohnheit tr&auml;gem Gleiseihr' Kraft und Leben nicht sich verlier'!\\"or, more briefly:\\"Der Regel G&uuml;te daraus man erw&auml;gt,dass sie auch 'mal 'ne Ausnahm' vertr&auml;gt.\\""},{"Title":"Sky Island,: Being the further exciting adventures of Trot and Cap'n Bill after their visit to the Sea Fairies","review":"Sky Island, although good and claimed by Baum to be \\"probably remembered as his best writing\\" was missing some of the childlike fun I've come to enjoy in his other books. Sky island is best described by me as \\"tense.\\" Basically all of the strange people and creatures that Trot, Cap N' Bill and Button Bright encounter on their adventure to the clouds are un-friendly and wish to somehow make them their slaves or have them thrown over the edge of sky island. I'm not bashing this book I just enjoy how in other Baum titles not EVERYTHING goes wrong and the reader can rest ones head so to speak by not expecting every strange race of beings encountered to \\"off\\" our favorite main characters. Speaking of characters Button Bright is nothing like he was in OZ. For one, he speaks full sentences and not once does he wander off and get lost so predominate of his character in OZ. I understand Button may be a bit older in Sky Island however in later OZ stories, Lost Princess for example (which by this time Trot and Bill have came to permanently live in the Emerald City) Button is a stupid kid once again who's largest vocabulary is \\"don't know\\" or \\"not sure\\" not to mention a key plot element in Lost Princess involves Button Bright getting lost. Polychromes' infamous cameo in Sky Island is almost a mute point only offering the amazing characters presence for roughly 3 to 4 pages. Adding these two popular OZ characters and basically putting Buttons name on a adolescent young boy who discovers a magic umbrella in Sky Island was not so much Baums fault yet the incessant desire by his fans for him to continue on with OZ and \\"write something more\\" as a young girl once wrote to Baum.Personally I enjoyed Trot and Cap'n Bills adventure the most in the first 150 pages of The Scarecrow of OZ. The beginning of which was the ill fated 3rd installment of the continuing adventures of Trot and Cap'n Bill. The Sea Fairies and Sky Island are both Great stories yet perhaps I was expecting too much from L Frank Baum after finding so much fun and excitment in his OZ books."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"A very delightful tale about a naughty puppy's adventures.

It's a silly little story about a small dog who bites a wizard on the behind and gets turned into a toy, and then goes on to have a number of adventures on the moon and under the sea. What I liked about the book is its wonderful freedom from the strictest constraints of plot, and Tolkien's whimsical willingness to throw whatever takes his fancy--like the musical plants one finds on the moon. But the story still flows for all that, and it's mostly quite coherent and wholly fun to read.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Let's face it, the only reason most people would read this story would be because they're curious to see how Tolkien writes when his subject is not rings and Hobbits. I was, frankly, surprised to see that he'd ever published anything non-Middle-Earthy. Roverandom certainly wasn't advertised much. It is set in a rather fantastical version of the present-day (or at least of Tolkien's present-day) and is definitely a story for children (with a few winks to any adults who may be reading the story aloud). True, the narration contains all that is wryest and most whimsical of Tolkien's humor, but other than that, Roverandom bears no resemblance to The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit. But there's a warmth and affection in Roverandom that those other books do not contain, and that is best explained, I think, by the story's origin. According to the introduction, Tolkien and his family were on vacation near the sea one year when his children were young. One day when they were visiting the beach, one of his little boys lost his favorite toy, a tiny lead dog, in the sand. The whole family searched hard that day and the next, but they never found the toy again. To comfort his grieving son, Tolkien invented a story about how the toy was truly a real dog who had been enchanted and how he had to go off and have marvelous adventures in order to regain his proper shape. And so Roverandom was conceived--a love story, not in that it contains a tale of romance, but in that it was told out of love for a child. And that alone makes it beautiful."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"The genius of Tolkien - that of fantastical and wonderful story-telling - simply cannot be hidden! Even while vacationing with his family, incidents there would provide inspiration for new tales. When his son lost his toy dog on the beach, Tolkien started \\"Roverandom\\" as a comfort for his son...and so it became a tale that Tolkien grew, worked & reworked until it became the delightful, full, nostalgic piece that it is today.The story starts off with a little dog playing with his yellow ball in his owner's backyard. Suddenly, an old man appears, and he and the dog have a misunderstanding. The old man turns out to be a wizzard, and so he turns the dog into a toy. From there, your mind is constantly stimulated as Tolkien brings so many unexpected twists and turns to the story...from the dog's existence as a boy's toy dog to his trip to the moon over the sea to his adventures with the dog on the moon.As with Tolkien's other works, the presence of wizzards is omnipresent and highly entertaining. He has 3 dominant wizzards with very different personas and responsibilities. Their eccentric, sometimes wise and easily-annoyed temperaments remind one of Gandalf...but these simplistic characters are just shades of that great character. Tolkien also explores such ideas as where we go when we dream and the special access children have to other dimensions but he does this with a light, exploratory tone...not at all with the serious convictions of some of his larger works.In a similar way as \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\", this wonderful tale helped give me some more insight into Tolkien's phenomenal mind. While Lord of the Rings shows an untold depth to this man, these smaller stories show how he takes delight in comical, ironical, classical tales as well. It seems that he naturally was drawn to worlds in which wizzards, giants, dragons, and pathways to the moon exist...and he had a true talent in relating these worlds to others."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Roverandom is a great book no matter what age you are.

Also great for anyone who enjoys lighthearted adventures even if they have not read Tolkien before.Not similar to the epic grandeur of the Lord of the Rings nor connected to Tolkien's 'Silmarillion' mythology, this book still holds a place in any collection of literature to dazzle and delight."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Reading Roverandom, by J.R.R. Tolkien, was like opening a dusty box of childhood memories left under my bed. It has a sort of playful side to it. When Rover was journeying to the moon on the back of a seagull named Mew, and almost traveled an actual road in the sky to get there. Tolkien dragged you into the plot by drawing you in as a part of his outrageous world, giving you a sense of belonging. For instance, he'd mention the names of the flowers on the moon, as if it were nothing and as if they were common knowledge. Fairbells, tinklebells, ringaroses, pennywhistles, tintrumpets, feathergrasses, fairy-fiddlestrings, etc... Roverandom was short and extremely fast-pace. Tolkien consumed big slices of time like homemade bread. He would say, \\"Rover and the Sea-dog had many more adventures under the ocean, but we can save those for another time.\\" It left a lot of room for your imagination to run wild. Strangely, it was very entertaining. When Rover is under the ocean and causes the sea serpent to awaken on accident, his shy little attitude makes you sad for him. But, of course, good books are the ones that make you feel something. They are the ones that make you feel like you're the main character without ever having been in their position.This little novel is about a little dog that goes on many strange and magical adventures. It starts off with Rover biting Artaxerxes's trousers. Artaxerxes is an old grumpy wizard who just happened to be strolling by, and some say it wasn't coincidence. The old wizard become furious with Rover and turns him into a miniature toy puppy. Rover goes through many bizarre complications trying to get back to his original form. The entire journey not only turns out to be a lesson for Artaxerxes and his anger-control, but for Rover as well.Despite all the wild journeys, the uncanny characters, the abnormal locations, and Rover's involuntary arbitrary movement, I found that the best part of Roverandom was remembering how to be a kid again. Fantasy books tend to do that to me, and this was most definitely one of those enchanted stories. It is the kind that you can curl up with on the couch, and ponder all the strange and magical adventures you've had over the years."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"This is a great children's story. As is stated in the introduction, Tolkien created this story about a dog for one of his sons, when he lost his toy dog. The dog in this story (Rover) goes on many fantasy adventures. On his adventures, Rover encounters wizards, and mermaids, and other magical creatures. Throughout the tale Rover is trying to get back to a young boy he met on one of his adventures. The vocabulary in this book is occasionally a little advanced for a young reader. Tolkien always believed in challenging young readers, he felt this is how they got better. Also present are some familiar Tolkien themes, such as a negative portrayal of technology."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"I feel that Roverandom, although short, is a good book. If you are wondering whether or not to read it, I think you should. This story of a dog that is turned into a toy and then sent to the moon is fun for all ages!"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Long before Tolkien constructed the sweeping landscapes of Middle Earth, he created this charming series of improbable events. It started on a summer holiday, when a small nephew lost a favorite stuffed toy at the beach. In order to console the stricken child, Tolkien narrated these rambling adventures of a stuffed toy much like the one lost. 'Roverandom,' as the little toy dog is eventually named, meanders across the countryside, to the moon and back, and to a mermaid land beneath the sea in a series of gentle adventures, carefully stripped of any truly dark moments or frightening parts. It comes across as a mild-mannered but pleasant way to entertain a small child, much the same way that Beatrix Potter'sFairy Caravandid.As a result, it charmed me at a level too deep to resist. My own father told my brothers and me similar rambling, safe adventures when we were small. Perhaps his stories, like these, were slightly inane in themselves and he was certainly no Tolkien, but that doesn't matter. They arose from a base of paternal caring, they were created uniquely for us, and we loved them. Even if the editors hadn't done such a meticulous job of documenting the stories' origins, I would have recognized the same affectionate spirit in these as in my father's.But the editors, Scull and Hammond, did a fine, scholarly job of researching these stories. Roughly twenty pages of introduction describe the stories as they grew in their telling, by comparing different editions from Tolkien's files. Then, another fifteen pages of endnotes explain literary references and obscure terms scattered throughout the stories. Although academically rigorous, these bits of research contrast sharply with the tone of the stories they describe.If you just take the Roverandom stories themselves, you'll find a fine bit of literary comfort food, well suited to any read-to-me kid with a bit of imagination. Tolkien completists might also be interested in this early stage of Tolkien's storytelling skills, but the gentle warmth in these stories is enough for me.- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"So much fun for adults and kids.

How much fun you can have, and all the amazing things you can go and see, even when you are only a small dog, turned into an even smaller toy.Roverandom! A children's novel written by JRR Tolkien, but an actual event. No, his dog was not turned into a small toy, and sailed over the world, too the moon meeting the man in the tower, the great dragon, seagulls and gods, but by his Son, who had lost his toy dog on a family vacation.JRR Tolkien is more famously known for his epic story of: The Lord of the Rings. However, a large amount of work written by JRR Tolkien were children's stories, and this was one excellent. It is about a small dog, Rover, who gets changed into a small toy dog by a wizard, after taking a bit at him! Think before leaping!After being picked up and placed into a toy shop, Rover is bought, and his adventure begins. Ever looking, and trying, to return to his home, Rover goes on an amazing adventure, around the world, below the seas, and too the moon. We meet amazing characters such as the man in the moon, another, old Rover, who can fly, great dragons, where children go when they dream.The story is very well wrapped together, and even though was written, people of all ages can enjoy it. We have all lost thing, precious and not, and maybe we'll stop to think where they actually go! Many fans of Tolkien will see correlations to other pieces of his work, but Roverandom stands on his own 4 legs as his own little big adventure!"},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"After the hobbit, our younger children who love Tolkien had very little to read. We did get farmer Giles of Ham, but Roverandom was liked much better. Tolkien's imagination and word play are really delightful."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Up until relatively recently, Roverandom existed in the minds of Tolkien fans as a mysterious open secret: an unpublished work. For a man whose notes to the milkman and getting-the-pen-to-work scribbles on the inside cover of the Yellow Pages were trumpeted by publishers and family alike as 'masterpieces', this was remarkable. Look the old professor up on Amazon and it's not long before the list of works begins to look significantly desperate (Tales from the Perilous Realm, Finn and Hengest: The Fragment and the Episode, Unfinished Tales of Numenor and Middle-Earth, etc.). Did he mean for all this stuff to be plundered for public consumption? So, finding a complete and illustrated work that hasn't seen the light of day in almost 70 years is odd to say the least. The five illustrations were seen in a couple of academic books, and also at the Bodleian Library's centenary exhibition, but the text was unknown until 1997/1998.The story is based upon an incident that occurred when the Tolkiens were on holiday in the Yorkshire seaside town of Filey, in 1925. Tolkien's four-year-old son lost a small toy dog and became distraught. To console him, his father created a story about a real dog that is magically transformed into a toy and is forced to seek out the wizard who wronged him to be returned to normal. In the course of his search he goes to the Moon and the bottom of the sea and being a mischievous little tyke, gets up to all sorts of adventures. Much like The Hobbit, there are wizards and dragons and huge flesh eating spiders, told here in the singy-songy voice of a good-humoured children's tale. But unlike The Lord of the Rings, this time there is none of the thunder and bombast of, for instance:&quot;...for answer Gandalf cried aloud to his horse. 'On Shadowfax! We must hasten. Time is short. See! The beacons of Gondor are alight, calling for aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on Amon Dn, and flame on Eilenach; and there they go speeding west: Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad and the Halifirien on the borders of Rohan...'Instead, we get:&quot;Once upon a time there was a little dog, and his name was Rover. He was very small, and very young, or he would have known better; and he was very happy playing in the garden in the sunshine with a yellow ball, or he would never have done what he did.&quot;Which, frankly, is much better.Tolkien was only in his early thirties when the first draft was written, and it's full of the sort of easy jokes and casual references a well-read young academic might throw in for his little boy's amusement. Old Mother Hubbard's dog has a walk on part, there's a gentle and affectionate explanation of what happens when we dream, there are sly nods towards his work at Oxford, carrots dangled perhaps to entice his youngsters into enjoying the things he himself loved? Well, possibly.What we have ultimately is a slight tale - it's only 80 pages long - clearly created for reading aloud at bedtime for young children eager to believe that their toys can become animated and exciting (it'll come as no surprise that Rover can only become 'alive' at night when his owner is asleep) if they allow their imaginations to run riot. And that can't be a bad thing. I also can't find the phrase 'a fairy tale for all ages' in the notes or press blurbs and that's surely a boon. More importantly, it happens to be a handy stopgap when you leave your grown-up book on the bus.So will I be reading any more JRRT? Has this fired me up to try LotR again after a twenty-year break? Amon Dn, Eilenach, Nardol, Erelas, Min-Rimmon, Calenhad and the Halifirien?!

The unpublished works of favorite authors nearly always disappoint. I pick them up in hopes of experiencing a fresh taste at an old table, only to find kitchen scraps intended for the garbage heap. This was not so with Roverandom. The story is a delight. The word play is delicious, with lots of rhyme, rhythm and rutabagas. Children love words like Persia and Pershore, Psamathos or Roverandom, for that matter, that they can roll around in their mouths like a handful of jelly beans. These remind me of the word play in the Alice books or a marvelous picture book I once read to my nephew about a woman named Euphonia. (I wish I could find it, or at least remember the title.) This is a children's book. However, it does not talk down to children, and it has lots of literary references most nine-year-olds would miss. These can be enjoyed by the older reader with a wink from Tolkien. I am at the awkward age. My children, in High school and collage, are too big or too busy to have children's books read to them. And I do not yet have grandchildren to regale with the wonder of books. When I grow out of this stage, Roverandom will certainly be on my list. Until then it makes splendid reading for a Summer afternoon."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"To those who would criticize this lovable little book I say, &quot;Understand a work before you judge it.&quot; Maybe you just didn't know, but Tolkien wrote this book to be read aloud to small children. Similarly, The Hobbit was actually written to be read with children. Roverandom is NOT Lord of the Rings, but it is a very good, enthralling little story..."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"For a little kid, losing a favorite toy is downright traumatic. So in 1925, when four-year-old Michael lost his little toy dog on the beach, fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien made up a story to comfort his son. It explained away the loss of the toy, and wove a magical story around a little dog named Rover.Rover is an ordinary little puppy near the seaside in England, until he runs into a grumpy old man and ends up biting off part of his pants. The old man happens to be a wizard (Artaxerxes by name), and promptly transforms Rover into a toy dog (and no, I don't mean a tiny dog -- I mean a real toy). Rover subsequently gets picked up and sold to some little boys (presumably the Tolkien kids).Fortunately, Rover encounters another magical being, a crusty, kindly sand-wizard named Psamathos. That wizard, in turn, gets Rover (who is renamed Roverandom) flown to the moon, where he spends time with the Man in the Moon and his winged dog Rover. And then he's heading off to encounter a talking whale, a mer-dog, a sea serpent -- and a dragon.Like the vastly underrated &quot;Farmer Giles of Ham,&quot; &quot;Roverandom&quot; is a charming little bit of whimsy. No deep themes, no epic clashes, not even really a villain. The writing is charming and magical, with phrases like &quot;There was a cold wind blowing off the North Star&quot; sprinkled through it. It almost gives the feeling of being in another world. Best of all, in the middle of the book are Tolkien's own illustrations, cute little drawings and ethereal paintings.Rover is well-named, since his adventures are all over the map and don't really progress from one to the other. It's merely a cute little dog roaming over the moon, the ocean, and the land, conversing with shrimps and bothering wizards. He's an outspoken little guy, but likeable. The grumpy wizards are also excellently done, reminiscent of Gandalf.While &quot;Roverandom&quot; is a book aimed at children, adults may enjoy the whimsical humor and beautiful writing. A charming and timeless story."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Roverandom takes place once upon a time in England. The main character in this story is Rover (Roverandom). The other main characters are Artaxerxes, Psamathos, the Man-in-the-Moon, the moon-dog Rover, Mew, Two, and the mer-dog Rover.The conflict was that Rover (Roverandom) was turned into a toy dog by the old magician Artaxerxes, and then sold to a little boy named Two. Rover then runs away hoping to be free but then runs into the wizard Psamathos who sends Roverandom on many journeys and he meets many new friends. But Rover longs to become a real dog again and hopes to find the magician.My favorite character probably was the Man-in-the-Moon's dog Rover because he kept Roverandom company while on the Moon, even though they argued some. And because it is very unusual for a dog to live on the moon so it makes Rover extra special to me. I think this is a fun little book that all ages would enjoy. Tolkien orginally wrote Roverandom 70 years ago to comfort his 4-year-old son Michael who lost his favorite toy dog on the beach. Tolkien started to write this book after The Hobbit was published, and he stopped to begin writing The Lord of the Rings. So in 1998 Roverandom was finally published. This book would make a great read aloud book for kids and adults of all ages to enjoy."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Roverandom is a sweet little book which would probably be best used as a read-aloud introduction to Tolkien for small children. It is neither profound, nor a masterpiece, but it is fun to read. It is the story of a puppy that is turned into a toy dog by a passing wizard, and his adventures as he tries to get back to real-dog-ness. This edition has extensive endnotes, almost to the point of being silly (they explain a reference to Humpty Dumpty!). But the endnotes are otherwise helpful and entertaining if you are curious about the current event allusions in the text. All in all, it is an entertaining book, and worth sharing with a young friend."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"I quite enjoyed Roverandum and thought it very enchanting and pleasant.It had lovely descriptions and very pleasing and interesting characters. Some may think it too cute or rather pale beside of The Lord of the Rings but you have to remember that this story was orginally written for a child.It reminded me of the Doctor Dolittle books which have also been called rather whimsy and cute. Anyway Roverandum is a nice little story, pure humor and enchantment."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"Nor, do I think, was it intended to be. There is no battle between Good and Evil. The characters are not larger than life. It is not a morality tale (unless you're in the habit of biting the trousers of strange wizards). This story seemed to me more A.A. Milne than Hobbit or Lord of the Rings.The title is perfect. The adventures of Rover are pretty darn random. But you've ever worked with first graders, you know that a child's world (and mind) is filled with randomness. The humor is delightfully British. Take for instance, this excerpt in which Rover (after being turned into a toy and bought by the mother) is taken home in a bag with various other purchased items (bear in mind that, at this early point in the story, Rover is a rather cheeky little pup):&quot;Rover soon managed to wriggle his head out of the paper. He smelt cake. But he found he could not get at it; and right down there among the paper bags he growled a little toy growl. Only the shrimps heard him, and they asked him what was the matter. He told them all about it, and expected them to be very sorry for him, but they only said:'How would you like to be boiled? Have you ever been boiled?''No! I have never been boiled, as far as I remember,' said Rover, 'though I have sometimes been bathed, and that is not particularly nice. But I expect boiling isn't half as bad as being bewitched.''Then you have certainly never been boiled,' they answered. 'You know nothing about it. It's the very worst thing that could happen to anyone - we are still red with rage at the very idea.'Rover did not like the shrimps, so he said: 'Never mind, they will soon eat you up, and I shall sit and watch them!'After that the shrimps had no more to say to him, and he was left to lie and wonder what sort of people had bought him.&quot;Yes, this is a children's book. But I bought and read it halfway through a very grueling masters program, and it was just the escape from academia that I needed. It's absurd, and silly, and light-hearted, and absolutely wonderful. I recommend it for children of all ages, especially the grown up children who need a quick breath of magic to liven up the reality of adulthood."},{"Title":"Roverandom","review":"This book was a delight for my 10-year-old (and me), even after already having read the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. A clever, enchanting story with lots of fun and unexpected twists.

With Tolkien's children's fiction, with the exception of THE HOBBIT, its not so much the quality of it but the fact that it exists. These activities culiminated in the composistion of THE HOBBIT. When Allen &amp; Unwin accepted it for publication and it became a runaway hit, they wanted more about 'hobbits'. This book, MR. BLISS, THE LOST ROAD, and THE SILMARILLION (OF BEREN &amp; LUTHIEN, the poetic form, was submitted with perhaps FARMER GILES as well)found its way to the publishing house in 1937. But Sir Stanely Unwin wanted not these but a hobbit sequel, of which we all know what happened with that.This being said, ROVERANDOM shows Tolkien delighting in the position of a story teller for his children. The love and warmth shows clearly in these pages, and while its not the best thing ever written, it does have its charms. Largely, however, this work is for Tolkien completists, and by and large will not win over any fans. But if you looking for a book to read to your younger children and you want it to be Tolkien, this is a good choice. But if they're a little older, give 'em the real meat and introduce them to that lovable Bilbo Baggins.

Boy 2 is smitten with the toy Rover, but Rover is more concerned about become real again, not just being some little boy's toy. one day on the beach, Rover slips out of Boy 2's pocket and waits in the sand for another magician to help guide him on his journey towards real-dog-hood again.this was a really creative story. and no wonder, i mean it is written by Tolkien and all. Rover spends equal time on earth, on the moon, and in the sea. the writing feels like a parent telling their child a story, which it is. this was written by Tolkien for his son (Boy 2) after he was distraught over losing his toy dog at the beach (Rover). Tolkien draws heavily from Norse mythology in the weaving of his story and has plenty of nods to (then) cultural references. there is a note section in the back of this edition that helps guide the reader who may not be the most familiar with the year 1925 - when this was originally written.complete with dragons, wizards, and the stuff dreams - and nightmares - are made of, Rover remained a realistic and sweet character. he meets lots of fun people and has lots of wacky experiences along the way, as any good adventurer does. this is a cute, fun, sweet and quick read for people of any age.fave quote: \\"The moon-dog did not blush, because he could not; and he did not say anything, but he went and sat down in a corner and wondered how much the old man knew of everything that went on, and everything tat was said, too.

They are concise and yet full."},{"Title":"Psalms 1-72 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"I have owned this fine book for almost 30 years. I just started looking at it again and thought I should write a review. At one time I spent over 6 months outlining all 150 of the Psalms. These 2 books were the main sources I used.Derek Kidner's 2 small books are incredibly full of insight. My version of these 2 books has 492 pages total. So maybe they are not so small as I think they are. I have spent hours reading and studying from these 2 books. I don't know of any author who can pack so much thought into so few words. These 2 books are great for sermon preparation and / or Sunday School class preparation. He gives you the big picture so well and helps you to see the big picture. He keeps you focused on what the Psalmist is saying. He is very good at giving meaning to particular words - the important words. And that so often is the key to interpretation of the Psalm. One way he does this is by showing you how the same words are used in other parts of the Bible. You learn about the Psalm and other parts of the Bible as well.These books are fine for reading, but I find them best to be read, studied, and re-read as I try to grasp the meaning of the Psalm. I find these 2 books on Psalms to be one of the first I go to when I want to study and gain insight into the Psalms. Your mind is filled with ideas and thoughts as you ponder the meaning of what the Psalmist is saying.Definitely, the best buy for the money."},{"Title":"Psalms 1-72 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"This has been considered one the best and most useful commentaries on Psalms for decades. Kidner is a genuine scholar, and he knows the difference between significant detail and meaningless trivia. He makes great choices in choosing how far to pursue a line of interpretation. His comments are succinct, scholary, and easy to understand. You do not need Hebrew to read this, and textual/grammatical issues are generally addressed in the footnotes.The average comment length per psalm is about 5 small pages, so it is not bloated but it is concise and thorough for the student, pastor, and layman. Can be used in group Bible study. This is a \\"hands on\\" work.He writes from a conservative evangelical position (which I appreciate), but he sees the church as fulfilling the promises made to Israel (I disagree with him on this). Despite my difference, I heartily recommend this as perhaps the best all-around commentary on Psalms. If you must only get one, this might be it. You can't go wrong with this one.You will probably want to buy both volumes."},{"Title":"Psalms 1-72 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"It is really hard to go wrong with Kidner on the Psalms. His treatment of Psalms 1-72 is concise, to the point, and pastoral. Kidner really has a gift for breaking down the Psalms into great outlines. He exercises brevity in a way that is very helpful to the working pastor. While this shouldn't be the only commentary you use on the Psalms, I do recommend it as one that should be referenced when preaching/teaching the psalter."},{"Title":"Psalms 1-72 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"I was required to get this commentary for a Psalms class I am taking for school, and I found that I love it!

Jesus is alive and reigning so its all good."},{"Title":"Ghost Ship (Doctor Who)","review":"Going into GHOST SHIP, I had rather low expectations. I'd read a lot of reviews slagging off everything from the plot to the characterization of the Fourth Doctor. Its ranking on Shannon Patrick Sullivan's charts placed it near the very bottom, and, although I had never read anything from this author before, Keith Topping's reputation for fiction writing isn't exactly stellar. To my utter shock and amazement, I really enjoyed it anyway.By far, the most ubiquitous criticism is that it's told in first-person narration from the point of view of the Fourth Doctor. And yet, at first glance, the character appears to be totally unlike any performance we'd ever seen Tom Baker give. He's nervous, unsure of himself, panicky, and awkward. At one point, he even runs off back to the TARDIS hell-bent on making a quick getaway. For the first ten or twenty pages, I didn't believe it in the slightest.But further on from that, I began thinking. The book is set in the void between THE DEADLY ASSASSIN and THE FACE OF EVIL, where the Doctor spent some unknown amount of time wandering through space and time alone. Is it possible that his already dark character could have dipped deeper? I began pondering some other moments that we had already seen of the Fourth Doctor's life. The graying, brooding figure we saw in his final season (particularly in LOGOPOLIS). The almost callous man who Sarah admonishes in PYRAMIDS OF DEATH for not seeming human. Yes, I decided. Yes, I could buy this as a continuation of the character, pushed a tad bit farther than we'd seen before, and without the usual humor that balanced out this part of him. It made me think and reflect on a character whose main source of development ended decades ago, which isn't a simple trick.Though to be fair to critics of this characterization, what I couldn't buy was the actual language that he used. First of all, it's difficult to imagine the Fourth Doctor actually sitting down to write something like his memoirs without getting fed up and wanting to save the universe or pop in on Da Vinci or something. But going further, I just can't see his prose being this flowery or this filled with clever similes and metaphors. Don't get me wrong; it's good, it just doesn't seem like the sort of thing that he would say.As for the rest of the novella, well, it's basically a ghost story (no big shocker, given the title), and as a ghost story it relies almost exclusively on the author's ability to evoke an appropriately creepy tone. Of other reviews, I've noticed that those who loathed the book didn't see any plausible atmosphere created, while those that liked the book did see that. Place me in the second column then. I found the book quite chilling.The plot is secondary to establishing the mood. We meet characters and see their conversations, more for the sake of developing them and their role in the ambiance than for any particular plot reasons. This can appear either as necessary scene setting or mindless padding, depending on your point of view. By the time we meet the bulk of the secondary characters, I was already absorbed in the flow of the story and accepted this in the manner in which I assume it was intended.GHOST SHIP has too much going against it to be really popular. If you don't like the characterization of the Fourth Doctor, you'll hate the book. If you don't like the atmosphere Topping attempts to create, you'll hate the book. Personally, I thought it was very good indeed, but I realize I'm never going to be in the majority on this. I'd recommend giving it a try though, even if you do end up detesting it. It's short and it's well paced, so you won't be wasting too much time; I read it in one quick sitting and enjoyed it enormously."},{"Title":"Crawlspace","review":"Crawlspace is a book that my friend Chuck had been recommending to me for years as it was his favorite book of all time. I finally got around to reading this and must say I really enjoyed it. It is the story of a lonely, childless couple who befriend a young drifter only to have him move into their house, or more specifically, under the house. Over time, they come to trust Richard Atlee enough to even invite him to live with them. But, eventually, all good things must end. Crawlspace is scary at times and sad at times but one thing for sure, you won't forget young Richard Atlee any time soon. This was written in the early 70's and may be difficult to find but if you do, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Crawlspace","review":"I read this book one night when I was home bored and had nothing better to do. I picked it up, started turning the pages and the images and story that unfolded have stayed with me ever since.

Stereotyping? I could just imagine what someone from AIM would say about it. I think if something like this were released today, there would be quite an outcry.Apart from that it's a fun diversion and a quick read - a little guilty pleasure on a summer afternoon.

No, contends Bea Johnson emphatically in Never Too Early to Write-a gem of a book which describes both a writing program and a way of thinking.Each chapter is chock-full of advice, tips, anecdotes, and, thoughtfully, samples of actual student work. In Chapters 1 and 2, Johnson makes the argument that kindergartners and first graders should be taught to write. To support her contention, she explains in detail the many benefits in doing so. One of the most important is that when students write, they are using letters and punctuation. Indeed, they are immersed in them. This, in turn, imbues the strange squiggles and marks with meaning. They are not so mysterious nor foreign anymore. They have a purpose. They can communicate thoughts, feelings, ideas. Other benefits include: enlarged vocabulary, enhanced phonetics and spelling, increased familiarity of sentence patterns and word discrimination, additional opportunities to think critically and creatively, and even increased self-esteem.At this point you may be thinking, that all sounds well and good, but how am I going to fit this into my already crowded day? The answer: Integrate the writing experiences into your other subjects. &quot;Writing,&quot; asserts Johnson, &quot;shouldn't be a once-a-week activity done on Friday afternoon, 20 minutes before the busses arrive.&quot; Johnson also contends that you &quot;will discover incredible truths&quot; about your teaching if you have your students write in the content areas. How? By having students write about the lesson, you will have immediate feedback-in black and white-about what they learnedand didn't learn.Chapter 3 delves into seven stages or benchmarks of writing: from scribbling to random lettering to conventional spelling. It is important, declares Johnson, that children should not be taught at a level beyond their capabilities.In the next chapter, Johnson discusses &quot;The Rules.&quot; Although they are an &quot;ideal&quot; and you won't be able to follow them all the time, they should, she states, at least be in the back of your mind. In a nutshell, an effective writing classroom is informal, open to experimentation, content oriented, supportive, affirming, and encourages &quot;table talk.&quot; The teacher &quot;provides students with the tools, time, and structure to write.&quot;&quot;The Big Four&quot; are discussed in Chapter 5. They are: Dictation, Drawing, Scribbling, and Temporary Spelling. There are a plethora of benefits to dictation, notes Johnson. First and foremost, the student &quot;realizes immediately that his spoken words have meaning and can be written down&quot; (emphasis mine). As the teacher or volunteer writes, the student is able to observe: left-to-right progression, punctuation, phonics, sentence structure, and more.&quot;Drawing,&quot; writes Johnson, &quot;becomes the child's rehearsal stage of writing.&quot; These illustrations are snapshots, so to speak, of the child's thinking. Scribbles are the beginning stages of writing. Here the child experiments with word and sentence formation, symbols, holding the writing instrument and more. As educators, we should not overlook these attempts. Rather, we should &quot;take advantage of the learning potential&quot; of them by asking the student what he or she has written. Temporary spelling, notes Johnson, &quot;is children's first attempts to write words using their best judgment about spelling.&quot; She then goes on to discuss the three stages of temporary spelling as well as the benefits described in research findings.In Chapters 6 through 15 Johnson discusses in detail ten writing strategies. Among them are: Individual Language Experience Stories (ILES); Journal Writing; Draw and Write; Pattern Stories; Class Newspaper.Johnson rounds out the book with a chapter on communicating with parents (which includes sample parent letters) and a chapter on conclusions, questions and answers.If you are interested in trying a writing workshop in your kindergarten or first grade classroom, this concise, approachable, highly useful volume that will help you accomplish your goal.Reviewed by the Education Oasis Staff"},{"Title":"Never Too Early to Write (Maupin House)","review":"I am very excited about this book and this program. I began using this program in just two months ago. The setting is a first semester, half-day kindergarten program. Over 30% of my students are English Language Learners, nearly 10% receive speech services, 5% are hearing impaired, and nearly 10% receive other special education services. Most are considered low-income. If this program produces results for us, it can work for anyone.The strategies in Never Too Early To Write are designed to lead each individual student to her full potential. Students express their own thoughts, feelings, and concerns. A teacher cannot help but connect with the children. Every student wants to be loved and respected as a unique person. Journal writing allows for a private moment with each student. Each child is working on skills that are meaningful to her. Once a concept is mastered, there is another to focus on.The reasons for beginning the program are clear, but the side effects were the most impressive. Writing is FUN! It is fun for me. It is fun for the paraprofessionals in the classroom. It is fun for the volunteers. It is fun for parents to see their children progress. Most importantly, it is fun for the students; they love it."},{"Title":"Never Too Early to Write (Maupin House)","review":"I am a writing teacher for Primary teachers and students.

The natural language Bea uses makes it enjoyable to read and easy to understand. Her philosophy that children don't need to be pushed in order to grow as writers makes a lot of sense.

The first few chapters are devoted to proving, with academic citations and several pages of student samples, the benefits of a writing program tailored to the abilities of younger children. This is not a new idea; Montessori preschools have been teaching young children to write before they can read for decades. Excluding the thesis-like chapters, the author's teaching advice could have been condensed into an on-line article or a FAQ pamphlet. Although the author has a few creative ideas on how to encourage writing in a classroom or group, she emphasizes journal writing and/or drawing. Even with the author's recommendation of ignoring punctuation and spelling, my son dislikes journal writing--so this book was of no help to me. The only tip I found in the book for a reluctant writer was on page 32--\\"go back to your desk and think a while;\\" the author claims students are usually motivated by seeing his/her peers writing in their journals and will think of something to write unless they're feeling sick. This might be true for group writing, but does not help tutors or home-schoolers working with students one on one.

Can you believe that?Other than that, this book is excellent. I was shocked to read about many things that we never hear about, things that happen daily beyond any jurisdiction. It isn't very long, it doesn't go into a lot of detail on each subject. It is more of a broad introductory book into the world of shipping."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Despite complaints by certain other reviewers, I was overall quite completely satisfied by Langewiesche's treatment of the topic of global commericial shipping. No single author can write a work that will satisfy all readers. Among the questions he must ask as he composes: Where shall I focus? In how much detail? Shall I be dry and matter-of-fact, or zoom in on the human drama and tragedy?To me, Langewiesche strikes just the right balance. In this slim, compact book he covers the major bases: dilapidated freighters transporting hazardous cargoes, slipshod maintenance, the desperate lives/careers of their crews, nefarious \\"shell corporations\\" that exploit 'globalism' in the further fattening of their Swiss bank accounts, smuggling, piracy, and terrorism. A frightening and otherwise-uncommented fact stated in the book is that Osama Bin Laden himself controls (or did at time of publication) a \\"ghost fleet\\" of some 20+ freighters for the transport of jihadists and arms. Couple this with Langewiesche's portrayal of the inherent lawlessness of the global ocean and you have the makings of our next 9/11.The middle portion of the book (the two chapters \\"On a Captive Sea\\" pg. 101 to \\"The Ocean's Way\\" ends on page 195) chronicle the Estonia ferry disaster. Think \\"Titanic\\" meets \\"Poseiden Adventure\\". Langewiesche's shocking portrayal of the Estonia's passengers climbing for their lives in a capsizing ship is like nothing to be found anywhere else. He knows just how to zoom in on dire individual plights, then pan out to the political in-fighting of the investigation boards comprised of Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish officialdom. Add to this the incindiary workings of the third-party conspirationalists (namely one Jutta Rabe). Then throw in the German shipbuilder Meyer Werft -- desperate to defend their technical reputation -- making their own investigation in order to sully the offical one and thus shift blame to the Estonians and Swedes. This narrative ranks with the Challenger and Chernobyl episodes in terms of technical-versus-political drama.In his last chapter \\"On the Beach\\" Langewiesche exposes the reality of the commercial shipbreaking business, centered on India's Alang region. Certainly it will come as a revelation, as it did to me, to learn that each year some 700 commercial tankkers and freighters, each massing some 10,000 plus tons each, are cut up for scrap on this forlorn island of desperate third-world poverty. The author brings out the catastrophic environmental and human toll this \\"business\\" brings. As said by one Indian in the book (unnamed), \\"Would you rather die first of starvation or by pollution?\\" Some choice.All in all, one will either like or dislike this book as a matter of ideology. The reader can either view it as an indictment of our global capitalistic materialistic hedonistic \\"free-trade\\" society (as if), or as a paramount example of \\"creative destruction\\" and opportunistic exploitation of the underdeveloped world's cheap labor and throwaway material resources. I choose the former."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"In William Langewiesche's \\"The Outlaw Sea\\", we learn about the politics, or lack there of, in the oceans that dominate our world. This is not a book that looks at the mysteries of the ocean like giant squids, tidal waves, perfect storms, etc. This is a book about how big, usally unnamed and European, capitalist squeeze out every dime of profit they can from the tanker trade.Once his theme is established the books then braches off into three main problems of sea trafficking, the surprisly high number of still sinking vessels, modern pirates, and the enviromental problems associated with dismantling ships.It's a fasinating report, all be it a tad dry at times, condensed into a brief 239 pages."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Disappointed. Title is great, but content is lacking. Mostly an excruciating recap of some notable maritime tragedies rather than a discussion of the issues associated with governance of the seas, UNCLOS, inability of coastal states to manage their coastlines, flags of convenience, etc."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I cant wait for the great wars of the sea.

I wounder what its like to be a repo man of the sea."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Considering that the subject matter of this book is shipwrecks, smuggling, castaways, piracy, and a host of other lurid ocean-related themes, I was surprised to find it on the tedious side.Langewiesche's basic strategy is to discuss shipwreck after shipwreck, and then investigate the seamy underworld of the shipping companies lurking behind the disasters, and the laws that have helped to engender the situation.But the book is poorly organized and Langewiesche gets distracted easily: for example, after going on and on about the wreck of the Estonia, he continues for a couple of dozen pages about the various conspiracy theories surrounding its sinking. Digressions like this are common.The book also has no logical beginning or ending, and I can't see why Langewiesche even divides the work into chapters. A glimpse at the titles of the chapters (e.g., \\"To the Ramparts,\\" \\"On a Captive Sea,\\" \\"The Ocean's Way\\") is enough to suggest that there is no progression of thought being realized in the book, and other than a general lament on the rough and shady nature of international shipping, the book ends up having little to offer.Certainly not in the way of entertainment!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The book should have been named \\" the Tragedy of Estonia\\".Langwiesche is an excellent contributor to the Atlantic monthly, unfortunately he seems to be under the impression that a book is simply a compilation of several articles strung together.You will hardly learn anything new from this book.Although he is an excellent writer he should really just sick to periodicals.See other 2 and 3 star reviews for more detail, they hit the nail on the head."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Hi , I can't review this book because I never received it ! All attempts to try to contact amazon failed .This sucks!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"While the cover blurbs on the book promise another \\"Prefect Storm\\" quality reading experience, it's a fine read, but it's not quite that good. The book is broken up into 3 sections, a pirate hijacking in the Asian seas, the Estonia ferry sinking in heavy seas, and the ship breaking beach at Alang, India. The pirate section is great. The ferry sinking less so because in explaining the political fallout, he goes over the same information multiple times. (Though I was shocked at the statistic he threw out that supposedly 20% of all Germans believe that the 9/11 World Trade Center attack was actually done by the United States against its own people.) The 3rd section about the ship breaking industry was the reason I'd picked up the book, but it spends most its space on the Greenpeace efforts to shut down Alang. The author admires Greenpeace more than I do. When during an interview with Greenpeace, he keeps asking what I think is a very interesting question and the Greenpeace representative keeps refusing to answer it, the author says that it's really his fault for asking the wrong question. And since the ship breaking section of the book is over 10 years old (even 5 years old when the book was published in 2004), it leaves the question unanswered about what happened with the whole Greenpeace movement to shut down Alang because I believe ships are still being broken down there, that they have not shut down."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book covers a wide range of subjects related to shipping and explains that many aspects of life at sea are unregulated, or regulated only on a voluntary or theoretical level, and that consequently, maritime life is just as dangerous as it has ever been. The book discusses flags of convenience, negligence in maintenance and inspections, piracy, and shipbreaking. Most of these topics stand alone as decent essays. However, Langewiesche tries to tie them together with vague lines in each chapter about the uncontrollable quality of the sea and anything having to do with it, a device that looks like a last-minute, unconvincing way of binding a collection of essays into a book. The longest essay is the excessive, 94-page treatment (out of a total of 239 pages) of the 1994 wreck of the Baltic ferry Estonia. Much of this section concerns media vampires and conspiracy theorists drawn to the tragedy. In this section, it is easy to forget that one is reading a book about the sea."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This is not the book I was expecting. Normally it would only have gotten three stars, for recycling three articles, only one of which was really of interest to me (on piracy), but the author is gifted, and his articulation of detail lifts the book to four stars and caused me to appreciate his final story on the poisonous deadly exportation of ship \\"break-up\\" by hand. It is a double-spaced book, stretched a bit, and not a research book per se.Two high points for came early on. The author does a superb job of describing the vast expanse of the ungovernable ocean, three quarters of the globes surface, carrying 40,000 wandering merchant ships on any given day, and completely beyond the reach of sovereign states. The author does a fine job of demonstrating how most regulations and documentation are a complete facade, to the point of being both authentic, and irrelevant.The author's second big point for me came early on as he explored the utility of the large ocean to both pirates and terrorists seeking to rest within its bosom, and I am quite convinced, based on this book, that one of the next several 9-11's will be a large merchant ship exploding toxically in a close in port situation--on page 43 he describes a French munitions ship colliding with a Norwegian freighter in Halifax. \\"Witnesses say that the sky erupted in a cubic mile of flame, and for the blink of an eye the harbor bottom went dry. More than 1,630 buildings were completely destroyed, another 12,000 were damaged, and more than 1,900 people died.\\"There is no question but that the maritime industry is much more threatening to Western ports than is the aviation industry in the aftermath of 9-11, and we appear to be substituting paperwork instead of profound changes in how we track ships--instead of another secret satellite, for example, we should redirect funds to a maritime security satellite, and demand that ships have both transponders and an easy to understand chain of ownership. There is no question that we are caught in a trap: on the one hand, a major maritime disaster will make 9-11 look like a tea party; on the other the costs--in all forms--of actually securing the oceans is formidable.Having previously written about the urgent need for a 450-ship Navy that includes brown water and deep water intercept ships (at the Defense Daily site, under Reports, GONAVY), I secure the fourth star for the author, despite my disappointment over the middle of the book, by giving him credit for doing a tremendous job of defining the challenges that we face in the combination of a vast sea and ruthless individual stateless terrorists, pirates, and crime gangs collaborating without regard to any sovereign state.I do have to say, as a reader of Atlantic Monthly, I am getting a little tired of finding their stuff recycled into books without any warning as to the origin. Certainly I am happy to buy Jim Fallows and Robert Kaplan, to name just two that I admire, but it may be that books which consist of articles thrown together, without any additional research or cohesive elements added (such as a bibliography or index), should come with a warning. I for one will be more alert to this prospect in the future.Having said that, I will end with the third reason I went up to four stars: the third and final story, on the poisonous manner in which we export our dead ships to be taken apart by hand in South Asia, with hundreds of deaths and truly gruesome working conditions for all concerned, is not one of the stories I have seen in article form before, it is a very valuable story, and for this unanticipated benefit, I put the book down a happy reader, well satisfied with the over-all afternoon.See also, with reviews:Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats are Hijacking the Global EconomyWater: The Fate of Our Most Precious ResourceBlue Frontier: Dispatches from America's Ocean Wilderness"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I came to this book as a person who spent over a dozen years in the ocean shipping industry. For me, William Langewische's The Outlaw Sea is a fascinating look at a subject with which I am intimately familiar.Langewiesche's gloomy, albeit accurate, portrayal of life at sea for the \`low-end' portion of the ocean shipping industry is marked by excellent research and even better writing. The book has some of the hallmarks of the best fiction. It unfolds dramatically and keeps the reader's attention. Langewiesche's portrayal of the passenger ferry Estonia is heartbreaking. The author pulls no punches. At one point, Langewiesche discusses the horror of the loss of 852 lives on the Estonia, notes the worldwide outpouring of grief (particularly in Northern Europe) but then pauses to mention that ferry accidents such as this are a routine way of life in the third world (in Asia and Africa in particular) and yet these accidents barely attract our attention. The terse, matter-of-fact fashion in which Langewiesche imparts this information has a greater impact than it would have if set out in a dogmatic fashion.Last, Langewiesche turns his eye to the ship breaking business in India. Vessels that have reached the end of their useful life (and as set out in the book a ship owner's definition of useful life is far longer than may be prudent for safe operation) are run onto beaches in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan where they are dismantled in a manner that endangers everyone involved. Life for these ship breakers is nasty, brutal and short. Langewiesche's portrayal is so well written that one can almost smell the befouled air that lingers over the work area. The author also sets out the political confrontation between the ship breakers and Greenpeace. It is an excellent overview of the conflict that arises between first-world political activists and third world throngs struggling to make a life for their families.I only take two minor issues with the author. First, in discussing the sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain, I think the author did not pay sufficient attention to the horrible decision of the Spanish government to deny safe harbor to the damaged vessel. It is mentioned in passing. The decision to force the Prestige out to sea, before she was damaged beyond repair and before there was a major loss of oil, into stormy and unsafe seas was as much, if not more, to blame for the environmental disaster that followed as the general condition of the vessel before the accident. The actions of the Spanish government in this regard were reprehensible. Second, Langewiesche makes much (rightfully) of the negative impact on foreign flag registration, specifically flags of convenience, in terms of vessel safety, poorly trained seamen, etc. However, it would have been useful to point out as a counterbalance the fact that the Exxon Valdez, the vessel responsible for one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history, was a U.S. flag vessel, built to U.S. flag standards, fully accountable to all U.S. maritime laws and regulations with U.S. officers and crew.This book is well written, informative, and interesting, whether or not one happens to be in this business. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in first rate, well researched and written non fiction."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This is not the book I was expecting. Normally it would only have gotten three stars, for recycling three articles, only one of which was really of interest to me (on piracy), but the author is gifted, and his articulation of detail lifts the book to four stars and caused me to appreciate his final story on the poisonous deadly exportation of ship \\"break-up\\" by hand. It is a double-spaced book, stretched a bit, and not a research book per se.Two high points for came early on. The author does a superb job of describing the vast expanse of the ungovernable ocean, three quarters of the globes surface, carrying 40,000 wandering merchant ships on any given day, and completely beyond the reach of sovereign states. The author does a fine job of demonstrating how most regulations and documentation are a complete facade, to the point of being both authentic, and irrelevant.The author's second big point for me came early on as he explored the utility of the large ocean to both pirates and terrorists seeking to rest within its bosom, and I am quite convinced, based on this book, that one of the next several 9-11's will be a large merchant ship exploding toxically in a close in port situation--on page 43 he describes a French munitions ship colliding with a Norwegian freighter in Halifax. \\"Witnesses say that the sky erupted in a cubic mile of flame, and for the blink of an eye the harbor bottom went dry. More than 1,630 buildings were completely destroyed, another 12,000 were damaged, and more than 1,900 people died.\\"There is no question but that the maritime industry is much more threatening to Western ports than is the aviation industry in the aftermath of 9-11, and we appear to be substituting paperwork instead of profound changes in how we track ships--instead of another secret satellite, for example, we should redirect funds to a maritime security satellite, and demand that ships have both transponders and an easy to understand chain of ownership. There is no question that we are caught in a trap: on the one hand, a major maritime disaster will make 9-11 look like a tea party; on the other the costs--in all forms--of actually securing the oceans is formidable.Having previously written about the urgent need for a 450-ship Navy that includes brown water and deep water intercept ships (at the Defense Daily site, under Reports, GONAVY), I secure the fourth star for the author, despite my disappointment over the middle of the book, by giving him credit for doing a tremendous job of defining the challenges that we face in the combination of a vast sea and ruthless individual stateless terrorists, pirates, and crime gangs collaborating without regard to any sovereign state.I do have to say, as a reader of Atlantic Monthly, I am getting a little tired of finding their stuff recycled into books without any warning as to the origin.

The six chapters function as semi-independent essays (bits of which appeared in The Atlantic), within an overall thesis that the world's oceans are essentially places of anarchy, and civilization exists only tenuously (at best) aboard seagoing vessels.Chapter One introduces the reader to this anarchic world of flags of convenience, shadow ownership, holding companies, the cheapest crews money can buy, and unsafe, decrepit ships. This is done via the case of the Kristal, a 27-year-old tanker carrying molasses and a Croatian, Spanish, and Pakistani crew when it split in two and sank in off the coast of Spain in February 2001. The disaster is reconstructed from the testimony of the few survivors, and concludes with furtive settlements to them and an utter inability to determine who actually owned the ship. Through this, Langewiesche describes how most shipping is regulated by the International Marine Organization (a UN agency), and, rather depressingly, how -- despite all kinds of conventions, agreements, regulations, and inspections -- ships are constantly sinking at sea and lives are being lost.Chapter Two is about security, both of ports and of ships. The vast majority of modern commercial piracy takes place near the Straights of Malacca, and Langewiesche takes the reader through one such case -- the October 1999 hijacking of the $10 million Japanese cargo ship Alondra Rainbow and its $10 million cargo of aluminum. Again, Langewiesche reconstructs the event through individual testimony and court records: from the Indonesian pirate leader's planning via cell phone with a Chinese boss, to the storming of the ship by multinational gang of Malays, Thais, Chinese, and others, to the ship's disappearance, and the pirates' eventual capture and prosecution by India. The disappearance is especially fascinating in this era of GPS and satellite imaging, and an important digression is made on the impossibility of tracking, never mind identifying all the ships at sea (some 30 million by one U.S. Coast Guard estimate). Anyone concerned about terrorists using boats or ports to deliver WMDs to the doorstep of the U.S. will probably not want to read this section, as it is rather chilling stuff.The very brief third chapter provides a little more background on how international regulations work in practice, here in the case of oil spills. This first grew into a major concern following a series of incidents in the mid-1970s, and blossomed into a full political issue after the Exxon Valdez crash. Langewiesche shows how American and European bureaucracies have responded over the last several decades, and how ineffectual these new rules regulations have been.Chapters four and five (totaling around 100 pages) deal with the September 1994 sinking of the ferry Estonia in rough Baltic waters, killing more than 850 people. And if you thought \\"The Perfect Storm\\" was heartbreaking, wait until you read this. The reconstruction (again, from survivors and the massive legal record) makes for terrifying reading, and no one who reads it will ever take a ride on a Baltic ferry. It's brilliant writing, tackling both the furious legal and technical debate about the cause of the disaster, and the harrowing human side, as people literally claw and climb over each other to survive. At times, the reconstruction gets a little too colorful as the attempts to show how most of the people become Darwinian animals get a bit much, but it's still nightmare-inducing stuff. It's an incredibly convoluted and contested tale, but one that does a very effective job of showing how the ocean can quickly reduce order to chaos and how the failure of regulation can lead to large tragedy.The final chapter is somewhat tangential to the book's main thrust, as it deals with what happens to ships at the end of their lives rather than the chaos that rules the high seas. Here, Langewiesche covers the shipbreaking beach at Alang, India. Here, ships come to die, driven ashore and then manually broken down in scrap metal and salvageable parts by poorly paid crews who live in squalid work camps and are exposed to all manner of toxins from the dead ships. Various activist campaigns have brought world attention to the plight of these workers, but Langewiesche points out that shipbreaking is a booming field and even more wretched facilities exist elsewhere in South Asia. What the responsibility of shipbuilding nations is becomes a very murky matter and there are no easy answers.This is a very good book, and each chapter stands on its own as an accessible introduction to one or two maritime topics which could easily merit entire books. Langewiesche is very good at blending travel reportage, investigative interviews, and archival research to create very compelling stories. Throughout, even though the topics can be rather abstract legally or technically arcane, he always writes with great compassion and clarity about the people who are affected."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"\\"The Outlaw Sea\\" is as good an introduction as one can find to the marvel and mystique of the ocean world-a frontier were states, businesses, pirates, crewmen, and scavengers vie for freedom, livelihood, and control. It is a world that is as exciting as it is dangerous-a perennial clash between the desire to place under control and the reality that the open seas are simply too vast to be governed.William Langewiesche, writer for the Atlantic, looks at the various aspects of the shipping industry and chronicles its main characteristics and hazards. He writes about old ships that pass lax inspections and end up in accidents that damage the environment or kill people; he narrates the hazards of traversing though waters mired with pirates; and he even discusses the end-point of many ships, as they sold for scrap, usually in South Asia.Throughout this story comes the dialectic between the chaos of the sea and the attempts by governments to bring the whole edifice under control. Characteristically, he tells of the various efforts and fears of the US Coast Guard about the potential of a terrorist attack carried out through a merchant ship-a likelihood that is much feared but almost impossible to protect against.In the end comes a balanced account of the realities of the sea. Save one narrative that is slightly overdrawn, the story is poised and well-focused, though at times it could have used more background and analysis instead of storytelling. But the underlying theme-that the chaos of the sea is unlikely to managed, comes across as powerfully as it could."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The book begins strongly, colorfully describing the byzantine world of ship registry, possible terrorism, and modern-day pirates. But when it turns to maritime disasters, the author chooses a selection of ship sinkings which take entirely too much of the book. His exhaustive description of the wreck and great loss of life of the auto ferry Estonia in 1994 takes up almost an entire third of the book and exhausts the reader. And somehow he misses the point of the book. The book ends on stronger ground with his coverage of the largely unregulated salvage of hundreds of commercial vessels each year, raising important ecological and social issues, though the book kind of dribbles to a close as if the author needed to complete the book by page 239.I liked the book for all that. The author's coverage is a bit shallow (pun intended) of a vastly important and interesting subject. He would do well with a follow-up, picking up where this one leaves off."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Control of the world's oceans was once considered a primal goal of the foreign policy of many nations. The advent and spread of air, then jet travel has reduced the importance of the sea, especially in terms of human transportation. But the sea is still the medium by which most of our goods are shipped, and as world trade increases, more and more produce is shipped over the ocean every day. This dichotomy then leads to an interesting situation. As people increasingly move about by air, the importance, and danger of sea travel recedes from public attention and the political limelight. But as more and more of the goods we use everyday are brought to us from places oceans away, the importance of oceanic commerce grows. Hence the growth in the shipping and shipbuilding industries and piracy. This then is the subject of this book, industry, crime, chaos and anarchy on the world's oceans.The book focuses on several parts of man's current relation with the sea. One chapter is devoted to shipbreaking, or the destruction of old ships. This environmentally hazardous and dangerous job often gets relegated to third world countries such as India. Another chapter examines piracy, and shows how some of the world's most traveled waters are often some of the most dangerous. Case in point are the waters between Malaysia and Indonesia. A third chapter examines the international shipping industry, and shows how shipping companies often sail under flags of multiple nations to help the bottom line and avoid government inspections.All told, this book shows how the world's oceans are a world apart from the land-based countries we are all used to. Rules that apply on land often do not on the high seas, and greed is often the determining factor in what goes and what does not. This book is especially relevant given the current war on terror."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The title is the premise.The premise is interesting. The writing journalistic and a bit pedantic (though highly acclaimed on the books back cover).It's interesting in parts, like the \\"recycling\\" that goes onin India and the fact that almost all carriers fly flags ofconvenience, the real owners often hidden behinddouble blind dummy corporations. It is a real warning note on the dangers inherent in the lack of regulation in shipping.I was surprised to find that large scale piracy of freightersexists today (on the order of roughly 1-2 ships a week, world-wide).The book is essentially a collection of 4 or so articles.While interesting, I think it lacked overall cohesion."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Exploring the edges of order in the modern age, Langewiesche again demonstrates that the world is getting larger, not smaller.In a recurring theme (compare the 'pencil whipping' ValuJet employees certifying the payload of flight 592), The Outlaw Sea highlights the contrast between the bureaucratic fictions of the regulators (in this case, the IMO) and the sobering vastness of the world's oceans and the consequent intrinsic unruliness of their traffic.With crisp, distilled, yet lyrical prose, and examples ranging from Spanish sailors to supranational pirates, from devastatingly impoverished shipbreakers of South Asia to paternalistic European environmentalists, Langewiesche uses the sea as a lens through which to focus on the unbridgeable gaps in perspective between rich and poor, East and West, order and chaos."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"If the attacks on the World Trade Center towers made you nervous, then this book will load you with solid reasons to be fully frightened about the potential for even more destructive terrorist attacks.&quot;The challenge is daunting. The United States has ninety-five thousand miles of coastline and more than a hundred seaports capable of handling large ships. It is the most active sea-trading nation on earth, accounting for a large percentage of long-distance maritime traffic worldwide and annually accomodating more than sixty-thousand port calls by oceangoing ships, the great majority of which are foreign flagged, owned by offshore companies, and crewed by anonymous sailors -- almost all of whom come from troubled parts of the world where America is resented, corruption is rife, and authentic documentation can easily be bought,&quot; Langewiesche explains.The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, focused attention on aircraft smashing into buildings. Ships are mostly ignored, except for &quot;big bang&quot; fantasies generated by Sept. 11, 2001. However, an equal or worse disruption of trade is possible simply by running a large oil tanker onto shore in a vulerable region -- think Exxon Valdez, and the impact of a larger spill on San Francisco, or Seattle, or Boston, or any other of those hundred US seaports.Can terrorists get a ship? Pirates already seize dozens of ships every year, and it often takes weeks before the ship is recovered. Al Qaeda already owns 20 ocean-going ships. Tankers have inflicted billions of dollars of damage on coastal regions for decades; now, think of this being done deliberately. The federal building in Oklahoma City was demolished by fertilizer and fuel oil -- in 1917, a French munitions ship blew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in a blast so massive that it briefly bared the bottom of the harbour.Despite an impressive bureaucratic and paper facade, ocean shipping is virtually unregulated. The total chaos of trade is an open invitation to the greedy, the pirates, the terrorists and anyone else with modest means and massive hatreds. Ships are the world's best cargo carriers, they are the essence of globalization and low prices in the US; in the hands of the world's world terrorists, they are also awesome weapons.In brief, it leaves Americans and the industrial world with a choice: either live with the &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; of ocean-bound terrorism, or develop a system equivalent to NORAD that was created to provide aerial security during the Cold War.This book is awesome. Read it, and you'll weep with rage at the $200 billion War on Iraq while leaving the &quot;cargo door entrance&quot; to America as an open, unprotected and deadly invitation to each and every terrorist."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Langewiesche is a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and has written several books that combine hard reportage with the more ephemeral qualities of a travel writer. In this case, Langewiesche's goal is to illustrate with bold examples the ungovernability of the sea. For him, this is a law of nature, but it is also a consequence of the inability of the laws of men to deal with sea's expanses. His case studies, if you will, are many, but he spends the most time on a few memorable stories: the modern day pirate attack on the Alondra Rainbow in 1999; the post-apocalyptic landscape of the world's most heavily trafficked ship graveyard, the beaches of Alang, India; and the wreck of the ferry Estonia on which at least 852 people died when it went down in a storm in the Baltic Sea in 1994. The subtext in all of these stories is that the tragedies contained within are, at least partly, a result of the inability of modern societies to govern the seas. The greater implication, as Langewiesche makes clear, is that such lawlessness and statelessness make the sea fertile for the operations of lawless, stateless terrorists. The sea is everywhere, but it is nowhere in the eyes of the law. These timely concerns, and Langewiesche's sturdy prose elevate a book of riveting tales of disasters at sea to a book of more weighty importance."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"How do you pronounce this man's name? He has a wonderful way with words and I think I am going to subscribe to the Atlantic Monthly just so I can read more of his writing. This book was really scary at times and I couldn't put it down. What I like most about the author is that he doesn't try to force his opinions on the readers. Or if he does, it isn't obtrusive. His description at the end of the shipbreaking yards in India are incredible and I would love to see pictures of them."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I could not put this book down. Some other reviewers' complaints (too many digressions, no central theme) are precisely what I like about it. Great stuff!Best of all, Langewiesche is a great writer. It was a joy to read poetic sentences that were not poetic for their own sake. Langewiesche is a good writer who does not write good sentences merely to dazzle but to actually tell us something.If this book is any indication, I'm ordering all of his others and look forward to reading them."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Some of the reviewers here have detailed some of the books short comings and I do not think they are being unfair. My review is going to be focus only on the positive, because I not only like this author, but I found the book extremely enjoyable. The author talks to us about some different aspects of the current state of ocean shipping across the world. He covers areas from recent ship wreaks to pirate encounters. He even takes the reader into the world of ship breaking where these massive structures are reduced to bite sized bits of steel. The book is fast paced and very interesting.Sure, over half of the book focuses on one car ferry sinking in the mid 90's, but unless you are familiar with the story, it is interesting. I kept wondering how he got so much detail. He covers the sinking in his somewhat off center style. If you read his other book about the World Trade Center then you can appreciate it. He just looks at the world with a bit of sly humor and an odd angle that makes his story telling that much more interesting.Overall I thought the book was great. The stories were interesting and somewhat unique. He injected just the right amount of drama and detail to make the reader hurry to the next page. Could he have spent more time on any one section of the book, probably, but he is writing as much for the readers enjoyment as to tell a story. You may want this or that changed with the book, but at the end of the day it is an interesting, and at times exciting, book that is well written."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The author is a journalist, and journalists are taught to keep the reader's attention by emphasizing individual stories and human interest over statistics, which are supposedly boring. Consequently, this book is a collection of stories. We get to spend time with both pirates and their victims in the Indian Ocean, with the crews of sinking, leaky oil tankers, with the investigators of the sinking of an Estonian ferry, and with shipbreakers on India's Alang beach.The stories are great, but they only paint details and leave the reader hungry for the broad picture. There are few figures. We read, for example, that there are over 40,000 large ships on the ocean, but there is no indication of where this estimate comes from. If the ocean is chaos, how do we know how many ships are on it? Also, what does \\"large\\" mean? I would have been interested in a table of number of ships by size category, with the source of the data and the author's assessment of their accuracy. We also hear that most ships sail under flags of convenience. Here also, a table of how many ships fly each flag would have given some perspective.The same pattern is repeated throughout the book. All the issues are presented through anecdotes, without quantification. For example, we know there is piracy, but not how prevalent it is. At the end of the book, we don't know whether the stories are examples of trends with broad significance or are simply random isolated cases.The book is also lacking in cross-referencing information. There is only a table of contents with cryptic titles like \\"The wave makers\\" and no index. The only maps are in the lining of the cover, and there are no photographs, which leaves too much to the imagination."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book is on several different aspects of the merchant shipping industry. As a former radio officer on U.S. merchant tankers from 1986 to 1995, I can say that lawlessness, choas and crime does not apply much to U.S. vessels. For other vessels that are flags of convenience the story is a lot different. I think this author is a gifted writer. The story about the hijacking of the Alondra Rainbow in the Malacca Straits is very interesting and suspenseful. There can't be a better read about the sinking of the Ro/Ro vessel Estonia than this book offers. It is worth the price of purchase just for this narrative alone. The end of the book about the shipbreaking operations in India is also interesting. The author seems to get into a bit of the \\"save the environment\\" mentality though, and since I think this guy lives in Seattle he may be a bit of an environmental nut. But that doesn't come out much in the book except a little towards the end. His overall theme is the damage that is caused to merchant vessels (and the people riding them) due to the carlessness or fraud of owners, governments, ship's agents, maritime authorities, etc.A very good book about merchant ships disasters (from both natural and human causes) is Disasters at Sea by Richard Cahill.The merchant shipping industry is not quite as outlaw as the author might suggest. The only way any nation could put a nuke on a merchant vessel and light it off in one of our ports would be to do it in complete secrecy. I believe it would have to be done by a state government. Having a more in depth knowledge of how the merchant shipping industry works, I don't think a bunch of terrorist could pull this off. The author does not go into this possible scenario, but given the theme of the book it does perhaps lead people to draw their own conclusions about that.Very good work by the author on this book though. I highly recommend it. His research is excellent and his style of writing is also excellent. That combination makes for a very good read IMHO."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"William Langewiesche's excellent book could be seen on one level as just a collection of harrowing, if wonderfully told, sea stories. His writing, though vivid, is understated, and can carry as much freight, so to speak, in one or two sentences as some writers pack into entire chapter. Even on this very superficial level, this title is both riveting and educational reading.But the deeper you look into this book, the more there is to uncover. I read it during a news cycle when the threat of seaborne terrorism was once again in the headlines, and it was certainly sobering to see how easily how ships in what one reviewer called &quot;the low end of the shipping industry&quot; can disappear almost at will from the world's seas, reappearing in a new port under a new name, with a new flag, and even a markedly different appearance.Langewiesche's key point is that the world's oceans are an outlaw place -- in the original, literal definition of the word as outside the protection, or even beyond the reach, of law. On the high seas, each ship is to one or another degree, its own absolute monarchy. When crimes occur, where can they be prosecuted -- by whom, and under what authority? (The author's recounting of one memorable case where modern-day pirates were tried in India vividly proves his point.)Law and order tend to break down at sea in another way too, as the sinking of the ferry Estonia made clear. As the ferry began to go under, Langewiesche tells how civilization fell apart under the simple and inescapable need for survival. Thieves even began stealing jewelry right off the bodies of their fellow passengers -- before themselves going to their deaths, appropriately enough. Disaster at sea provides horrible proof for how thin the veneer of civilized society really is.All this makes for disturbing, as well as fascinating, reading. The ocean is a world where few humans feel at home, and fewer would be able to survive for any length of time if their comfortable ships or planes were taken away from them. William Langewiesche's understated but revealing book illuminates this world in a way that should replace romantic visions with a very sobering understanding of reality."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book reads like 4 or 5 magazine articles that have been strung together. Each article focuses on some sort of disaster involving the seas - ship wreck due to poor maintenance, oil spills, piracy, loss of life in a ferry disaster, and the tear down of old ships in India. There is a loose connection between the articles involving chaos on the seas (mostly man-made but also natural) but not enough to make a coherent book. There are times when I wondered what the point of the book was besides passing on some interesting stories. In the introduction he tried to link the \\"outlaw sea\\" to terrorism but that idea was never reintroduced or significantly supported.Read the book if you're interested in maritime disasters. Skip the chapters that don't interest you because none are essential. (The Estonia ferry disaster drags on for over a hundred pages and I was never quite sure what the point was.)"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"With the news exploding about pirates off the Somali coast, it diverts the public's attention from the more threatening area of piracy in the Straits of Malacca and other nearby waters of southern Asia.Thankfully, this book exposes that nefarious world to us but it doesn't just stop there. The focus is on how our oceans are the last frontier where rules really have no effect at all. Issues such as shipbreaking (mainly seen by the Western world as something which happens exclusively in a certain part of India yet is exists all over the map), ship safety relating to inspections, safety standards and how the pressure to deliver cargoes in less than seaworthy ships leads to disasters also are brought to light.The only strange thing was the choice to devote close to 200 pages on the passenger ferry sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic Sea. After I read the one chapter, I thought the author wrapped up the topic well but he went on for another chapter which I eventually gave up on as I felt it was too much detail on ground already covered."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I acquired Mr. Langewiesche's book based, I believe, on a flattering review in The Economist and that by itself shows that the book has to be good. It is definitely and it provides an enjoyable read. Mr. Langewiesche's mastery of his subject is obvious. He has done a lot of research and commendably interviewed lots of people before writing an authoritative and serious book, yet without pomposity or any pretense to save the world.His premise is most enjoyable: the more you regulate the High Seas - through international organizations or otherwise - the more messy and ungovernable they become ! Quite interesting indeed and probably required reading for bureaucrats, particularly those in Brussels purporting to regulate the minutiae of Europeans' lives.....The chapter on piracy is great, but the book was published in 2004 so the information is out of date as it could not include the new \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" environment in Somalia. Too bad because I am sure Mr. Langewiesche would have written some most enjoyable pages on that topic.This being said, the chapters devoted to the story of the Estonia - a ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994 with considerable loss of life - are too long in my view. A horrible tragedy it was, for sure, and the characters trying to turn it into a conspiracy by the CIA and the like - some of them real crackpots - are amusing but after a while one understands the reasons for the ship's demise and the rest of the minutiae of the story loses interest.On the other hand, the final chapter dealing with the shipwrecking in industry in Gujarat is required reading for anyone with an interest in what actually happens to modern ships when they become so old that they cannot carry even the safest cargo, such as sugar molasses - the stuff will simply melt away in the sea if the pile of floating rust the ship has become just breaks up and sinks and who cares about the crew anyway....- and frankly the tale is quite frightening.A nice and interesting book it is. Do read it but remember that it was written some years ago and perhaps some of the details of the Erika story can be skipped."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book is a compilation of previously published materials that lack a unifying theme. Although the information presented is interesting, the author fails to tie together the topics into a meaningful whole. In the end, he reaches no conclusions. Worth reading from the library, but I wouldn't buy the book again."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"THE OUTLAW SEA takes the reader on a journey across the seas and examines the variety of ways that life on the ocean functions without the rule of law. Each section examines a different concern, from vessels that should never be sent out to sea because of age and their decrepit condition to modern day pirates; Langewiesche brings each problem to the forefront but merely scratches the surface of each. Rather than focus on a particular type of maritime calamity, Langewiesche decides to give the reader a cursory examination of the many problems that are out on the oceans. The final section, an examination of the shipbreaking industry on the beach at Alang, India gives the reader a taste of what could have been. A fascinating look at a little known and dangerous venture which Langewiesche handles with compassion and aplomb that makes you realize that any one of these concerns would have been a valid problem to examine in greater detail. As it stands THE OUTLAW SEA serves merely as brief glance at many serious problems, but not giving any one problem the investigation it deserves. Couple this with the occasional example of purple prose:\\"There was no God to turn to for mercy. There was no government to provide order....Love only slowed people down. A pitiless clock was running. The ocean was completely in control.\\"And you end up with a book that was a great idea but lacks the intensity of research to make it anything more than a curiosity."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"An exceptional investigation written with great descriptive detail and empathy."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Description of this book did not live up to the actual writing. not very memorable"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"the writer knows how to write but one and one half short story(maybe for esquire?) for an expensive book, means short-changing the readerhalf this mini- book is exciting, but the other half reads like a boring report from some boring committee"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The author is a good writer, BUT, where in this piece of nonfiction are the index, bibliography, and footnotes.

But freedom at sea can lead to such manifestations as piracy, and not just in the swashbuckling days of yore; it could also lead to corporate irresponsibility and malfeasance. William Langewiesche's _The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime_ (North Point Press) collects and expands upon his previous magazine articles on this theme. All of us are dependent upon international trade, and few of us understand how it works or in what ways it is working badly or dangerously, unless we hear about a capsizing or an oil spill. There are a lot more of those than we hear about, and a lot more crime on the sea than even governments acknowledge. Langewiesche's book is a fine way for lubbers to get to know how traditional maritime freedom is endangering them.Before World War II, ships were customarily built in a country, were registered in that country, flew the flag of that country, and sailed for the profit of businessmen in that country. Ironically, the United States began the current anarchical system in a pretense of neutrality during the pre-Pearl Harbor war, registering in Panama ships bringing needed supplies to Britain. The practice became widespread in the succeeding decades, with many ships now sailing under &quot;flags of convenience.&quot; They might be registered in countries that have no navy and even no coastline, and the countries involved can get relatively small fees, which are actually almost pure profit. The countries don't pursue administrative niceties like taxes, labor laws, safety inspections, and so on, and the corporations which own the ships don't mind avoiding such things, either. Among the cases described here are a too-old ship (with full inspection documents) broken in half by stormy seas. Pirates can take advantage of the lax laws by making a ship disappear; capture, repaint, rename, and reflag the vessel, and it vanishes from the seas. Seas are big, ships leave no tracks, and patrol ships and aircraft can see only a tiny percentage of any hunting ground. Policing the oceans from such attacks is not now possible.The longest episode in the book tells of the _Estonia_, a giant luxury ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994, with a loss of 852 of 989 passengers and crew. A victim of faulty design, poor maintenance, or even a bomb (none of the extensive investigations afterwards has satisfied everyone), the narrative here of well-chosen characters trying to escape from the swiftly-sinking ship is fast and terrifying. The book ends with a part of the maritime business that few people ever consider: what happens to the worn-out ships? Salvaging used to be a thriving business in our country and others; reclaiming the metal and reusing it was good for profits and good for the environment. However, showing the same pattern of lack of regulation and reduction of the job to the cheapest source available, shipwrecking has gone to places like India, where poorly equipped and poorly paid workers are glad of the job, even if it means almost constant danger from the unplanned movement of heavy objects or the inhalation of poisons. The shipping industry, Langewiesche writes, is &quot;not exactly a criminal industry, but it is an amoral and stubbornly anarchic one.&quot; This is a deeply disturbing book, written with cool detachment. Technology and international organizations have not made improvements in the way the vital global trade is conducted. Profits are more important than anything, the sea promises the freest of trading, no one seems to be learning from the lessons described here, and no one should expect these dangerous situations to be changed anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"William Langewiesche is an excellent journalist, and his writing is hard-hitting and unvarnished. This book is a great read, but its scope is quite narrow. Unusually, I would have enjoyed it more had it been twice as long. Readers are treated to in depth profiles of a few incidents that support the book's thesis, but the separate threads are not satisfactorily tied together. The stories he does tell, however, are gripping and frightening. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I picked up William Langewiesche's The Outlaw Sea after having read his compelling series of articles for the Atlantic Monthly that make the bulk of this book. The tale of modern-day piracy he explored in the Atlantic was amazing and something I had never thought possible before. In this book, Langewiesche expands on his thesis: that the sea is immune to the laws of man.With the probing, empathic narrative of an investigative journalist, Langewiesche shows how modern shipping is almost completely unregulated, run by shadowy figures, and accountable to no one. The result is piracy on the open seas, official corruption, and environmental havoc. For instance, he explains how when megaships reach the end of their lives, they are rammed onto the coast of India where workers take apart the polluted hulls for scrap. Langewiesche notes the devastation to beach and the unsafe conditions the workers face. But he also points out that workers are far better off for having these jobs than they otherwise would be working at best in subsistence agriculture. He also poignantly recounts the stories of the Kristal and the Estonia, victims of legal unaccountability and the cold viciousness of the sea.Langewiesche outlines the bureaucratic impotence, and sometimes obstructionism, of the international system regulating the oceans, but he offers no recommendations or solutions. It seems he doesn't think there is a solution, and he is sadly convincing in this pessimistic outlook.If you read Langewiesche's Atlantic articles, you have already read much of this book, but it might be still worth getting it if only for the final chapter on India. Otherwise, this book is wonderfully written and very interesting."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I came to this book as a person who spent over a dozen years in the ocean shipping industry. For me, William Langewische's The Outlaw Sea is a fascinating look at a subject with which I am intimately familiar.Langewiesche's gloomy, albeit accurate, portrayal of life at sea for the \`low-end' portion of the ocean shipping industry is marked by excellent research and even better writing. The book has some of the hallmarks of the best fiction. It unfolds dramatically and keeps the reader's attention. Langewiesche's portrayal of the passenger ferry Estonia is heartbreaking. The author pulls no punches. At one point, Langewiesche discusses the horror of the loss of 852 lives on the Estonia, notes the worldwide outpouring of grief (particularly in Northern Europe) but then pauses to mention that ferry accidents such as this are a routine way of life in the third world (in Asia and Africa in particular) and yet these accidents barely attract our attention. The terse, matter-of-fact fashion in which Langewiesche imparts this information has a greater impact than it would have if set out in a dogmatic fashion.Last, Langewiesche turns his eye to the ship breaking business in India. Vessels that have reached the end of their useful life (and as set out in the book a ship owner's definition of useful life is far longer than may be prudent for safe operation) are run onto beaches in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan where they are dismantled in a manner that endangers everyone involved. Life for these ship breakers is nasty, brutal and short. Langewiesche's portrayal is so well written that one can almost smell the befouled air that lingers over the work area. The author also sets out the political confrontation between the ship breakers and Greenpeace. It is an excellent overview of the conflict that arises between first-world political activists and third world throngs struggling to make a life for their families.I only take two minor issues with the author. First, in discussing the sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain, I think the author did not pay sufficient attention to the horrible decision of the Spanish government to deny safe harbor to the damaged vessel. It is mentioned in passing. The decision to force the Prestige out to sea, before she was damaged beyond repair and before there was a major loss of oil, into stormy and unsafe seas was as much, if not more, to blame for the environmental disaster that followed as the general condition of the vessel before the accident. The actions of the Spanish government in this regard were reprehensible. Second, Langewiesche makes much (rightfully) of the negative impact on foreign flag registration, specifically flags of convenience, in terms of vessel safety, poorly trained seamen, etc. However, it would have been useful to point out as a counterbalance the fact that the Exxon Valdez, the vessel responsible for one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history, was a U.S. flag vessel, built to U.S. flag standards, fully accountable to all U.S. maritime laws and regulations with U.S. officers and crew.This book is well written, informative, and interesting, whether or not one happens to be in this business. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in first rate, well researched and written non fiction."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This is one scary book. Pirates, murders, breakups at sea, the loss of the huge ferry Estonia with many innocent passengers and so on. It is well written, but it is sort of like if somebody wrote a book about all the people who had been horribly murdered in public restrooms. I don't know how many of those there have been in the last 100 years, but let's say there were fifty and suppose I were to gruesomely describe ten of those. After reading that book you'd never be able to walk into the men's (or ladies) room again without getting the shudders. You'd likely be buying adult Huggies to avoid the whole possiblity of having to take the chance.Well, that's the way this book is. It's scary, and after you read it you will have to think twice about getting within a hundred miles of any large body of water. That's you, of course. Now I live on an island, so what the hell am I supposed to do."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The book as a whole provides a detailed and engaging sense of the lawlessness and disorder that takes place on the ocean and near its coasts. The stories are based on current events and add a great deal of drama to his investigative writing. Its the kind of book I was eager to discuss with my friends and family after reading each chapter. As an ocean lover, but not a frequent sailor, its a great find and gives a rarely told perspective on what actually takes place with the world's ships. The threats of terrorism, piracy, the difficulties of scrapping ships, and the contrast of the way governments try to regulate the ocean with the practical realities of the ocean are thought provoking and fascinating. What a pleasure this book was!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I come from a commercial fishing background and I'm always looking for a good sea story. This one happens to be true, terrifyingly so. It inspired the plot for my first thriller, Blindfold Game."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"\\"The Outlaw Sea\\" is a real page-turner about a wild, lawless frontier that affects all of us. With so much of the raw materials of civilization shipped by freighter -- machinery, vehicles, food, oil -- you'd think shipping would be more closely regulated and better protected. But the author shows us how it's in the best interests of those who own the shipping lanes for there NOT to be much regulation. Ships, crews, and cargos are all, ultimately, expendable. It's more profitable to lose a ship here and there than for the navies and marine authorities of the world to get serious about policing the waves. Hence, we learn that inspections, even in ports where the authorities are relatively uncorrupt (which is rare) mean very little, and piracy is surprisingly common in the 21st century. You also get a look at the lives of mercantile sailors, which are not at all romantic or glamorous, but dirty, dangerous, grueling, and underpaid.You'll be particularly appalled at how easily a ship can be taken, and the possibilities for terrorism are chilling as well...This isn't really a single book, though, or at least it doesn't read like one. It's a collection of several different marine-related themes. First, Langewiesche talks about the law of the sea, or rather, the lack thereof. He covers regulation, naval enforcement, the shadowy, mutable world of ship owners and registries, and why the world depends on shipping and why shipping remains \\"a world of freedom, chaos, and crime.\\"Then he spends a huge chunk of the book talking about a single disaster, the sinking of the ferry Estonia. This is practically a minute-by-minute account, complete with descriptions of crew and passengers, survivors and non-survivors, and plenty of after-the-fact analysis of exactly what went wrong and the legal and political ramifications.Finally, Langewiesche describes the ship-breaking yards in India, \\"hell on Earth,\\" where the poorest of the poor break apart condemned vessels for low pay, crawling over shards of metal and puddles of toxic waste.This book started out as several different essays, but each one holds up on its own, and the complete work is an eye-opening expose of both life on the high seas and the people who work to keep the world's shipping afloat."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I enjoyed this book. I'm fascinated by the subject, and the writing is terrific. I was a bit disappointed with it, though, for reasons shared by many other reviewers.Of the 240 pages in the book, the first hundred pages move along well. So do the last forty. From page 100-200, though, the book bogs down in the story of the sinking of the Estonia. While it is a gripping story, it should have been limited to 50 pages-- the book's title is not \\"The Sinking of the Estonia\\". Issues like piracy and shipping finance could have healthily stretched the book to 300 pages total.Overall, though, I would recommend it-- with the proviso that it is not a full treatment of it's subject."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Well written and full of interesting anecdotes, The Outlaw Sea is a fun read. Especially revealing about ship breaking, an activity about which I was totally ignorant until I read this book. But after all, what is there to do with ships that have reached the end of their useful life?"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Curious about the real world of the sea and what can happen when you lose sight of land? This fabulous book explains it all and more. Currently the most dangerous sea lanes appear to be in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, but Mr.Langewiesche describes the dangers of the South China Sea and the Java Sea as well. It's not just the sea faring pirates that cause the misery and heart break, those corporate ones sitting behind oaken desks cause just as much or more grief.As always, greed kills and absolute greed kills even more; from abused registries, and bogus inspections to the cost cutting methods of recycling mamouth tankers, it's a corrupt and evil world of business and government run amuck and William Langewiesche gets to the bottom of it. It's a great and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The Outlaw Sea is about the immensity of the sea and the essential lawlessness of commercial shipping. There is far more ocean than there is land. \\"International Waters\\" are just that - not part of any country.The book consists of four main sections. The first is about freighters in general, the law of the sea and the story of the Kristal, a 550-ft all-purpose tanker, registered in Malta, owned in Italy and crewed by Croatians, Pakistanis and Spaniards. The ship had grown decrepit, but the owners kept on sailing it. It broke into two sections off the coast of Spain, dumping a cargo of molasses and drowning a third of its crew.The second is about pirates who captured a freighter. It shows how dangerous the shipping lanes are even today, and how hard it is to catch the criminals.The third part is about the loss of a huge Estonian car ferry, in the Baltic on its way to Sweden. Storm waves broke open the car deck. Passengers played in the bars until the ship began to sag to starboard. There are stories of death and survival. A lot of it is about the investigation of the loss, and international politics.The last part is about ship-breaking, focusing on a beach in India. The author watched a ship deliberately driven onto the beach, then cut to pieces by low-paid workers. The author describes the work of Greenpeace and others to promote skip-breaking that is not so bad for the environment, or so unhealthy for the workers.The book is well-written throughout. There's plenty of detail, but it never gets boring."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Wm. Langewiesche is a favorite author of mine, having produced several previous delicious reading experiences for me, most recently his book about the Sahara. He is a skillful wordsmith and travel raconteur with an eye for detail almost as keen as Paul Theroux's. So I leapt at the chance to read The Outlaw Sea, thinking it would help explain the piracy issue in great detail. (How is it the world's strongest navies can't stop a few Somalis in outboards from highjacking yachts in 2008?) Instead, while devoting a chapter on South China sea pirates, he devotes two very lengthy chapters on the Baltic Sea ferry disaster that was so regrettable but presented by the author in such detail one leaves the book thinking he has seen every rivet and chain link of the Estonia, the ship that sunk--this book. I'll continue to seek out Mr. Langewiesche's work, but with skepticism and a little less enthusiasm."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The sea covers most of the world's surface area. Most people have a passing knowledge of the sea's history, of pirates and hidden treasure. Langewiesche's book brings up the modern issues the sea presents to the world and the different countries that border it.The overarching theme of the book is that no matter what humans do, the sea cannot be tamed. Langewiesche's book is divided into different vignettes that inform the reader of the many different issues of the sea. All are impeccably researched and written. The most interesting to me was the final section on shipbreaking. I had no idea of the work and loss of human life involved in reducing a ship to scrap.This is a great book to give to anyone who wants to know more about how the sea figures into our modern existence."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Sea stories have long been among my favorite subjects.

I'm going by airplane!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"As other have noted, it is a little disjointed as it is a compilation of some previously published material. However, as someone with little knowledge about how the economics of ocean transport works, I found it insightful, infuriating and interesting.The blurbs on the cover make you think it is about \\"corporate malfeasance\\" and while the author does seem to want more control over the oceans, it is a bit more nuanced than that. He does recognize the impossibility of regulating such a vast expanse. Even on the environmental issue of how to control the business of scrapping ships (which is done these days on heavily polluted beaches in India) he is not willing to make the scrappers the villains. Rather, he notes that while the work is dangerous and not environmentally friendly, to simply outlaw the practice would increase insurance fraud and put a large number of poor people out of work.Langewiesche does not provide much in the way of answers, but the book is a good place perhaps to start the conversation."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"As others have said, basically a number of more or less independent articles pasted together with the running theme of the law-free ocean and the global marketplace. Each chapter is engaging, entertaining, and informative. A wonderful little piece of non-fiction. Nothing super-spectacular, but a great way to pass the time looking through a window into a world most of us are quite unfamiliar with."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The Outlaw Sea is a great read. Langewiesche takes the reader on a tour of the perils afflicting modern maritime shipping and attempts to trace the origins of those perils through the attempts of nations to establish some kind of regulatory control over the seas. While I'm sure Langewiesche meant his book to be, at least in part, a cautionary tale about the Wild West nature of much of the world's oceans (underscored by his caveats regarding how easy it would be for terrorists to sail explosives into the US aboard a cargo ship), the book better serves the reader as an introduction to the world of maritime shipping and its laws (or lack thereof). Langewiesche doesn't try to make his work exhaustive - it's actually too brief, I think, owing in part to its readability and the fascinating nature of the source material - but rather he tackles three episodes in modern shipping history and describes them within his greater framework. I gave the book four stars because I found the subject interesting enough that I wanted more details, more stories - The Outlaw Sea was, to be frank, just too damned little of a good thing."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The Outlaw Sea is a short book with a wide-scope, including the history of international regulatory efforts, the problem of piracy, the practical effects of international regulations, terrorism, the sinking and investigation of the Estonia ferry accident in 1994, and the global \`ship-breaking' industry and its malcontents. William Langewiesche is a talented writer and his description of what it was like to be on the sinking Estonia is breath-taking. Here is an excerpt:\\"Survival that night was a very tight race, and savagely simple. People who started out early and moved fast had some chance of winning. People who started late or hesitated for any reason had no chance at all. Action paid. Contemplation did not. The mere act of getting dressed was enough to condemn people to death, and although many who escaped to the water succumbed to the cold, most of the winners endured the ordeal simply naked or in their underwear. In any event, the survivors all seem to have grasped the nature of this race, the first stage of which involved getting to the Deck 7 promenade without delay. There was no God to turn to for mercy. There was no government to provide order. Civilization was ancient history. Europe was a faint and faraway place. Inside the ship, as the heel (angle) increased, even the most primitive social organization, the human chain, crumbled apart. Love only slowed people down. A pitiless clock was running. The ocean was completely in control.\\"\`Love only slowed people down...' This is one powerful sentence. One reads about ferry accidents from time-to-time in the paper, and then moves quickly to the sports section. The name of the ship and country fades quickly from memory. But after reading Langewiesche's chapter on the Estonia, you will have a new appreciation of how hellish these accidents are for passenger and crew.The book bogs down in places - in particular, in the detailed forensic analysis on the investigation of the Estonia disaster and some other places. Langewiesche heroically describes the detective work but it would have been useful to include a few photographs - or even some drawings - to help people without a nautical background understand various parts of the ship. The chapters are self-contained, and overall the book has the feel of several unrelated long articles put together for a book. There should have been an afterword to bring the disparate topics all together.At the end of the book, Langewiesche offers up another excellent chapter on the beaches in Southeast Asia (India in particular) where ships go to die, and be scrapped. The danger, slave-wages, and ecological catastrophes are brought to life in a very visual, compelling way. This chapter, and the minute-by-minute account of the Estonia disaster, spotlight the author's talent at bringing extraordinary scenes to your mind's eye."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case.","review":"In 1944 the famous hard-boiled mystery writer Raymond Chandler published an influential essay titled \\"The Simple Art of Murder\\" in which he praised the hard-boiled mystery fiction of Dashiell Hammett and disparaged the supposed lack of realism in earlier mysteries, including TRENT'S LAST CASE (1913). The chief fault he found with it was that no millionaire would do X to himself just to take vengeance on another person (read Chandler's essay to see what X might be). The only problem with Chandler's statement is that he is wrong! The millionaire did NOT do what Chandler says he did. And yet several \\"standard\\" reference books quote or paraphrase Chandler as if he were right. (Now THAT IS A MYSTERY. Do critics occasionally plagiarize from others without reading the books they comment on? Or do they just have faulty memories? Or are they deliberately playing fast and loose with facts and trusting that nobody can tell the difference? Or what?)TRENT'S LAST CASE is actually a very cleverly plotted mystery novel that has two major twists AFTER Philip Trent believes he has solved the shooting of millionaire Sigsbee Manderson. What this essentially means (SEMI-SPOILER ALERT) is that Trent has been mistaken in his first solution--and that the second solution, which is handed to him by another person (the one that Chandler and others seem to be remembering), is ALSO mistaken. The final twist, which occurs naturally enough in the last few pages, provides the REAL solution (which Chandler and others appear to have forgotten).Anyway, these twists (which neither Trent nor most readers could foresee) are plausible enough when they have been laid out for us, and they provide us with most of the pleasure of the story. The main fault I find with this mystery is that the embedded love story (which does serve a key role in the overall plot) does not seem believable to me. (Other readers may differ, and indeed readers of 1913 might have considered it totally in line with how people felt and acted back then.)If you read and enjoy this novel, the good news is that E. C. Bentley later wrote 13 good short mystery stories about Philip Trent that are prequels to this book. Twelve of them were published in TRENT INTERVENES (1938), and the last one, titled \\"Ministering Angel,\\" appeared in THE STRAND magazine in Nov. 1938 and has been anthologized in at least 3 books that are fairly easy to find."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case.","review":"This quick read was an entertaining glimpse into early last century detective fare.

It appears that what this outfit does is downloads/copies/cuts-and-pastes the text file, converts it to a proportional font, and prints it as is.

Or will it result in a terrible miscarriage of justice?From a 2005 standpoint, TRENT'S LAST CASE is not a remarkable novel. Published in 1913, it feels overwritten, wordy, more Victorian in style than modern--and while the plot itself is interesting, it hardly compares to the unexpected twists offered by the very writers who so praised it and who were so influenced by it. But the fact remains that it was the first: Poe may have created the detective story and such writers as Doyle, Collins, and Dickens may have wrung romantic changes upon the theme, but it really wasn't until TRENT'S LAST CASE that the mystery novel as we presently think of it was born.Most contemporary readers will likely find Bentley's style tough going, and although extremely influential the triple-twist plot has been done with considerably more drama in later novels. But say what you like, TRENT'S LAST CASE really is \\"the first,\\" and that counts for a lot. Worth reading for the history of it!GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case.","review":"Actually Trent's last case is his first - and his last: E. C. Bentley didn't write another full-length novel (although there is a disappointing collection of short-stories entitled 'Trent Intervenes', I think; the only edition of this I have seen was in the green and white Penguin crime classics). The importance of 'Trent's Last Case' is that it helped to shape a new paradigm in British detective stories: witty, social acute, conservative (to the point of looking down on 'trade'), and flippant bordering on frivolous.

C. Bentley (July 10, 1875 - March 30, 1956), was a popular English novelist and humorist of the early twentieth century, and the inventor of the clerihew, an irregular form of humorous verse on biographical topics.Born in London, Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph. His first published collection of poetry, titled Biography for Beginners (1905), popularized the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, in 1929 and 1939. His detective novel, Trent's Last Case (1913), was much praised, numbering Dorothy L. Sayers among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery. The success of the work inspired him, after only 23 years, to write a sequel, Trent's Own Case (1936).All lovers of the genre of mystery will enjoy his work immensely."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case.","review":"Trent makes a lasting impression in this, his first, last and only appearance. Appearing in 1913, \\"Trent's Last Case\\" is among the first classic English country murder mysteries. It's all butlers, country houses, motor-cars and dressing for dinner, sprinkled with wry observations on the manners of the wealthy, country folk, inn keepers, servants upstairs and downstairs, police inspectors, husbands, widows, American secretaries and French maids.We begin with our man Trent arriving in town to investigate a murder. The plot is brisk, without enough clues to make it a whodunit. Trent's an established painter with a national reputation as an amateur detective and newspaper correspondent. An amateur sleuth would be incomplete without a nemesis, so we have a long-time friendly rival, Inspector Murth. The presumption of a long history and the effortlessness of the characters' interactions was drawn beautifully. All is revealed through what the characters say and do, not by long narrative descriptions. I rather wish this was only the beginning for Trent and not the end."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case.","review":"What mystery writer today would use that as a title for their first mystery? It seems like so many titles now are intended to begin multi-book series that the \\"last\\" part seems strange. Why is it his last case? Does the detective die? You start this book with a question already.Trent is an artist who's amazing mind has led him to dabble in solving criminal cases for a newspaper. He's called in to consult on the case of the murder of Sigbee Manderson, an American business tycoon. Trent also happens to know the widow's uncle, Mr. Cupples, who also asks Trent to see what he can discover. Mr. Cupples knows that his niece and her husband had a falling out and knows she will be suspected but he feels his niece is innocent and wants Trent to find the proof.Trent is brilliant, working out what he feels is the solution but also falling in love with the widow! Later, he discovers much of his careful logic to be wrong.I delighted in this short little book. Trent is a great character, a detective that laughs and loves and has human failings."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case.","review":"I bought this book becauae 1. I enjoy detective novels and 2.

It's a fast read and it's fairly inexpensive. If you're looking for a LOST tie-in it's not here.The novelty of this story is that the case is solved before the book is two-thirds of the way through.

An accomplished sports writer, his articles, essays and short stories have appeared in a wealth of hunting, fishing, wildlife, and sports magazines. In At Home On The Range With A Texas Hunter, Chappell offers a series of engaging, highly recommended essays on the bonds that exist between hunter, hunting dog, land, and prey. From hunting Bobwhites in the Texas Panhandle, to prairie grouse in the Flint Hills of Kansas, Gambel's quail in New Mexico arroyos, blue quail on the staked plains, or doves and Mearns' quail in Arizona, Chappell evokes a true sense of hunting, complete with its responsibilities and ethics."},{"Title":"At Home On The Range with a Texas Hunter","review":"I am a native Texan and an avid hunter of over 25 years. I think Henry Chappells book is sublime and I enjoyed the realism and detail associated with it. It is nice to read a hunting book that I can relate to in not only hunting, but in a common love of the great state of Texas and all of it's beauty."},{"Title":"At Home On The Range with a Texas Hunter","review":"I got this book and expected to see the typical hunting stories and that would be O.K. because I have been an avid hunter/outdoorsman for over 30 years and enjoy anything related to hunting, camping, etc. This book was a surprise! It does contain some hunting stories, and some experiences encountered while camping, but more insightfully, one can share the thoughts and observations of a person very skilled not only in hunting but in observing nature. While it is difficult to accurately describe this book, I would say it is about hunting from the perspective of a conservationist as opposed to a person who is only out to shoot. Additionally, the author's thoughtful insights into hunting ethics are sure to raise some hackles, especially in Texas, and will hopefully provoke some self examination by anyone who hunts. As an aside, the section on Country is worth the price of the book, by itself. This book accomplishes something that is difficult-it stimulates thought."},{"Title":"At Home On The Range with a Texas Hunter","review":"I'm a novice hunter, have lived in Texas for 16 years, and was happy to have been tipped to read Henry Chappell's first book. I've read him in Texas Parks and Wildlife, and other magazines. The love he has and shows his dogs is evident, along with the intriguing insights into his background. It is evident he is an ardent environmentalist, but also a pragmatic capitalist.

I have made some of the jams and brandied peach recipes and...it is the closest you can get to experiencing the lost world of Hearst in 3-D smell and taste-o-vision. One understands by actually COOKING this food that he loved good ol' American cozy COMFORT FOOD. The stuff of an imagined or real childhood in a home surrounded by snow.

The book is written in the format of what appears to be journal articles, or reviews by various authors on the different subjects. It is not written in textbook style. Furthermore, in this manner of writing, the book does not provide enough background information on the subjects that it covers. It automatically assumes that the reader fully understands the subjects that it is intending to teach. I do not recommend this as a primary text for a class. It would serve a wonderful job as a supplement for a class or to provide someone knowledgable in developmental neuroscience a &quot;refresher&quot; or update on what is currently known in this subject. However, I do not feel that it should be used to TEACH developmental neuroscience."},{"Title":"Molecular and Cellular Approaches to Neural Development","review":"This is not a textbook for students but an excellent series of reviews by top level scientists in the neural development domain.

Obey Him?","review":"I'm a Christian woman, married to a Christian man. I was reared in Christian home &amp; attended Christian school.At the bottom of page 28, this book actually says that I'm &quot;to obey my husband as if he were GOD HIMSELF!!!&quot; It also says to accept what my husband says as if &quot;God were speaking audibly from heaven&quot;! Are you kidding me?! Correct me if I'm wrong, but the Bible says to &quot;have no other gods before Me&quot;.While I DO believe that my husband has the ultimate authority when there's a dispute, I DO NOT believe that I have no opinion &amp; that my husband is infalible as God is infalible.This book is just absurd! It's not Biblical, although it trys to pass itself off as being that way.Don't bother wasting your time, unless you want a good laugh!"},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I bought this book just for laughs, and all I can say is, \\"WOW.\\" I can't believe this is serious, and that people actually trust this. I showed this to all of my friends (and even my girlfriend of 3+ years), and none of them could even fathom that a woman would subject herself to such extreme submission. I believe that a relationship works best if both the man and woman make sacrifices, not merely the woman. I wouldn't be able to handle \\"owning\\" my wife and being allowed to carelessly do whatever I wish.Get this book and take it to a book club for some great expressions!"},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This book is Scripturally unsound. The theme throughout the Bible is that we, as individuals, are spoken to by the Holy Spirit and have a personal relationship with God. We are responsible for our own sin, and we are not absolved of personal responsibility because &quot;he told me to do it.&quot; To obey another human being as God is to assign perfection to that human being, and is idolatry."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I am a firm believer in submission as taught in the Bible. The author of this book, however, has &quot;exceeded what is written.&quot; Does your husband require you to get an abortion? No problem, just pray about it and God will change his mind! What immature reasoning is this? Just because it has happened in some cases does not make it normative for all! Stay away from this book. It can lead you into sin!"},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I found several areas where the author seems to fail to recognize that there are some subtle differences in commands for a wife following a Christian husband and for a wife following a husband who is not living as a Christian. For instance, in her statement, &quot;A wife is to obey [her husband] regardless of his spiritual condition.&quot; she appears to be saying that a woman is to obey her husband even into sin. Later she attemps to clarify this by saying that God will convict her husband and protect her from sin. But, she fails to recognize that the husband does still have free will. In the teachings for Christian couples wives are told to obey their husbands in &quot;everything&quot;, but it must be noted that when speaking to wives who are married to the unsaved they are simple told to obey, not in everything.I can see this book being of help perhaps to a wife who is married to a truly God fearing husband, but for a woman who is married to a man who is serving someone other than God, I find it to be an instructionn manual for how to set yourself up for abuse. There are Christian women in shelters all over this country who could give the author lessons on what true submission is to a man who is not following God."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I read this book two years ago. I reread it every now and then. I have used it in my marriage classes. I have purchased over 50 books for others. When I first began to read the book. I had to get a friend to help me through the first chapter. I &quot;WAS&quot; a wife who felt the word submission was sickening. I would always replaced the word submit with desire to please, according to Gen.3:16. It gave me a since of choice and control. After reading this book, I understand that submission is power and freedom. I rejoice in submitting to my husband. By subitting to my husband, I am submitting to God. Submission is Gods perfect will. God changes not, He is the same today yesterday and forever. Others have come back to thanked me for sharing this book. I called the author to personally thank her and encourage her in her ministry to women. This book is a must read for every wife and future bride."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"The negative reviews below sadden me, because I was there once and used to think that &quot;submission&quot; was a dirty word. How I wish I had learned these lessons earlier on in my marriage; how much grief I would've saved myself! God is gracious. Through this book and godly authors such as Elisabeth Elliot and Elizabeth George, I am learning what it takes to be a godly wife who is pleasing to the Lord.Is it any wonder that the very first sin ever committed was by a woman who did not want to submit to her husband? Satan is still lying to women today. He convinces them that submission is restrictive, when the truth is that submission is freeing. &quot;You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.&quot; (John 8:32)This book is worth its weight in gold. Do yourself and your marriage a favor and buy it, read it and most of all, APPLY IT to your life. You will be blessed. You will be transformed."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I do not agree with some other reviews I read here which state that the author is saying to submit yourself into sin if your husband so requires as well as that a wife can't have a direct personal relationship with God because she must go through her husband. The author does not say these things at all. This book is a quick read and full of inspiration for those in good or bad marriages. It clearly shows how submission is not being inferior, but trusting God - just as a man must submit to God and trust Him. In fact, the book clearly states that God would never require us to sin simply in the name of Godly submission to our husbands. This book has completely changed my perspective and shown me how I have been controlling in my marriage, nearly leading to divorce."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I would not recommend this book, because the teaching on the TOTAL submission to the point of sin is wrong. This book turns page 16 & 17 Adams' sin into a good deed. This was not a good deed, but a sin of Gods law. Disobedience to God for the sake of reaching someone else is wrong. The book on page 20 & 22 implies, the husband can save the wifes body. \\"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.\\" Jesus is our savior In the book page 31 suggests obeying the Husband rather than God.Here are a couple of websites for further review...[...] [...]I would not recommend this book as it will confuse you, about the submission God is talking about."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This book will help you to know the truth and the truth will set you free. It took my loosing my husband to another woman to even want to know what submission was! During the two years that I was alone with four little children, the Lord led me through the Bible and the truth on submission. I found that I wasn't the Christian wife I thought I was, but a contentious woman. My marriage was restored after 2 years which began my ministry. A few years later, a woman I was ministering to told me about this book and now this book is on the Recommended Reading list in the back of my books! My only reason for not giving it five stars was that I prefer the unrevised edition."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This book is absolutely HILARIOUS! I bought it a few years ago in a used bookstore and have since lent it out to a few friends. All of them loved it, too. It's hard to believe that there's anyone out there that would take this book seriously. What a riot! I'd highly recommend this book to any other atheists out there, on entertainment value alone. An excellent example of someone who is unable to think for themselves. The foreward by her husband is one of the most absurd things I've ever read."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This is a discussion of the submission of the Christian wife. The first chapter explores the reasons God commanded it, and then the book goes on to cover the Scriptures that direct wives to submit, and what they mean. Biblical examples are given, and questions about rights and tyrannical authority are answered. Basically, the author shows that God expects the wife to always obey her husband. She understands that sometimes husbands request or require things contrary to the Word of God, and in that case, disobedience is necessary. However, she says that she has never seen a husband being abusive or insisting that the wife sin when the wife has been in submission with a sweet spirit. Just because she has never seen it, of course, doesn't mean it doesn't occur, but she says that usually the spirit of a truly submissive wife will provoke tenderness in her husband. After all, Handford's audience is not primarily those in arranged marriages, but those who entered marriage voluntarily, as did their husbands. She shows from Biblical directives and examples that no matter the husband's character, we are to respect and submit to him. If it is not his virtues (as most are sinners), we are at least to honor his position as husband and head of the home. But then on the other hand, this should not be too hard, as most of us at least entered marriage with love for our husbands.My mother gave me this book a few months before I was married, and I thought it was very helpful. I already wanted to bless and honor my husband, but this book reinforced the Scriptures, and I think it was good for me to remember to keep the right attitude toward the Lord and my husband. I would definitely recommend the book to engaged women, new wives, or wives unsure of their position, or wives who simply want to review what God says about submission to their husbands."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"If you are looking for a book that uses the Bible as the whole word of God, and takes what God says literaly, this is the book for you.

Obey Him?","review":"I'm so grateful I found this little book in our church library. In fact I loved it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

No matter what is going on in a woman's life now days, God's Word concerning a woman's place and purpose never changes."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This is a good basic book about wifely submission. In a straight-forward manner the author lays out the do's and don'ts of submission. Most of the examples are good practical advise and help to expose how easy it is to get the marriage roles out of alignment. While this book is for women, it doesn't let men off the hook either when it comes to their responsibilities. I look forward to what my wife thinks of the book.The reason for my removing of a few stars was because of the authors total glossing over of a rather tough topic in Christian submission: What to do if asked to do something immoral or illegal. Rather than tackle the difficult issue, the author simply gives some examples of how it all worked out in the end. That's all well and good, but in the real world that rarely happens.Ask any mainline pastor or theologian and they will tell you that a wife need not obey a directive from the husband to sin or to break the law of the land. While it is true that Ephesians instructs women to obey their husbands, it also commands men to love their wives as Christ loved the church. Would Christ command the church to sin? No way."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"Why is there so much tension between husbands &amp; wives? What if the husband is a dud, a beast, etc.?

It will change your life. I give them to brides (&amp; grooms)."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This book is truly not worth your time. Ms. Handford on one hand seems to state that women are spiritually misguided and need the strong guidance of a man, and on the other hand tries to teach us spiritual truths. I am truly surprised that her husband, a Baptist preacher, would allow her to publish such a book.This book makes a woman wonder if she can have a personal relationship with God at all. For example, she states in her book that if what the wife feels God is calling her to do is different from what her husband is feel God is calling her to do, she must simply be in rebellion. Well, if that is so, why try to hear God at all?She also seems to place such a huge importance on obeying one's husband... to the exclusion of all other commandments in the Bible. She even goes so far to say you should submit even into sin. Placing man before God is simply unBiblical and wrong. Yes, we as women are called to submit to our husbands, but NOT into sin. And, she has the audacity to say that if our husband is asking us to sin, that either we truly want to sin or we aren't submitting well enough in everything. This is just ridiculous. She is misguided and should better read her Bible... reading it not to prove her point, but to understand and learn what God has written in it. She should understand it and read it in context."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"As a Christian woman married to a Christian man (for 15 years now) I have never understood submission. I was raised by a single mother and never saw the marriage relationship as it was meant to be. I asked elders wives, ministers wives, peers of mine, and my grandmothers to explain what exactly submission to my husband meant and none of the explinations helped me. Then a friend gave me her copy of this book and it finally helped me to understand what submission means. I highly recommend it, especially to strong, stubborn women like myself."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I read this book after hearing Elisabeth Elliott talk about it on her radio program Gateway to Joy. It has caused me to remember the great responsiblity I have to love my wife as Christ loved the church. This means treating her as I wish to be treated and keeping her perspectives, views, and opinions in mind during any descision making process. I firmly believe that if I have the mind of Christ in my relationship with my wife, that submission will be an easy and even moot task. I made the descision to love my wife like this before we were married and this book has helped remind me of the incredible responsibility I have to her."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"I read this book and was horrified but the kind of mindlessplace it gave to women.Maybe Evangelicals have such a highrate of men cheating on their wives because they have createda setting for a boring,lifeless and mindless woman.What man would be interested in a woman who obeys unless he'sa complete controll freak and is frightened of women deep down.This is the dark side of Christianity,which gives the generalpublic a negative view of the religion.Every verse in the Bible to justify male dominance is presentedin the book as \\"Godly\\"One inparticular is \\"the woman is for the man,but the man isnot for the woman\\" This has been used to dominate women forcenturies and controll every aspect of their lives.Submission leaves women in a place of limbo.Not a child but notquite an adult either.It's a sort of mental Talaban,an insidiousbrutality against a woman's individual personhood and mind.My church does not teach submission of women.Instead of submission of women,it teaches submission to God for both men and women on an equal basis.Submission takes a woman's spirit from her and crushes herself confidence.One of the biggest threats to EvangelicalChristian male seems to be a woman with a strong sense ofself and strong mind.If a woman reads the book and believes itshe will live in fear of displeasing God and her husband over thesubmission issue,and have it hanging over her head for herlifetime."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"When I purchased this book I was in the process of seriously studying submission. I read all these great reviews and thought it was an answered prayer. Instead I found myself repeatedly realizing that many Scriptures where taken out of context, and misapplied. My initial reaction was that I was being defensive (prideful) and that I should share this information with women who have the Word on their hearts, minds, and souls. A group of women married to men at all stages of life and status: leadership, Christian, non-Christian, widowed, newly married, married for 40+ years, and everything in between. Upon their review of this book they too shared the same feeling. Not all the information is incorrect, submission is a biblical concept, but the majority is very misleading if you are relying solely on this book for a thorough understanding of submissionIf your heart is still to purchase this book, I encourage you GREATLY to also purchase &quot;Liberated Through Submission&quot; by P.B. Wilson, along with &quot;The Excellent Wife&quot; by Martha Peace. Finally, you owe it to yourself to study submission out in the Bible. At that point it is only fair to make your own judgement of what submission is."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"Ms. Handford's book, though put together in a thoughtful manner, fails to accurately interpret the passages she uses as her Biblical &quot;proof&quot;. She does what Bible Scholars call, &quot;Isogesis,&quot; meaning that she comes to the scriptures with assumptions about what it says and looks for scripture to back her up, rather than letting the scripture speak for itself.When one reads scripture without coming to it with motivation of trying to prove a point, you will be able to see that her interpretation of the creation account(s) in Genesis is horribly skewed.Don't read this book. It's a waste of your time. Find another book that accurately assesses the scripture instead. Allow me to recommend: Good News for Women: A Biblical Picture of Gender Equality by Rebecca Merrill Groothuis as a book that takes conclusions drawn by those with poor interpretation and looks at them in light of scripture."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"Recently I read \\"Me? Obey Him?\\" and was very grieved at the content of this book. No where have I ever seen a miss use of the concept of submission as I did in this writing. It sounds like the old satanic doctine of a few years ago where if you have enough faith then even if your husband asked you to do something it will never happen for God will stop him. What happened to free choice and how God will not step over that? I will obey God rather than man anytime. Also if my husband asked me to do drugs I certainly would not obey him for that would be going against the law and God says to obey the laws of the land. I would not recommend this book too anyone because I think it gives you a license to sin and blame it on your husband."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"Those fortunate enough to have never actually read \\"Me? Obey Him?\\" may be shocked and appalled by the teachings in support of \\"biblical patriarchy.\\" This review is simply quotations of Handford's own words, followed by comments from my personal experience as a former submissive Christian woman.*God's Perfect Creation Required Order*Jesus, the Creator of Heaven and earth, submitted Himself to God the Father. He took His place in the chain of command. ... It is no shame, no dishonor, for a woman to be under authority, if the Lord Jesus -- very God Himself -- submitted to the authority of the Father. (p. 14)The submission of the Lord Jesus is our example. He submitted not just to the tender ministrations of the Father. He submitted to revilings and curses, persecution and suffering. He was our example, not just to obey a gentle and kind husband but a harsh and mean husband as well.You may find that your obedience to your husband and your obedience to God are all tied together. You may not want to obey your husband because you are in rebellion against God. (p. 51)By intimately linking Christ's willing subjection to God the Father with a woman's submission to her husband in \\"the chain of command,\\" the teachings of patriarchy create such an intricate tangle of enmeshment that it's nearly impossible for an abused woman to extricate herself from the bondage of her husband's tyranny without also throwing off her spiritual bond with Christ.*Woman's Nature Requires Obedience*We've had the impression that women as a class are more spiritually minded than men, with sensibilities more refined, and purer thoughts. Scriptures say the opposite is true! Women are more often led into spiritual error than men. Perhaps it is caused by her intuitive, emotional thinking. Intuitive thinking is God's gift, not to be despised, but it needs the balance of a man's reason. I should add too, that a woman does not have to be led into error. That is the reason God commanded her not to usurp authority over the man, so she can be protected from false doctrine. (p. 17)Sexist generalizations are never useful in understanding human relationships.In reality, I am no less rational than my (ex)husband. He also is gifted with a strong intuition and emotional intelligence. Convinced as we were that I was more susceptible to Satanic deception, our family was deprived of my reasonable input in decision making. My intelligence was squelched, my intuition was distrusted and my feelings were denied. My husband developed an artificially inflated sense of his own powers of logic. I can't count how many times he said to me, \\"What you are saying sounds reasonable, but how do I know that Satan is not using you to deceive me?\\" I had no good defense. According to the Scriptures, we had every reason to believe that I was indeed being used to lead my husband astray.His authority and my obedience did not protect us from tragic deception which ripped apart our family.*What Do the Scriptures Say About a Wife's Obedience?*Beyond a shadow of a doubt, the Scriptures say a woman ought to obey her husband! ... [Note, these ellipses represent page after page of scriptural support given by Handford to bolster her argument that God commands wives to obey their husbands.] If you are intellectually honest, you will have to admit that it is impossible to find a single loophole, a single exception, an \\"if\\" or \\"unless.\\" The Scriptures say, without qualification, to the openminded reader, that a woman ought to obey her husband. (pp. 24, 25)1) She Is to Obey Regardless of His Spiritual ConditionThe wife who obeys her husband may win him by her meek and quiet spirit, her loving behavior. (p. 25)2) She Need Not Fear Conflicting AuthorityThere is no hint that a woman may have to choose between conflicting authority. ... If it is needed in order to fulfill both obligations, God will do a miracle to make it possible. ... It is safe to conclude that when God told a woman to obey her husband, He intended for her to be able to do it without risk of offending other authorities. (pp. 25, 28)3) She Obeys Without Reference to Her Feelings About the Will of GodThe Scriptures say a woman must ignore her \\"feelings\\" about the will of God, and do what her husband says. She is to obey her husband as if he were God Himself. She can be as certain of God's will, when her husband speaks, as if God had spoken audibly from Heaven! (p. 28)When a concerned friend reported our family to Child Protective Services, my ex-husband lost custody of the children due to his abuse. The social worker told me that I was guilty of \\"failure to protect.\\" The only thing that prevented me from having my parental rights terminated and my children placed in foster care was my willingness to submit to a full psychological evaluation, undergo individual and family counseling, and cooperate with random unannounced home visits by Social Services.My older children rightfully blame me for not protecting them against their father's abuse. Even though they know that I was influenced by books such as \\"Me? Obey Him?\\" to believe that it was God's will to submit to the abuse, my children cannot be fooled into thinking that I was not really responsible for their suffering. I have apologized for my neglect. Most of my children have forgiven me -- still, the damage is done and some things can't (and shouldn't) be forgotten.*What If a Husband Expressly Commands Something Explicitly Wrong?*When women ask me this question, I counter with two of my own:1) \\"Have you been living in daily obedience to your husband as part of your wholehearted, loving submission to God?\\"(This is an essential part of the problem. If a woman has not been submissive, God has no responsibility for her situation and cannot be blamed if her husband requires something wrong.)2) \\"Has your husband ever actually commanded you to do something wrong?\\"In the hundreds of times I have asked these questions, not once, if my memory is right, has a woman answered, \\"Yes, I am always obedient, and yet my husband has required me to break one of God's laws.\\"Never! Why?Because, when a woman takes God at His word, submits to her husband without reservation, fears God and loves Him, then God takes upon Himself the responsibility to see that a woman does not have to sin! (pp. 37, 38)Many non-Christians can at least appreciate Jesus as a good moral teacher, but I have come to think of my 25+ year walk with God as the perfect example of a codependent relationship. To me, having \\"the mind of Christ\\" means thinking like a battered woman: It's really all my fault that He treats me so poorly. If only I were a better person, He wouldn't have to make me suffer. He only does it when I disobey -- to test my love for Him or to teach me a much-needed lesson. I don't deserve His love. I am so thankful that He puts up with me! Without Him, I am nothing.Even if a woman can honestly claim to have been perfectly submissive, if her husband nevertheless commands her to do wrong, God still gets off the hook. But, \\"Me? Obey Him?\\" gives the godly woman a promise so that she is not without hope: perhaps the Lord will kill her evil husband!!A man always has the choice of saying yes or no to God. He can reject the pleadings of the Spirit, the pleas of his loving wife. If he does, and he goes on his wicked way, then I have seen God reach down and take that man's life, rather than make his wife choose between two wrongs. (p. 40)The Lord did not rescue us from abuse by killing my husband -- even though, I'm embarrassed and ashamed now to say, I did pray He would do so after reading this passage in Handford's book. No -- it was up to me to put a stop to the abuse. My only regret in seeking divorce is that I didn't do it sooner.*Don't I Have Any Rights?*Can you find a Kleenex somewhere and mop up the tears, just for a minute, long enough to talk to me about what your rights really are?You don't have any rights, no rights at all. You lost them on the day you rebelled against God. You lost them, not because you are a woman, but because you are a sinner, just as I am. p. 49)Handford goes on to argue that, having been purchased by Christ's blood, we become His bondservants (slaves) who ought to be glad to do anything He tells us to do. This teaching that I was a slave to Christ translated into me also being a slave to my husband. I had no right to expect decent treatment for myself and our children. My husband owned me and was perfectly within his rights to demand that I comply with his every whim. If his desires seemed selfish, petty, or abusive, who was I to protest? If I would have rebelled against his wishes, then I would be guilty of witchcraft (1 Samuel 15:23) and subject to demonic control. I was told that either God was in control of my life (in the guise of my husband), or else Satan was in control of my life. The only power I had was to choose which one would control me.*You Have the Freedom From the Consequences of Decisions*When you give back to your husband the responsibility for the direction of the home and the making of the decisions, you also give him the responsibility for the consequences of his decisions. ... Fortunately, that's the way a man likes it. God made a man to be aggressive, to respond to challenge, to glory in his manhood, to rejoice in draining his strength, to risk great hazards for the one he loves. It is his very aggressiveness that a woman sometimes finds frightening, simply because she is a woman. She doesn't have confidence in her physical strength, in her ability to cope with danger, in her decision-making ability. It is a privilege, a gift unearned, for a woman to have a man take upon himself her welfare. (p 56)What Handford fails to mention here is that the wife and children have to live with the consequences of the husband's decisions. Reality persists. In actual fact, if a woman turns over all authority to her husband, and he blows it, she is nevertheless responsible by abdication for the resultant predicament in which the family finds itself. Perhaps God will not hold the submissive woman responsible for her husband's squandering of the household funds, but her children's hollow eyes will haunt her all the same.The male aggressiveness which I feared was, in fact, strengthened when I catered to my husband -- much as a bully becomes increasingly malevolent until his targeted prey dares to stand up to him. My insecurities regarding decision-making and my ability to cope worsened as I was never permitted an opportunity to prove to myself that I could deal with challenging situations.God has a wonderful way of working it out for the comfort of the whole family when a woman leaves the decision making to her husband. (p. 57)Wishful thinking much?*Don't I Ever Get to Express an Opinion?*When you are talking over a problem, if it isn't asking too much, try to think reasonably. ... Men think women talk too much about how they feel, rather than considering facts. Sure it's important how you feel. Can you tell him why you feel that way? (p. 61)There is a word for this contemptuous insult: Misogyny. It means, hatred of women. Anyone who thinks so little of women should be afforded zero credibility when it comes to handing out marital advice.*Why Do I Have to Make All the Concessions?*Why doesn't the husband have to do his part first? Why? Because you are the one burdened for a Christian home. Having a home where Christ is the head is cheap enough at whatever price you have to pay! Think how long the rewards of a good Christian home will last. Then ask yourself if it is worth the trifling mortifications of obedience. Of course it is! All valuable things cost something. Certainly you will have to pay a price. (p. 69)A relationship in which one party must make all the concessions has nothing to do with love and everything to do with power and control. It is unhealthy, dysfunctional, unsustainable, and perverse. It is not good for the wife and it is not good for the husband either.The \\"mortifications of obedience\\" in my marriage were not trifling. I was not the only one who had to pay the price. Patriarchy took a terrible toll on my children: physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. We are still paying the price to this day. Sadly, the promised rewards of a good Christian home never actually materialized for us.*But What If His Influence on the Children Is Bad?*Then make sure your influence on the children is good. Let them see a mother who loves God and keeps His commandments by obeying her husband! Your influence, by God's grace, can counteract the bad influences a father can have. ... Obey God. Obey your husband. God will see to it that bad influences on the children are countered. (pp. 72, 74)My children will tell you that this simply is not true. Day after day, week after week, year after year, my husband's anger and control wore the children down. They learned his bad habits. His hatred and criticism destroyed their enthusiasm for life.I submitted, he dominated. The children learned that in all relationships there is an imbalance of power -- better to be the person in power.Over and over, I prayed for the Lord to help me counteract my husband's negative influence. Despite my desperate pleadings, the reality was that he had way more energy, he could lecture for hours and hours without a break, he spent more time with the children while I was on continual bedrest either pregnant or recovering from pregnancies/deliveries. Plus, he had all the power -- so which of us would the children want to emulate? Certainly not me and my martyrdom.*I Want to Do Right, But I Can't Help How I Feel*Have you noticed how many Scriptures there are that command a wife to obey her husband, and how few Scriptures there are that command her to love her husband? There is only one Scripture, to my knowledge, that tells a wife to love him, and that is Titus 2:4. Why? Because, I think, in a marvelous, supernatural way, submission brings love. If you obey him, you will love him, love him more than you ever dreamed possible. p. 75)The principle which Handford is describing here actually has a name. It's called Stockholm syndrome. As defined by Wikipedia, Stockholm syndrome is a term used to describe a paradoxical psychological phenomenon wherein hostages express adulation and have positive feelings towards their captors that appear irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims, essentially mistaking a lack of abuse from their captors as an act of kindness.I learned this coping mechanism well in my own abusive marriage. Whenever I felt the natural repulsion and lack of love engendered by my husband's poor treatment of me and the children, I forced myself to become even more submissive to him. I was following Jesus' admonition to turn the other cheek and to repay evil with good. Guess what? It worked!! In no time, the good, positive feelings returned and I was once again feeling incredible love for my husband.But this trick of my mind was not a good thing as it enabled me to endure the abuse -- to rationalize and justify my husband's behavior even when the children and I were clearly suffering harm.*Does It Work? Does It Really Work?*God has made a promise to the woman who will obey her husband. He keeps His promises. He will not honor disobedience, no matter what excuse is given for it. A woman wins her husband, draws him to a higher spiritual plane, by a submissive, quiet spirit. ... Yes, it really works. God will bless your home if you are obedient. (p. 77)It really works! ... Unless it doesn't work, in which case, it's all the woman's fault. This guaranteed recipe for success cannot be proven false because the \\"no liability\\" clause is inseparable from the key ingredient: perfect obedience. Not blessed? Not His/his fault. The woman is solely responsible for every failure.*For the Sake of the Children, Submit*In any unresolved conflict between husband and wife, there is always great danger to the marriage, however trivial its beginning. Children instinctively know the sanctity of the home itself is endangered when there is conflict over who is boss. Not only will children suffer from fear, they will also learn from a rebellious mother her rebellion against authority. ... The children will learn rebellion and rebel against you and your husband. Then they will resent all authority: the school, the boss, the policeman, the structure of life itself. (p. 86)Conflict in marriage is normal. The absence of conflict is a sign that one (or both) of the partners has been demoralized and dehumanized. Holding an opinion and caring about it is a big part of what it means to be alive. Working through conflict, listening to each others' differing perspectives and learning to compromise is the way mature couples learn and grow. Marriage does not have to be a power struggle. Nobody has to be \\"the boss.\\" Mutuality makes a happy, satisfying relationship for both husband and wife.Children who witness healthy parents dealing constructively with the inevitable disagreements of daily life are learning valuable conflict resolution skills.I thought that I was providing much-needed security for my children when I continually assured them that their father and I would never divorce. They told me later that to them, my unwavering commitment sounded like a death sentence.It was not until I began standing up for myself and the children against their father's unreasonable demands that he quit acting like a two-year-old and began to take responsibility for his own actions. Witnessing me challenge their father's authority did not turn my children into rebels -- it was living with a bully which made them revolt. When I took a stand, the children learned healthy boundaries: both to insist on their own boundaries and to respect the boundaries of others.*For Your Husband's Sake, Obey*Imagine how quickly a man would turn his steps homeward in the evening, after a day of grappling with the world, if the woman who waited for him met him with words of tenderness on her lips instead of a set of ultimatums. ... If it matters at all to you about the man you have promised to love until parted by death, for his well-being and joy, for his usefulness to God, obey him! (pp. 87, 88)When I indiscriminately submitted to my husband's every whim, I was not treating him like a grown-up man. I was treating him like a spoiled child. Taking on the responsibility for his \\"well-being and joy\\" stripped him of self-respect and enabled him to avoid the consequences of his own poor choices. Filing for divorce was, in fact, the first time I showed true respect to my husband since before we learned about and accepted the teachings of patriarchy. Finally I was saying to him, \\"You are an intelligent, sane adult and therefore, you must live with the consequences of your behavior.\\"A man whose wife is a spineless doormat is actually more likely to stray from home as he seeks a companion who challenges and engages him on an adult level.*For Your Own Welfare and Happiness, Yield*There's a strange paradox in Scripture, echoed in many places: If you would live, you must die (John 12:24). If you would keep your life, you must lose it (Matt. 10:39). If you would be free, you must submit yourself a slave to Christ (Rom. 6:18). And there is one more paradox which must be taken by faith as well: if you would know true freedom, you must submit to your husband's authority. Obedience certainly has its great and final reward in Heaven, but it also has the present tangible reward. ... Obedience brings happiness! (p. 88)Again, wifely submission is intimately linked to one of the central messages of Christianity.What Elizabeth Rice Handford doesn't want you to know is that this same argument, these same verses, in fact, were used by Christian slaveholders to justify their ownership of fellow human beings.Stop for a moment and actually read the following verses:Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but like slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not men, because you know that the Lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does, whether he is slave or free. (Eph. 6:5-8 -- the same section of Ephesians in which Paul commands wives to submit to their husbands.)To sweeten the deal, proponents of biblical slavery would remind slaves that serving the Lord meant serving their masters - but this is not burdensome because the Bible also commands masters to treat their slaves kindly:And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him. (Eph. 6:9 -- with such a Christ-like master, why wouldn't a slave willingly submit?)Sound familiar? Teachers of wifely submission are always quick to point out that while God insists that women obey their husbands, we must remember that husbands are likewise instructed to love their wives as Christ loved the church. So that makes the subjection and subordination of women okay ... just like slavery, right? After all, the bible commands both women and slaves to submit and obey.Virtually no Christians today advocate slavery. The verses commanding slaves to obey their masters have not been removed from the bible or discredited, yet we have laws against people owning people. Ask Christians why they believe that slavery is evil when the bible does not condemn slave owners and, in fact, commands slaves to obey their masters, and you will receive a myriad of responses: You have to consider the context and the culture; God was not condoning slavery, only acknowledging its common practice and providing guidelines to make it more humane, etc. What you will not hear -- ever -- is a Christian who replies, \\"The bible commands slaves to obey their masters. Therefore, slavery is God's will and faithful Christians must practice slavery to be in the will of God. Obedient slaves are happy slaves.\\"Think about it. Why don't we still practice slavery? Why?Slavery is wrong. It is dehumanizing, unjust, inequitable, immoral and inconsistent with the Golden Rule. It does not matter that the bible commands slaves to obey their masters - we all know that slavery is wrong, wrong, wrong.How do we know that slavery is wrong when the bible does not tell us so? Answer that question and you will also understand that it doesn't matter how many times the bible commands women to obey and submit to their husbands - we know instinctively that the subordination of women is just plain wrong. For the same reasons that we dismiss and ignore the bible commands for slaves to obey their masters, we should also feel free to disregard the bible commands for wives to obey their husbands."},{"Title":"Me?

This book turns page 16 & 17 Adams' sin into a good deed. This was not a good deed, but a sin of Gods law. Disobedience to God for the sake of reaching someone else is wrong. The book on page 20 & 22 implies, the husband can save the wifes body. \\"For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.\\" Jesus is our savior In the book page 31 suggests obeying the Husband rather than God.Here are a couple of websites for further review...[...]Start on page 8, ...[...] AND [...]I would not recommend this book as it will confuse you, about the submission God is talking about."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"A book encouraging women to give up their free will and obey their husbands as though they were children. You'd think it was an urban legend, but no. In fact, this tragic misuse of the Bible has been going on for centuries, begun by the fact that Paul's comparison of the relationship between the husband and wife to the relationship of Christ and the church has been grossly misunderstood. People have taken this to mean that the husband has irrefutible authority over the wife, just as Christ has absolute and unquestionable authority over His church, but this is NOT the case. Paul was speaking of the give and take relationship between Christ and the church, the love and devotion it takes both sides to commit. Now, of course Christ is the authority of His church AS WELL as the source of it, but Paul was, in that particular passage, only speaking of Christ as source and nurturer of the church because it is THAT aspect of His relationship with it that marriage is supposed to reflect, not the authority part. Furthermore, the reason Christ is the authority is because He can never, will never, lead the Church astray! He is perfect, unerring. Husbands, on the other hand, are not; like any other human, they can lead others astray. This alone should be enough to dissuade wives from wanting to obey their husbands.If you believe in obeying your husband inspite of these facts, that's your choice. However, I still don't recommend you read this book. Even if we were to obey our husbands, it wouldn't be in the way that this book advises; heck, children shouldn't obey their parents the way this book says! Handford advises that you should not refuse your husband even if he asks you to get an abortion. Rather than getting an abortion or outrightly disobeying your husband, she says you should pray for the problem to go away, and it will. Two major logical faults with this: number one, by not getting an abortion, you ARE disobeying your husband; just because you don't tell him doesn't mean that you're not. Now, I'm not saying that a woman SHOULD get an abortion; I'm saying she should say no outright instead of hoping and praying it will go away. That leads me to problem number two with Handford's advice: why keep silent? If ANYONE tells you to do something sinful, don't beat around the bush; give them a flat-out NO. That is your right.The idea of obeying your husband is always accompanied by the equally wrong idea of using him as your spiritual covering. Our husbands can NOT cover us from sin; that is God's job. To expect a husband to do so is frankly unfair to him. Our spouses have their own sins to worry about; don't expect them to shoulder ours as well, as this book encourages. It seems to me that certain overburdened women would like to believe that they can relinquish their burdens by placing them on their husbands. Ladies, I think you are sensible enough to know that this is not only wrong, but unBiblical! God wants us to humble ourselves, true, but that doesn't mean placing ourselves beneath our husbands.This author honestly believes that not only will a sweet quiet spirit cure a husband's abusive actions and bad decisions, but that women are almost always to blame for their husband's bad actions. Nearly every time she shares an example a woman gives her in a letter, she twists the circumstances around until the wife is at fault. In one case, a wife wrote in saying she felt guilty for selling wet wheat under her farmer husband's orders, because she felt that the wheat wasn't in fit condition. Even though the government wheat-buyer accepted the wheat, she still felt guilty. Handford declared that this woman's real problem was that she felt herself wiser than her husband and the government, and should have just trusted her husband's judgement. This wife had a weak conscience, not a strong one, Handford said, because she was doubting her husband.In the next example, a mother complained of a husband who beat her son. After hearing that the son and the wife had both been disobedient to the father, Handford decided the husband was probably only disciplining the child, that the wife was overreacting, and that she was most likely to blame for her husband's treatment of the child. And, in the most extreme example yet, a woman told Handford that her husband made her get an abortion. They'd been using contraceptives, she explained, and she had enough trouble keeping up with the housework and finances, so her husband had her get the abortion. Handford's response to this? The wife probably secretly wanted an abortion and the husband was just granting her wish! Handford claimed that if the wife had wheedlingly approached her husband and apologized for complaining about the housework, promised to do better, and begged the husband to reconsider, he would have changed his mind!! That was Handford's response: it must have been the wife's fault she was overburdened with work and had to get an abortion. In EVERY example, Handford twisted the situation and made ungrounded presumptions about the wife's motives in order to make the problems the WIFE'S fault. I can't believe this callous woman! I've never seen such blatant, cruel twisting of a person's account in my life. Handford needs to be highly avoided by troubled women.Not only are books like this discouraging, but they also manage to come out as sickly sweet and trite. Handford not only assures women that becoming obedient doormats will win them second honeymoons, marital bliss, and their husband's favor, but she acts as though it's some sort of guarantee for a healthy marriage, the one Golden Rule. She harps about obeying your husband like it's something that must remain branded on your brain tissue at all times: obey your husband, and you'll be okay; obey him, and God will bless you; obey him, and you're doing the right thing, because no matter how silly his request is, he'll turn out to be right as a default just because he's the male in the relationship and God designed it that way. She even shared a story about boarding a plane in cold, unpleasant, and possibly dangerous weather, telling herself the whole time that she needed to \\"obey her husband\\". So this bad boarding plan was hubby's idea and that's why she went along with it; how admirable. To top it all off, though, her husband actually wrote an introduction in this book, assuring the reader that the Mrs. really did obey him like a good little girl their whole marriage, always following him, and we should be assured that she's a good source of wisdom because she practices what she preaches. Thanks, Mr. Handford; you just offered the crown reason I should avoid freakish family practices like yours. I hope you're proud of yourself for stifling your wife's spirit.I find it sad that certain women think Satan tries to hurt us by keeping us AWAY from these books. It's the opposite; he'd love for us to twist God's words about submission to the point where we're idolizing our husbands and that's exactly what Handford has done. So many times books advise women not to treat themselves like goddesses and then advise treating their husbands like gods instead. That's just as wrong as treating yourself like God; there's only one God and He is not us or our husbands. It is beyond me why certain women glorify the position beneath a man's shoe, particularly with comments such as \\"submission is freedom\\" (meaning one-sided submission, not the healthy sort). Sure..and war is peace, ignorance is strength, etc. Whatever you say, Big Sister (see Orwell's \\"1984\\" for more examples of twisted principles). If you really consider reading this, I suggest you read the other reviews first, both the good and the bad. I think they speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"Honeys, get a grip.

But when God's truths taken out of the context ( like this book does)and out of the context He intened us to hear....you get unfortunatley, as well intended as this author may be...an unbalanced and very dangerous,unhealthy perspective. I mean no disrespect to the author, who wrote this book. I am in Women's ministry. And within the Church I attend ,we have had to do damage control, and re-educate Men and Women after they read this unhealthy book and take this book litteraly .They don't go to God's Word to check and see if this book is telling the truth. ANY Book on lifes issues and spiritual things ,MUST be taken to the Word and examined. If it is a well written book ( and this book is not)it should be a supliment not a substitute for reading and understanding His word. The word for \\"submit\\" in scripture when applied to the wife does not mean \\"obey\\"....as in stop ,listen and do.But in the marriage context it is a word that means \\" a voluntary,cooperation with your husbands will\\". However, IT HAS LIMITS, if that will of the husband oversteps the will of God, and what is clearly written in His word...Her first priority is to obey God, and what is clearly written. I saw some truths, but the out of context statements of absolute obedience no matter what to a husband is not biblical and it is a false statment.It hung a dark cloud over the text. God didn't want marriage-olitry, or husband-olitry. Cooperation,coming along side, and sometimes biting our tongue is a good thing and ALL good relationships consist of this respect,whether it is Moms, Dads,co-workers, Sisters,brothers...friends.Get into the biblical context.....there is true wisdom and freedom there. Test all things by researching Gods Word!! Don't just believe a few scriptures out of their context.There are some other well written books on this issue that are in context,and compliment Gods word and hold men equally responsible for being a loving, Noncontrol freak, nurturing.......hmmmm like Christ who gave His life for the Church.

I obey my husband and rejoice in my role as helpmeet. I am not in open rebellion, nor do I chafe at my position in the created order. Submission, understood biblically, is a beautiful, healthy teaching.There are nuggets of truth in this book. But much of Mrs. Handford's take on submission is dangerous in that it pulls Scriptures out of context and creates moral binds where Scripture does not. Her insistence that you MUST obey your husband in every conceivable situation just does not jive with Scripture. We have clear examples of godly people &quot;sinning&quot; when it served a higher purpose. Take, for example, Rahab, the harlot who lied about the spies in Jericho in order to save their lives and preserve her own family. She is counted as a righteous woman and is in the genealogy of Christ! A woman is never put into a situation where she must sin AND obey her husband. The most odious and deplorable example given by Mrs. Handford was the young woman whose husband forced her to have an abortion. Blaming the abortion on the woman's attitude toward childbearing is just plain wrong. Her husband was ultimately responsible for this sin. And as for the other young woman who prayed that God would change her husband's mind when he asked her to abort their child, she had to disobey her husband's direct command to do this! To obey him would have meant calling the clinic to schedule an abortion when he asked--not praying for a week that he would change his mind. So this is a clear example (in Mrs. Handford's own book) of a young woman disobeying her husband for the right reasons.There are many books out there with far better explanations of the doctrine of submission. The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace is probably the best. But, whatever you do, please read ALL books with the Bible at your side and context in view! Forcing Scripture to fit an extreme view like Mrs. Handford's is dangerous."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"If you'd rather not have a thought in your pretty little Stepford wife head, this is your book. Frankly, as a Christian woman, this book makes me laugh and feel sick by turns. I thank God that I am married to a man who expects me to be an equal partner. This book tries to prettify the word &quot;submission,&quot; but we all know what it means. I'm sorry for the little girls who grow up in homes where the mothers and fathers truly believe this stuff."},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"This book was published in 1972 with the intention of documenting the appropriate relationship women to their husbands. If taken seriously, the title should be &quot;Slavery: Role for Wives.&quot; The picture of God presented is of Someone you would never want to spend eternity with. The book contain laugh generating subtitles and entire chapters which: 1)suggest &quot;her conscience is not a good guide&quot; [only her husband is];2)instructs women to obey their husbands even if &quot;she feels God is directly instructing her to do something else.&quot;[close paraphrase]; 3) advises &quot;She has the freedom of consequence of decisions&quot; a backhanded way of saying women should not make decisions. This book is a hoot! But, it is not a spiritual guide for to a loving God. Most Christians, feel this is unscriptural bunk. The recently released &quot;updated&quot; version is only slightly less &quot;woman=slave&quot;, but nonetheless still carries that tune very well. It would be an insult to any person to treat them as is presented in this book. Do I want to go to a Heaven where slavery lives on? - No!"},{"Title":"Me? Obey Him?","review":"Ms. Handford is asking wives to ignore their consciences when faced with a husband's command to sin. She says God will always, always (her words) provide an &quot;out&quot; for the wife who knows what her husband is asking her to do is sin. If He doesn't, it's because He sees she is not willing to obey, anyway.Ms. Handford's whole premise bypasses the high incidence of spousal abuse today and the fact that a controlling, sadistic husband can use this book to destroy his wife. Her solution to a situation like this? Submit ever more deeply, faithfully and thoroughly. In this way lies madness for emotionally and physically battered wives who can no longer discern what is rational and what is not.Following this teaching, a woman can potentially ignore all Scriptures except those specifically addressed to wives."},{"Title":"Me?

I am very much like the other lady, in the fact that we were just about to get a divorce.

Then I read the book and I realized that understanding submission this way makes MY life SO MUCH EASIER!! Ultimately what the author is saying is that when he, the husband, screws up, it is HIS responsibility to account for it to God. When WE make our own decisions that makes US accountable. Using submission this way takes us right off the hook with God. Personally that took a huge weight off my shoulders.

Some women have found out the hard way and some are going around helping others to save their marriage. The truth cuts like a two edged sword. If your not practicing the Holy Bible, then your practicing what the Holy Bible tells us to abstain from. Two kings cannot maintain residence within the same household one will kill the other or one will leave, but a queen can live with a king very happily may I might add. What the critics who gave bad reviews must not have read the book or just don't know how to read. (1 Cor 11:8 KJV) For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. (Eph 5:22 KJV)Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. (Eph 5:23 KJV) For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body. (Eph 5:24 KJV) Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. (1 Cor 11:9 KJV) Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. (1 Cor 11:4 KJV) Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. (1 Cor 11:5 KJV) But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. (Luke 2:23 KJV) (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) (Titus 2:4 KJV) That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, (Titus 2:5 KJV) To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. (Col 3:18 KJV) Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. (1 Pet 3:1 KJV) Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; (1 Pet 3:5 KJV) For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: (1 Pet 3:6 KJV) Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. (1 Pet 3:7 KJV) Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. (Gen 3:16 KJV) Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. (1 Tim 2:11 KJV) Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. (1 Tim 2:12 KJV) But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. (1 Tim 2:13 KJV) For Adam was first formed, then Eve. (1 Tim 2:14 KJV) And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. (1 Tim 2:15 KJV) Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety. I applaud Elizabeth Rice Handford."},{"Title":"Me?

I only wish to comment on the review from throughaglassdarkly.I have read books on femininity and it has changed my whole perspective - do you know what freedom and delight comes from being a truly feminine woman? Being submissive is not slavery - it is freedom. Being obedient to your husband is not degrading, it makes him want to treat you like a queen. Free to obey, free to love. Free to serve, free to be secure.There is no true happiness for a woman besides obeying God by obeying her husband. Take this from someone who knows - I have had feminist ideas. I wanted to have a career and didn't even want to get married. But then I was introduced to femininity and oh, what a delight has come from it!

I finally got her point at the VERY end of the book, but I can not say that I agree with the applications that she put forth throughout the book. The book seemed (to me) to be poorly written with sketchy stories and scattered ideas. Which is why I had such a hard time grasping her point. She also, in my opinion, spent alot of time pushing her own opinion while classifying it as Truth. There was also some questionable useage/interpretation/reading into the scriptures; I found myself saying, \\"That's not what that scripture is even talking about!\\" alot.The best chapter in the book was Chapter 1(although many won't agree), but the book somewhat goes downhill from there. I also found the title amusing which is why I gave the book 2 stars (1- for Ch. 1 & 1- for the title). I've read much better books on this subject that have gotten to the root of the problem and helped me greatly in becoming a submissive wife.

Obey Him?","review":"First of all, Ms. Rice is doing an excellent interpretation of partiarchal teaching and freeing women of much responsibility. But in fact, there is no instruction in the Bible that we must obey our husbands. That is extra Biblical and reading a lot into passages that is not there. The one most often used of course is Eph 5:22, where it talks about wives. Then it goes on to talk about slaves, and the greek word where it does tell slaves to obey their masters is a completely different word than the one used for wives. Paul knew what he was doing. And really an analogy can go only go so far...your husband is not Christ to you, nor a mediary between Christ and you. That is untruth."},{"Title":"Me?

This book has brought romance and happiness and peace to my marriage, and much peace to me. I am much happier after implementing the principles of this book than before. Submission equals joy, not sorrow. Submission is willing compliance, not forced compliance. We have the honor of laying down our lives for our husbands, much as Jesus laid down his life for us.

She referenced several couples (Abraham & Sarah; David & Michal; Queen Vashti & King Ahasuerus) in the Bible to augment her argument that a woman is to submit to her husband. I found her interpretations to be assuming, misconstrued, and incomplete.I hesitantly recommend the book with this caveat - Open your heart and mind to the book's overall message, Our (women's) submission to our Lord is God's plan for our marriage.

Obedience of all to God almighty, and different people have different *God-given, God-mandated* roles to live out, for which He has equipped them if they are willing.

As we follow the narrator down her lonely and doomed path, it is clear that we are in the hands of a skilled storyteller."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"Mishima's _Thirst for Love_ is most readily understood in the context of his other writings and thematic concerns. Throughout his literary career, Mishima was deeply troubled by changes in Japanese culture during modernity (starting around the 19th century) and beyond, particularly after the Asia-Pacific War (1931-1945). He viewed the loss of tradition as devastating to any culture, leaving them without an initial way to healthily exist and understand the processes of life and death. Japan, with its slow accretion of Western culture, was merely one macrocosmic example of this historical trend._Thirst for Love_ is in part a fictional presentation of this cultural decline: examples of decay are present throughout the novel, such as Miyo's rejection of traditional dress and customs, Etsuko's obsession with the lower-class farmhand, Kensuke's pathetic pseudo-intellectualism, Saburo's physical transgressions against Etsuko, and numerous others. It is imperative, then, that each of these chracters be frustrated with their actions in life and ultimately reach a sort of destruction, for they are all encapsulations of Mishima's \\"fallen man,\\" the one without guidance from tradition and sane, known ways of living.A psychological reading of the book would prove fascinating, particularly of Etsuko, Saburo, Takichi, and Kensuke.Mishima's characterization in this work is admittedly rather weak, relative to his other novel-length works. Perhaps this is because adding satisfactory details and back history to each of the many characters introduced throughout the book would have proven difficult, if not impossible. Another interpretation offers the possibility of using this character shortcoming as a depiction of what Mishima felt towards each of these characters; to him, there is not much behind these people that is interesting or worth delving in to psychologically. They are his \\"fallen men,\\" and as such a long, descriptive background and intimate storytelling would seem out of place, casting them into greater heights of worth - in the artist's mind - than warranted.The beauty of Mishima's prose (and the translation of that prose) is, as usual, quite good. Passages evoking Osaka in the rain, evening in the country, and the throng of crowds and jubilation at the seasonal festival are all excellently composed.My major faults with the novel derive from its relatively unengaging plot (compared to other works by the author) and the fact that its message has been told and retold numerous times by other authors, psychologists, and philosophers, including the author himself (though at a later point in his career)."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"Mishima is a fascinating and intoxicating author to me, but I felt a little disappointed with Thirst for Love after having read the Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. It seems less focused somehow; I found certain segments a bit dull and the end somewhat dissatisfying (not just because it wasn't &quot;happy.&quot;) But, those are just the cons -- I still think this is quite a book. Etsuko's psychology is fascinating, and there are some great moments. Quality, unconventional stuff."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"Although this is not one of the best novels of Mishima, I think is quite a good book. The author denudes one of the most painful realities of human condition, the unattainment of love. All the characters are frustrated in their thirst for love, nobody is loved by their beloveds and the weak one has the worst part. Also on this novel (the passage of the night party)you can find one of the most erotic writings in literature. This is a good book about desire and its wicked ways."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"Published in 1950 Thirst for Love was one of Mishima's early novels and written shortly after his Confessions of a Mask which had already gained him celebrated public acclaim. The novel is set on a ten acre property on the outskirts of Osaka owned by Yakichi, a retired businessman and widower in his sixties but wishing to return to traditional life living off the land. With Yakichi is his indolent intellectual son Kensuke and his wife Cheiko, daughter-in-law Asako (whose husband is in Siberia) 8 year old daughter Nobuko and 5 year old son Natsuo, and the recently widowed third daughter-in-law Etsuko. The household is completed by a young peasant maid Miyo and 18 year old gardener, Saburo. Mishima focuses on the relationships between the above especially Etsuko whose husband had been a very unfaithful philanderer and now Etsuko has become the mistress of her father-in-law, Yakichi. Her passionate obsession is for the young tanned and good looking gardener, Saburo. Saburo is a nave innocent young man who is having a physical relationship with Miyo and unaware of Etsuko's obsession and jealousy. Mishima's contrasts the relationships in the household: the intellectual cynical detached relationship of Kensuke and Chieko and the physical but loveless relationship between Miyo and Saburo. The mix of love, sex, death, obsession, jealousy is central to a number of Mishima's works and Thirst for Love lacks appeal largely for the very detached manner the characters interact. Mishima's writing I enjoy and I have loved several of his other novels Confessions of a Mask, Spring Snow and Forbidden Colours but Thirst for Love is not as good. There are moments of brilliance such as the detailed account of a Festival with a Lion, green mane streaming and the frenzied activity of the half naked young men following behind. The ending was difficult to comprehend especially the physical tidying up by Yakichi and Etsuko, all rather odd to me. Thirst for Love is an appropriate title for there is no love in this book and to satisfy thirst I would suggest reading another of Mishima's novels."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"Not long ago I was astounded by the brutality, truth, and beauty in my first taste of Yukio Mishima -- The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea. Randomly picking out his work, the next book I stumbled upon was the Sound of Waves. And eventhough from a critical point of view, the Sound of Waves has its obvious flaws. From a readers point of view, it was a great novel. Next I picked up Thirst For Love, and I was surprisingly dissapointed.First off, I found ALL the characters in this book dull and unlikeable. With the exception of Etsuko, who is generally unappealing; None of the other characters are really developed. As another reviewer pointed out, it almost seems like important parts of the plot had been taken out of the book. The story itself aimlessly drags along going nowhere, occasionally making similarly aimless detours. But regardless of all of that, it simply isn't an interesting read. There is no outrage, no excitement, no point. Maybe to really understand this story you had to be in Japan at the time, that cultural wall is always present in Japanese literature. However, I found this wall to be too high to climb."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"Thirst For Love was only Mishima's second novel, and it shows. It could probably have been made into something great, but the author was either too hasty to finish it or simply didn't know what to do. Despite its great title, it's somewhat of a disappointment. I figure it was an attempt at writing an anti-romance, some kind of complete inversion of the concept of the love story. Well, it wasn't a success. The first half of the book is mired in scenes that don't go anywhere (such as the grotesque flashback where Etsuko's husband dies - did we really need that? why was it included?), and this makes the developments of the second half a bit of a shock. It seemed rather sudden how Etsuko's mild interest in the gardener Saburo turned into complete obsession. Certain aspects of the book sorely needed more attention from the author - Yakichi's attitude toward Etsuko could have been turned into something involving, but ends up being a mere tangent, a check mark on the laundry list of plot points. Had Mishima further developed the backstory of the family, we might have understood what lay behind the enmity between its various members, but it went almost completely unexplained, and said members end up coming across as spiteful for no reason. On the other hand, there are plot lines that are completely pointless and blatantly fabricated and yet are for some reason drawn out to great length - namely, the utterly inane subplot with the socks Etsuko buys.Admittedly, the bit about the festival conveys the appropriate feeling of frenzy. Also, Mishima does a fine job of showing the dichotomy between the overly sensitive, wounded Etsuko and the utterly uncaring, &quot;light man&quot; Saburo. But these are small parts; the whole just isn't all that good. And let's not even get started on the deliberately &quot;shocking&quot; ending, which goes completely against what little character development Mishima bothered to put in. I got the feeling that he simply didn't know how to end the story, and so took the first way out that occurred to him; it would have been better if he had given it a little more thought. In fact, that can be said of just about everything in this book apart from the title. Feel free to skip it and go straight to the masterpiece The Sound Of Waves."},{"Title":"Thirst for Love","review":"the guy below doesnt know what he is talking about, he didnt understand anything"},{"Title":"Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java(TM)","review":"This is one of the greatest books about assembly you can buy...I will tell you why:The most of the books (e.g. 'Assembly Language Master Class' of Wrox) which you can buy about assembly are about topics like 'how to paint a bitmap on the screen', 'how to write to a file', 'how to read a character from the keyboard', and so on.This is nice if you only want to know some little tricks and learn (nearly) nothing about assembly.If you want to learn something about assembly buy this book!

Versions are also available for DOS, Windows, Sun Sparc, and Macintosh OS X."},{"Title":"Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java(TM)","review":"This is probably one of the best computer architecture books I have ever read. The thing I like about this book is that Reis does not fall into the same trap as other authors and fills the first seven chapters of the book with lessons on what binary and hex is and how to convert between the two. I have always hated when technical authors begin an advanced technical book with freshmen level topics such as number systems. Real does not repeat this typical mistake. He actually teaches advanced topics such as how the JVM actually works, or how to write a simple compiler by using simple examples and that one can build on. He is obviously very knowledgeable, but uses non technical language in order to reach you. Kudos for a job well done Mr. Reis."},{"Title":"Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java(TM)","review":"I really have nothing to add to the other reviews of this book. I've never learned as much from one single book as I have reading this one.

Yes, one can find all the words in the unabridged Liddell & ScottA Greek-English Lexicon, Ninth Edition with a Revised Supplement, but the latter volume is not very portable, and it has far more information than a reader of the LXX will need.A more important difference, though, is that the present volume addresses many matters of lexical meaning that are peculiar to the LXX. Many senses given are followed by verse references. An exceptionally helpful feature, and one which I am sure took much time to develop, is the inclusion of hypotheses about how certain odd-looking translations in Greek may have been derived from the Hebrew text. This may be due to a different assumed voweling, a slightly different consonantal text or a simple misunderstanding by the Greek translators.Words unique to the LXX and literature based on it are marked, as are words found in the NT. Corrections to Rahlf'sSeptuaginta, to which this is a companion volume, are also indicated.While my overall impression of this volume is very good, there are a few desiderata I have for a subsequent edition:1. Many of the translations are rather old-fashioned, and some are positively obsolete. I burst out laughing when I found \\"conjure\\" as the translation of *exorkizo*, which means 'to put under oath'. The fact that this gloss is found in Liddell & Scott suggests that the authors depended too much on its quaint 19th-century and earlier vocabulary, rather than giving modern English equivalents in all cases.2. Occasionally an additional gloss is needed. For example, *elegcw* (elenkho) needs the gloss 'to prove to be' for Wisdom 2:11.3. This lexicon has extremely few cross-references for unexpected or irregular forms. A few more would be highly desirable as an aid to students. Among them are *arnos* referring to *amnos* 'lamb, sheep' and *qhmwnia* (themonia) referring to *qimwnia* (thimonia) 'heap'."},{"Title":"Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint (Greek Edition)","review":"I do not regularly read the Septuagint, but there are times when a passage from it is helpful for work in the New Testament. At such times the last thing one wants is to encounter an unfamiliar vocable or a vocable that has a twist in meaning different from the usual New Testament meaning. Such words are not likely to be found in other Greek lexicons. For such times this work is very helpful. It is not exactly a concordance to the Septuagint, but does give several passages where the word is used, sometimes indicating the list is complete for all occurences. It is spendy, but a very good resource.

If you wish to learn to use the bosal hackamore to work a horse, then THIS is a very good place to start. Read it over and over, and take your time when working a horse... it's much more difficult to \\"train out\\" mistakes than it is to avoid them by being patient, gentle and thoughtful. Anyone who loves horses and knows them, will probably agree that though they are not \\"people in animal skins\\", they certainly are incredibly intelligent and sensitive beings, worthy of respect and kindness.

Despite what others will say about the time required to make a horse using this technique from the very beginning, I have found that these practices are immensely beneficial in re-establishing cues with problem horses. The KEY thing, to me, is that you can send a strong message or demonstrate control without ruining that soft mouth, and can handle a hard-mouthed horse if necessary. In a relatively short time a horse will begin to lighten up and respond, perhaps because there isn't the perceived threat of the bit or mebbe due to new and different signals? No matter, it works! 3 or 4 arena workouts, some easy trail rides with cues given as needed, and you'll start to see marked improvement. Sure, we'd all give an arm for a vaquero-made horse, or the time to do train one. If you can't get that, settle for next best, a safe pleasant horse with a nice soft handle.

The first two were White Banners and Green Light. I would recommend these as well. Douglas wrote back in the 1930s and his stories hold up well over time.This particular story is about a young medical student in his quest to be a great surgeon. He attends a medical school that is headed by a brilliant yet undeniably lacking-in-social-skills doctor with the improbable name of Tubby Forrester. Dr. Forrester is a strong proponent that doctors must retain an objective distance from patients to be able to implement the best treatment. He and our protagonist immediately butt heads, but as it becomes apparent what promise out budding doctor holds, Dr. Forrester goads as well as aids our hero to push himself to be the best.Dr. Forrester and our hero continue to almost hate each other, but they also work well together. Add to this mix the appearance of an old college mate of Dr. Forrester's who does not espouse the same medical theories Forrester does. This doctor maintains that a patient should be treated holistically and not just for his specific ailment.The themes in this book are surprisingly current. Further, the author writes a great narrative that contains conflict, romance, a touch of humor, and a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Disputed Passage","review":"Not quite as good as &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; but still exceptionally good.

I think this claim in intuitively true. A lot of films show kids in their underwear gratuitously and use the ambivalence of art to insinuate what taboo dictates cannot be directly stated. Macaulay Culkin in the \\"Home Alone\\" movies is a beautiful blonde with unnatural cherry-red lips like Harlowe or Monroe!But the conclusions Kinkaid draws from his observations aren't as forceful and eloquent as the debunking observations themselves. If he is right, what does this mean? His answer seems to be kind of vague. He suggests we rewrite the Gothic script and stop overrating innocence and panicking about the burgeoning sexuality of the young. His pervasive humor throughout the book suggests a kind a campy scholarship. I am all for humor, but I think Kinkaid needs to write another book about how our society can get out of the quandary of its sexual hypocrisy. It's a larger and more complex subject than he seems to think. Also, he chooses his pictures poorly, and I think they're essential to making his points about the eroticized child.I hope these misgivings don't steer you away from \\"Erotic Innocence\\" though. Its a totally fresh perspective, and how many books deliver that anymore? Read it as the opening slavo of what I'm predicting will be a long 21st century battle between the prigs and the libertarians."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"Kincaid takes on a droll tone throughout this book that urges us to examine our relationship to children. Kincaid wishes to get rid of the paranoia and hysteria around the threat of child molesting and provides some evidence that adults are somewhat sexually attracted to children, but loath to admit it. If we admitted the attraction and stopped treating it like a sick perversion we could live in a saner, less fearful environment. Our culture also celebrates the childlike features as sexual, but we condemn those who get too turned on by them. Beauty contests for children are given as an example of our making children sexy. Kincaid suggests that we stop looking for monsters and sinister purposes in others, thinking that they are potential child molesters. We should stop passing draconian laws that give godlike powers to the police. And we should not accuse others of being child molesters for advocating a lighter approach to child molesting problems.Kincaid thinks that we are trapped in a never-ending gothic story of a monster that comes after our children and violates their innocence .We then do a lot of porn babbling about the events as if to say, \\"It is an awful unspeakable story. Please tell it to me in every detail again.\\" The child molesting stories serve prurient interests in adults, sexually titillating them.Kincaid goes over films and books and pulls out the sexual overtones of child characters in entertainment such as Shirley Temple with her flirtations and kids in their underwear for half of the movie. When a child star reaches adolescence people often forget them since they are no longer cute, but are gangly, awkward looking teenagers. Adult movie goers often make these kiddy films big hits, especially if they produce nostalgia or images of the perfect adorable child along with butt and penis jokes. This also says something about the people producing the films, I must say. I have also noticed on junk TV talk shows, they will have sexy problem children sexually act out by doing a dance, for instance, before they get down to business of trying to cure the child or teen's precociousness. This has a way of arousing the audience and then condemning the sexiness afterwards. Talk about having your cake and eating it too!People are also indifferent to the many physically abused and neglected kids who are not so cute or adorable. There are a lot of runaway and throwaway kids, but people focus on child abduction and molesting cases rather than deal with the larger and mundane problems of child neglect.Kincaid encourages us to \\"change the story\\" about child molesting so that we can look at the problems another way and quit producing a culture that produces child molesting, monsters, hypocrites, paranoia, and violent vigilante reactions. We seem unwilling to understand ourselves fully.We should question the innocence of children, which comes from romantic notions of the child. Kincaid asserts that children can be sexy naturally and are not that innocent; it is our romantic notions that make them seem innocent. We should question the veracity of children's testimony and recovered memories from hypnotized adults. He goes over some of the more dubious accusations of child molesting such as the McMartin daycare case which started with a phone call from a paranoid schizophrenic. Child testimony can also be tainted if questions are leading. Often in our culture, if someone is accused of child molesting the public already wants to believe that the accused is guilty and they tend to overlook any contradictions in the testimony against the accused. False accusations of child molesting ruin people's lives.Kincaid makes light of a usually grave topic, perhaps too much so from time to time. But he does show that some of the brouhaha around child molestation is due to paranoia and hysteria. I think that there is more serious side to it that he does not address."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"Kincaid begins from the premise that our culture's stories are flexible, and reflect our underlying cosmologies. He demonstrates convincingly that myths about childhood innocence and concurrent vulnerability arose historically as we created a separate cultural identity for children. This stoked a quasi-erotic love of children as innocents, and a hatred of those who act out that eroticism. There is a widespread obsession with children, and an obsession with those who act on that societally generated eroticism. Those who are inclined to hate have fostered a bitter hatred of those who are trapped by the wrong kind of love of children. Dahmers and Gacys are rare and twisted individuals, but they are held up by these haters as representatives of all who break the rules for touching and loving children. Kincaid shows, though, that society dotes on cute, eroticized children, as long as appropriate hypocrisies are maintained. He suggests that the frenzied hatred of child-abusers is fed by this same hypocritical eroticism. Up to this point, Kincaid is bold and persuasive. Children themselves become damaged by the myth, being taught that be be desired or contacted erotically by an adult is to become the most damaged of society's victims, and even potential abusers themselves, and that any love expressed in these relationships, perhaps by the only adult who has shown them love, is absolutely thereby discounted. The truth is that &quot;hard-core&quot; sexual contact with children is a harmful and abusive practice, and only the most blind or self-serving can deny this. Kincaid does not attempt to deny this, although he questions its frequency. Kincaid challenges all of us to find ways to reconcile the awareness of this cold harm with our &quot;warm&quot; behaviors in the unmapped areas of love. The book fails however in developing effective and compelling alternative stories. The tortuous paradigm he describes throughout the book exists, besides serving a &quot;pleasure-principle motive&quot;, as a societal adaptation to prevent a shift into the wholesale abuse of children. The current and hypocritical arrangement kills and imprisons some relativey innocent adults as a means of controlling and containing erotic impulsivity towards children, but much of life seems to work this way. We may need new stories if we are to act in a more wholesome and communally suportive fashion, but Dr. Kincaid does not succeed in outlining them. Thus the pain and hurt (and titillation) will go on. Maybe there are no better stories. Still, the gauntlet has been flung."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"Aside from the lurid title, Mr. Kinkaid's book on the &quot;glorification&quot; of child sexuality is a harsh study on America's fascination with all manner of things erotic. Born in Europe, I can say with some knowledge that Americans do seem to have a bizarre need to know all the details of molestation cases...almost as if they were suffering from the same desires as the perpetrators. Mr. Kinkaid's points are well presented, although to the point of monotony. After several pages devoted to Shirley Temple, I will never be able to view &quot;Heidi&quot; in the same way again. The dichotomy of writing a book of this sort is that Mr. Kinkaid becomes almost as guilty of the very activities of which he accuses Americans. Yes, some ideas and subjects must be broached in a manner that borders on exploitation, but still....a little less detail of certain elements would have sufficed. All in all, Mr. Kinkaid has written a very disturbing, yet highly important work. Perhaps the next time a mother or father decides to dress a nine-year-old girl up in a skimpy bikini, they will think twice before doing so. Cute? Maybe...But what message are we sending, anyway, when we show as much young flesh as we tend to do? Remember Jon-Benet Ramsey?"},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"It would be both easy and comforting to dismiss Kincaid as being prone to over-generalization, as projecting his own sick fantasies onto the world at large, and as being dismissive of the reality of child abuse and its seriousness. It would also be ridiculous. Kincaid presents an excellent thesis (That our culture's Victorian era sexualization of children is responsible for our modern child fixation and abuse, and that this sexualization is harmful to children). He discusses the ways that our erotic fixation on children serves us. Overall, this is a very interesting and compelling book.There are a few problems with it however:-He fails to recognize that children (and/or young adolescents) were treated sexually prior to the Victorian reinvention of the child and that there may or may not be biological and/or evolutionary reasons for fixation on children. Kincaid asks repeatedly why we think of children as sexual, what in our culture makes us believe that this is the case, but fails each time to consider that children may in fact Be sexual. I am not suggesting that children are actually legitimate erotic targets, but it is poor logic to never consider the possibility.-He approaches this discussion from a literary analysis perspective. The thesis may have been better served by a sociologist, a psychologist, an anthropologist, or a historian. Towards the end of the book he attempts to find solutions for our cultural conundrum, and suggests the creation of new stories. He constantly berates well-meaning individuals for prolonging \\"the conversation\\". While I agree that in part public discourse that assumes that childhood = victimhood and that sexual abuse = irrevocable damage may be harmful, I find it counter-productive to suggest that not talking about the problem will solve it. Additionally, a social scientist might have had a slightly more cogent grasp of the recovered/false memory controversy.-Finally, he tends towards utterly irrelevant asides (periodically in defense of Freud, which certainly didn't win him any points with me). Some of these are funny, some of which show his biases, and some of them seem to serve no purpose at all. More editing and a slightly more academic (by which I mean a reliance on evidence and science rather than conjecture and metaphor) take would have made this a much stronger book.Overall, this book is fascinating, but should be read with a critical eye, and ideally paired with \\"Harmful To Minors\\" by Judith Levine."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"Want your eyes opened? Read this book. I must warn you though, after flipping through channels a few hours following the introduction of this book, you may want to get rid of your television. Kincaid really ticked me off initially in his intro, but by the end of it I was mesmerized clear through to the end of the book. The thought that we have and still do sexualize children in our country (and world) really sucks at first, but then you realize its true and it almost makes you sick to your stomach. It took so much strength to write this book. I commend you Mr. Kincaid."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"I haven't read this book but I had a class with Kincaid. A few remarks: The people whose reviews said that he did not have good evidence did not provide anything better to argue their side. So, without what they consider sufficient evidence for either argument (child abuse is or isn't a social construction), they side with the status quo. In other words, they never even thought about it. Kincaid always told us that he didn't pretend to have unearthed any absolute truth, he just thought it was valid to see things in ways that make you uncomfortable. I hate to sound like a fanatic, but honestly, I've never thought of the world in the same way since having his class. Also, his writing is always well-crafted and frequently hilarious (check out Annoying the Victorians)."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"While Kincaid makes a number of interesting points on the way Western culture venerates The Child (and includes some insightful historical and literary evidence), the book falls apart after the introductory chapters. Since this book was written some decades ago, the work is unfortunately outdated and fails to take a critical eye to class and race in the analysis. I wonder what this book would be if it were written within the last 5 years."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"Mr. Kincaid presents the reader with an in-depth look at what lies behind the average person's idea of what a child is. Similarly, he shows how this (apparently flawed and dangerous) concept is commonly fit into what he calls a &quot;story,&quot; which is a subjective, but shared, view of a certain type of situation. He concentrates on accounts dealing with sexual abuse. Whenever someone is accused of sexually abusing a child, Kincaid says, there is an almost universal compulsion to put people into roles of innocent victim (the child,) protector (the police, and others) and inhuman monster (the accused,) even if it does not fit the facts. Further, he says, this ideal of &quot;child&quot; is very commonplace in works of art, showing that adults have a strange compulsion to be entertained by a certain kind of child, in a certain kind of situation. Then, Kincaid comes to his emphatic conclusion: The reason children are treated and thought of in this way is because adults, all adults, are sexually attracted to children, and simultaneously feel that it is wrong and act to deny and hide it.The above explanation does not follow from the book's contents. The author presents no evidence (short of listing countless plots of novels and movies involving children, then insisting that they are erotic,) makes no attempt to validate or support his thesis with either psychological, empirical, or sociological data, and worst of all, acts as if this methodology is just hunky-dory. His irrational and similarly unsupported contention that all knowledge and accounts of past events are merely malleable, subjective &quot;stories&quot; is simply a sloppy way of covering up the fact that his entire explanation is arbitrary and unsupported by any logic or truth.I was certainly willing to consider his ideas, indeed, that is why I read the book at all. In fact, _Erotic Innocence_ is not without its worth. Buried underneath the rambling, egg-headed prose lie some interesting insights. For example, that many people do have a false and harmful idea of what children are or should be. That these same people obsessively and emotionally try to make a predetermined Gothic melodrama play out in every sexual abuse case involving children, even in defiance of facts. Those points, to varying degrees, are reasonably well argued. What is not, is his fantastic explanation of why this is so.The most ominous thing about this book, though, is that Kincaid purports to be one of but a few people who can cut through the hysteria with truth, when in fact he adds to it a hundredfold by saying that EVERYONE is a pedophile and that (nearly?) every work of art involving children eroticizes them. Furthermore, his solution is not for people to wake up from the &quot;story&quot; and see things as they are, but to instead construct new &quot;stories,&quot; i.e. to delude themselves into believing something else. This, he has the gall to call &quot;rational.&quot;&quot;I believe most adults in our culture feel some measure of erotic attraction to children and the childlike; I do not know how it could be otherwise,&quot; he writes, in a statement which summarizes the book's logic.Sorry, Mr. Kincaid. I need a lot more than your testimony of faith to believe such a fantastic story."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"This is a dreadful book, one of the worst I've ever read.In brief, Kincaid cannot write. Admittedly he can put nouns with verbs and form sentences into paragraphs. But he cannot tell a story or present a coherent analysis or argument. And he is a bore of the first magnitude, telling inane stories of no particular point and going off into multiple and serpentine tangents.He leadens his ancedotes with incessant, irrelevent asides, employing a smart-alecky undergraduate \\"humor\\". He is a master of the sweeping, unsupported generalization. He will not let his reader draw his own conclusion, but pounds away at his very limited point.That point? Simply that American popular culture exploits the dangers of child molestation for its own {commercial}purposes. Way to go professor!See for example the last paragraph at page 207, as bad a piece of writing as you will ever see. A news-wire story about a child molester in Texas somehow winds up in East Liverpool, Ohio, where the reader is gratutiously informed-twice no less- a Notre Dame football coach hails from. There is also something about \\"The judge slurping back drool as he spoke\\". What? This is a god-awful mess.Or try his final tale at pp. 294-295 where Kincaid takes us to a muddy field outside a circus where a bore is haranguing him while his grand-daughter is about to topple into a pit. What? And talk about calling other people boorish!The evidence for his main conclusion is his addictive watching of trashy daytime T.V., movies largely featuring little boys such as the \\"adorable\\" Culkin kid and wads of old newspaper ads he clips. Presumably his idea of multi-tasking is clipping news articles about weird events while watching Orpah's latest soap opera.Not surprisingly then Kincaid is himself infatuated with children, primarily boy children. He is especially obsessed with \\"our national obsession with underpants\\". That obsession-not surprisingly- is really only his own- projected onto the populace at large. Movies like \\"Home Alone\\" and \\"Stand By Me\\" are the occasion for him to dwell at length at scenes of boys in their underwear. {I don't know about you, but I've seen these movies several times, and I don't even remember such scenes; but then I am not the scholar Kincaid is}.He unfortunately must share every piece of his collected trivia with his suffering readers. He not only airs his dirty linen in public, but insists on describing it in gruesome detail, then concluding how sick it shows the rest of us to be.Kincaid is a pedantic fool who presents himself as the real champion of \\"our\\" children. He constantly employs an \\"our-we-ism\\" that implies \\"we\\" are all in this together, and he is merely our guide- a first among equals. In fact, his tone is one of uncorrupted superiority. He is a nasty little man who insults whole groups and individuals as 'morons', 'idiots', etc.But his own discussions of movies for instance are primitive in the extreme. They would not pass muster in a tenth grade English class.This book is a childish and naive tirade against a very soft target. Certainly T.V is a commercial enterprise that exploits \\"our\\" lowest aspirations for sex and scandal-be it with children, adults, or for that matter other life forms . But Professor Kincaid's posturing as a contemporary Sigmund Freud uncovering \\"our\\" secret peeking at semi-clad children is only his own desire writ large.Professor Kincaid should stick to boring captive 19 year old undergraduates.Blaine in Seattle.blainefielding@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"In his introduction Mr Kincaid states that there are good writers and then there are writers that get good reviews. Sadly Mr Kincaid will never fit into either of those categories as he tends to go into overtext with his own opinion of the limited amount case studies he has supplied. His intent appears to be pointing the finger of sex crimes not at the offender but at the system that prevents child abuse, because child abuse was not there two hundred years ago it must be the system that was put in place at that time. He typifies his beliefs by stating that child abuse has only increased since the system was put in place. Could it not in fact be the increase in both population and development of modern technologies that have increased both the number of offenders and the numbers we know have offended. He is right about several things including certain bias by the police and press but fails to note that rather than being the norm this is usually the extreme. In particular he points out the fact that the press has a tendency to dwell on the erotic. What he leaves out is that they also dwell on war, murder, politics and bank robbery amoungst others, that after all is the nature of news. For those trying to learn something about the criminal or the people who fight them I recommend &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; by Stephen G. Michaud with Roy Hazelwood. And for those looking for a few erotic stories, don't expect any."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"I'm not a child molester or a pedophile by any stretch of the imagination, but I picked up this book because it had an interesting thesis- that our culture eroticizes youth and, in a way, invites molesters to act on their impulses.Kincaid even suggests that Mac Culkin in Home Alone (1 and 2)was chosen for his sexuality- his blonde hair and red lips. I'll be the first to admit that when I saw those films, I thought Culkin was just adorable, but in a sexual way? Come on! Anyone who watches that kind of movie for that is a sicko who should be locked up!There is a beauty to youth, as Michaelangelo surely observed, but normal, responsible adults know the difference between that pure, ideal beauty and the kind that elicits sexual fantasy.Kincaid's book is certainly thought provoking, and very well-written, so I give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"I meant too review \\"Harmful to minors\\" which I read not this one which I didn't read (in its entirety)-- but I'm against the fear mongers that wish to frighten and repress young people (esp teens) -- read Freud--children are already sexual--they can be repressed not \\"sexualized"},{"Title":"Erotic Innocence: The Culture of Child Molesting","review":"I don't own this book, nor have a read it.

So I found the relevant sections of this book extremely well-written and quite useful. The sections on power transmission and generation were quite excellent."},{"Title":"A history of our relations with the Andamanese,","review":"Originally published 1899 by a British colonial officer, one of the very few people genuinely interested in what are one of the world's strangest people. This book contains a rather badly organized mess of government and other reports, documents, descriptions, all without an index - but what reports, what descriptions! This reviewer has spent weekends trying to locate quotes that he knew are mentioned somewhere in the 880 pages but couldn't remember where. In the end he made his own rough index despite the horrible effort infolved. It it was worth it.

I did - until I found this book in a give-away box at a garage sale (The owner was moving, and the book was well-thumbed, so I figure s/he must have finally loaded all the recipes into her/his head). Whether you're a novice in the kitchen, or been cooking since Mom taught you, You STILL need this book. It is possibly THE best cookbook on the planet. I read cookbooks for instruction and pleasure, and none of them has ever steeped me in the RIGHT way to use food like this book. Highly entertaining, too, full of opinion and ink-wash sketches. An absolute blast to read, and you can apply the methods to anything, including non-Chinese things like beans, to increase savoriness and shorten cooking time. If nothing else, you'll never have to scrub a gunky pan again."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"We purchased a copy of this book about 20 years ago. We have used it so frequently that it has fallen apart so we purchased another copy. My husband has traveled extensively in China and says that the food taste like what he has eaten on his travels."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"This is a very good cookbook, it clearly and well describes the principles and practices of Chinese cooking and I believe it's well worth having on your bookshelf. It's limitations - the index is clumsy, a common failing in Chinese cookbooks, and its range of recipes is limited precisely because so much space is given to cooking techniques. For examples, fish maw soup is not covered at all, the hot and sour soup recipe is conventional, and I was unable to find any recipes using either fermented bean curd or 'preserved vegetable'.This does belong on my bookshelf beside 'An Encyclopedia of Chinese Food and Cooking' by Chang and Kutscher and 'Florence Ling's Complete Book of Chinese Noodles, Dumplings, and Breads'."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"very simple to understand, it will guide you to make good tasty chinese cooking without complicating your life,and if you are an amateur like me you will be very pleased with this book."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"This is one of the best and most comprehensive chinese cookbooks I have used. I was most disappointed to find that it is not currently in print."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"Finally, a chinese cookbook that I can really rave about. Irene's dishes are mouthwateringly authentic and teach skill as you do them. It's dreadful that this was ever permitted to go out of print!"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I'm not sure I'm quite as sold on this book as the other reviewers, but it is a very complete, well written Chinese cookbook. I sought this book out as a used book because so many people wrote about it in such glowing terms. I find that I don't use it as much as some of the reviewers because my husband is just not as fond of Chinese food as he is of other cuisines.Ms. Kuo not only you gives you easy to follow recipes, but gets you acquainted with techniques and ingredients that are essential to Chinese cuisine.If you do enjoy Chinese cuisine, want to get better acquainted with it, or just would like to move beyond chicken and brocolli takeout I'd suggest that you try and find a used copy of the 30 year old book and give it a try."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"Received our book quickly and it was in good condition. A great value good service."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"The eleven other reviews of this remarkable book (as of early June, 2004) all give this book 5 stars, an equally remarkable achievement. As one of those eleven people said, this is truly the Julia Child of Chinese cookbooks. I've been using it now since 1978 and there are still hundreds of recipes I haven't tried because the ones that I *have* cooked are so wonderful that I go back to them time after time. Most of the recipes are reasonably simple, with ingredients that can be found in even the most modest Asian market, or even in a Safeway these days, but some of them are a lot easier to make if you live in San Francisco (as I did for a number of years) and can find *everything* she calls for without undue trouble.If I were marooned for life on a well-stocked desert island, this would be one of my two cookbooks, Julia being the other one. As wonderful as Italian food is, and as great as Marcella Hazen's Italian cookbook is, Chinese cuisine (with its many regional diversities) is far richer and with far more subtleties -- only French cuisine is its equal. Haunt the used book stores, or on-line sources, and try to get this unparalleled book."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"My husband is from China, he tells me I cook like his mother now. The copy I have is old and broken I've used it so much. I was hoping to get another copy. It's a great cookbook. Cooking techniques and recipes are explained in depth. There is also a glossary of ingredients so you can figure out what something is and where to buy it."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"... I was thrilled to find a used copy. I have been making the food from my Chinese childhood, and yes, the recipes make dishes that taste exactly how I remembered everything. Her instructions are clearly-written and concise."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I bought this book 20 years ago, the year I moved out on my own. I'm disappointed that I can't buy a new copy, plus a copy for each of my daughters (both born in China); it's hard to believe such a fantastic cookbook is out of print. Ms. Kuo not only offers many unusual and authentic recipes I've never seen elsewhere (e.g., Winter Melon Soup cooked and served in the carved Melon, and the best Steamed Pork Buns I've ever had), her directions are exceptionally clear, and she explains each technique and how each dish is traditionally served. And don't miss the explanation of how to cook Peking duck (including using a bike pump to make the skin crispy!)"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"In the mid-eighties I had a job that allowed me to get home at 5pm. I used Irene Kuo's book to learn to cook Chinese. Not only are the recipes great, but the book is highly educational. I found it particularly useful to shop for the right ingredients.Oneof my favorites is crab and corn soup. Overall, it's one of my &quot;top 10 all time&quot; cookbooks."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I lived in China eleven years; studied Chinese there and taught English. I love cooking and love Chinese food, but was dismayed that after years of attempting to copy my friends' cooking there, the results were barely remotely the same. (They don't use measuring spoons there, and few of my friends had a gift of teaching.) Finally I remembered this cookbook that my mother fell in love with and had given as a gift to each of her daughters, and on a trip home for the summer, dug mine out of my attic boxes, and brought it back to China so I could learn to cook!Result: I did, and my friends there finally began to enjoy and even compliment my Chinese cooking. And one friend whose mother never taught her to cook learned staying weekends at my apartment, reading the cookbook (she was an English major), and then following the clear directions. I gave her a copy for her wedding present. She is now a good cook, too!The thing of the book is, Irene Kuo is a gifted teacher, and a very good writer to boot. If you like cookbooks, you could read this one just for sheer enjoyment. She presents, then totally demystifies key concepts that I had suspected I was missing but couldn't guess at. She gives you confidence. And yes, the recipes are very authentic, though they don't cover every region's cooking. It's so helpful that she lists the ingredients with their Chinese names, though in China these names can vary a tiny bit regionally, and so I'm thinking they may in the States, too (I still live abroad.)"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I've had The Key to Chinese Cooking for 27 years; it was one of the first 5 cookbooks in my collection. I now own somewhere around 300 cookbooks, but this is still among the best.Kuo got everything right. In an era when no one had heard of dim sum or regional Chinese cuisine, she included long sections about ingredients, techniques (including improvisations when you lack authentic equipment), and cooking styles. Every technique introduced includes introductory recipes, such as steamed lemon chicken in the steaming section. There are also lots and LOTS of recipes for every conceivable category, and it probably goes without saying that they're uniformly excellent. The book falls open to spicy pork with peanuts; hot and sour soup; tangerine peel chicken; shrimp fried rice.But what sets this apart is the writing and instructional style. Kuo has become my touchstone for friendly, technical writing. She knows the reader hasn't deep-fried a duck before, so she gives careful detailed steps that somehow manage to both reassure you and keep you moving. It's never too much information, making you feel as though a task is daunting. I was lucky to find this book when I still a cooking beginner, because I credit the author with making me unafraid to try new recipes and techniques.My only criticism is that her estimates of serving portions are unreliable. Sometimes she'll say that a recipe serves 4, when served with rice, and we get just a meal for two. That's the case for one of our favorites, chicken in black bean sauce. (I must have a dozen such recipes. This is the one I use.)Overall though - this is one of my favorite cookbooks. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"Irene Kuo's recipes not only tell you what to do very clearly, but also the &quot;why&quot; of each direction. This is the only book of Chinese Cooking that gives me reliably excellent results. I have the 1977 edition. It is worn and dirty. I hope I can get a new copy of this book soon."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"This comprehensive work has been considered a classic ever since it was first published nearly three decades ago. Mrs. Kuo, a master chef and veteran restaurateur, clearly explains the basic techniques of Chinese cuisine, enabling her readers to understand how and why they are utilized. The more than 300 recipes, which range from simple everyday dishes to banquet creations, are imbued with the \\"teaching presence\\" of the author. Although many volumes on the subject have appeared over the years, \\"The Key to Chinese Cooking\\" still remains an essential resource.Also recommended: \\"The Complete Asian Cookbook,\\" by Charmaine Solomon."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"My book is from 1977, and I have photocopied recipes to give to others, as it's still out of print.I like it's treatment of each recipe..A recipes may start with background history, the ingredients are next, and the directions are very clear, telling you how to cook by knowing when a \\"cooking stage\\" is met, that is, when something is browned, another is blackened..it isn't just a \\"2 minutes\\" and on to the next stage.Substitutions are listed, and the recipes do not have an excessive number of ingredients, so a trip to a regular grocery store, and an infrequent visit to an Asian store are all that's needed.Ms Kuo gives many cooking \\"pearls\\" among the many recipes...these are helpful in French, or Argentinian cooking for example, not just limited to Chinese/Asian cooking. Even hints on how to reheat leftovers the next day is given...nice!Get this for a great introduction to ways to cut and prepare foods, and learn in the opening chapters much about cooking in oil, cooking in liquids, and cooking with dry or wet heat.It has recipes with Szechuan peppercorns...which were \\"outlawed\\" until just 2005, so Chinese afficionados will be delighted to have one more \\"real\\" ingredient to cook with. Get the \\"seeded\\" rather than the \\"whole\\" ones, as she points out \\"the flavor and the aroma come only from the petal-like husks\\". (The seeds are gritty and undesireable.)When mincing or chopping, she recommends wetting the cleaver's blade to keep food from sticking...she has a chapter just on the different ways to cut, tenderize, chop...just about any food! Makes one realize why many chefs prefer just a medium weight cleaver for 95% of their work, over an array of varied specialized shaped knives.This book had over 500 pages of great recipes and wonderful instruction...buy this...this is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I bought this marvelous book more than thirty years ago. Irene Kuo literally taught this midwestern boy how to cook Chinese food from the ground up. I could not even begin to count the number of times I have cooked many of these delicious, superbly explained recipes.My \\"Key\\" is now battered and there are oil and soy sauce stains on more than a few pages, but I have yet to see another book that so beautifully explains the breadth and depth of all forms of Chinese cooking. What Fuschia Dunlop's books are to Hunan and Sichuan food, this is to all of China. Why doesn't someone reprint this masterpiece??"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I've been looking for the ideal Chinese cookbook for years and this is as good as gets. I've just made my second meal from this book and I like it more and more each time I try a recipe. This is really one of the few books that addresses the foundations of Chinese techniques and give you a good introduction to theory and practice. And ...the food is good! Just not a nice recreation of Chinese restaurant food but what you would eat in China. I don't think that I will ever have to buy another Chinese cookbook."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"this was one of my first cook books. and when i loned it to some and never got it back prt of my books was greatley missed. so with finding it on amazon . com i was very very happy.

Kuo classify the Chinese cooking techniques into cooking in liquid, in oil, with wet heat and with dry heat. She then proceeds to go into details for each of these main techniques. Her recipes are full of classic Chinese dishes but designed with the American kitchen in mind."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I bought this book a year ago at my local library for $1.00. Imagine my glee when I got home and started reading it!!!! This woman was a master at her craft. There are so many wonderful cooking tips that I am reading it cover to cover just to get the tips - and then go back and try all the recipes.If you like chinese food this and Chinese Technique by Ken Hom is all you will ever need. And if you love woks also purchase The Breath of a Wok which is again loaded with techique and cooking tips. I live in the Bay Area so I am so lucky I have easy access to all of these ingredients and cooking supplies. Boy am I grateful to whoever donated this book to my local library. Thanks somebody!!!!!"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I have used this book for 20 years and it not only contains outstanding recipes, it tells you what you are doing and why - so that you really learn to cook in the Chinese style and can improvise your own recipes. This book needs to be reprinted!!"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"Just as a disclaimer, I have the 1978 uk edition so I don't know if these things were present in the newer edition.* Some ingredients use alternative names that most people (at least me) are not familiar with such as chinese cabbage(bok choy), celery cabbage (napa cabbage)* Sherry, one of the main seasonings used in the book, is the popular western alternative to rice wine but rice wine should be fairly easy to obtain nowadays* Some of the english names for dishes do not use the more common variant seen nowadays.* IT'S OUT OF PRINT!Aside from these things I think this book is fantastic. The techniques remind me of my Chinese parents', right down to the almost excessive use of starch water and parboiling of vegetables. I highly doubt that I will ever feel the need to get another Chinese cookbook."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"This was recommended and came through superbly, the book has so many recipes and is a great addition to my cookbook shelf."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I purchased this book a couple months ago- and it is amazing!

I strongly recommend this cookbook to anyone interested in Chinese cooking."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"This book is the best book that I have ever found on Chinese cooking, no holds barred, nothing held back and such a warm direct way of directionIt really is the definitive book for people who really want learn to cook Chinese from scratchI would really love to thank Irene Kuo for this book, it is a blessing"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I found my copy of this incredible book on a sale table in a Borders in D.C. for $7 (c. 1996). Little did I know it would change my life--well at least change my Chinese cooking. I 2nd all the superlatives listed. We have a really nice Chinese restaurant near our home, but the family prefers my renditions of Ms. Kuo's recipes/instructions. My copy is now tattered, splattered, binding cracking.... If you have the $$$ and opportunity, I recommend that you buy copies for all your daughters, sons, nieces, nephews, sisters, brothers! Many, many of the recipes are simply to die for. If you do nothing but learn the slippery coating, it's worth the price of the book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I can hardly say more than the previous reviewers. What makes this cookbook so revered? It's because Irene Kuo conveys the essence of Chinese cookery by describing the actual techniques. Where many other cookbooks simply state the ingredients, Irene tells why you're doing something and what this will achieve.The best example I can think of is her velveting instruction. Notice how silky and delicious shrimp, chicken, etc. are in Chinese restaurants? Ever wonder why it doesn't come out this way at home? Most modern Chinese cookbooks omit the velveting step. However, this method is essential by marinating, then \\"pre-cooking\\" these ingredients through a fairly simple process. Flavor and authenticity are sometimes sacrificed in modern \\"quick & easy\\" cookbooks.At the time this book was first published in the '70's, items such as hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, and rice vinegar were not easy to find. Today, you can find them in most suburban supermarkets. You will not be frustrated by once-difficult to find ingredients.This is a fine text which deserves pride of place in a kitchen library. It's a shame it's out of print. I bought my copy \\"used\\" through Amazon, but it's wearing out fast. I hope Random House will reprint this someday soon."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I first bought this cookbook shortly after my husband and I were married, in 1978. I was 22 and a very inexperienced cook. In addition, I came from a family who never used fresh garlic or even fresh mushrooms. Irene Kuo's book opened up a whole new world for me. The book is brilliantly arranged for a novice cook: the initial chapters are arranged as lessons teaching basic techniques of Chinese cooking. The rest of the book goes through appetizers, poultry, seafood, beef, fish, rice and vegetable dishes in their turns. A chapter at the end is devoted to explanations of ingredients. Recipes are clearly written and easy to follow and delicious to eat. Well, at the end of the story, it is 30 plus years later, we're still happily married and I still use my cookbook. My first Key to Chinese Cooking is so well loved and heavily used that it is held together with duct tape. A few years ago I was lucky enough to find another copy of this precious book and it is my \\"good\\" copy."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I wanted to title my review \\"Best cookbook ever,\\" but that seemed too strong. I mean, it's not like there are pictures of George Clooney in it, so why all the passion?Because, like the other reviewers, this is how I learned to cook Chinese, my favorite cuisine (if I had to pick just one). This book has flawless instruction, illustrations, and recipes. Recipes you haven't seen before--try the chilled lima beans.I'm sorry to say I had this book on my shelves for several years before I got around to using it. Now, the spine is broken from heavy use, and I see it is, absurdly, out of print."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I got this book when I was in graduate school, in the 1980s. Along with Julia Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\\" this is the book that got me interested in cooking and taught me the base of what I know about it.Ms. Kuo does a superb job of taking a novice who knows nothing about Chinese cooking, or even cooking in general, and teaching them everything they need to know to make both simple and elaborate dishes. The book has sections on important equipment and how to use it (woks, cleavers, cutting boards), ingredients, basic cooking techniques, and the general principles of Chinese cooking. It goes far, far beyond stir fries and deep fried dishes into areas that one rarely sees occur on the menus of even very good Chinese restaurants. Flavor potting, red cooking, white cut, and many other techniques are known to me solely because of this book. To this day, I do the bulk of my cutting with the Chinese cleaver that I chose based on her advice and learned to use from her instructions.And the recipes are all strong. Thirty years later, I'm still making them, and still returning to this book for inspiration.The only problem with Irene Kuo's book is that it's out of print, and has been for a long, long time. My paperback copy started falling apart years ago, and I continue to hope that the book will be reissued, so I can buy a new copy."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"As her bio states:\\"Irene Kuo was born into one of the oldest families in China.\\" Elsewhere in the book you learn that in the 1800's the Emperor stayed at her family's house for two weeks, one summer. Ms Kuo includes one his favorite dishes... but the dishes are notinaccessible, as you might expect given this heritage. Quite the contrary. Simply put, Ms Kuo reveals the secrets of simple techniques and tastes that make this food so special...Velveting of chicken, cuts of chicken, flavor-potting, clear simmering, light-footing, and so much more that I have never heard of. And she does it simply. What a shame this is out of print.... This was a gift from her to the world... Thank you, Ms Kuo."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"How can The Bible be out of print? This book is by far and away the finest Chinese cook book i've ever seen. My copy is old and worn, but I hope someday that everyone will again have the opportunity to read, use and learn from this awesome book."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"I have tried any number of chinese cookbooks and none come close to this one in authenticity. Every recipe in this book is a gem. I wanted to buy and give this book to a number of friends and was devastated to find that it is out of print. I will treasure my well worn copy all the more."},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"Irene Kuo is truly a phenomenal chef. Key to Chinese Cooking is a collection of authentic chinese recipes that is a required volume for anyone interested in Chinese cooking -- Chinese and non-Chinese alike. The recipes include regular favorites like scallion pancakes and almost unheard of authentic connoiseur pleasers such as 1-2-3-4-5 Spareribs. Anyone can make these dishes easily with Kuo's easy-to-follow steps. A perfect Chinese cookbook, only matched by real Chinese cookbooks, in which case, you'd have to be able to read Chinese in order to follow it! As a Chinese, a very picky eater, and one tough Chinese food critic, I give it an 11 out of 10!!!"},{"Title":"Key To Chinese Cooking","review":"First of all, I fully concur with the 5 star concensus on this book. I bought it used at Powell's books in Portland in the early 80s. I live overseas now and it is one of the few books I've brought with me. Others include \\"From Julia's Kitchen\\", both of Jacques Pepin's technique books and Craig Claiborne's NY Times Cookbook.I'll simply add one or two observations to the generally effusive reviews here. The technique sections take the same approach as in Jacques Pepin's books. The technique is illustrated by providing one or more recipes. So rather than studying dry descriptions of technique, you dive in and make something delicious and learn the technique(s) as you go. One of my favorites is Beef with Black Bean sauce. This covers slippery coating and stir frying in one recipe. I often substitute broccoli for the onions and peppers. So, contrary to another reviewer's comment, the technique chapters are not wasted. They contain a plethora of great recipes in their own right.One small point is that she universally calls for dry sherry in recipes. This is a substitute for Shao Xing wine, which I'm guessing was very difficult to find in the US when this book was written. It works fine, but she doesn't mention that is what she's doing. A very small nit in a superb book.I will chime in with other reviewers in wondering why this book never went back to print. 5 star all the way."},{"Title":"Bergsonian philosophy and Thomism","review":"This book is either badly written in original, badly translated, or both. The sentences are long and meandering, occasionally one sentence makes up an entire paragraph! The style is such that the reader doesn't always know whether Maritain is describing Bergson's positions or his own (shades of St.Thomas and his scholastic method?).Frankly, I stopped reading this book after a few chapters. It gave me a headache. Besides, we already know why Neo-Thomists reject Bergsonism. \\"Rome has spoken, the matter is settled\\".The rest is just commentary."},{"Title":"Which MBA?: A Critical Guide to the World's Best MBAs (13th Edition)","review":"This series used to contain &quot;raw comments&quot; from students which I found very interesting. Now, Business Week is the only one that publishes them.Interesting statistics, good summaries. But pretty duplicative of any other book, web site, WSJ, BW, etc.Except for international. Very highly recommended if you're looking at international schools off the beaten path.Getting long in the tooth."},{"Title":"Which MBA?: A Critical Guide to the World's Best MBAs (13th Edition)","review":"Where American business schools are concerned, this book says really nothing new: it gives basic stats for admission, salaries, ; it describes the nuts-and-bolts of the curriculum, etc. There is really nothing in the way of editorial comments from students, faculty, recruiters, or for that matter from the authors. It's just the facts, mam.The approach for European schools is the same, but I know of no other book that mentions more than even, say, half a dozen European schools. This book has about 100 pages of info on British schools (which is almost as much as they have for the U.S.) and almost as much again for &quot;continental&quot; Europe. So if you are interested in schools in Europe beyond the top six or so, you will actually need this book. It will be handy (but incomplete, since it lacks much qualitative information).If you are a U.S. student (or intend to be), the basic Business Week guide gives the same basic information and adds a lot of qualitative info to. Buy it instead for this country."},{"Title":"Which MBA?: A Critical Guide to the World's Best MBAs (13th Edition)","review":"While this book covers North American b-schools, it is particularly valuable if you are interested in a European business school. We particularly like the primary source research from the surveys. While we would have liked to have seen even more quotes from the purported 4,500 survey respondents, this is certainly the most authoritative source we have found for European, particularly British, MBA programs. Additionally, we have received nothing but positive feedback Which MBA?

No new dog owner should be without this and his Before and After You Get Your Puppy\\" books! I've followed his methods and took some classes at Sirius Dog Training, which teach his methods, and couldn't be happier with my two happy dogs! They are a delight to live with.Don't hesitate for a second before buying this and his other books. If more dog owners tried his methods, which are so humane, the dog populations at shelters would plummet! So many dogs are sent to shelters because the owners don't understand that dogs don't understand from birth what we expect of them - they have to be taught!!! The best way to teach is to understand the animal's nature and why it behaves as it does, which leads to understanding how to teach it what you want.

Reading this book feels like you are in conversation with an extremely talkative 14-year-old.

All that aside, there are diagrams illustrating how to train your dog which seem useful."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"I'm going to try to separate my critique of the text as it is presented, and Maimonides work.The typeface used here is awfully small, and crammed onto the pages with a crowbar, it seems. The margins must be measured with a micrometer. I suppose the publishers were determined to get the thing into one volume, but this book is really pretty slender; I don't see why it couldn't be larger to accommodate larger print, with more white space, so the words aren't crammed together like passengers in steerage.The translation is dated, and takes some getting used to, if you haven't had a lot of exposure to late Victorian English, the language may be off-putting. I happen to have a degree in English literature, and have read many styles extensively, and barely notice how dated the language was. There are other translations, but Freidlander, in this translation is very cautious in keeping his words consistent. This is important, because a large part of Guide for the Perplexed is defining Biblical terms.The Guide for the Perplexed is a brilliant work. Maimonides is my nomination for &quot;most important post-Talmudic scholar.&quot;The Guide is not a simple work; Maimonides does not spell things out; he doesn't give succinct answers to ages old questions. One doesn't go to this book, look up &quot;Cain,&quot; and say, &quot;Ah, there's where he got his wife.&quot;This is a book to aid the reader in becoming a better scholar. Where Maimonides does not give answers, he presents the tools that may assist the reader in studying the Torah, and coming up with his (or her!) own answers.Words are defined, and also analyzed in an etymological way, which is really more mystical than scientific, but we're talking Torah.Maimonides knows better than to give tools for interpretation without also giving lessons in interpretation. Some of his own mishnot come through as he discusses interpreting the Torah. He also discusses prophecy and free will, but eventually brings it all back to Torah.Anyone who wants to be a serious Torah scholar needs this book."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Maimonides' Guide is a masterwork of philosophic interest to Jews and non-Jews interested in the problem posed by philosophy to revealed religion, but Friedlander's translation is not the way to approach it. Besides removing the ambiguity of Maimonides' title by rendering it &quot;The Guide *for* the Perplexed&quot;, he translates technical Rabbanic hermaneutical terms into awkward and sometimes inappropriate Latin 'equivilants'. Anyone who needs such translation won't be able to understand Maimonides' thought anyway, steeped in Rabbinics as it is; anyone looking to learn something of the Guide will be unable to do so with this translation. Shlomo Pines' translation is universally considered superior; be sure to get both volumes."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"This turn-of-the- (20th) century tranlation from the Arabic has been absolutely superceded by the Pines-Strauss University of Chicago edition. No one really interested in studying Maimonides can afford to use this translation.Maimonides in his introduction makes it clear just how careful he was in his choice of words, so someone who has to read the book in translation cannot afford to save a few bucks and buy a flawed version"},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"This has become one of my favourite non-fiction books. The Rambam (Maimonides) is an absolute giant of learning and explanations. In this volume, he presents many of the philosophical sides of Judaism which are rarely encountered.The text is divided into 3 books.The first book starts with discussing the use of homonyms in the Bible, especially in relation to describing God. The thesis that emerges is that it is only superficially that the Bible describes God as corporeal but the real doctrine precludes corporeality. The second topic discussed is the nature of esoteric study in Judaism and why it should only be taught in a restricted manner. The third topic is where Rambam protests against people using positive attributes to describe God and tries to prove that God is beyond such attributes. Then, he describes the Kalam argument (an Islamic school of thought that tried to prove the existence of God amongst other things) and points out his view of the flaws in it.The second book starts with a discussion of Aristotelian philosophy in terms of cosmology and metaphysics and compares that with Judaism, especially the mystical tradition. Rambam then gives his own view of the world structure which is at times very amusing in terms of what we know of science but still very interesting. Then, he describes the nature of prophecy and what exactly it meant to be a Biblical prophet.The third book opens with a hinted exposition of mystical passages in the Bible, such as Ezekiel's Chariot (Ezek Chap 1 and others). Then, he talks about God and the problem of Evil as well as providence. Finally, he describes the perfect worship of God as well as the purpose of most of the major commandments in the Torah. It is here that I could see why there was much opposition to the work from within the Jewish community - as he tends to provide unorthodox rationalisations that go against traditional expositions.As you cna see, he convers sooooo much that a serious believer or non-believer would wish to consider that it's an absolute gem. The translation is dense, both in language and print but at least it's accessible in terms of being in one volume as well as the price. If you can penetrate the at-times-archaic language, I think this book will greatly enrich your life."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"I gave it 5 stars, because it is a great piece of work - essential in Jewish studies - in its full, unabridged version. In keeping the price of the book low, the creators of the work left the readers a couple of problems. One, the type is way too small. Two, aside from the introduction, there are no notes or commentary, leaving the unexperienced reader with little resources for such an extremely intricate work. The creators should have tripled the size of this book and put it out in two volumes. I, and I'm sure many others, would have had no problem paying triple for it, if that were the case, for it is a work that is well worth the price. But that does not diminish its current greatness."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Maimonides' philosophical opus presents his views on biblical interpretation, creation, the nature of prophecy, the reasons for the commandments, divine providence, free will, and many other topics. The Guide is one of the most influential works of Jewish philosophy ever written, and is well worth the effort of reading. Unfortunately, it is an effort with this edition, as the type is absurdly small."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"After further trying to use the Kindle version of The Guide I have decided that it is just unusable. The entire book is one long unbroken stream of text. The beginnings of chapters aren't highlighted or separated using line breaks. Even footnotes are embedded right in with the text. Unfortunately Amazon won't let me change my original star ranking. But I'd rate this implementation as one star. I needn't emphasize that his is a great book. Also, I have no problem with the dated 100-plus year old style of the translation. It is the implementation for the Kindle that leaves much to be desired. There is no active table of contents. This makes navigation very difficult. I started reading after finally finding the beginning of the text after paging through page after page of the inactive TOC. Then my Kindle \\"hiccupped\\" and restarted itself at the home page. I was not amused at having to page through the same inactive TOC to find the text that I had been reading. I would be much more putout if I had spent a lot of money for it. At $0.99 it is still worthwhile buying. Just remember that you will have to take the time to put in your own navigation bookmarks."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"An excellent work by a late medieval Jewish theologian/metaphysicist (a contemporary of Aquinas) who presents and breaks down the metaphysical arguments of the day for the existence of God, a God-created universe, and the interpretation of the Torah. He examines the Aristotelian arguments supporting the eternal existence of the Universe and determines whether or not they are supported by Scripture and logical analysis. Our contemporary physicists could use his methods to uncover logical flaws in their theories about the ultimate origins of the Universe. He finishes the text with a treatise on Scripture and the perfection of Man. A must read along with the works of Augustine and Aquinas, and for that matter, any modern work on the ultimate nature of Nature.rac"},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"as other reviewers pointed out. But even so I got something out of it - especially at the beginning (where Maimonides attacks simple-minded literalism) and the end (where Maimonides tries to justify the mitzvot). I'm sure that in a few years when I am a bit more intellectually sophisticated, I will get more out of it.One really interesting part of the book that none of the other reviewers has mentioned so far: Maimonides' explanation of divine intervention in our lives. He asserts, based on Torah, that such Divine intervention affects humans but not animals (Part III, Ch. 17). Why? Because \\"Divine Providence is connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine Providence.\\" (Id.) And given that Divine Providence is connected with intellect, it further follows that \\"the greater the share which a person has obtained of this Divine influence ... the greater must also be the effect of Divine Providence upon him.\\" (Id., Ch. 18). Thus, \\"the greater the human perfection a person has attained, the greater the benefit he derives from Divine Providence.\\" (Id.) In other words, if you are Abraham or Moses, you get plenty of divine influence in your life. For the rest of us, the world takes its natural course.It seems to me that this theory allows us to reconcile Biblical miracles with the day-to-day reality of bad things happening to good people and vice versa: perhaps prophets get individualized reward and punishment in this world, and the rest of us don't. (Caveat: I am NOT saying that this view is factually correct, or even that Maimonides endorses this view; it is not clear to me how spiritually elevated Maimonides thinks one has to be to receive Divine intervention- whether only Moses, Abraham, etc. get it, or whether ordinary good and intelligent people get it as well, or whether he would draw the line someplace in between)."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"My review and rating is restricted to a comment regarding the small typeface which makes this edition a difficult read. If an edition can be obtained with a larger typeface, I would recommend it, even at some additional expense.(Aside from this comment regarding the typeface; obviously, Maimonides does not need my approbation.)"},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Reviewers have noted that the book offered is the second editon of Guide.The translator-editor notes that this edition is highly simplified from the First edition, omitting much Hebrew wording and footnotes. The text here is still long. No-one who wishes to understand RAMBAM and his genius should read any abbreviated version, neither Guide nor M. Torah.This text is available free on Google, and may be downloaded into pdf.There, print size is fine--big in other words.It should be noted that the cited translator did not translate much of the book. He credits the actual translators as applicable.I do not agree that only those versed in rabbinic lore and law should read Maimonides. Guide is much harder to understand than M. Torah. His discussion of the comparison between the Prophets and Aristotle is quite interesting. The fact that he surrendered to biblical principle Aristotle's notion that the Universe is Eternal is not quite clear here or anywhere as to whether RAMBAM accepted the rationalle offered later by Nachmonides that the miracles disappear if the universe is eternal or if RAMBAM simply went with convention. (As honoring the tradition that the male is the only biological parent, while knowing science has proved this false) It should be recognized that Maimonides is not rejecting science; he does not compare the prophets to science, but to Aristotle. As Aristotle was a highly imperfect scientist, Maimonides is in fact accepting one metaphysical statement over another, but the truth of the universe's creation in time or its eternality was not known then and is not known now. Maimonides says that death occurs for individuals in order that types can survive. This is closer to a scientific notion; and the fact that it runs counter to TANACH does not bother him much.Maimonides may be seen as Darwin before Darwin, as Einstein in an age before science, the inspiration of Spinoza. Guide differes from M-Torah in that in Guide Maimonides is interested in truth, both Truth and truth, whereas in M. Torah he records and summerizes the words and thoughts of others.As I do not read 12th century Jewish Arabic and am unlikely to learn, I cannot speak to the accuracy of the translation. The Hebrew translation was done during RAMBAM's own lifetime, but I know of no comments he made on the translation. I recommend the screen version, not because it is better, as both are the inferior 2nd edition, but because of print size.As a very useful and life-directing exercise, I recommend that Maimonides' \\"Guide\\" be read at the same time as one reads St. Thomas Acquinis' \\"Suma Theologica.\\" The result would be a much stronger understanding of thought process and human events."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Yes, this is a true classic. Though there have been many works written since this jewel was first written, it still shines as a jewel in the crown of the Torah.The translation may not be of the order of some of the more recent interpretations, yet it remains clear and lucid. There is littel interpolation in the translated text ( a difficult ask). This edition keeps the classic cover, and surely remains an essential component in any discerning thinkers library. Whether you are Jewish or not, this seminal text is one that can only benefit the thinking reader.This edition has good, sturdy paper (ok, it is not parchment standard, but at this price, what more do you want?). Its binding is equal to much more expensive books, and its size ensures it will be used again and again.Read and enjoy (even if you disagree with the text) and you will understand why \\"From Moses to Moses, there is no-one like Moses!\\""},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"I have the kindle 2. I downloaded a Guide to the Perplexed which was available on GoogleBook. Although the text was readable, there was no formatting and the footnotes and commentary were merged with Maimonides' words to make the thing unnavigable - continuity was destroyed.The Amazon version on the other hand is without footnotes and is easily read. Another reviewer has criticized the Friedlander (late nineteenth century) translation as a bit archaic. I did not find this although there is the occasional word that one encounters only infrequently in more modern literature.If you are simply interested in reading the book, the Amazon Kindle version seems more than adequate. I have no way of knowing how reliable the translation, and wonder how the reviewers who do have opinions on this issue reached them."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"The Guide for the Perplexed is truly a masterpiece of Jewish thinking, providing a foundation for integrating Toraic and Talmudic insights with Aristotelian philosophy and scientific observation. Be forewarned: This is an intense piece of Rabbinic literature and tends to require digestion in small pieces. A discussion partner, reading the book with you is a great help. My only criticism of this particular edition is that the typeface is small and older style - if you're a dinosaur like me, that can be a limitation."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Generally speaking we don't tend to think of men of science as also men of G-d.

Other than that, it is very helpful and as relevant today as it was when it was written! This should be in everyone's home library who is Jewish, and if you aren't Jewish, you probably should have it too! It is helpful for people who aren't studied in religion, or neophytes, as well as scholars. Maimonides certainly doesn't need my help in selling books!

It's long. It's difficult. It's hard to understand. And it takes years to sink in after reading it. Then if one has been reading other things for those years, it will make more sense the second time around.But the reason I'm posting this is I love the Kindle Format. The book is thick and heavy to hold. The print is small, and the margins are a bit narrow. The only bad part about the kindle format is it would be hard to skip ahead a couple hundred pages. But as I prefer to read from front to back, it's not an issue for me."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"This work of philosophy is in fact three books, the last one not really dealing with philosophy, is one of the greatest masterpieces of philosophy ever written.

Words cannot really describe it - you MUST read for yourself.The translation is pretty good, if sometimes difficult, in any case, it is a much easier read than the Hebrew translation."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"This book was written a long time before modern science and this guy knows from the old scriptures a lot about the beginning of the universe and mankind. Quick delivery also."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Maimonides offers an interesting perspective on the questions of theology. As told in the introduction, Maimonides rose from relative obscurity to a high level of academic merit very quickly due to his clear and distinct understanding and interpretations of the scripture. Indeed, his insights are what this book is all about. It is not an exhaustive study of all of the questions raised in the old testament, nor of other inquiries into the various properties of the divine, but it covers a lot. I found the text to be a little dry; not as captivating as a Platonic dialogue, but not as confusing as, say, one of Aristotle's essays. Were I to do it again, I might reconsider buying this edition because the type is quite small and Maimonides covers a lot of ground in little space, so I found my self using up the margins while trying to keep up with his thoughts. One of the nice things about this edition, however, is that it is in one volume, the entire guide to the perplexed. I found other editions, with larger print and such, but nothing besides this has the complete text. Moreover, it's cheaper than everything else I found! The translation is descent to good. It was done in the late 19th century, so you might say that it's a little dated, but it doesn't effect your reading. I read this book during a college seminar at St. John's, if you were wondering why I would have read this thing in the first palce. Speaking of which, I don't know if I'll ever really read this book again. This may be an important point, because while owning a book means you can do with it as you please, if you don't read it again, then it's just dead weight."},{"Title":"A View Of The Mountains","review":"In 1955, Britain's socialized medical system is new; and it isn't working as the physicians and patients who supported its creation thought it would. To a modern U.S. reader, it sounds like an HMO on steroids. Married-to-each-other doctors Morris and Janet Gibson, frustrated into either leaving their profession or emigrating, choose the latter alternative. Contacted by the Chamber of Commerce in a Canadian Rockies hamlet called Okotoks, which has no resident doctor, they decide - sight unseen - to settle there. With post-war currency controls forcing them to leave behind all but a few hundred dollars of their savings, including what they realize from selling their dream home, Morris, Janet, and their 12-year-old daughter Catriona arrive in Alberta to find that Okotoks has no Chamber of Commerce. A few local businessmen once thought about forming one, and somehow during their \\"thinking\\" (which came to nothing at that time) they sent out an appeal for a relocating physician to consider their town.That's how the Gibsons' adventure begins. Morris writes their first years in Okotoks (yes, they stayed - I can hardly consider this a spoiler, since if they hadn't there would have been no book!) in chapter-long vignettes reminiscent of his good friend James Herriot's work. Poignant, hilarious, and thought-provoking by turns, the result is a delight to read. People are people, everywhere, in every era, yes; Morris Gibson understands that, and his stories emphasize it as a truth. But he also captures the nuances of Canadian culture (that is NOT an oxymoron!), and the uniqueness of each person he and Janet and Catriona come to know as they adapt themselves to their new home.A gem. Pure and simple."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"This book is interesting because of the way it's told. It reads much like a novel would read. It's related from an Indian omniscient point of view. In other words you feel as if a Native American were sitting down recounting the tale. During the story we see Crazy Horse grow from a young boy called Curly hanging around his warrior friend Hump to a mighty warrior brave in battle. Sadly as most people know his people endured many hardships and many broken promises made by soldiers representing the Great Father. Reading this you can't help but be somewhat moved and have compassion for the eventual demise of the Oglalas that was well underway during Crazy Horse's life. Towards the latter part of the book emotions run deep as you see how jealousy, anger, and greed ripped apart what could have been good relations among the different Native American peoples. Of course, Crazy Horse the man we come to know in this book undergoes many of the hardships of the people himself. Almost as if he is the embodiment of the transition from the Indians to the white man's world at any cost.I did have a couple of problems with this book though. Namely, I found the writer's sentences to be ambiguous a lot of the time. There are no complicated words here as she is trying to write in the plain-spoken Indian style but many times I felt she was unclear so you would find yourself reading passages several times over to try and get sure her meaning. After a while this can become tedious. I also felt the prose could have been more lucid. Just because you're telling a story in a plain-spoken style doesn't mean you have to forsake any intellctual-sounding prose altogether. For these reasons it can be a taxing read which made what could have been a great book into just a good book. I still do recommend this work for a good perspective on the Native American view of history (even though some of the historical events in the book are no doubt dubious) if you are prepared to put in some effort and time reading it."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"I'm the kind of person who loves a book that makes you want to never put it down.This book is nothing of the type.I was doing a research project and when I went in to get this book it was sitting on the shelf all dusty like it had never been touched. Now I know why."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"It will be 3 years ago this February that I first read this book. I then bought the hard cover version so I could keep it in my library and read it over and over again.Prior to this, my interest in Western history was confined to pioneers and cowboys. The Indians were just some folks who happened to get a tough break. This book though, opened my mind to a culture that I had never known or thought much about. Now I read every book I can get on the subject, and spend my summers touring forts and battlefields.Since my first reading of Crazy Horse I have read a biography of Sandoz. I know that her research was maticulous and that she had a good rapport with the Indians who knew Crazy Horse and were still living at the time she was writing. Of course, since this is mostly an oral history it is hard to know what is actual truth and what is the myth which grew around the subject, but it doesn't really matter. No one can read this book without coming away with a new understanding of what it was like to live the free life on the Plains, and how devestating it must have been for those who lost it."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"What can you say about a shy, slender, half-blind woman, about five feet in height, who slept on the open prairie, lived with Indians on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, interviewed the likes of Black Elk, He Dog, Short Bull, Red Feather and others who personally knew Crazy Horse, who had already struggled for years as a writer before penning the ultimate biography of America's first authentic hero? From page one of \\"Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas\\" there is a sense that something spectacular is being recorded for posterity, never again to be witnessed by a living being. We are fortunate that Mari Sandoz lived during a time when the legend of Crazy Horse was still able to be told by those who knew and lived with him, but even more fortunate is that this amazing biography was written by an artist of the highest order. The story of the great Lakota warrior who refused to let his heritage be destroyed by the white man, will make you weep and wish you could have ridden with him on that open prairie."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"I read this book some days ago, and I am deeply impressed on both the life of Crazy Horse and the way Ms. Sandoz told it to the reader. Since long I have been reading books about Plains Indians and their wars and had a special interest in the person of Crazy Horse. But I had not expected that this strange man, hardly to be understood by his own people, would have become so vivid to me. Ms. Sandoz book is by far better than that of Stephen E. Ambrose who often quoted her, because unlike him she was able to tell it from the Indian point of view and did not always evaluate what she wrote about. Crazy Horse was an Indian hero as out of a Greek tragedy alway doing the best for his people but condemned to be beaten by unmeasureably stronger forces than those of his people. I think he will keep in my heart and brain."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"In his foreword to the 50th anniversary edition, Stephen Oates, himself an historian and biographer of note, describes how Sandoz came to write the life of Crazy Horse and states,\\"Mari Sandoz and Crazy Horse may be the most potent pairing of author and subject in the history of modern biography.\\" He praises Sandoz for writing \\"with a creative and lyrical brilliance that makes Crazy Horse a tour de force of language and style\\" and calls the book \\"...an almost perfect work of biographical art.\\" I could not agree more with Oates. I have read the entire book two times and portions of it many more times.Readers are often faced with the dilemma of deciding to read further after the first few chapters of a book in the hope they'll \\"get into it\\" or to close it and turn it into a dust-catcher. Not so with Sandoz's Crazy Horse. The reader is immediately drawn into it. I was hooked by the lyricism of the first few words of the book which told me that this was going to be no ordinary biography. They read as follows: \\"The drowsy heat of middle August lay heavy as a furred robe on the upper country of the Shell River, the North Platte of the white man. Almost every noon the thunders built themselves a dark cloud to ride the far crown of Laramie Peak. But down along the river no rain came to lay the dust of the emigrant road, and no cloud shaded the gleaming 'dobe walls and bastions of Fort Laramie, the soldier town that was only a little island of whites in a great sea of Indian country two thousand miles wide.\\"This story is told, not in the voice of a distant historian, but in the voice of an eyewitness. The vividness of her narrative would convince you, if you did not know otherwise, that Sandoz walked with Crazy Horse and his people. But even though she did not walk with them, she knew them well.This is an extraordinary work of creative nonfiction that makes you love being a reader."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"The strange man of the Lakotas made very little contact with the \\"white man\\" and remains a mysterious character of native American culture. Not much is known about him, his birth, his death, his burial.Sandoz attempts to document as much history is known about this man, and she puts it in the form of a novel. It is easy to read and entertaining. Yet it includes historical facts, events and characters. While it is difficult to pen a biography about someone who so little is known about, Sandoz documents all that is known about him in this book. Many of the facts were taken from interviews with people who knew him and lived with him. Those people are all long gone. The only comprehensive memory of Crazy Horse is this book."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"Immerse yourself in the life and mind of the Oglala Lakota with Sandoz's biography of Crazy Horse. In his preface, Steven Oates perhaps best summarized the book in writing &quot;by incorporating the Indian oral tradition into her narrative...Sandoz got closer to the truth of Crazy Horse and his world, and thus to the truth of history, than she could ever have done had she adhered strictly to &quot;facts&quot; taken from the written records of the white people.&quot; Although she had been accused by some of putting words in Crazy Horse's mouth with her style and use of oral history, Sandoz was no slouch as a historian. The book was a dozen years in the making and meticulously researched. As I read the story of Crazy Horse, I found myself so captivated by his story, and by Sandoz's retelling of it, that I was somehow hoping to be saved from the inevitable, tragic conclusion to the life of this truly heroic American. Anyone with an interest in American history must read this book."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"This is probably the most comprehensive biography of an Indian leader that I have ever read. The research is painstaking. The book was written in novel form and makes for an excellent read. Although there are no pictures of Crazy Horse, Ms Sandoz' first hand information from people who knew him creates an indelible snapshot of the man. He was a mystic, a visionary, a defender of his people, a modest man, who wore no fancy regalia, who never bragged after he had accomplished something great. His own people were ambivalent about him, and called him the Strange One or the Silent One. Moreover, he had fair complexion with light hair and brown eyes. He wanted desperately for his people to speak with one mind and with one heart. But the divisions within the Lakota people were simply too strong. What is most interesting is the tension between Crazy Horse and Red Cloud. Red Cloud is not painted in a positive light in this book. He is shown as petty, jealous and desperate to show up Crazy Horse. Wherein Crazy Horse was a 'natural' at everything he did, it was not so with Red Cloud who was forced to live under the specter of Crazy Horse's natural aptitude, particularly in matters of war. As a matter of fact he was one of the Lakota that held Crazy Horse down when he was fatally stabbed in 1877 by a white guard at Fort Robinson (Crazy Horse's vision as a young boy had prophesized his murder at the hands of his own people). Red Cloud is much lauded for being the only Native American to beat the cavalry soundly (Fetterman fight). In fact, it was the brilliant strategist Crazy Horse that won that fight. He had learned the ways of the white man in terms of war tactics and applied them brilliantly. Crazy Horse was certainly not without his faults, the matter of running away with another man's wife springs to mind. The Author is scrupulously fair in her assessment of him and of the time in which they lived. In the end Crazy Horse was not able to unify his people - he had his followers, and Red Cloud had his. The book is elegrantly written, paints a thorough picture of a tragic time in American history as natives ultimately fell into poverty, starvation and despair. The buffalo was gone. As noted in the preamble to the book, Natives of Turtle Island, were the victims of 'historical inevitability'. Ho."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"This is a highly unique biography and is a well-deserved classic in the world of literature. Sandoz did not write the standard Native American story from the point of view of the outsider (that is, the white conquerors), but created a book that feels as if it was written by the Indians from their own world view. Sandoz had the great advantage, in the 1930s, of interviewing still-living oldtimers who really knew Crazy Horse, and her combination of first-hand Indian accounts and meticulously well-crafted prose makes for an extremely compelling story of the last years of Indian freedom. In fact, this is not so much a biography of Crazy Horse, but a much larger story of the Lakota (Sioux) people in which he is the central character. The book does not include much historical detail, as that would be the white man's method of writing, so for such information on late Sioux history you would have to look elsewhere (such as *Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee* by Dee Brown).However, we do get a book full of beautiful and poetic prose such as &quot;there was a star with a long white tail to speak of good things,&quot; and consistent use of Indian terminology such as &quot;burning cup&quot; for whiskey or &quot;soldier chief&quot; for army officers. This style of writing does make the reading of this book stiff and long-winded in places, but Sandoz must be commended for her very unique and moving methods. In the end, Crazy Horse himself comes across as a troubled loner among his people, a bit manic-depressive but a strong leader and warrior, and he remains as dark and mysterious to us as he was to his friends and enemies. And as usual for Native American histories from this period, the end of the story gives us the depressing loss of the people's freedom and the noble but hopeless efforts of a great leader to save his people. Concerning the special 50th anniversary edition of the book, you can ignore the rather sycophantic introduction by Stephen B. Oates, but the stunning cover painting by Ed Lindlof is almost worth the price of admission alone.

It gave me a better understanding about how Native American life was and how the British took over. It explained how they believed in certain rituals to prepare for war such as the magic water they believed that stopped bullets from hitting them. Mari Sandoz gave a very fine description of Crazy Horse without using pictures. He seemed to be a great man from his characteristics and her words left you to think and imagine the scenes and appearances of people she mentioned. Crazy Horse was a leader and never a follower. He would try to do anything for his people. He was brace and independent. I admired him a lot because I favor people who take leadership and are not ashamed or frightened. At first I didn't want to read this book because it was so long and I wanted to get the book done to accomplish my project. But the book caught my attention and it was so deep. The book had happy scenes that made your spirit happy and sad scenes that made you cry. Crazy Horse was a great role model. I really related to him because as a boy he always wanted to accomplish his goal and he tried and did good deeds. However, I, also as a young lady in high school have dreams and goals to succeed and achieve and want to be confident in my work. Crazy Horse I would recommend for anyone who will take the time to read it, because it's a really good book. This is one of my favorite books and I will remember Crazy Horse for his courage, honor, gifts, bravery, and determination."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"For two years in college, I studied with Stephen B. Oates, who wrote the Foreword to this edition. An award-winning biographer of Lincoln, King, Nat Turner, John Brown, and others, Oates often told his classes that in his opinion, Mari Sandoz's Crazy Horse was the best biography ever written. His chief reason was Ms. Sandoz's ability to make the reader feel as though he or she is in the actual time and place where Crazy Horse lived, and the quality and style of her language, which has the feel of an oral history told by an Oglala elder at a ritual ceremony. I first read the book in Oates' class in 1985 then recently bought the newer edition with his contribution and read it again. Oates is a very wise man (and an extraordinary writer himself!)."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"Crazy Horse has held a deep and sacred passion for me since childhood, I thoroughly enjoyed Mari Sandoz's book but can not understand why her account has Hump dying at the hands of the Snake's and in a time frame before Crazy Horse's own death(1877), one has only to read Dee Brown's \\"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\\" and view a photo of Hump dated in 1890 at Fort Bennett, South Dakota, additional research indicates that Hump died long after Crazy Horse. It would be greatly appreciated if someone could clarify this for me."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"Little is known about Crazy Horse in comparison to other legendary chiefs, warriors and heroes due to the quiet-spoken and solitude-seeking nature he possessed. Indeed, Crazy Horse was considered \\"strange\\" due to standing true to his ideals and who he really was, instead of the conventional ways of others no matter how traditional. Born of lighter hair and skin, young Curly stood out as different from the beginning of his days. Most humble and purely strong and good-hearted, Crazy Horse grew to be the truest and most brilliant leader of the Lakotas. Self-sacrificing even to the bitter end, Crazy Horse earned his place of honor as a hero to be respected.Combining interview information of Eleanor Hinman with survivors who knew Crazy Horse, with Mari Sandoz's meticulous research, gives \\"Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of The Oglalas\\" clout in accuracy of detail and fact in the day and time of Crazy Horse. I very highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"This book and its' unique style succeeds in communicating history and personality. More so than a standard biography, Ms. Sandoz gives one the feel for the man and his character. The personalities of the protagonists are simulated for the reader. The background in history is strong enough to make most historical purists feel comfortable despite the styling of a novel. This book based on history; and &quot;Hanta Yo&quot;,fiction based on culture, give the reader some of the best insights into the times from the mindset of the Lakota."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"This book is well written, very interesting and hard to put down. The story it tells is very important in the history of North America. Crazy Horse is a significant historical figure to be admired and understood.

When I first read \\"Crazy Horse\\" six years ago, I ranked it as one of my two favorite books (\\"Grapes of Wrath\\" being the other). One hundred books later and it still retains that ranking in my list, along with Grapes and, now, Katz's \\"Battleground\\" (a bullet-proof presentation of Jewish claims to Eretz Israel) and Fischer's \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\" (which brings that event to life brilliantly). Sandoz writes and retells magnificently. This is a great book."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"I had never read Mari Sandoz so I can't compare this to her other books. The writing style is unique and pleasant. It is a very interesting, and unfortunately sad story about Indian life on the great plains. The book seems very well researched and therefore more interesting to read since it is about history. The Indians suffered strategically from a lack of organization, but their whole life style was about independence and in fact a much more pure form of democracy in selecting and de-selecting their leaders. In reading the story with regard to the lies and deceipt of the white men it reminded me that world politics and war is no different today than then. Crazy Horse had attributes that leaders should aspire to, he wanted to help his people and he was not vain about himself as leader. In the end he was tricked into surrender by his own people.I thought it was one of the best books of Indian life and history that I have read."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"This is unlike anything that I've ever read before. I can't say that I quite knew what to make of it when I started reading. Somewhere a couple of chapters in, this book just grabs you and you start realizing what an amazing piece of writing and history it is. The whole thing is told in the voice of the native american people. I'm blown away by this book!"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"Mari Sandoz does an excellent job of bringing an honorable and tragic life out of history and into the minds of the readers. Rather than writing a shopping list of Crazy Horse's life, Sandoz lets these events happen organically out of the story. As a result this book reads like fiction. Although not told from within the head of the Strange One, it is told from his perspective and his tribe members around him. Therefore, there is a continuity in the narrative that serves to pull the reader further and further in. There is no jumping around from Oglala to Cavalry to Trader,etc. which would only serve to confuse the character of Crazy Horse. I found myself wishing that Crazy Horse would just break out and flee into the wilderness rather than the tragic end he found at Ft. Robinson. His murder, although well-foreshadowed, never seems inevitable and drives home the great loss of this man and indeed the tragedy of this shameful aspect of American history. Sandoz also shows that history is never as simple as cowboys vs. indians, she paints a more complete picture of the internal and external conflicts surrounding Crazy Horse. I wish there were only more of his life for Mari to write about. I especially enjoyed her style of mixing direct quote with indirect quote with narrative--it's effective rather than being distracting. If you want to read a book about Crazy Horse, read this one."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"I have lived in Nebraska and Wyoming all of my life and currently enjoy hunting the same lands as Crazy Horse. I first read this book in 1974 during the uprising on the Pine Ridge Reservation. I have since then stood at the site where Fetterman was killed and other areas that Crazy Horse and his people lived and died. I have read the book two more times. The last being this summer.The book moved me as a teen and still today. I have used it as a lesson for myself to be tolerant of other societys. Another book of intrest is The Killing of Custer. In this book it further talks about how Crazy Horse saw the end of his people by accepting hand outs from the goverment."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"What can you say about a shy, slender, half-blind woman, about five feet in height, who slept on the open prairie, lived with Indians on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation, interviewd the likes of Black Elk, He Dog, Short Bull, Red Feather and others who personally knew Crazy Horse, who had already struggled for years as a writer before penning the ultimate biography of America's first authentic hero? From page one of &quot;Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas&quot; there is a sense that something spectacular is being recorded for posterity, never again to be witnessed by a living being. We are fortunate that Mari Sandoz lived during a time when the legend of Crazy Horse was still able to be told by those who knew and lived with him, but even more fortunate is that this amazing biography was written by an artist of the highest order. The story of the great Lakota warrior who refused to let his heritage be destroyed by the white man, will make you weep and wish you could have ridden with him on that open prairie."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and couldn't recommend it more. If you are a Native American history buff, or have any interest at all in the so-called Indian wars of the Great Plains, this book is a must-read. It is written in the vernacular of a Native American who speaks English tolerably well, and I believe this adds a great deal of character to the writing. The story of Crazy Horse's life is a sad one filled with the mistrust and back-stabbing deeds of his own people, along with the well known deeds committed by the American settlers and soldiers. Crazy Horse's ultimate downfall was aided by the restraining hands of his own people, as foretold by his vision. A sad ending to his life indeed, but Sandoz's re-telling provides a fascinating work of history. One word of advice to the reader: A much better understanding of the events that occur in this book can be had by \\"pre-reading\\" a good, concise history such as Indian Wars by Utley and Washburn."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"It is great to find a book that tells the life story of one of the greatest leaders in history from an indian point of view. Too often we are subjected to the Hollywood version of cowboys good, indians bad. The language in the book is clear and vivid, making Crazy Horse and his people come alive. After reading this book, Crazy Horse is no longer the demon we are often lead to believe but a human being devoting himself to saving his people. I would have no hesitation in recommending this book to my friends."},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"as a 50 year old man i was brought up thinking that indians were merely killers who took joy in killing any white man they found for no particular reason. after all that is what our school books ( at least back then ) and the movies said they were like. but after reading this factual book about the greatest warrior of the lakota, i have to say i was suprised to find that these people were not the same as i read about and saw on the movie screen. it gives one some insight into what they were really like. the way they lived, interacted with each other &amp;other indians, fought, and died for what they believed. it tells about a great man who gave all for his people, and how he and the people lived in a time when the white man was pushing west. in my opinion i would say this book is more accurate than most of the books i have read on the subject. it gives one a feeling you are there experiencing what was happening at the time, and the fear and joy crazy horse and his people felt. it also shows that these people were not blood thirsty like we were led to believe, but human beings just like everyone else. with that , one can see why they did some of the things they had to do to survive. if you want to know what it was like to be an indian in the mid 1800&quot;s or want to know what a real warrior was like read this book"},{"Title":"Crazy Horse, the strange man of the Oglalas","review":"as part of an undergraduate course on revolutionary heroes.

It was the first book chess book I ever bought. For White, it present an overview of the Stonewall attack and Queen's Gambit Declined. For Black it presents the Sicilian Dragon defence and Laskers Defence.I bought the book because some colleagues at work (back then) had invited me to play chess, and while I knew how to move the pieces, I didn't really have a strategy. This book gave me a general strategy (opening moves), talked a bit about the middle game, and discussed how to exploit inferior play. Some have written that it doesn't teach one how to think ahead. I disagree a bit: It got me thinking. My game improved, and the other players complimented me on my improved play.I am writing this review today becuase I am reorganizing my book-case. I re-discovered this old copy of \\"How to Think Ahead in Chess\\" and see how it is literally falling apart. Though I have not looked at it in years, I read it a lot back in the eighties.As I peruse it this morning, one last time, I feel it is dated. Sicilian theory, expecially the Dragon, is so well-known that one false move can doom you. Lasker's defence is not well thought of (as far as I know) these days. Don't read this book if you are a club player. You will probably be beaten badly by any other experienced player.So, who should read this book? Anyone in a club is probably already too advanced for it. I would recommend it for children and teens who know how to move the pieces and are ready to study opening theory, but aren't sure what openings to try. The writing is crisp and clear and simplistic (as is usual for Horowitz and Reinfeld).BTW, Other options would be \\"Concise Chess Openings\\" [Everyman Chess] or one of the teaching books by Jereny Silman.While I remember this book fondly, one should realize that there are a great many good chess books available today. Far more than when this book first came out."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This book deals specifically with 3 and only 3 openings - the Stonewall Attack for White; the Sicilian Dragon and Lasker's Defense to the Queen's Gambit Declined for Black. It presents 4 to 6 example games for each opening with pretty good commentary and explanation for each. However, each example given is a highly successful adoption of the subject opening, which gives good illustrations of what they are capable of, but which might give the inexperienced player the impression that each is a sure-win bet. After all, 6 examples of the Dragon will barely scratch the surface of this line and 6 out of 6 wins might be a little misleading to the novice.Part 4 of the book is titled, &quot;How to Exploit Inferior Play by Your Opponent&quot;. It contains 4 examples of Morphy and Alekhine crushing no-name opponents who are offered up as cannon-fodder for former world champions. Hardly inspiring and not very good examples of play for beginners.What this book does offer, however, is 3 solid choices of openings (1 for White; 2 for Black) for beginners who may have just joined a club or school team and need a limited opening repertoire to use against stronger players while they learn the game in more depth. It gives several very concrete plans to follow and they are presented in very clear fashion with the reasoning behind the moves. The authors occasionally use phrases such as &quot;White intends...&quot; or &quot;Black plans...&quot;, but whether that justifies the title of the book, &quot;How to Think Ahead in Chess&quot; is debatable.On the whole, if you are a beginner who needs some openings to play while you continue to develop, this may be just the book. But if you are rated over 1300 or so, you need to have a keen interest in the Stonewall or in Lasker's Defense to bother with this book."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"Master Horowitz and enthusiast Reinfeld's _How to Think Ahead in Chess_ tackles the problem of the mediocre play of most of us chess players most pointedly: Know only 3 openings, a few positions, and several variations -- but know them well. Train your eye upon the image of key chess positions seen through the analytical eye of the master. And, masterly, your chess instinct will react. This is the most fun book of chess I ever read. I've had it for well over 10 years and, the book is true to its back cover blurb, &quot;you will enjoy each game to the fullest.&quot; Improving chess demands work. And for those of us afficianados with pedagogical interests, this is a &quot;must have.&quot; This is not a beginner book nor a complete treatment. It is just a unique yet effective vehicle which may give your chess games a quantum leap toward the rewards of their deeper understanding. Four stars because a book should solve the basic human dilemma (whatever that is) to earn 5, and I'm conservative with my praise upon others or myself. I don't know a lot about winning a lot of chess games, but I know a lot more about my own approach thanks to this book."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This book will help intermediate players gain insight to strategy and help give them the confidence to play more aggressively.

If you can get a copy, it's worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"I enjoyed and played a lot chess in high school and in college and since I started working I have less and less time available for playing so my game suffered from it. Having said this currently I consider myself a novice again after about twelve years without being able to play a single game of chess. When I recently started playing again I found myself confused and kind of lost questioning if I should attack?, defend?, and if so when?, where?, how? I was looking for some books to start from scratch and try to reassess my game.I bought this book as part of a used chess book collection on an auction (the copy I got is a 1973 reprint), and I was not disappointed at all with this title. The book showed me again what kind of aspects I should take into account in order to establish a game plan after the opening stage has been passed. The authors take you step-by-step through actual games, describing and commenting every play, giving examples of the right questions to ask yourself in order to find the right plan and the right move.In the other hand one negative aspect is that the scope of the book is limited since it teaches how to think but it covers only three basic patterns from the opening phase: -With white pieces play one standard opening (the stonewall variation), - with black pieces play one standard defense against 1 P-K4 (the dragon variation of the Sicilian defense), and - with black pieces play one standard defense against 1 P-Q4 (the Lasker defense). So if you are already a strong player and master the openings you won't find anything new here. Nevertheless as a novice after you become thoroughly familiar with the patterns of play recommended in this book, you could then branch out into other openings with the help of an introductory opening book.Since the Table of Contents is not included in the book information presented above by the seller, I am including how the book is organized, so everybody can visualize what topics are covered in this book:Part One - Playing with the white pieces: Stonewall Pattern.- What opening shall I play.- Stonewall attack I. Demolition sacrifice at KR7.- Stonewall attack II. Normal position for white.- Stonewall attack III. Swooping down on the open king bishop file.- Queen's gambit declined. Black evades the stonewall attack.Part Two - Playing with the black pieces against 1 P-K4.- What defense shall I pay against 1 P-K4.- Dragon variation I. White can not afford indifferent play.- Dragon variation II. Normal position for black.- Dragon variation III. Black concludes with a stunning queen sacrifice.- Dragon variation IV. Vigorous counterattack.- Dragon variation V. White's queen-side castling proves a fiasco.- Dragon variation VI. Relentless positional pressure by black.Part Three - Two - Playing with the black pieces against 1 P-Q4- What defense shall I pay against 1 P-Q4.- Lasker's defense I. Simplification leads to freedom.- Lasker's defense II. Normal position for black.- Lasker's defense III. A fatal dilemma for white.- Lasker's defense IV. Battleground of conflicting theories.- Lasker's defense V. White's last attempt at refutation.Part Four - How to exploit inferior play by your opponent.- What if my opponent doesn't follow the book.- The importance of controlling the center.- How superior mobility leads to a stormy breakthrough- How line-opening leads to attacking possibilities.- How superior mobility leads to line-opening."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"While I am sure that there are many instructions given in this back that some will take issue with, I think this is overall an excellent chess book. Written for the chess player familiar with basic tactics and openings, it gives advice on preparing and carrying out the middle game. I am not familiar with any onther book that does this so well. Move by move, the book explains the how one launches into the middle game, transitions to end game, how solid development breeds opportunities. If you are a player who can develop the pieces nicely, but then are baffled at what do next, this is a must read. I am certain it improved my chess. This book was recommended to me about a year ago, and I looked in about 20 used book stores till I found a copy."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This book gives the player who is knowledgably about the basics, but doesn't have a plan, a logical way to proceed against mediocre players, but not against an advanced player, who they wouldn't be playing anyway. The introduction states that, \\"this book is not meant for masters.\\" However, I have used these tactics to beat 1400 rated (good, but not strong) opponents.The Stonewall, it's recommended opening for white, is not an opening the casual player is used to seeing, so the Stonewall's attack will almost always overwhelm them and lead to a victory for white. The two black openings, that are recommended, are sound against any opponent and require careful play on the part of white or they will find themselves losing in the middle game. The book also recommends going on to other openings after mastering these. It does give examples of how to plan the whole game from it's given three openings, and I found, that this helped me when I made my own game plan with other openings. This gives a tiny bit of justification to the title.But, I'm not giving it five stars because the title is annoyingly misleading; I would have called it, \\"Strong Openings for the Mediocre Player,\\" but that may not have sold as many books. At any rate, I strongly recommend the book to the neophyte. I found it useful and, I think, other beginning players will too. I still refer to it and I'm buying another copy to replace mine, which is now in parts."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This was one of the first Chess books I bought to begin to learn how to play advanced chess back in the 1980's. It is a reasonably good book that will give the beginning player some anchors in their journey to becoming more than a recreational chess player.That having been said, the selection of the Stonewall Attack as an opening for White leaves a lot to be desired. This is one of the most anemic and ineffective openings you can use against an experienced player. It leads to a closed opening which is really more the domain of the advanced player who understands positional and strategic chess. The only real benefit to the Stonewall attack is hoping your opponent won't see a bishop sacrifice and quick mating attack. It is easily defended against. Once it is defended against, White quickly loses the initiative and Black moves on to a strong game.Better suited for the beginner are King's pawn openings that bring tactics to bear in open games. Once this is understood then there are far better Queen's pawn openings to explore than the Stonewall Opening. Even the Colle System, which is similar and touched upon in this book is more practical than the main line taught here.That being said, however, the book does benefit the beginner by giving them a repertoire of 3 basic openings to where they can begin to go into their first tournaments or local chess clubs with a plan and some understanding of how to handle an opening. This should be more than enough to give them a leg up against any inexperienced player who has no plan.Once you've understood and mastered this book, be prepared to set a lot of it aside and relearn some things as you move ahead.Really, that is the primary criticism. There are plenty of good primers out there that give more practical openings to work on that will lead to something you can better build on later.So take it or leave it. It was a help to me and I've gone on to be a reasonably strong player, but it's not a book that excites me now that I know enough to look back on it and see what it did for me. Any book by Bruce Pandolfini for the beginning player should be chosen over this one."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This book is really great for the beginner (as I was) who usually just moves one move ahead and is reactive rather than proactive.

The authors take you step-by-step through actual games, describing and commenting every play, giving examples of the right questions to ask yourself in order to find the right plan and the right move.In the other hand one negative aspect is that the scope of the book is limited since it teaches how to think but it covers only three basic patterns from the opening phase: -With white pieces play one standard opening (the stonewall variation), - with black pieces play one standard defense against 1 P-K4 (the dragon variation of the Sicilian defense), and - with black pieces play one standard defense against 1 P-Q4 (the Lasker defense). So if you are already a strong player and master the openings you won't find anything new here. Nevertheless as a novice after you become thoroughly familiar with the patterns of play recommended in this book, you could then branch out into other openings with the help of an introductory opening book.Since the Table of Contents is not included in the book information presented above by the seller, I am including how the book is organized, so everybody can visualize what topics are covered in this book:Part One - Playing with the white pieces: Stonewall Pattern.- What opening shall I play.- Stonewall attack I. Demolition sacrifice at KR7.- Stonewall attack II. Normal position for white.- Stonewall attack III. Swooping down on the open king bishop file.- Queen's gambit declined. Black evades the stonewall attack.Part Two - Playing with the black pieces against 1 P-K4.- What defense shall I pay against 1 P-K4.- Dragon variation I. White can not afford indifferent play.- Dragon variation II. Normal position for black.- Dragon variation III. Black concludes with a stunning queen sacrifice.- Dragon variation IV. Vigorous counterattack.- Dragon variation V. White's queen-side castling proves a fiasco.- Dragon variation VI. Relentless positional pressure by black.Part Three - Two - Playing with the black pieces against 1 P-Q4- What defense shall I pay against 1 P-Q4.- Lasker's defense I. Simplification leads to freedom.- Lasker's defense II. Normal position for black.- Lasker's defense III. A fatal dilemma for white.- Lasker's defense IV. Battleground of conflicting theories.- Lasker's defense V. White's last attempt at refutation.Part Four - How to exploit inferior play by your opponent.- What if my opponent doesn't follow the book.- The importance of controlling the center.- How superior mobility leads to a stormy breakthrough- How line-opening leads to attacking possibilities.- How superior mobility leads to line-opening."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"I barely obtained my copy of this book, and i must say that the methods do work quite well. I played against the machine on AOLand i scored a win, a draw, and lose. Just follow the instructions and look at the layouts and your Chess games will improve. Even if you lose in the end, the knowledge you learn is very valuable because with it now, you can go so far in your Chess attack. Never mind about the negative reviews that some posted on here. Instead, buy this book, study it and see a difference in your game. I know i did against the machine.

The book teaches a few decent openings, which are useful against weaker players who don't know what are coming, but are easily defended against against people with some expertise (although, other than the stonewall attack, the other openings are quite respectable enough to get you started). It's also quite distressing that the \\"What if my opponent doesn't follow the book\\" chapter focuses on \\"inferior play\\", despite the fact that there are many very respectable lines of play not considered in the rest of the text. It's a bit arrogant for the writers to conclude that all of the lines in the rest of the text are necessarily the best ones (most classic was the claim that Queens Gambit Accepted is the worst thing ever...).The book, in annotating several games as the base of its explanations, gives very little reason as to why certain lines of play were chosen for tactical analysis, while the gazillions of possible others are eliminated. And *this* is what a book titled \\"How to think ahead in chess\\" needs to focus on. Clearly, very very few (if any) chess players can examine *all* possible combinations of moves lasting 6 or 7 moves deep in any reasonable time. This book needs to tell us *which* sequences of moves to focus on, and why. And the answer needs to be more specific than \\"these moves help control the center, and the others don't.\\" It's all well and good to say \\"control the center\\", but you need to know exactly what \\"control of the center\\" constitutes, how to bring it about, and what to do with it once you have it (or, how to cope with a loss of center control).This could actually be a good book if it had been titled \\"What openings should a beginner play\\", with the final chapter on \\"what if my opponent doesn't follow the book\\" removed."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This book helped me when I was learning. This book gives 3 basic openings and encourages the user to focus on just these. This is good advise for someone who knows how to play, but not well. These openings will get you into a sound middle game, and if your opponent is not careful they will make a mistake you'll be ready to capitalize on. I now follow a similar line of reasoning but I now use a differnt opening, the King's Indian...partly because it can be used for white or black, and it is more difficult to disrrupt. My favorite book for that is &quot;The Ultimate King's Indian Attack&quot; by Angus Dunnington."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"I've been playing with the Stonewall opening and my opponent keeps not cooperating!

I got this book back in 9th grade when I first got interested in trying to improve my game. I had practiced chess problems and learned some basic mates along with pins, skewers, forks, discovered attacks etc. but didn't really know much about openings or an overall game plan. This book's focus on a limited set of openings is an effective learning strategy that doesn't overwhelm the novice.I have moved on to openings other than the Stonewall Attack (mainly due to the horribly boxed in Queen's bishop that you end up with) but there is nothing like the feeling of power you get looking at the expression on your brother-in-laws face the first time you post your King's knight to e5. :-)If you know how to play but always get creamed by experienced players then this book will get you started on the road to real chess."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This is a great chess book for strong novice players. I was a strong novice before I studied the book. I could usually beat the typical computer chess program (with 10 levels of difficulty) at level 1 and sometimes on level 2, but struggled beyond that. After reading this book and practicing its suggestions, I can now beat the same chess programs at level 4 and sometimes at level 5. This book helped me develop from a strong novice to a low to mid-level intermediate player. Because the book worked for me, I give it 5 stars.However, it is important to keep in mind the target audience for this book. If you are an intermediate player already, the book will not be quite as helpful (and you'll probably give it fewer stars). As other reviews point out, this book advocates learning just 3 openings very well: Stonewall, Sicilian/Dragon variation, and Lasker's Defense. If you play in a chess club or against the same opponents frequently, they'll probably realize that you are pretty much just a 3-trick pony and they'll find ways to respond to your openings. However, if you just want to hold your own on various impromptu games, then learning the variations of 3 openings very well will set you up for a strong middle and end game.This is book alone will not take you all the way to mid-level or high-end intermediate level play. It does teach you other ways to think through the play of the game and to plan high-level strategy. But it really doesn't teach you tactics and probably won't strengthen your end game very much. Keep this in mind when you decide whether this book is right for you."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"I once thought this was a wonderful chess book even though the title has nothing to do with the contents. But that was 30 years ago. The book hasn't stood the test of time. It hasn't even stood the test of practical play.It's an opening repertoire book, simply written and easy to understand. There's the problem: it's vastly over-simplified and biased. Let's have a look.For White you are recommended to play the Stonewall Attack. Despite what some others think I don't have a problem with that, though a related and in my mind more effective choice is the Colle system. The book shows some spectacular wins against rather poor play, and also shows a response to one anti-Stonewall line. All in all, rather well presented even if the Stonewall doesn't enjoy a popular reputation (but see later comments).For Black, against 1. d4 (er ... 1. P-Q4 as the book is in descriptive notation) Lasker's Defense is recommended. Again, not bad, and the coverage is reasonable. Of course all the big wins for Black are again due to poor opposition play. Still, for a beginner facing 1. d4 Lasker's is a good way to stay out of trouble (but again see later comments).Unfortunately, the recommendation against 1. e4, the Sicilian Dragon, is covered quite poorly and is in no way a suitable choice for a beginner. It is full of theory and sharp lines and requires deep study and a lot of skill to handle well. Unfortunately and a bit foolishly I tried to be a Dragon player for quite some time, based on this book, and did badly overall. The book doesn't talk a bit about anti-Sicilians such as 2. c3 or 2. Nc3. It doesn't cover the Yugoslav attack, which has been the death of many a Dragon player. It just shows all these slashing wins by Black against inept White opponents.I asked a local coach (a highly rated player) about these lines, stating (as above) that the Stonewall and the Lasker seemed like good safe lines. He advised me to not spend my time studying openings that I will have to throw away later (his word was 'junk' but I thought that a bit strong). He said that the Stonewall and Lasker's were OK to get by with, but once I improved and started to play better competition, I would need to switch to openings that had better winning chances. \\"You don't win by playing for a draw\\" was the way he put it. And he agreed that the Dragon was simply not suitable for non-expert players.Read this book for entertainment (maybe) but not to find the magic repertoire. It isn't here."},{"Title":"How to think ahead in chess: The methods and techniques of planning your entire game","review":"This was the first book my older brother bought on chess when I was a kid and we both benefited from it.

The book is a natural follow-up to their first collaborative effort, Classrooms That Work: They Can All Read and Write. It is lengthy, but highly engaging, and offers practical, research based ideas for those who envision and want to work toward moving their school or school system toward being one where all children become literate. Because American society has changed, and is changing, at such a rapid pace, Allington and Cunningham contend that the current organizational structure of schools, while being well intentioned, is outdated. Existing structures do not effectively meet the needs of all children, especially those who are at the highest risk of school failure. Therefore, they believe that educational interventions that offer \\"more of the same\\" will not work to fix the inadequacies in today's schools. Because many schools are stuck, looking toward traditional solutions, huge amounts of federal and state money are being poured into educational programs such as developmental kindergarten, transitional K-1 classes, retention, and remedial, resource and bilingual programs that aren't effective in helping all at risk learners learn to read and write. Throughout the twelve chapters of the book, examples of effective large and small-scale school restructuring efforts in real schools are described. These descriptions are very helpful in illustrating the authors' key points. Models such as the Coalition of Essential Schools, Success For All, the Accelerated Schools Model, Reading Recovery, School Power and Schools for the 21st Century are included. Chapters of the book are organized around central themes of school organizational plans such as instruction, professional roles, allocation of time, parent involvement, assessment and curriculum materials. I will briefly summarize these chapters to give an overview of their content. In the chapter on curriculum, Cunningham and Allington offer many ideas for getting real reading material into the hands of children. Popular methods of literacy instruction are also described, but it is clear that the authors do not believe there is one best way to teach reading and writing. Instead, they advocate for quality instruction delivered in a multifaceted approach. This position is similar to that taken in Best Practices in Literacy Instruction, edited by Gambrel, Morrow, Neuman and Pressley, a resource text for teachers of literacy. Allington and Cunningham then go on to describe essential components of quality literacy instruction. One of the important points of the book is that \\"good schools are a collection of good classrooms\\" and that the job of everyone who works at a school is to support and enhance classroom instruction. An important point is made that while most instruction for at risk students slows down the pace of instruction, what is most effective is accelerating their learning through more and better instruction so that they are able to catch up with their peers. Concerning the issue of how instructional time is used; a chapter is devoted to describing effective classroom management practices that maximize the amount of time available for actual reading and writing. Innovative ways of creating more instructional time such as allowing teachers to work on flexible schedules opens up the possibility of students receiving extended amounts of instruction before and after school, in Saturday School and summer school. In the chapter on assessment, strategies for evaluating literacy programs and progress are given. Ideas for utilizing authentic assessments such as observational records, writing samples, narrative comments, interviews, self-evaluations, portfolios and anonymous student testing are presented.Because schools can change only as fast as the instructional practices of teachers change, Allington and Cunningham devote a chapter to advice for supporting the professional development of teachers. The authors believe that systems need to allocate greater amounts of their resources toward professional development, as well as offer administrative and collegial support in order for teachers to remain life long learners who continually develop new areas of expertise. As our changing society affects schools, it affects families too. Most children now come from single parent families or families where both parents work. Because the authors believe that schools cannot be fully effective without parent support and involvement, ideas for improving parent outreach programs are described. Innovative ways to improve communication between schools and families, involve parents in school decision making processes, and create family literacy programs and interagency family support services that help break cycles of illiteracy and poverty are provided. A chapter is set aside for offering additional ideas for developing the literacy skills of special populations of children, such as those with learning disabilities and those who speak English as a second language. In another chapter, a tour is given through a hypothetical school that reflects some of the basic themes in the book. Readers are then prompted to take a tour through their own school and look for examples of effective practices they would like to see more of, as well as ineffective practices they would like to see decreased. The final chapter of the book offers some relief to the reader, who may at this point be overwhelmed with the scope and scale of school restructuring that needs to be done. Allington and Cunningham caution, though, that there are no quick fixes in education, and that successful reform efforts are done gradually with the long view in mind. Restructuring often begins with a small group of people, or even with one person at a school. Is that person you? Do you believe that all children can learn to read and write, and would you like to help them do so? If you think so, this book could be an invaluable resource that gets you thinking about large-scale changes by starting small. Read it and pass it along to someone in your school, as someone in my school passed it along to me. Who knows what might happen next?"},{"Title":"Schools That Work: Where All Children Read and Write (3rd Edition)","review":"With over ten years as a primary, intermediate, and junior high teacher, I have read lots of education books.

I finally wound up buying the Ebook and reading it that way, but hope to have my REAL book in hand soon -- yes, it's REALLY that good.Gail McFarland's work can't really be compared to anybody else's. Her writing is not mushy or 'girly'. It is strong and evocative, with a syle that makes you want to sit and talk with her. Then, she plotted the Hell out of the story. Everybody else reviewing this one nearly told you the story, and I don't want to ruin it by filling in too many of the gaps, so I will simply say that I hope there's a sequel to this one, 'cause I want MORE.

I waited for almost three years for this one, and she did not disappoint me. Gail did her usual thing with all the characters, and every one of them was almost like somebody I know. From page one, this story had me going, and I turned those pages like a champ!I have to say it again: Damn! This Sister is good!

Hot on her trail, he and his psychologist ex-wife Dhana soon find that they are working on more than just the case.Filled with romance, a hint of suspense, and psychological thrills, Lady Killer by Gail McFarland kept me turning the pages not only to see if the killer was caught, but also if Jaz and Dhana could reconcile their relationship. It's not really what I would consider a &quot;mystery&quot;, as the killer is revealed early on. Instead, I'd call it a worthy piece of supsenseful romance in which the characters are likeable and real, and the crime is deviant, yet possible.Reviewed by CandaceK"},{"Title":"Lady Killer","review":"Beware of a woman scorned, especially a woman with the intelligence and the means to do harm in ways only once thought of as unimaginable.In Gail McFarland's suspenseful novel, Lady Killer, Detective Jaz Ballantine is on the hunt for his foster brother's murderer. Jaz is bewildered with who could have done this and why the murderer chose to practically mutilate GQ (Jaz's foster brother) and take one of his teeth. What's even more mysterious is the body count at the morgue. It's growing full of young, single, handsome, African American males, all murdered in similar fashion. Jaz realizes that he has a serial killer on his hands, and a unique serial killer at that. It's expected that a WOMAN, an African American woman may be responsible for the murders. Jaz vows to find the killer to GQ's murder, and despite his misgivings, Jaz brings his ex-wife, Dhana, into the case to profile the killer. Through the vigorous twists, turns, and surprises that plague Jaz and Dhana's investigation, thetwo find themselves reconnecting on a more personal level. As their love grows and ignite, so does the murderous rampage and the cat and mouse games of the serial killer. Will the duo find the killer and rekindle their love before more bloodshed?I have to say that I really enjoyed this story, more so at the end than in the beginning. The novel starts off very slow, and I found myself skimming through to get to the more suspenseful parts. I have to state that I read the uncorrected proof, so I'm not sure if all 422 pages of the novel was published; however, I thought the novel could be a lot leaner, especially in the middle. I was interested in the relationship between Jaz and Dhana yet, at the same time, I wanted more of the Lady Killer and her story prior to taking \\"matters into her own hands.\\"I can say definitively that McFarland's Lady Killer is the most evil and brilliant female villain I have ever read. She frightened and excited me at the same time and made me want to finish the novel to see what would happen to her.I would recommend that others pick up this novel and give it a read. I don't think you will be disappointed.Shon Bacon"},{"Title":"Lady Killer","review":"When young men start disappearing in Atlanta and other high-profile cities, it's not long before connections are drawn and the police realize they are dealing with a serial killer. What's even more strange is the killer appears to be a woman, out to rid the world of womanizing men. Talk about a woman scorned! She calls herself L.K., aka Lady Killer, and leads the police on a chase to find her and the connection between her victims.Detective Jaz Ballantine is on the case after he loses GQ, his foster brother, to the Lady Killer. Though he's closely linked to GQ, Jaz remains on the case, set on finding out who not only killed him, but also mutilated the body in the process. He calls on his ex-wife Dhana to assist in finding the killer. A psychologist skilled in profiling criminals, Dhana is not convinced working with Jaz is in her best interest. Though divorced for several years, she's still harboring feelings for him and is hesitant to commit to spending more time with him than necessary.As the story progresses, the Lady Killer seeks out Dhana, feeling a sense of familiarity with her. More bodies are found and the attraction between Jaz and Dhana grows. One is not certain how things will end, but it will definitely be an ending you'll rush to get to.Gail McFarland has the gift of storytelling and should be commended on how masterfully she crafted Lady Killer. It is an exciting, suspenseful, and somewhat provocative story about what a person is capable of becoming in the future as a result of their past.Reviewed by Mz.

Mill, Marx, Bastiat and Pareto. What is truly amazing is amount of time in Volume I he devotes to smaller unknown scholastics (who revived much of the work of Aristotle after finding preserved by the Arabs) overlooked by works like Lionel Robbins lectures on Economic thought and much of Hayek's contributions, which were dominated by the Scottish Enlightenment. Insomuch, Rothbard credits - like Schumpeter did - many lesser individuals which prefigured Smith, like Turgot, Cantillon and the French tradition; or the School of Salamanca and the Scholastic's who debunked the idea of a just price - based in a theoretical corpus of Natural Law (like Rothbard himself).There are some who have taken the whole book out of context by reading only his treatment of Adam Smith - mostly because this is the most controversial section. Without context, Rothbard chapter on Smith seems to be harsh for those who consider him a great defender of liberty and lassie faire. Yet, to me, he sufficiently backs his libertarian case against Smith - as those who have actually looked into the Wealth of Nations can attest (the contradiction in Book 1 and 5 is most apparent in his description of the division of labor on one hand and alienation on the other). In fact, he continues Joseph Schumpeter's famous assessment of \`das AdamSmith' problem (Schumpeter argues that Smith, in the Wealth of Nations is just carrying on a physiocrat position in \`Economic Doctrine and Method'); which has plagued economic thought by misplacing an emphasis on one man as the intellectual godfather while belittling outstanding prefigures like Turgot and Cantillon, the Scholastics and post-figures such as Senior, Bastiat and Say.It is not that Rothbard means to tear Smith's whole doctrine asunder. Rothbard admits freely that Smith was important up to a point, yet was bereft in his defense of liberty. Hence Smith doesn't measure up to his \`hardcore' liberal French counterparts - for instance Turgot or Say. Rothbard illustrates this in the American tradition by quoting Thomas Jefferson as having admiration and preference for De Tracy and J.S. Say instead of Adam Smith.A mild warning - although the book is an exhilarating history of ideas, some of the finer points may be difficult or perhaps too technical for a layman. Rothbard has particular detailed points on theoretical economic issues. (Which makes me question the familiar charge about Rothbard retreating from Economics during the 1970's - as this book was written in the 1980's) He spends some space analyzing the differences in the theory of price (between Mill, Ricardo, Smith and the French School), interest and other lengthy sections (roughly 3 chapters of the second book) on monetary theory.In light of the 20th century textbook analysis dominated by the neo-classical tradition in the micro sphere and Keynesianism in the macro sphere, Rothbard seeks to carve out and correct misunderstanding and misrepresentation of the classics and its development into the strains of these modern ideas - evaluating them by his own Austrian standard (see Rothbard's Man, Economy and State and Human Action by L. von Mises). Yet, Rothbard is not intentionally setting up historical economists as straw men, but to show that they were pioneers - some with clearer insight than others. In effect, he shows that some economics has gotten better while other have gotten worse.Although this book is aimed at understanding economics, these two volumes also show the depth of Rothbard as an intellectual, religious and political historian as well. Again, this work ought to be disquieting to those scholars who continually discounted Rothbard. It is this painstaking argumentation which feeds directly into his thesis and makes the work sparkle; providing relevance to the questions which still persist today and will be here tomorrow."},{"Title":"An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought (2 Vol. Set)","review":"The product of a lifetime of dedicated scholarship, this is Rothbard's magnum opus.Volume one is a breathtaking journey through time, analyzing how culture, religion, and politics have impacted upon economic thought.Volume two contains the most devastating refutation and trenchant analysis of Karl Marx and his destructive, apocalyptic theory of Communism.\\""},{"Title":"An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought (2 Vol. Set)","review":"When an economist writes history, you are going to get something much different than when a historian writes history. For regular historians, economics is a poorly understood sideshow at best. Unlike Rothbard, they'll skip consideration of the economists themselves and their ideas.In other words, you will never have heard of 95% of the historical figures in this book, important as they were to the birthing of the modern world, nor will you have heard of the wars of ideas they fought. Certain major factors moving big events of history will not be there because the historians simiply haven't noticed.For example...We all know about the Black Death. But a free market economist studying the era quickly makes a connection missed (so far as I know) by standard historians. Standard historians tell us about how the bubonic plague affected the economy but generally miss how the economy affected the plague. Rothbard doesn't miss it. 13th and 14th century kings, challenging the power of Rome and in need of money to finance their new structures of centralized state power, taxed and regulated the burgeoning commerce that had been bringing Europe out of the Dark Ages. In so doing, they sent the economy spiraling back into a new dark age of poverty, poor sanitation, and ill health that made the plague just that much more virulent when it hit.Rothbard is not a proponent of the \\"Great Men\\" school of economic thought that has a few giants like Smith, Marx, Keynes etc. doing all the heavy lifting. He sees the conscious study of economics as somewhat unusual in history and the advancement of economic understanding as slow and incremental. Actually, advancement is not always the right word. Rothbard makes the point that there have been and still are many wrong turnings that have set progress back.In this astounding book, you will get a look at: the laissez faire philosophy of Chinese Taoists, Plato vs. Aristotle, the laissez faire underpinnings of Roman Law, Thomas Aquinas, the exceptional and important free market discoveries of the Catholic Scholastics during the Middle Ages, their struggle to come to grips with and finally dismantle the notion that usury is a sin, the struggle between liberal-minded Scholastics (especially Jesuits) and authoritarian Protestants (which presages and develops into the modern intellectual debate between freedom and authority in politics and economics), mercantilism vs. freedom during the English Civil War, Cantillon and Turgot, and finally the Scottish Enlightenment and Adam Smith, one of the Great Men who doesn't fare as well under Rothbard's analysis as one might expect.(Note, this review was for Volume One: Economic Thought Before Adam Smith, before the two volumes were combined.)"},{"Title":"An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought (2 Vol. Set)","review":"I borrowed this work from my local university library and read it through TWICE!

He also wrote books such asMan Economy and State One Complete Volume,Power and Market: Government and the Economy,America's Great Depression (Paperback), etc.He wrote in the Introduction to this 1995 book, \\"this work is an overall history of economic thought from a frankly 'Austrian' standpoint... This is the only such work by a modern Austrian... Not only that: this perspective is grounded in what is currently the least fashionable though not the least numerous variant of the Austrian School: the 'Misesian' or 'praxeological.'\\" (Pg. vii) He adds, \\"leaving out religious outlook, as well as social and political philosophy, would disastrously skew any picture of the history of economic thought... The entire work is longer than most since it insists on bringing in all the 'lesser' figures... I hope that, for the reader, the unwonted length will be offset by the inclusion of far more human drama than is usually offered in histories of economic thought.\\" (Pg. xiii)He states, \\"The usury prohibition was the tragic flaw in the economic views of medieval jurists and theologians.\\" (Pg. 45) He observes, \\"The decline of Church authority, then, was matched by the rise in the power of the absolute state.\\" (Pg. 69)He is (perhaps surprisingly) rather disparaging of Adam Smith: \\"The honour of being called the 'father of modern economics' belongs... [not to] Adam Smith, but to a gallicized Irish merchant, banker and adventurer... [named] Richard Cantillon.\\" (Pg. 345) \\"after Adam Smith... the entire tradition of subjective utility... gets poured down the Orwellian memory hole by Adam Smith's fateful decision to discard even his own previous concepts... Adam Smith has a lot to answer for at the bar of history.\\" (Pg. 449-450) \\"Adam Smith contributed nothing of value to economic thought... he introduced numerous fallacies, including the labour theory of value, and thereby caused a significant deterioration of economic thought...\\" (Pg. 463) \\"The most unfortunate aspect of the total Smithian takeover in economics was... the blotting out of knowledge of the rich tradition of economic thought that had developed before Smith. As a result, the Austrians ... were in many ways forced to reinvent the wheel, to painfully claw their way back to the knowledge that many pre-Smithians had enjoyed long before.\\" (Pg. 502)He admits, \\"Natural rights, laissez-faire libertarians always confront several problems or lacunae in their theory. One is taxation. If every individual is to have inviolable property rights, and those rights are to be guaranteed by the government, taxation, itself an infringement of property rights, presents an immediate problem to laissez-faire theorists. For HOW HIGH should taxes be, and WHO should pay them?\\" (Pg. 371)This first volume goes into MUCH more detail on the early economists than many readers will be even marginally interested in; however, Rothbard's incisive comments make this volume essential reading for anyone studying Austrian economics, or the history of economics."},{"Title":"An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought (2 Vol. Set)","review":"This was better than I expected. A quite different perspective on Plato and Aristotle, and how they were so egotistical - as in \\"we are the polis, and those ignorant slaves and merchants and craftsmen and all the other filthy classes, really need us to tell them what to do and how to live, since we're so much smarter than they are.\\" This may truly be the foundation of the modern elitist attitude, it seemed to me. (My summary of attitudes here, the book is much more erudite and particular)The book then continues on with example after example of highly intelligent, gifted thinkers who kept disagreeing with each other through the centuries. In fact, one impression I gained was that the Absolutist, or total government-control-of-everything theory, has alternated many times with the Property rights/Natural Law theory of individual rights and free markets. And perhaps the Black Death/Plague years really happened because that was in a time of the Absolutist theory being predominate, and both rich and poor were so impoverished that their health failed from hunger and weakness and exhaustion, and the inability to practice sanitation and rat control - because the governments had ruined the economy so badly. Wow!Not that it's all generalities. This book is stuffed full of names, and often will reverse your opinion of who really invented many of the theories and thought systems we've learned about in history classes. The connections and influences, the famous schools and philosophers, and the catastrophic reversals of opinion and the huge mistakes made by famous people, is sure to have you shaking your head. So little learning from history, even by the most influential and famous of thinkers!There is truly nothing new under the sun.

Far more of it is a matter of snarky assertion having little to do with facts or analysis and his writing is so wildly biased towards his own political world view as to be rendered useless for any scholarly purpose other than a review of this particular economist and his writing. His dissection of Marx is about half correct though blindingly obvious, and half based on deliberate misstatement of Marx's works or of attributing the works of others to Marx. Don't get me wrong, I'm no Marxist, but it would seem to me to be a simple matter to critique Marx on a far more honest and intelligent basis than this 'economist' has done. The parts of this book which are not tortuously boring are rife with willful misinterpretation of viewpoints that are anything other than far right libertarianism.

It is always held by the same man, simply known as Ashmedai. For centuries, countless witches and warlocks have vied in vicious bidding wars with one another to attain the auction's mysterious prize. No one knows what this prize is, only that it contains immeasurable power and thus is worthy of bloody contention. Rumors whisper of unfathomable danger and death and a fate worse than death - that, of those who choose to participate in this auction, no one ever ever returns...Valerie Lancaster goes looking for help from history professor Alex Warner, who was a friend much held in esteem by her father. Valerie's father was recently murdered and the daughter wants certain questions answered and seeks a redressing. But things get even more muddled. Jake Lancaster, Valerie's dad, was a capable true mage and was brutally slain in order to obtain an object he had received - an Invitation to a legendary auction, whose location can only be determined in the presence of said Invitation. It seems the only way to uncover Jake Lancaster's murderer is to go to the auction. Alex Warner, along with Valerie (who herself is a nonpracticing sorceress), is sucked into the sinister world of the occult, where magic is terrifyingly real. Their journey to find the whereabouts of Ashmedai is unendingly fraught with attacks by werewolves, golems and powerful black sorcery. But, as it turns out, getting to Ashmedai's auction is the easy part. Alex and Valerie will undergo ultimate peril when they at last come face to face with the true nature of the auction's prize...The Devil's Auction is definitely somewhere in my top twenty all-time favorite books. Robert Weinberg weaves a harrowing tale of horror, fantasy, and exhilarating high adventure. There are hairbreath escapes, old-fashioned romance, heroic derrings-do (mostly perpetrated by the intrepid Alex Warner, who seems to be an updated version of Indiana Jones) and nasty supernatural creatures, all of whom are intent on causing irreparable, not-covered-by-insurance damage unto our duo. Weinberg has lots of sadistic fun here, constantly throwing his two leads into dire jeopardy after jeopardy. The result is a wild, adrenalin-rushed occult thriller, a story that rarely pauses to take in oxygen. Man alive, I just love this book. From start to finish, there isn't a word, sentence or passage that rings false. You sink into the pages (to quote Rakim) like you were ink. The closing pages offer up a very nice reveal, providing a nice dessert to what has been a sumptuous feast of a novel.If I could, I'd give this horror story more than five stars. I highly, highly recommend it.

The book (great as it is) centers on several of the main Beat authors and either presents selections of their works or offers extended yet insightful interviews with them. Though the centerpiece here is Jack Kerouac himself ---all right! The king of the beatniks, as he once roared in holy inebriation --- and how each writer was affiliated with him. Arthur and Kit Knight (apparently a journalist couple) did a swell job of giving us each author's experiences with Jack. Mainly, Kerouac and the Beats is a sourcebook which one can then explore other works by all the featured writers.&lt;I am going to give you an in-depth account of each chapter. It is rather dull and extensive. For those who hate descriptiveness, don't read. For those who want to know about the book read on.>\\"Poor God\\" makes a start, a chapter introducing us to Neal Cassidy and his distinctive letter writing style. Alliterations and uneven structures are overflowing throughout his one-long letter to wife Carolyn, written in his cell because of another misdemeanor. Secondly and thirdly are two enthralling interviews with WS Burroughs and Philip Whalen. In the 1st chapter Burroughs discusses writers, writing, weapons, and such. In the 2nd chapter Whalen (a not-so-well-known Beat author) says a bit about his recently changed-person activities and how Buddhism is abetting his writer's touch. \\"Guilty of Everything,\\" a short account by Herbert Huncke, proceeds the last two. The tale depicts all the never-ending jaunts Huncke took thru NYC cafeterias, crash pads, surveys with Professor Kinsey, and drugs. &lt;One can find this short, and more, in the recent anthology The Hebert Huncke Reader.>Yet another interview follows, parleyed with undervalued writer Jan Kerouac, Jack's daughter of course. Jan (who decided to let the \\"beat\\" go on) is noted for her novel Baby Driver. Multiple chapters of letters are near: with Ginsberg, JC Holmes, Cassidy, and Jack and Holmes. These four sections of the book are pretty much a barrier, sweat-fest abundance. I put it down for a week because of its bombastic phrases and cryptic dialogue, although that might be gripping for some readers. 2 sections concerning JC Holmes are next. The first (an interview) is an in-depth account of Kerouac's novels. The second (Exiles Journal) is chronicle spanning the Years-of-Hope-Days-of-Rage decade. The last three chapters are the best: 1st an interview with Mike McClure describing his prose; 2nd an excerpt from a story about F. Edith Kerouac Parker, Jack's widow; 3rd (and finishing it off) a lengthy discussion with Allen Ginsberg.All and all, (is that all?) Kerouac and the Beats is an enjoyment for those inquisitive \`bout the Beat Movement and other hep subjects. Furthermore, the sourcebook delves into historical information (chiefly the 1950-70s), ideas and facts regarding jazz, drug related matters, sexual related matters, Eastern philosophy, and much more which might seem mind-boggling for a younger audience. Nonetheless, if you read On the Road or Naked Lunch, and understood most of what those writers were talking about, you may have a chance liking Kerouac and The Beats. That's it."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"This was Maugham's first published work which appeared 102 years ago. Maugham had just graduated from medical school almost the day the book was published and the modest success and good reviews convinced him to dedicate his life to a career of letters. The story takes place in the Lambeth section of London and is baised of his internship and residence at St. Thomas Hospital where he was required to call on the lower classes in the most dangerous section of town. Later in his life he joked about being a Midwife in his youth and delivering over a hundered babies for the poor. Maugham was influenced by &quot;Sister Carrie&quot; and &quot;Mean Streets.&quot; and other books in the realistic tradition of the day. It is a rather short book and is written in the Cockney dialect of conversation like Dickens &quot;Hard Times.&quot; It is well worth reading and a must for any Maugham fan."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"\\"Liza of Lambeth,\\" Maugham's literary debut, is a less accomplished and complex novel than later masterpieces such as \\"The Razor's Edge\\" and \\"The Moon and Sixpence.\\" Nevertheless, this novel is well worth the read. It chronicles Liza, a young woman who lives in a lower class London neighborhood. She struggles as she works in a factory and helps her alcoholic mother. Despite the rather grim setting, the characters are suprisingly full of life and humor. Liza is a bit of a social butterfly in the neighborhood and is well-liked until she garners the attention of a married man. This connection grows with tragic consequences. There is little sentimentality in the novel, and Maugham was apparently inspired by his work as a medical student in the London slums. Overall, a quick read and a good character study of a young, head-strong woman in late 19th century London."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"The story plot is nothing extraordinary, nor are the characaters unique, but what sets this short novel apart from the rest is the vivid picture that Maugham creates of the lower section of the London society. The story flows freely with a lucid style of writing, arresting the reader's attention from the first pages to the last, and touches a chord in the reader's heart somewhere deep, all along the way. Definitely a work of class, more so, it was Maugham's first novel. The old adage 'morning shows the day' aptly describes what the writer achieves in this work and the masterpieces that follow (Of Human Bondage, The Moon and the Sixpence, The Razor's Edge, etc.)."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"Maugham's very first published work has many of the elements that would be evident in his later works and that set him apart as one of the truly accomplished men of letters of his era. Lisa Of Lambeth is set in a poor working district of South London where Maugham practiced medicine as a younger man and demonstrates the remarkable powers of observation that were crucial to his later success. The tragic story of a bright young girl's affair with a married man has the pacing and feel not only of Maugham's later novels but has dramatic buildup and dialogue so predictive of his later success as a playwright.The novel certainly stands on it's own since the story and the characters are very engaging.

Set among the working poor in the slums of Lambeth, Liza Kemp rejects the marriage proposal of the decent and worthy Tom and becomes the lover of a married blackguard Jim Blakeston. He treats her horribly and when she becomes pregnant with his child, his wife savagely beats her, causing a miscarriage and her eventual death. Maugham does not moralize but writes in an almost clinical manner (much of it is based on his experiences as a doctor among the poor in London). There is some humor in the dialect writing and in some of the scenes (the street dance where Liza is chased and finally \\"caught\\" by Blakeston, for example), but basically it's a pretty grim affair. The characterization of Liza is realistic and believable: she is not a total innocent and victim of evil, though she is forced to take an awful amount of abuse. Perhaps her rejection of Tom (twice!) stretches our credulity, but she is faithful to the no-good Jim right to the bitter end. It's a realistic slice-of-life portrait of life among the underclass."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"This short novel begins with humor and interesting street characters and ends with a tragedy. Life in Lambeth centers on the street where the entertainment is free, but rough on those who aren't tough enough. Liza is strong but has a weakness for a married man that leads to her undoing. Somerset Maugham developed his characters from his work as a physician in the poor neighborhoods where he practiced. His ability to capture the dialect of the street characters adds to the realism and worth of this work."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"W. Somerset MaughamLiza of LambethVintage Classics, Paperback, 2000.8vo. xx, 138 pp. Preface for the The Collected Edition, 1934 [v-xx].First published by T. Fisher Unwin in 1897.-------------------------------------------------'This is most certainly the last book of Somerset Maugham I would recommend to somebody who wants to read him for the first time. It is actually his first novel which Maugham wrote as a medical student in London's St. Thomas hospital. It was published in 1897 when the author was only 23 years old. No doubt it has nothing to do with his later works, even with his early books from the beginning of the XX century, let alone with his mature works written after Of Human Bondage published for the first time in 1915. (Interestingly, this novel was actually Maugham's second book; the first was a biography of Meyerbeer which was never published and apparently burned by the author.)''Liza of Lambeth'' has a certain charm with its simplicity of plot and characters. It is written in straightforward and convincingly realistic manner, I guess mainly because Maugham used his own experience as medical student visiting the suburbs and little imagination as he himself confesses in the preface to The Collected Edition the first volume of which is his first novel. By the way, this preface contains a lot a interesting biographical details about Maugham and is actually much more absorbing than the novel itself. Maugham rarely wrote of his works at all, let alone of his early attempts, and that's why a preface in which he discusses many of his youthful books, and why they didn't find place in The Collected Edition, is to be treasured. A most fascinating biographical essay of 15 pages, it is just wonderful that it is reprinted complete in the Vintage classics edition.Back to ''Liza'', despite a touching moment here and there, and the highly charged and brutal ending which is skilfully written, the novel has nothing remarkable to offer. Moreover, I myself at least find the dialogs in cockney very hard to read. In terms of characters' description and development ''Liza'' is a very far cry from Maugham's mature works. Were it not for his name on the cover, I would never guess that Maugham is indeed the author. As a matter of fact, incorrigible Maugham buff as I am, this is the only novel of Maugham I don't think I will ever re-read; or if I do, it will be solely for studying the development of his style, rather than for pleasure. Even Maugham's second novel, a historical one called ''The Making of a Saint'' (1898), wooden and immature and unrealistic as it is, is actually a great step forward compared to ''Liza''.I guess Maugham chose to include ''Liza'' in The Collected Edition mainly because of its historical importance. I think it is an interesting read mainly for Maugham fans who, knowing what heights he reached later, want to know where the great writer started. It is nothing short of miracle that the same person wrote ''Liza'' and, say, ''The Moon and Sixpence'' twenty years later. It is a well known fact that Maugham was not a born writer; he had to learn his craft at his own expense. Between ''Liza'' and his first masterpiece, Of Human Bondage he wrote no less than seven novels, seventeen short stories, one travel book and Heaven knows how many plays. In my very humble opinion, his indefatigable industry and constant striving for improve his writing is a valuable example how one should live one's life and, as Maugham himself usually put it, to make a pattern of it.But this is neither here nor there. Maugham's ''Liza'' remains, for me, a perfectly dispensable short piece of fiction which has but historical interest only. Perhaps I am too harsh, viewing the novel too much in the light of Maugham's later masterpieces, but since I can't be any other person than myself, I can't give more than one star to ''Liza'' either."},{"Title":"LIZA OF LAMBETH","review":"Another great book by Somerset.

I recommend it to anyone in any freelance business. It till help you become a success."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"With a little common sense you can skip reading Mr. Hollenbeck's book. Everytime I want more depth and detail, there is none, but in other ways the book is amazingly repitive and redundant."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"I havent read this book but I noticed something that I want to point out.It is supposed to be a newly released book but the reviews are from 2001 and earlier. Apparently they are not for this book or at least not this edition."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"This book by Cliff Hollenbeck is a real \\"find \\" for anyone desiring to make money with a camera. Most of us who go into the photography business sort of slide into it without much of an idea how to go about it. Most of us, when we reach a point where people are willing to pay for our photos, have some pretty abysmal business practices and stagger from crisis to crisis until we learn all lessons the hard way. We arrive at that point just before the evil eye of bankruptcy fixes on us.Hollenbeck's book covers all bases from writing a business plan to negotiating prices for use of photos. I suspect that anyone who follows his advice from day one \\"in the business,\\" will achieve far more success than they would by just winging it. Fortunately, all the business advice is served up with a wit and brevity that make learning it an enjoyable exercise. Knowing that he has been exceptionally successful in his own professional life lends weight to his suggestions. Hollenbeck and his wife are one of the most successful teams working in the area of Travel and Editorial photography. Their book \\"Great Travel Photography\\" is a great companion volume.Not to try covering the whole universe of making money with a camera, but there are two additional books I would recommend. Rohn Engh has a couple of books that would, with the Hollenbeck pair, form a great basic library for anyone interested in a photographic career. They are, \\"How to Sell and Resell Your Photos\\" and \\"Sell Photos.Com.\\"Thanks,Bill Halley"},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"An absolute necessity for the serious photographer considering the prospect of photography as a financial reward in addition to creative expression. Within the pages of this book, I found an inspiration as well as a reality check. Past the &quot;Glamour &amp; Glitter&quot; visions most associate with the title of &quot;Photographer&quot; lies the realization of the need for good sense business practices &amp; procedures. Too be a success at any business one must learn what it takes to conduct that profession &amp; do it well. That is just what this book will provide you. An arsenol of information from the basic requirements of technical knowlege to sales &amp; marketing yourself &amp; your images. Up-to-Date resources &amp; techniques. This is one of the most practical books on the business of photography I have purchased &amp; studied and recommend anyone interested in starting a career as a professional photographer should include this book within their reference library. Do yourself a favor, READ THIS BOOK IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SUCCEED! Mr. Hollenbeck...THANK YOU for OPENING MY EYES !"},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"...\\"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography\\" was not at all what I expected from the title. However don't get hung up on that! The subtitle on this fourth edition nails the book contents. \\"A Complete Photo Business Package for all Photographers\\" is a more apt title and this book does deliver that.This book is geared towards anyone who is thinking of getting into photography as a full-time business but knows nothing about this business. If you have been researching photography as a business for some time a lot of this material will be familiar. If you are successful in the photography business you are already applying the contents of this book. For the rest of you contemplating photography as a business this book may change your mind. However, if you seriously want to consider this field of business then read the book.If you want to go to the meat of \\"Big Bucks\\", marketing and selling your photos, start at chapter 9 and finish the book out. More importantly though not as exciting to read (Lawyers, IRS and CPAs! Oh my!), the first part of the book covers the back-end of the business. Cliff Hollenbeck, like most photographers, is not a CPA nor a Lawyer. He's not a Marketing Agent nor a Stock Agent. He's a successful photographer! Therefore you're not going to find much depth on these subjects, but the subjects are covered and Cliff tells you where to find the expertise.If I were to summarize \\"Big Bucks\\" in one line it would be - Familiarize yourself with the whole business, concentrate on producing images and your creativity, and leave the business side to the experts."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"We'll have to wait and see if the recession of 2008-2009 changes all the paradigms of marketing and selling photography. None of us know that yet. But this book, published in 2007 delivers straightforward advice that can be useful to professional photographers at every level.Here's the deal: This is the first book I've seen from Amherst Media that isn't chocked full of color photographs. In fact there's not a photo in the entire book and that's quite okay with me. It leaves more space for a full set of business forms in the back and pages crammed full of advice on how to undertake doing the business side of photography.With this book and a few solid books on technique you should be able to test the waters of the photography industry.Cliff is from the advertising and editorial side so much of the book's content is aimed at these markets. The book is less useful to senior shooters and wedding shooters.All in all, a good reference guide for people running photo businesses for advertising clients."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"I found &quot;Big Bucks...&quot; to be a practical and straight forward lesson in how to maximize your opportunities as a photographer. The key theme that I was left with was as a photographer, I am not taking pictures as much as selling pictures. This and the fact that basic business skills are what make or break a photographer is hammered into the reader. I loved Cliff's way of proving a point through a real life example or story.All photographers should read this book!"},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"I'm a professional photographer and \\"Big Bucks\\" has helped me stay in the game. I keep it on my desk as a reference tool, a reminder of what I must do to make money in an industry that is constantly changing. Cliff Hollenbeck's experiences are an inspiration to me and I strive to capture his success.A must read for anyone serious about a photography career."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"As a professional photographer Cliff Hollenbeck\\"s Big Bucks book was instrumental in refocusing my career. While so many people focus on the photographs, Cliff's book was about an even more critical aspect of successful photography, the business of photography. He gives you a step by step outline if you want to sell your photographs for a PROFIT. He covers Business administration, the all important business plan, covering your butt in regards to liability and copyright and provides the forms that photo buyers expect i.e. model releases and delivery memos. His latest version covers the important aspects of using a computer in a modern photography business. As marketing is critical if you want customers, he covers all the options available today. If you have someone who has expressed they want to work as a professional photographer give them this book first and they may have a chance in this highly competitive field."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"I'm sure this title sounded good, as he sat at a bar with his photo-buddies, but it really does a dis-service to the content of the book. Once past the title the book contains many valuable truths about the photography world and well worth the price for would-be, arm chair, and current professional photographers."},{"Title":"Big Bucks Selling Your Photography","review":"This book is an excellent tool for photographers looking for an edge to accelerate there business. Strategies for a business plan along with legal aspects of their business and tax filing are all covered.

As an expert in the area of travel photography, the author's inside experience provides valuable insight to the novice.As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is practical and straight-forward. It is an invaluable resource for all photographers"},{"Title":"The golden book encyclopedia","review":"I grew up with this classic 16 volume children's encyclopedia. I remember sitting for hours as a child reading through volume after volume of the 1959 edition. The articles were only written for grade school age children and ranged from a quarter of a page to a couple of pages in length (aardvark to zoos.) The real strength however were the many, many full color illustrations- the bright glossy \\"shadow box\\" covers were especially beautiful. Oh yes, there was a full index of subjects in the last volume.While the information may be quite dated by today's standards the set still serves as a fascinating time capsule into the world of the 1950's. I don't know of many baby boomers who don't remember these books. Not many homes could afford a set of Britannicas, but because this set was sold a volume at a time in supermarkets a great many homes could afford the Golden Book."},{"Title":"Psalms 73-150 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"This has been considered one the best and most useful commentaries on Psalms for decades. Kidner is a genuine scholar, and he knows the difference between significant detail and meaningless trivia. He makes great choices in choosing how far to pursue a line of interpretation. His comments are succinct, scholary, and easy to understand. You do not need Hebrew to read this, and textual/grammatical issues are generally addressed in the footnotes.The average comment length per psalm is about 5 small pages, so it is not bloated but it is concise and thorough for the student, pastor, and layman. Can be used in group Bible study. This is a \\"hands on\\" work.He writes from a conservative evangelical position (which I appreciate), but he sees the church as fulfilling the promises made to Israel (I disagree with him on this). Despite my difference, I heartily recommend this as perhaps the best all-around commentary on Psalms. If you must only get one, this might be it. You can't go wrong with this one.You will probably want to buy both volumes."},{"Title":"Psalms 73-150 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"I have owned this fine book for almost 30 years. I just started looking at it again and thought I should write a review. At one time I spent over 6 months outlining all 150 of the Psalms. These 2 books were the main sources I used.Derek Kidner's 2 small books are incredibly full of insight. My version of these 2 books has 492 pages total. So maybe they are not so small as I think they are. I have spent hours reading and studying from these 2 books. I don't know of any author who can pack so much thought into so few words. These 2 books are great for sermon preparation and / or Sunday School class preparation. He gives you the big picture so well and helps you to see the big picture. He keeps you focused on what the Psalmist is saying. He is very good at giving meaning to particular words - the important words. And that so often is the key to interpretation of the Psalm. One way he does this is by showing you how the same words are used in other parts of the Bible. You learn about the Psalm and other parts of the Bible as well.These books are fine for reading, but I find them best to be read, studied, and re-read as I try to grasp the meaning of the Psalm. I find these 2 books on Psalms to be one of the first I go to when I want to study and gain insight into the Psalms. Your mind is filled with ideas and thoughts as you ponder the meaning of what the Psalmist is saying.Definitely, the best buy for the money."},{"Title":"Psalms 73-150 (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"Kidner's Tyndale series commentaries on the Psalms (in two volumes) and Proverbs combine even-handed scholarship with devotional insight.

Lord Royce Westmoreland, conocido por todos como \\"El Lobo\\" es el m&aacute;s legendario y temible soldado de todo Inglaterra. Hombres, mujeres y ni&ntilde;os tiemblan ante su sola presencia. Como consecuencia de una vida llena de guerras y de dirigir hombres su vida es increiblemente solitaria y por eso decide retirarse del ejercito. Pero antes debe de completar una &uacute;ltima misi&oacute;n: someter al conde de Merrick, padre de Jenny y uno de los principales incitadores escoceses. Lo que no esperaba era que su hermanos se topase con Jenny y Brenna en el convento y las tomase como rehenes. Ninguno se esperaba que dos jovenes vestidas de monjas pudiesen causar tantos estragos en el endurecido ejercito ingl&eacute;s y mucho menos que una atracci&oacute;n irresistible comenzase a surgir y que esa atracci&oacute;n se convirtiese en un asunto de Estado."},{"Title":"Word movies","review":"There are many interesting poems in this book,and for Harfford fans,it is especially interesting how some of these poems eventually became the lyrics to some of John's better songs.
