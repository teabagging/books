Yet, the stoic people of the Yorkshire Dales keep their humor, and their stiff upper lips in a trying time.

There he is the assistant of Mr. Seigfried Farnon. They live at the Skedale House with Mrs. Hall and Tristan, who is seigfried's little lazy brother. At Shropshire, Mr. Herriot deals with the problems of the farmers at the area with their livestock and other domestic animals. Also at Dowrby, Mr. Herriot falls in love with Helen Aiderson. Later they become married and live a wonderful life.The reason that I read this book was because our teacher gave us the assignment of doing a report on this book, and I thought that this would be a good non-fiction book to use on my book-reports. I also choose this book because this is the biggest book in the class and I can read a lot.One of my favorite scenes in the book is the times when Siegfried goes berzerck and he sacks Tristan over and over again without ever remembering once what he had just done and still wakes up the next morning seeing Tristan eating breakfast with him and doesn't wonder why is my brother still here? I think this is weird and I believe Siegfried has problems and should get professional hep because at some scenes in the book, he really freaks me out."},{"Title":"The Nameless","review":"THE NAMELESS is perhaps the closest thing to a perfect horror novel I've read.The way I see it, the horror novel is a tough medium to do good work in. Part of the problem is that the novel format tends to encourage excess: excessive, clumsy writing; excessive elaboration; and excessive explanation. This excess works against a horror story, because the more we know and understand the horror, the less fearsome it is--the dread of the unknown, that gaping abyss in our awareness within which all our worst, most irrational fears take root, is a fundamental component of terror. Unfortunately, works that engage the reader's &quot;dread of the unknown&quot; are few and far between in these days of generic horrors, when formula plots and plain, nuance-free writing sell well, and exaggerated shocks are the closest things to true scares most writers strive for.So thank goodness we have writers like Ramsey Campbell, and novels like THE NAMELESS.Almost two decades after I first read it, THE NAMELESS is still one of the most frightening, perfectly constructed horror novels I've ever read; a gripping tale full of mystery, human drama, and shadowy spine-chilling terror provoked by horrors known and unknown. For sheer scare power, THE NAMELESS ranks somewhere near Campbell's best works, novels such as INCARNATE and THE INFLUENCE, and many of his great short stories.The story is the stuff of nightmare, a parent's uncontrollable nightmare worse than anything a conventional thriller could offer, growing darker, more horrific and bizarre as it progresses. It seemed young widow Barbara Waugh suffered a mother's worst nightmare when she learned her 4-year-old only child, Angela, had been kidnapped. This trauma was compounded soon afterwards by the discovery of a little girl's savaged corpse, mutilated beyond any hopes of identification yet clad in Angela's clothes, which led Barbara and the authorities to believe Angela had been brutally murdered. (As you'd expect, Campbell imparts these tragic scenes with an exquisite, mature sensitivity, unsullied by the mawkishness and false sweetness of sentimentality.) Then, nine years later, just after Barbara had come to terms with her grief, she receives a mysterious phone call at her office: A voice like a young girl's repeatedly calls her &quot;Mummy&quot;. And it soon becomes clear that her nightmare is only just beginning.As it turns out, Angela is still alive, and she's in the hands of a ghastly cult: an arcane, nomadic group made up of people who've abandoned their names and their individual identities. Even worse, these nameless, faceless conspirators are in thralldom to some terrifying supernatural force, capable of manipulating physical objects, be they living, dead, or inanimate, like obscene puppets. As one character explains with chilling simplicity, &quot;The bad got into things and made them move.&quot;It's testimony of Campbell's finely-honed storyteller's instincts that he handles the supernatural aspect of THE NAMELESS in an allusive manner, keeping it a mystery that hovers darkly in the wings; never diminishing its persistent unspoken menace by spelling it out in obvious terms or by allowing it to dominate the story. This obscurely sinister supernatural threat, this unknown terror, lends the scariest scenes in the book their disturbing power.With his inimitable style, Campbell draws readers into the heads of his characters, and so we experience the terror along with them. This technique works to remarkable effect in THE NAMELESS--we follow the protagonists around the dark decaying interiors of empty houses abandoned by the cult, looking for clues as the surroundings stir with silent threat. At times the terror is almost claustrophobic; the dread of the unknown becomes palpable. And we're with Barbara every nerve-jangling step of the way, right up to the story's devastating conclusion.But the real triumph of THE NAMELESS is not just that it's a very scary book, a dark horror tale that makes THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT look like pleasant holiday footage. Rather, it is that in this book Campbell combines scary supernatural horror and a compelling tale of personal tragedy and obsession even more successfully than he did in his superb earlier novels THE DOLL WHO ATE HIS MOTHER and THE PARASITE. Readers and horror fans alike are encouraged to seek out and read THE NAMELESS prior to seeing its recent Spanish film adaptation, LOS SIN NOMBRE. By all accounts, the film bears only passing resemblance to the book, and lacks both its depth of character and its supernatural terrors."},{"Title":"The Nameless","review":"Effectively scary can only describe this supernatural tale of a woman's quest to find her supposedly murdered daughter which leads her into a cult activity that may or may not exist. Ramsey Campbell succeeds in topping himself with this one. Everything about THE NAMELESS is highly impressive: from its multi-dimensional protagonist to its perfect plot pace, to its many edge-of-your-seat atmospheric moments. His prose is as gripping as the dark presence looming over the heroine. The ability with which he uses his narrative is reason enough to pick this one up. One word, one sentence, says so much. THE NAMELESS should definitely be on top of everyone's reading pile.-----Martin Boucher"},{"Title":"The Nameless","review":"I had high hopes for this novel. Ramsey Campbell, a master of psychological horror, seemed poised to add some uncharacteristically tangible frights and perhaps even it a bit of good old-fashioned gore to this particular work of fiction. The concept is far from original-cult activity at its most disturbing-but I anxiously awaited the results of the author's decision to really get his hands dirty this time. The book crawled along in places, but intermittent moments of foreboding kept my optimism intact as I continued my quest to reach what I felt would be the shocking conclusion. Sadly, all of this great buildup essentially came to naught in the form of a sudden, anticlimactic, depressingly disappointing ending. This novel proves that where there's smoke, there is not in fact always fire. I actually felt cheated by the seeming rush job of an ending here, and I can only look back with regret at the high hopes I associated with this book as I made my way through it. After the complete absence of tension or excitement at the end, one is left with a number of unanswered questions and a small set of characters who apparently served no purpose whatsoever in the narrative. It is as if the author suddenly decided at the last minute that he just didn't care anymore.Perhaps the term \\"the nameless\\" makes you think of unimaginable entities out of space and time with revoltingly indescribable features; it certainly brought a Lovecraftian connotation to my mind initially. In terms of this novel, though, the Nameless are a cult who forego all earthly experience (such as names) in service to their cause. It remains unclear, but there goal seems to consist of gaining power for themselves and presumably opening the door for something evil, I suppose, to manifest itself. All I really know is that they were obsessed with torturing their victims and offering them up as sacrifices to nefarious agents (or so we are told but never really shown). There is some type of nonhuman agent associated with them, but I never really learned what it was or why Campbell thought it needed to be included in the first place. This cult had kidnapped Barbara Waugh's beloved three-year-old daughter, leaving behind an unrecognizable dead body which was naturally determined to be that of a murdered young Angela. Nine years later, Barbara suddenly begins to receive mysterious phone calls from someone purporting to be her long-dead daughter. Desperate to find out the truth and to rescue her daughter if she is in fact still alive, the distraught mother embarks on a frantic search for the group's whereabouts, assisted by her boyfriend Ted and a young reporter looking for her big break. They pick up rather easily on the trail of the cult and seem to always be a few days behind it as it moves around. But just who is chasing whom here? The Nameless have designs on Barbara herself, and they know that her obsession with finding her lost daughter will lead her to them. Some but by no means all of my own questions about Angela's real story are answered in the end, but they are less than satisfying.Ramsey Campbell is certainly a talented author, but he seems to have misfired on this comparatively early effort. He never goes as far as the storyline would seemingly require him to go here, and this retreat from the abyss he has spent so much time constructing damages the novel's effectiveness and appeal a great deal."},{"Title":"The Nameless","review":"Ramsey Campbell is what you might call \\"Horror's best kept secret\\" ['cept, there was never any INTENTION to keep him secret!], or a \\"horror writer's horror writer\\" [if you check out the back covers of his books, you find the likes of Clive Barker, Stephen King, and Peter Straub all but falling over themselves, trying to out-do each other in praising him; a phenom.

However, when you get to the end of the book you are left wanting more as the author does not offer enough details about the cult or about the powers that Angela is supposed to have or who was the girl that they shot so as to make Barbara believe it was her daughter and how and why Arthur keeps showing to Angela and Barbara.I thought Ted's character deserved a little bit more development too. I found myself curious to know more about his personality and his motives since he has such a relevant role in the story. Also, it appears to me that some things are mentioned in the book just for the sake of being there as they lead to nothing and in the end there was no purpose to them whatsoever.All in all I found this book to be just ok."},{"Title":"The Nameless","review":"First let me say that you should ignore the rubes who have bashed this book for a reason i simply can't fathom. It's obvious that they have no idea what makes a horror novel great.Okay let's discuss the story. It starts off with the abduction of a woman's child and than her apparent murder. Years later the mother of the girl recieve's a phone call from a girl saying that she's her murdered child. It all picks up pace after that.Later in the book we learn about a cult that's members have no names (hence the title). The girl says she is living with them or that they are keeping her prisoner and only her mother can help rescue her. The cult worship some force or being that reminds me of one of H.P. Lovecraft's Old One's or nameless terrors. I can't reveal much more about the story because i do not want to ruin it for those who have not read it yet.This book starts alittle slow and than like a cannon blast it explode's never leaving the reader time to catch his or her breath. The horrible deeds of the cult will shock and disturb you a great deal and if they don't your a sick person. This book is downright scary because of Campbell's ability to scare the living daylights out of us with his descriptions of the enviorments and the shadows and things half glimpsed before all goes dark.

RC is very goodat describing things, so good infact that most of the Namelessdescribes the countryside, housesetc and maybe about a 1/5th ofthe book has dialogue oradvancement of the plot. As StephenKing put it in In Writing, descriptionis a tool that needs to be usedappropriately. RC seems to wantto describe everything not justthe important or significant thingsand in this book he doesn'tmove very much beyond doing exactlythat.So if you like endless descriptions,a plot that hardly goes anywhere(except maybe in circles) than thisis your book.But if you want a good horror novelDON'T buy this book and don'twaste your time reading it thinkingthat maybe in the next page- or thenext- or the next etc, that somethingmight happen and that you mightactually be rewarded forplodding your way through TheNumbing!

Many factors, both technological and cultural, have influenced the advances in aircraft construction. Wings of Wood, Wings of Metal presents the technological history of aircraft structures from the start of World War I to the end of World War II. The book focuses on the shift from wood to metal as the dominant material of choice. Several factors are presented which influence this shift including public perception and the symbolic relationship between technological progress and metals.Schatzberg begins by identifying a connection between metals and progress in the American culture during the first half of the 20th century. With the development of high strength aluminum alloys during World War I, the rise of the all metal aircraft begins. Wood remains dominant until the crash of a wooden airliner kills Notre Dame football coach Knute Rockne in 1931. This highly publicized incident is sighted as the most significant cultural event shifting public confidence in favor of metal aircraft construction.By the start of World War II, metal has become the material of choice for aircraft structures. The author examines anomalies to this dominance, specifically the British Mosquito bomber/inceptor and Howard Hughes's flying boat, the Spruce Goose. In closing the author examines the use of composites in today's advanced aircraft and correctly notes that these composite materials are more like wood than metal.Although Schatzberg presents several valid arguments in support of his premise, his tone toward metal is adversarial if not bitter. All arguments for metal construction are quickly dismissed as \\"engineering rhetoric.\\" With regards to metal, any project less than 100% successful is a complete failure. With regards to wood, any project somewhat successful is a glorious achievement is the face of tremendous odds. Since Schatzberg treats much of the scientific data which could justify an argument for either the use of wood or metal as \\"engineering rhetoric,\\" a reliance is placed on the opinions and perceptions of people (sometimes disgruntled employees) involved in aviation projects as revealed in letters and semi-technical reports.Discussions of aircraft structural development focus on government and military funded projects. Many successful wooden aircraft designs developed in the 1920's and 1930's are never discussed, specifically those developed by independent custom airplane builders for air-races and aerobatics.When Schatzberg identifies the British Mosquito and Howard Hughes's Spruce Goose as wooden aircraft, he is not entirely correct. These aircraft are manufactured from plywood which in reality is an engineered composite utilizing wood. The author should rather identify these two aircraft as the forerunners of today's advanced composite aircraft.Without a doubt, Wings of Wood, Wings of Metal has been meticulously researched and presents little known information related to the development of aircraft structures. Although very little quantitative information is presented, this book offers unique insights into the perceptions and personalities of the individuals who built the aviation industry in the United States."},{"Title":"Wings of Wood, Wings of Metal","review":"Who can deny the passionate reading of this fabulous text, where his author not only defines a cultural system, but literally invites you to join him along this anthological epic of the aircraft, that represents not only an important breakthrough respect all the previous references; it's besides another important landmark in the cultural history of technology, where the Western hemisphere once more makes the difference that makes the difference."},{"Title":"Wings of Wood, Wings of Metal","review":"This book is as thorough history of how metal airplanes took over from wood airplanes after WWI. There is a lot of detailed information that tells how metal was an inferior product that took over 20 years to equal the strength & performance of existing airplanes built of wood. The transition was based on social pressures, not scientific superiority. This book is a well footnoted historical account of the problems and costs of the transition."},{"Title":"Wings of Wood, Wings of Metal","review":"This is a classic example of the revisionist impulse gone bananas. The author goes to great lengths to demonstrate that people made a decision to pursue all-metal aircraft on a largely gut-feel notion that metal was good, and wood was bad. What he misses is the reality that wood really WAS bad...Ask Knute Rockne, killed when a Fokker trimotor shed its wings over the midwest (an event that helped lead to the dominance of Douglas and--you guessed it--all-metal transports in the mid-to-late 1930's. Or ask any of a number of WW-I German fighter pilots killed by inflight breakup of their Fokker triplanes or the Fokker E V (D VIII fighter). Or ask the RAF trying to operate the Mosquito (all wood, therefore a plane the author should love) in Southeast Asia. There is a lot of good information in this book, but nothing that would serve to overturn the conventional wisdom that the decision to replace wooden aircraft with metal ones was wise, prudent, and undertaken not a moment too soon."},{"Title":"The Homosexualization of America","review":"Nobody has yet reviewed Altman's book, probably because nobody reads it anymore. Since this book was published in the 1980s, much has changed. The value of this book today is to provide perspective. The book presents a snapshot of the same-sex movement then, which, when compared to a snapshot today, permits us a rough measure of change. Altman is an Australian who spent much time in the United States and also Europe and other parts of the world, so his analysis does have breadth. Altman attempts also to address same-sex issues among women, but he frequently confesses that he is not an expert in that area. He includes a chapter about the phenomena of sado-masochism and pedophilia, and how they have become linked, erroneously he believes, with same-sex relationships. There is also an interesting chapter on same-sex \\"culture,\\" going back to the beginnings of history.Altman's reasoning does not always seem to be real tight and to the point. He seems to wander around quite a bit with extraneous citations and data, not actually a scientific analysis but more of a journalistic argument. This, however, makes the book more interesting reading than a dry treatise, and Altman is certainly not afraid to reference his own experiences, some of which are pretty funny.This book may have some currency today for the perspective it provides on same-sex history.

This series, officially licensed by Lucasfilm, is inspired by the Indiana Jones character who first appeared in 1981 with the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rob MacGregor authored the first six books including The Seven Veils. Martin Caidin wrote the seventh and eighth books, and Max McCoy wrote the last four.The events of this book take place in 1925 and 1926. The book opens with an excerpt from the journal of Colonel Percy Fawcett who explored the Brazilian jungles in an attempt to find a mysterious lost city named Z. This lost city was believed to be established by European Celts who traveled to the Americas long before Columbus. Fawcett's journal finds its way to Indy via Marcus Brody. Prodded by Brody, Indy (along with Deirdre Campbell, who first appeared in The Dance of the Giants) decides to go look for Fawcett who has not been heard from in some time. Of course, not everyone wants Fawcett to be found-nor Indy to come back alive.I did like this book as it was a good combination of fact and fiction. I learned about Rio de Janeiro, Sugarloaf, Carnival, and Colonel Percy Fawcett. The characters of Indy and Deirdre have been given time to develop.

The search for Fawcett was what drew me to the book in the first place. I recently read David Grann's new book, The Lost City of Z. It covers Fawcett's explorations in South America and other places and was an extremely intriguing book.Seven Veils is entertaining, mainly because it is Indiana Jones. The story is fairly far fetched, but Indy's adventures will keep your attention."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"I read the book \\"The Lost City of Z\\" by David Grann. He has the advantage of Rob MacGregor of writing that book and being able to referencee \\"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils' but he shouldn't have. Grann's account is based on reality and tale checking, MacGregor is a tale of Indiana Jones, not Percy Fawcett. I am a fan of Indiana Jones and \\"The Lost City of Z\\" was so fascinating I could hardly wait to get my copy. I have only seen two Indiana Jones films, \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"The Temple of Doom\\" but they influence me as to how stories about him are to be seen. I read the books as though I were watching a movie, this gives me a frame of reference that is quite a departure from reality and stops me from criticizing events in the story that stretch or even go beyond my limits of credibility. Film normally takes about an hour and a half to cover days, weeks, even years so there is little time to build up character, to set up backgrounds,to explain actions, plot is the main event and action is important, not so much dialogue and monologue is almost non-existant.Conseqently as I read \\"The Seven Veils\\" I followed the book with a mind's eyeview of the actions as a movie. Backstory in the book was a break, better than an ordinary movie, and description or explanation of actions helped to round out the action. Special effects took care of all paranormal events and magic was disregarded. The time was mid 1920's with Brazil highly undeveloped and mysterious. Fawcett was a famous explorer, noted for his expeditions into Brazil so his final expedition, the search for a lost city of rumoured ancient Western European founding attracted greeat attention and his failure to reappear led to many searches for him. Indiana Jones is roped into going on a search for him but he is waylaid several times before he even becomes fully invlolved. As he approaches the lost city his adversaries become bolder and finally interrupt him in person. Before this happens a man and woman from the lost city join them and promise to free Fawcett and bring him to Jones, Jones is not to see the city. Jones boss shows up, he is the one trying to keep Indiana from freeing Fawcett and bringing him back to civilization. The inhabitants of the lost city believe in freedom but hold Jones and his wife, Deirdre as captives, or prisoners, The city needs new blood, they are too interbred to reproduce strongly. Deirdre and Indy will serve as progenitors for five years before they are let go free. Fawcett is already serving as such. The characters Dr. Bernard hired to stop Indy show up at the pilot's ranch but are killed by pilot maneuvers as they all try to fly to the lost city. The group does not fly into the city, they stop outside it so the outsiders will not see the city. But misadventure strikes, a native tribe shows up and forces Jones and his wife to go to the lost city. Fawcett himself frees Indy and Deirdre. He becomes the pilot but the plane crashes and Jones is called back from the dead to continue his adventures. Now is time to move on to the next book in the series.tags:Indiana jones, brazil, lost city, native tribes, percy fawcett"},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"Though it's not a brilliant piece of literary prose, the Seven Veils is a fun read. Author Rob MacGregor has carefully included the important ingredients of Indydom. The book begins with the typical crisis involving booby-trapped entrances to lost grave sites. \\"Tikal, Guatemala-March 7, 1926. The torchlight flickered in the close quarters. The tunnel was tight, the air choked with dust and the dank smell of earth. After two days of slowing removing one stone after another....a hole the size of his arm now opened into a dark chamber inside the pyramid.\\" See what I mean? You're hooked right away just like the movies.MacGregor continues to combine the true mysteries of history with a liberal sprinkling of fantasy. There is a prologue containing an excerpt from the diary of real-life British explorer Colonel Percy Fawcett who disappeared searching for the legendary lost city of Z. His mystery forms the basis of the Seven Veils book and makes you want to read more about what could have happened to Fawcett in the Brazilian jungle. The fantasy part of the book is pretty fantastic. While searching for the colonel and the city of Z, Indy is captured by a mystical tribe who can control his mind. These blue-eyed tribesmen seem descended from the druids and live in a world where reality is blurred by dreams. Of course the exciting escape involves poisonous blow darts, jumping into river rapids, and cannibals.It is not great literature - but it doesn't pretend to be so all is forgiven. I gave this as a gift to an adventurous son who travels to Tikal for research purposes and he will enjoy reading it on his next plane ride down."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"In this adventure Indy is sent off to South America to find an English explorer who has vanished in the Amazon while searching for a lost tribe. He takes Deirdre along with him, marrying her on the way. Once in Rio they meet with local hostiles who hound them all the way into the jungle where things get murky and needlessly complicated with too many 'dreaming' twists as the lost tribe mess with Indy's mind.Yawn! I understand that Rob MacGregor is writing to demand and deadlines here rather than from the heart, but come on! The only impressive thing about this book is MacGregor's research into Celtic tribes. Merlin from the previous book turns up again, would you believe. It's probably all nonsense (I ain't an archaeologist) but it interesting theory nonetheless and it ties in nicely with the previous book (Note: Read these order).Hardcore Indy fans should check it out. Casual readers would be better off looking elsewhere for their fix of pulp."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":". . . the plot about the dreaming city was just too weird and hard to work. There were some good parts, some of the exciting adventure you would expect to see in one of the novels (along with a good dash of romance as well) but for me the book just didn't work that well. Now, if Indy had been looking for the lost tomb of Alexander the Great ..."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"Start the book with a classic Indy beginning, move to the setup at the museum/college, then get underway. It starts promising, in which Brody is running an exhibit which promotes possible pre-Columbian travels to the Americas which influenced the native cultures. More than just vikings, but ptoltecs, chines, and even celtic druids. Indy is being sent to South America in search of lost explorer Percy Fawcett. Fawcett had been in Sout America looking for the Lost City of Z, a possible Celtic settled city from ages before Columbus' voyage.Hmmm... Indy, lost city... look for an influencial explorer... legends of outside cultural influences... sound good, but that's about the end of it. Again we have to put up with Deidre, whom Indy marries on the boat trip. Then comes points that the city isn't necessarily lost but rather is 'veiled' from sight. So we got a civilization that can 'turn invisible'. I can even accept that with clever manipulation of camouflage but just mind wiping and disappearing is almost too much. The story had promise but the delivery lacked. Macgregor continues to forcefully tie one book into the other and it seems too forced. Delphi to Stonehenge to Celtic civilizations in the Amazon. Not a strong book and the dreaming/reality sequences were rather messy."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"Was Indiana Jones ever married? This book will give you the answer to that question. The storyline to this book is a little far fetched. I enjoyed the continuing love story between Indy and the heroine introduced in last book (Deidre Campbell from Dance of the Giants) more than I did the actual story. Seven Veils didn't quite hold my attention like the first two books did, but it is fun reading and by no means is it a bad book."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"The whole point of the book, searching for the lost city in South America, is definitely one worthy of Indiana Jones. However, the book just wasn't written with enough adventure to satisfy me. This is the ninth Indy book I've read, and I must say that I like the way MacGreggor Links Stonehenge, the Omphalos, And the lost city."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"I understand that with any successful franchise, i.e. star wars, star trek, Indiana Jones, you will get 50+ books from a multitude of authors. Each one will bring their distinctive writing style, and ideas to the character, and try and produce a good book. Sometimes they are successful, and you can actually picture these characters in the story, based on their movies, and you will get a feeling like Indiana Jones actually had that adventure. When I read an Indiana Jones book, I want to picture the crack of the whip, the smart ass grin, and dangerous happenstances he always finds himself in. If you are a fan of the movies, these types of books are almost surely going to disappoint, but like a sucker, I read them anyway, because I enjoy the character, (movies), so much. This book did not stay true to the Indiana Jones character whatsoever, and should be avoided like a piece of bad fruit. I did think it was interesting though, that the picture of the author on the back cover looks like Belloq from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Maybe it is, in a sense, Belloq coming back to smear Indiana Jones in an awful book, that has our hero getting married, and following his wife around like a puppy. This is an imposter Indy, and in no way resembles the one we know and love. The author has our hero getting outsmarted, and outclassed at every turn. He is a bumbling archaeologist, who is love sick, and pathetic. We are also treated to some mumbo jumbo religion from nowhere Africa, which takes up way too many pages. I realize every one of the movies has a supernatural element to it, and that this is always intregal to the story, but the author of this book takes up like, 3/4 of the book with information on it, rituals in detail, and all kinds of goofy dreamlike trances, gods(lower case), and meditations...(sigh). Basically this book was a complete waste of time. I will keep reading, though, and hope to find the Indiana Jones I loved as a kid in one of these books."},{"Title":"Indiana Jones and the Seven Veils","review":"Okay this book started well, Just one mythological thing(the city)he didn't take it too far(kept it in line with the temple of doom) AND THEN HE PUTS MERLIN IN THE BOOK!

Too bad man, Too bad!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"The title to this review may be lame but the sentiment is not. This book is still incredibly relevant.The story of a futuristic society that controls its inhabitants by squelishing free thought is told through the eyes of the fireman (Montag), whose desire for truth is at odds with his pre-determined role to destroy those desires by burning books. .It is surprising that a book written over 50 years ago still has such startling parallels today. From the entertainment consisting of reality shows (taken to the next level), to the misinformation of the government, to the use of fear to control behavior; it is almost creepy how some of Bradbury's commentary on how we can be controlled is sharply visible in our world today.The story has a good element of suspense and the characters are fascinating. My favorite (of course) is Clarisse, the free spirit and non-conformist that is a risk to the government and the catalyst for Montag's awakening. Her behavior and attitude contrasts starkly against Montag's wife Mildred, who walks around in a daze of drugs and television. Between these two opposite women walks Montag, who connects us to these two differing existences, and must make his own choice about what footprint he wants to leave behind.The book still plays very well today as an adventure story (I was reminded of the Running Man during Montag's escape), but it is also still a strong social commentary on what could be...or is?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book is called Fahrenheit 451 and is by Ray Bradbury. This book is internationally acclaimed with more than five million copies in print. Fahrenheit 451 takes place some time in the future. Many things have changed since modern time. The speed limit is around 100. The billboards are really long, so people can see them as they drive by. Buildings were fireproof. Television shows are a couple of minutes long. Being a pedestrian was illegal. Books are illegal to read. Since buildings are fireproof, the Firemen do not have to save buildings and the people inside them. Instead of that, their jobs were to find book, and burn them. The main character, Guy Montag, was a fireman. He loved his job, and enjoyed burning books. He was married to his wife, and didn't seem to love her at all. Everything was fine, until he met this strange girl, who told him about how the past the houses weren't fireproof, and firemen used to stop flames. Then he found himself smuggling books into his house. With the help of his friend, Faber, he learns more about these books. Then he knows what to do. Faber is a professor who Montag caught reading a book. Faber was really scared of Montag because the thought Montag would turn him in. Later Faber and Montag became close friends.The books in this book were connected to drugs today. No one is allowed to read book, but people do anyways. Just like drugs, some drugs are illegal, but people still use these illegal drugs. The firemen are like policemen. They look around for people using illegal drugs, and arrest them. The firemen do the same, after they burn all the books. This book is kind of similar to The Matrix. In both of them, there are some people who are rising up against the suppressor. In this book it is the government. In The Matrix it isThe machines.The only reason I picked this book up was because I needed something to read for English class. I wouldn't recommend this book as something you would buy, if you want to read it just check it out of a library. I liked the plot of this book. It was interesting how so many illegal things are inconvenient and seems like there is no reason for it at all. I disliked the figurative language. Sometimes I couldn't tell if they were speaking literally or just figuratively. I also didn't like how the book would be really confusing unless you put some thought into it, and reread it a couple of times. I didn't think this book was very good for reading for fun. It is a good book for if you have to read, and you don't know what to read. I would give this book 3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Farenheit 451 is a book about a guy named montag. He is a firefighter in the distant future. The rules have changed since back in 2007, now firefighters don't put out fires they find any books that people read and burn them with kerosene. They sometimes even kill people.My favorite part of the book was when they burnt down the house with the lady in it. It was my favorite because the lady yelled and she lit the kerosene and killed herself. She did that because she didn't want her books gone. She wouldn't be able to live like that if her books were gone and not her.This book was one of the best books ive ever read. If you like that kind of book than you will like it. Ray Bradbury is an excellent writer that book is good.montag is a good guy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote this book, Fahrenheit 451. It talks of a fictional world of rules and restrictions. Laws ban learning, reading, and diversity. Intense firemen run the world that start fires instead of stop them. Censorship and brainwashing are ordinary things to see in the daily life of the people of this fiction.Ray Bradbury is not famous for any other book besides Fahrenheit 451. This book was written about fifty-five years ago, about five years after the end of World War II. This was a time of tensions between America and Russia. The last war ended with the deadliest blast known to man, and now to rival powers were plotting to use that type of bomb against each other. Fear of the other nation kept the two nations in check but a nuclear war was not out of the reach of reality at that time.This book shows a world that only appears in the nightmares. At first glance, this world looks like a utopia, everyone is smiling, and nobody is angry. Everybody has a job and there is no crime. But when the layers of the society are pulled back, the world is content but they are not happy. The whole story starts when the main character is asked if he is happy. He comes to the realization that he is not and he searches to find happiness, which turns into a fight against the society.I believe book excellently show the fear of the people that lived during Bradbury time. The fear that the world would turn into a society filled with over controlled life styles and fear and censorship. Through the book, Bradbury shows his concerns for the future and what a possible outcome could have been. His fear of nuclear war and the development society that destroys humanity is shown in the book.I like how Bradbury used great descriptions in the book and those alone are worth reading the book. The suspense is only topped by the action at the end that it leads up to. It is a thrill to read because of how the plot sets up the climax using suspense. It was interesting to see the layers of that society pulled back and dissected through the eyes of Bradbury. Seeing how this society was formed and how that world became what it was mind-boggling. The book puts you into the story, and takes you through a world that is disturbing, but the most disturbing part of it is that if a few different events occurred or will occur, we could be living in a society just like the one in the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Fahrenheit 451, one of the worst books i have ever read in my life. I disliked this book so much i didn't even want to finish reading it but sadly I was forced to by my English teacher if I wanted to pass the class. Some people may disagree with me but to me the book isn't even worth reading.First of all the book gets confusing with all of the strange ways that they act. It is kind of like a really, really, really bad movie with an inexperienced actors. You know, like those really really old black and white movies. Second, the book jumps from one thing to another. Most of the time you don't even know what is going on. Then all of it gets mixed up in your head. third, the book is about people burning books. How stupid is that. Also, everyone acts crazy. Especially the teenagers. Teens might be bad but not that bad. I have never seen one act like they do in this novel.I think the author's purpose was to inform the reader that sometimes what is taught and what is the law isn't always right. It could even be dangerous. This is about the only thing I agree with.I think the author handeled conflict the best in this book. The man versus man. Montag versus Beaty and Montag versus other things made by man like the mechanical hound.This book was written in 3rd person point-of-view. This is were the narrator isn't in the story, he just tells it.So to me this book isn't worth reading unless you are trying to go to sleep and that is why I gave this novel a 2."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I will first disclose that I am not a science fiction fan, however the guts of this story are far from science fiction.

Aside from serving as the pretext for a novel, there is really no good reason for this regime to bother with book-burning at all: they have marginalized literate culture so thoroughly that book-loving will soon die out, and poses no threat to anyone.The protagonist, a \\"fireman\\" who burns one library too many, winds up reciting poetry to his wife, who bursts into tears at being depressed so cruelly, and wants only to return to the din of commercialized sentiment flowing 24/7 from the TV that fills an entire wall in their home. She snitches on him, and he goes into hiding with the book people, who live way out yonder past the railroad tracks, helping each other memorize books as their copies disintegrate. One such is Plato's \\"Republic,\\" the most famous fascist blueprint in Western lit, in which art, poetry, and especially theater are all banned. These book people are carefully preserving the regime's own Bible for book-burning!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Independientemente de la historia el mensaje que transmite es el que vale mucho la pena (aunque la historia se va facil), me parece una obra indispensable en cualquier biblioteca."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I think that this book was an intriguing account of what a possible future society might be like. this book, though very difficult to follow or understand at times, was one i enjoyed very much.I do not suggest this book to someone who does not agree with cursing. If you are easily offended by the d-word, G-D, or h-e-l-l then this book probably is not for you, also if you have difficulty reading such as following the flow of words then this book is not going to make it any easier on you. Speaking of being difficult to read, the end of this book is a pain, it leaves you hanging, wanting to read more but you cant because there isnt a sequel and it the book ends on a very tense moment that does not have time to cool off with."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Fahrenheit 451 follows Guy Montag in a futuristic society where knowledge is scorned by the public. Montag's occupation is a fireman, though the job is quite different than one would expect. In this society, firemen do not put out fires, but they initiate them. Books are forbidden, and it is the firemen's job to burn the houses of those who are in possession of books. Montag's journey throughout the story leads him to question his work and the morals of a society that does not value intelligence.This is a great book for those that enjoy to read and possibly for those that have trouble finding a good book to enjoy in their free moments. The description is thick and layered such that it might be difficult for younger readers to understand. Often you will have to reread sentences in order to decipher their metaphors. Strong vocabulary is used throughout and the feelings of the characters are not explicitly stated but rather implied through their actions. The start of the story is slow, though intriguing enough to keep readers interesting and in anticipation for more to come.The basic theme of the story is similar to The Giver and other stories where human society has changed drastically to the point where it is often hard to understand. While there is not much action in the story, there is enough excitement peppered throughout the tale that it remains interesting.The characters often speak in dialogue that seems bland and bored, reinforcing the strong feeling that emotions are virtually nonexistent in this society. The characters are neither happy or nor sad, but simply content. Humanity's attention span has been shortened to just a few moments, as television shows last for a mere two or three minutes. Another interesting aspect of life it is the law that the vehicles cannot drive below a minimum of 55 miles per hour. Many of the characteristics of this society seem to not be enforced by government, but rather by the general acceptance of society as a whole. A few people in the story have not conformed to the rules set before them and consequently are either ignored or, in the case of owning books, their houses are burned. Many people are poor and few occupations are mentioned other than firemen. In fact, the job of librarian no longer exists and all of the known library's have been burned.Though this was written more than half a century ago, much of the futuristic predictions still stand as plausible. The author does an excellent job of molding a society into a believable yet terrifying group of people.I would definitely suggest purchasing this book, as it can be read and reread and still be an interesting story. You will make new connections each time you read Fahrenheit 451. I would give this four stars out of five, as it is overall a great story though it has a few dry spots and some confusing scenes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Guy Montag, the main character of Fahrenheit 451, is a fireman, who doesn't put out fires: he starts them. He burns books, because they are, as Captain Beatty puts it, \\"a loaded gun in the house next door.\\" Books cause people to be different, books make people question things-- books make people unhappy.This book is astonishing in its implications of where society is headed (or maybe already is at). Sensory pleasure dictates everybody's lives: they obtain their pleasure out of violence and live for nothing important at all. As Clarisse, a girl in the story who is the impetus for Guy Montag's complete 180, states: \\"People don't talk about anything... They name a lot of cars or clothes or swimming pools mostly and say how swell! But they all say the same things and nobody says anything different from anybody else.\\" Even children do not escape the horrible condition of the society-- they are violent, and frequently kill each other.F 451 is full of such psychological subtleties that turn the story into a tangible, beleivable being. Ray Bradbury writes with such passion, you cannot help but to feel his anger, loss, and hope as it were your own. Unfortunately, those same qualities that make this book so stunning also make it difficult for those of a lower reading comprehension level to understand. The style of writing, which is almost entirely stream of conscious, can put less adventerous readers off. This story, also, takes a level of maturity and experience that a lot of high school readers (where a lot of people read this book) find very difficult to manage.F 451 is still an adventure through the human psyche like no other. This book causes you to stop and look at the world around you in far more detail than you ever would have otherwise-- and it definitely makes you think about the disease that is ever present today in a society like America."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I had to choose a science fiction book for my English class and this left me many options. My English teacher then informed me of the book Fahrenheit 451. I had heard of the Ray Bradbury book before but I nothing more than knowing that Michael Moore took its title and used it for one of his movies called Fahrenheit 9/11. I knew Ray Bradbury and his style because I had read his short story There Will Come Soft Rains. I figured that my teacher had some years on me and she might know what she was talking about, so I decided to pick Fahrenheit 451 for my project.Fahrenheit 451 is set in the future and is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In the future of Ray Bradbury, firemen such as Montag do not put out fires but the firemen set the houses a blaze. The sole purpose of Montag's job as a fireman is to burn books because in the future owning or reading books has become illegal. One day when Montag is walking home from work, he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan. Clarisse is a seven-teen year old and a free sprit. She is intrigued by the ideas in book and asks Montag questions about him. One question that she asks him is if he is happy. This question makes Montag think about himself and thinks his happiness is in reading books. Yet Montag's wife Mildred is more concerned with an alternate reality of television and her \\"family\\". This is upsetting to Montag because he has realized the \\"family\\" works just as a blanket, and it covers up truth and knowledge. Montag is finally pushed to the edge when he has to burn a woman and her house of books alive. Montag at last realizes that there must be something in books to cause people to sacrifice their lives for them.I enjoyed this book very much and I would rate it in my top ten of favorite books. I like it because its message of censorship and knowledge's importance in society. I viewed the portrayal of censorship like that of George Orwell's 1984 in that both books portray a limit of freedom of speech and the suppressing of original ideas. This is shown in Fahrenheit 451 by the burning of books and the over-sized televisions. Burning books stopped flow of opinions. This is shown when Montag asks Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps their opinions on the war; they do not even care anything about it even though they have relatives in the war. Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps are more concerned about the \\"family\\" and the size of the television sets than anything else in the whole world.Although I like this book very much, I do not think this book is for everyone. This book can get confusing at times with all of Bradbury's use of foreshadowing and symbolism. It is also hard to follow Montag's constant reflection on past experiences. Overall I think that everyone who likes reading books that are cynical about the future or who care about it should read this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Ray Bradbury is an awesome author.

Bradbury uses the fireman in a world where they MAKE fires instead of putting them out, to explore the phenomenon of censorship in a world obsessed with being \\"good\\". Scenes in his book were reminiscent of what the Nazis did in Opernplatz, Berlin. In fact, of this event Bradbury made this poignant statement: \\"It follows then that when Hitler burned a book I felt it as keenly, please forgive me, as his killing a human, for in the long sum of histroy they are onein the same flesh.\\" I met Ray Bradbury and he is a gentle, humble soul."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"A very elegantly written book with a strong message about technology, censorship, and control/freedom.

He burns books and the houses in which they are found. He is very happy with his job even though all of the citizens are frightened of him, until he meets a girl who is \\"17 and crazy\\". His walks with her and her strange ideas and interesting views make him question his job. He starts to steal and read books, which change his life forever.I really enjoyed reading this book. I absolutely love reading (anything) but especially love books about what our future could be like. This book, 1984, and Brave New World, among others, are books that imagine and predict an awful future (Imagine a world without books!) which is even more interesting because it kind of gives us a warning.The author, Ray Bradbury, has a really interesting writing style. One characteristic writing device he utilizes is description. He shows the reader exactly what is going on by giving lots of detail, for example \\"climbed slowly back into bed, arranged the covers over his knees and across his chest, half sitting\\". I think he does this to both create tension and to prolong and emphasize a moment. At this point in the book, the reader is wondering if Montag, the main character, will be safe, but they have to wait. Another unique characteristic of Bradbury's writing is how he uses lots of metaphors and similes (\\"face as bright as snow\\") which add more detail, making the scene easier to imagine. A third characteristic is that he writes about really scary happenings in pretty, flowery, flowing language which makes it seem less frightening and more normal. This helps the reader really get into Montag's mind because they aren't so scared off.I would recommend this book to anyone (over age 12) because it is a book you have to have read to live in today's world and understand what people are talking about and referencing. Also, this book is just a really good read that can be enjoyed on many levels, as a suspenseful story, or as a warning about our future. There are also themes of love and camaraderie. Everyone can find a character to identify with."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a science-fiction novel set in a futuristic United States where books are illegal and firemen set fires, rather than put them out. The story follows fireman, Guy Montag, as he battles himself, the people he to whom he thought he was closest, and society in a race against time, and a race to preserve the knowledge shared in books. Written in a serious tone, with inklings of sarcasm, Bradbury creates a short novel that has a straight forward message.What makes the book five stars is the message that it shares with the reader, especially since it was originally written in 1953. There are many parallels to today's society that have the potential to make a reader change his/her lifestyle. It warns readers of the consequences of censorship, of life under a government that controls all of the information, and warns of how shallow we may become in a self-centered, media-focused, reality-show-based society. After reading the book it is easy to see how one might feel guilty about turning on the television for an evening of brainless entertainment, for this is what the book is preaching against!Some people are turned off on this novel because so many of the characters appear so shallow and flat. That is, I believe, Bradbury's intent. He intentionally created characters that are superficial and fake to reinforce his ideas of what it would be like to live in a society such as this one. He illustrates the metamorphoses of one of these flat characters in Montag, who changes dramatically from the beginning to the end of the book.Other than short stories, I haven't read any other Bradbury novels, nor have I ever been a big science-fiction fan. However, the style of writing is very similar to other pieces I've read with long sentences that are full of imagery, but still simple in their meaning. He makes it easy for the reader to escape into the distorted reality of his settings. In the case of this novel, it is not clearly stated where it takes place, but I imagine a city on the east coast of the United States, like New York or Boston.Although Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly quick read, I would recommend it to readers who are mature enough to handle the underlying messages of this book. When I've spoken with people who read it quickly, just because they heard it was a good book, they were often disappointed. If you like to be pushed in your thinking and perception of reality, you will like this book because it will challenge you to look at how you are living your life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is a book everyone should read. It's not a long book, or a complicated one, but the ideas expressed are worthy of great philosophical discussion. It seems an almost surreal world that these people live in, and yet it could so easily be something into which our world could turn. In this book the brainless wife is obsessed with her \\"parlour family\\" - a very television-like scenario. In this I see the preponderance of \\"reality shows\\" peppering the airwaves and entrancing viewers in mindless activity. Before you start screaming at me, there is nothing wrong with a little mindless activity - it's a good diversion from the stresses of daily life (I, myself, cannot stand reality TV, but watch a lot of sporting events as my \\"mindless drivel\\"). But when that mindless drivel becomes your life, it's time to step back and reassess how you are living. When people stand around all day chattering about the latest developments on a reality TV show but are unable to even relate one current event, conflict, or idea - then we have a problem. And so many people find \\"Survivor\\" more fascinating that the fact that our country is at war (regardless of what side you are on, you'd think you'd have an opinion!) that I think we are starting to have a problem. So today, take a moment, read a book, express a though, or have a meaningful discussion (about anything) and cherish your ability to do so."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"By brother-in-law had me read this book way back when. He's the kind of guy that sees flying saucers in the sky at least three times a day. Well, maybe he had something there.This book was thought provoking, intriguing and disturbing in its time. Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" seems to have foreseen and foreshadowed what is occurring in our current society. We live in a push button society, a world where a constant onslaught of audio and video information has engulfed our senses. Children graduate school and are not even able to read. And nobody really seems to care. Nobody cares because we live in a world full of the mundane and emptiness where we just want instant gratification of whatever will fill our empty lives. We are without substance. We are empty souls without higher aspirations for the ability to explore the capabilities of our minds. We seek not to nurture our appreciation for nature or the mind's ability to create visual associations to stimulate thought through the written word. We are doomed, each of us, to see the same vision on a tube and not think beyond the surface. We are doomed to conformity trapped in a visual nightmare where the mind's eye will evolve into oblivion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book was in Spanish.

So cool."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451 (Spanish) (Spanish Edition)","review":"I love science fiction, and I must say that Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a masterpiece.One example is the lifestyle of the people. TV's that cover four walls to make it 3D; fireproof homes; \`news radios' which fit in your ear for convenience; etc. There is just on thing missing - books! It is against the law to read/own a book. So, they are burned. And who does that burning? Why, the firemen.It turns out that once houses got their fireproof \`shells,' the firemen ran out of a job. Therefore, they were given the job of burning books, which the public had rejected. The people had forgotten what it used to be like. When Montag, a fireman, was asked: \\"Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?\\" he assures her that houses have always been fireproof.In the end, Montag, the main character, meets people who are books. They have memorized books of the Bible, or chapters of a novel, thus saving literature. Their plan - to pass on the books by word of mouth until they can legally print and spread them once more.This book intrigued me so much. I really appreciate Ray Bradbury's sense of fantasy vs. reality so we can avoid such mistakes in the future."},{"Title":"Sears Roebuck Catalogue: 1927 Edition","review":"There's the 1897 reprinted catalog and the 1908 and then there's the 1927. I'm sorry to see this is out of print because 1927 was one of the MOST fascinating years for Sears. Their business was booming. America was booming. Things were changing so fast. (And Sears had just started their new radio station - WLS - for World's Largest Store - three years prior!)In fact, it was in the mid-1920s that America went from being primarily agricultural (with more than 50% of Americans living on farms) to being a land where city-dwellers were the majority. The 1920s were a big decade for this country.And it was also the heyday of the Sears Modern Homes department. Sears was building \\"Sears Modern Homes Sales Centers\\" where you could actually walk into a store and pick out the features you wanted on your Sears Modern Home. (These kit homes, offered until 1940 came with 30,000 pieces of house and one 75-page instruction manual!)The 1927 edition shows the roots of so many things that we take for granted today, but were somewhat radical in the early years of the 20th Century. Things like affordable, practical women's dresses (no more sewing!), cook stoves at reasonable prices, $20 sewing machines, electric iceboxes (ooooh!) and on and on.For folks who love old things (like me), the 1927 catalog is a treasure.Rose Thorntonauthor, The Houses That Sears Built"},{"Title":"Sears Roebuck Catalogue: 1927 Edition","review":"Only two things prevent me from rating this reprint at five stars: (1) the pages that ought to be in color aren't so reproduced (which is self-explanatory), and (2) the reproduction isn't complete. By this I mean that if you check the index for certain things, like \\"diapers\\" or \\"leggings, girls',\\" you find a listing for them, but when you turn to the page where they're supposed to be, it doesn't exist. (To mend the omissions, get a copy of1922 Montgomery Ward Catalogue: Reprinted in Its Original Formtoo.) That much said, it's a tremendous pity that it's O.P., because there's no social-history volume quite like it. Even with an occasionally slightly blurry repro (mostly in the should-be-color pages) and eye-straining type, there is nothing like an old mail-order catalog to give you a picture of how the people in America's past really lived--how they dressed, what books they read, what music they listened to, how they furnished their homes, what kinds of technology they had access to. And this \\"wish book\\" gives you all--or at least most--of that. From typewriters to \\"teddies\\" (flapper undies), player pianos (and their rolls) to pots and pans, and just about everything else from apple corers to zithers, Sears sold it, and this catalog lists something like 90% of it. Amazon ought to look into making it available on Kindle, since whoever owns the copyright doesn't seem interested in bringing it back as a conventional book."},{"Title":"Sears Roebuck Catalogue: 1927 Edition","review":"I am using several old catalogs to show the difference in pricing throughout different decades for my Math class. This makes it easier for my students when they can compare and contrast."},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"John Fremont was (in some aspects) the Alexander Hamilton of the mid-19th century. That may seem like a strange comparison, but they had one very strong similarity.... you either loved them or you hated them. Both were seen as larger than life and aroused strong emotions throughout the country.There are some pretty significant differences between the two - Fremont was world-renowed explorer of the American Wild West - while Hamilton was a bona fide finacial genius (which Fremont definitely was not!). Hamilton died too young and became somewhat of a martyr and his reputation has grown. Fremont may have lived a little too long and scandal soiled and diminished his reputation.Now to Chaffin's wonderful biography on Fremont: What a great/interesting read! The characters are much larger than life John Fremont, Thomas Hart Benton (His father-in-law), General Stockton (Who helped win California fo America) and of course Fremont's exploring buddy Kit Carson.Chaffin tells a tale that is so odd that it must be true. The tales of Fremont's four main explorations is straight out of a Hollywood movie. We follow Fremont up mountains, across rivers, through deserts - we see how they faced extreme starvation and how some members were forced to turn to canabalism (ouch!).Chaffin presents Fremont with warts and all - there is mention of his affairs, his conceit, his insubortination, his shameless self-promotion and his many financial blunders. While Chaffin does not apologize for Fremonts faults he also chooses not to dwell on these aspects.So why only four stars? There are some minor flow problems (for me) I found that the section on the war for California to be far too long, and the sections on Fremont's role in the Civil War and his ill fated Presidential campaign to be far too short. However, a significant amount of the book concentrates on Fremont's explorations.... which is exactly why I give a full recommendation."},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"I loved this book--an inspiring story that conveys the excitment of the exploration of the west. Author includes historical background so Fremonts actions are placed in the context of the time. Very readable--almost like a novel. The one drawback are the maps of Fremonts explorations. They are merely sketch maps without any location detail--I would have liked to have seen more detailed cartography with, perhaps, landforms included. Many (most) place names in the book are not shown on the maps. I kept my atlas at hand while reading, but many place names have changed. I strongly recommend."},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"For an old native Californian I never had a clear picture of the Americanos revolt against the Mexicans except for the Sonoma uprising at General Vallejo's headquarters where the Bear Republic flag was raised. This book gives a comprehensive picture of the tumult in California and how the various American and Mexican forces interacted. It gives an excellent description as to what California was like with an estimated population of 15,000. This book now gives me a greater feeling of the Fremont history for the country roads and off-named places that I have traveled throughout California over many decades of my lifetime. I did not know that Fremont was French and we are not accenting his name properly. I wonder whether 150 years ago his name was pronounced properly. The city of Fremont perhaps should take note of the accent mark."},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"This is a massively important book, one that invokes not only America, but also the frontier and the life of a man who, hitherto a minor player in history, has been brought to the forefront to show how he embodied an age. The author puts himself astride the arguments of American history, showing how John Charles Fremont was once the epitome of the American who helped brave the wilderness, and how recent revisionist historians cast him as an imperialist and a leader in the persecution of the Native Americans. For the author Fremont is neither and both, a man who forced America to \\"reimagine America itself\\". Born in 1813 in Savannah, Fremont was to embody America itself, the Colossus in the Cradle, that was just beginning to feel its way into the new frontier of the West.He was to be surveyor in the 1830s when the Cherokee nation was relocated. Fremont's most important expeditions would be between 1838 and 1854, charting various routes and mapping the American west. His campfires and wagon trails are today nothing but dust, few are preserved. The author sought in van to find them but found instead the legacy of Fremont, America astride the West gave birth to the American West and after that to commerce and the great movement of population, for which Fremont's old camping sites are now national parks or owned by the government or inside the property of corporations.This book evokes so many things it is hard not to give it praise for all of them. It tells the story of the American West and attempts by well meaning explorers to sympathize and help Native-Americans, Fremont himself judged the U.S government deficient in its promises to the American Indian.An amazing read that will be enjoyed by any student of American history or anyone interested in the frontier or the American West.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"This is an excellent biography of an American that few people know about. Fremont was truly a vivid member of history from the days of the early republic through the age of manifest destiny. This book covers not only Fremont's triumphs but his downfalls. While a young and impetuous (sometimes dishonest) man, Fremont was successful in helping to expand this countries knowledge of its own topography and boundaries. Through a vivid use of journals and maps Fremont led expeditions that cataloged the trails for westward expansion.His service in the army corp. of engineers helped with the capture of California through bravado more so than force. After his brief governorship of California, Fremont was found guilty at a court marital for his actions against General Kearny and the Polk administration. Fremont's retirement would lead him to business ventures and a run for the presidency as the Republican Party's first candidate. These distinctions would continue as he was a commander of the western union forces during the Civil War. His greatest act here would be to promote a little known Grant to general and command the armies of Tennessee. Overall this is an excellent biography and does a great job of providing a balanced look at a little known person in American history. Highly recommended for those who want to understand how the groundwork for manifest destiny was laid."},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"John Charles Fremont, (1813-1890), was an American military officer, explorer of the American West - earning the sobriquet Pathfinder - briefly the military Governor of California , the first Republican candidate for President in 1856, a Union Civil War general and territorial Governor of Arizona. He married Jessie Benton, the daughter of Missouri politician Thomas Hart Benton. (Jessie was a force in her own right and one of the few people who visibly raised the ire of Abraham Lincoln.) Fremont had a bad case of wanderlust, in a time when horses were the most advanced mode of transportation, and he had an uncanny ability - consciously or not - to stir up controversy wherever he set up camp.Pathfinder is very well written biography, with the majority of the book chronicling Fremont's journeys on the trail. At this vantage point in time, with highways and airplanes, it's difficult to comprehend both the miles traveled by Fremont and his fellow explorers - including Kit Carson - and the \\"challenges\\" they encountered - weather, mountains, rivers and available food being just the most obvious of the \\"headaches\\" to be solved. Yet these walkabouts were more than just high adventure. Fremont was a meticulous data collector and these forays into the great unknown were just as valuable for what wasn't found - for instance the mythical east/west continental waterway known as the Bonaventura - as for what was - \\"documented\\" paths through the Rocky Mountains leading to the American West Coast.During his expeditions problems arose when Fremont exceeded his \\"orders\\" - for instance traveling further west than originally planned - and culminated in 1846 when Fremont and his men became directly involved in California's fight for \\"independence\\", which indirectly involved him in the Mexican-American War. These actions led to his court-martial from the US Army. (The US Government funded Fremont's expeditions. He led them as a US military officer.)Fremont's departure from the army occurs about 400 pages into this 500 page book. His run for the Presidency - both in 1856 and briefly in 1864, service in the Civil War and all that followed - basically the last 35 years of Fremont's life - are covered in about 100 pages. Ironically, as Fremont became more involved with other humans and \\"civilization\\" - and one would assume with more documentation available - the less detailed is this narrative. Don't get me wrong; what is covered is done so extremely well. But personally I could have used more \\"balance\\" into an examination of the Pathfinder's post-explorer life. There is a quandary in Fremont's personality - he was a very good leader of men \\"against\\" Mother Nature - this skill seemingly eluded him when involved and competing against other men.Very good book - just wish there was more."},{"Title":"Pathfinder: John Charles Fremont and the Course of American Empire","review":"I have not finished reading this book yet, but more than halfway through and find it excellent, very well written. you are with Fremont every step of the way.

Vivid descriptions of the areas travelled through will satisfy any arm chair adventurer, and for all its detail, the book is never boring! It is simply a true adventure story, with fascinating characters whose lives and careers in the wilds or in Washington, DC, unfold memorably before you. It is one of those books that I am sure I will be sorry when it ends but very glad I read it! I have read much about the Oregon Trail and emigration and development of the west and this book is a must read for anyone with an abiding interest in that period of our nation's growth.

Bringing us into the depths of horror, Oates's protagonists range in age, interest, and situation. We meet a six-year-old girl, a young nurse, a middle-aged fashionista, and an elderly woman dying in a nursing home, among others. What unites all of these women across their stories are the desperate personal circumstances in which they find themselves, and the realization that the only path out is a dark and disturbing one. As with much of Oates's work, this collection addresses the exploitation and marginalization of women in American society, yet it does so through horror and suspense. This is a deliciously suspenseful collection, excellent reading for a spooky October night."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"The world portrayed in Joyce Carol Oates fiction is one filled with sudden violence, violence that more times than not comes at the expense of one of her female characters. The Female of the Species, a collection of nine stories, is indeed filled with violence but this time it is not the women who need to worry. Each of the nine stories shows what can happen when a woman decides that she has had enough of a man's abuse, infidelity, desertion and the like or when she gives in to her own sexual demons.The book is subtitled \\"Tales of Mystery and Suspense\\" and that is not a false claim. Each of the stories is cloaked in mystery but the best of the nine shine because of the way that Oates gradually brings them to such a level of suspense that the reader can hardly wait to get to the last page to find all the answers. In \\"Hunger,\\" the longest of the nine stories, and my favorite, a young wife and mother who seems to have it all, including a rich, older husband who spends more time working than with his family, meets a man on the beach and crazily becomes obsessed with him. Will she come to her senses before she makes a fatal mistake? Is her oblivious husband, a good man who truly loves his wife and daughter, in danger? As the suspense built and built, I completely lost myself in what is one of the best short stories that I've ever read.The other eight stories are a bit uneven; some of them I will remember a long time for the tragic worlds in which they placed me for a few minutes and one or two others because they just did not work for me. The best of the stories somehow made me sympathetic to the women driven to violence despite the horror of what they were doing. Those included stories about women who respond to fears for their personal safety with violence of their own and stories of children driven to desperation by their mothers. But I found \\"Madison at Guignol\\" to be a surrealistic misfire that left me both repulsed by its descriptions of torture and confused by its message. And I was disappointed that \\"Angel of Mercy\\" did not offer any new insights into what causes a nurse to kill her patients rather than to watch them suffer slow and painful deaths.That is the danger, I suppose, in a book that contains only nine stories. The ones that don't work out for the reader remain as memorable as the ones that do."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"I have been an Oates fan for 20 years or more--since I was a teenager and found my mother's copy of \\"Where are you Going, Where have you been?\\" I have always felt that the gruesome, macabre, and disturbing elements of Oates' work were unfailingly balanced by her subtle and precise renderings of complex human motives and desires. In this book, the shell of Oates is still there, but the deeper layers that had kept her stories from tumbling into sick, voyeuristic, violence-porn are glaringly absent. This book fails to explore anything deep or worthwhile and conveys only ugliness and evil. Many of the stories seem to come from some well of hatred toward women that is truly disturbing. In the past, reading Oates' stories was always worth the trip. No longer. Something has changed and not for the better. I would not advise anyone to read these stories."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"This was my 1st experience reading anything written by Joyce Carol Oates and I was extremely disappointed after hearing so many glowing reviews regarding her writing. All the stories in this collection were dark, sinister and quite frankly very creepy."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"Scripture says that the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons. The meaning of this verse is commonly taken to imply the consequences of sinful parenting. For Oates, the sins of the parents are visited on the daughters. Here is an outstanding collection of women and girls of varying ages and circumstances who have in common both a horrible past or current hurt/injury by the one who they should trust the most and the horrible psychological and often sociopathic, violent and self-destructive effects of these hurts. Nabokov explores these themes. What makes Oates' contribution worthwhile is the brevity of the genre and glimpse into each life leaving you wanting to know more. In a sense, we often come across people with such backgrounds and who are severely disturbed as they briefly cross our paths. It is all too common and real. A book worth reading and thinking about."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"One should never assume that the fairer sex is the weaker and in this collection of stories, the prodigious Oates reveals the dark side of a woman's psyche, whether inspired by childhood abandonment or a married woman's rapidly escalating sexual obsession. Flying to the very edge of reason, each of these stories plunges into the darker waters of female behavior, some macabre, some grotesque, others giving voice to the secret impulses that drive women to extremes, to the edge of reason, innocent children taxed beyond the fragile structures of their emotional boundaries.In the first tale, \\"So Help Me God\\", a young woman falls in love with a bad boy cop, caught in a web of abuse with the husband she met at fourteen and married at eighteen. The exhilarating sexual energy of their early encounters feels far more dangerous as he toys with her dependency, obsession turning to terror. In \\"Doll, A Romance of the Mississippi\\", eerily reminiscent and a cross between \\"Baby Doll\\" and Lolita, a young girl travels the Midwest with her (step)father, preying on the sexual fantasies of vulnerable paying customers, frequently betrayed by her own twisted demons, home-schooled from the trunk of their 1953 Buick La Salle. \\"Madison at Guignol\\" speaks to a woman's quest for perfection: \\"But it is my soul I seek continuously, where I can and however.\\" This fashion maven is a victim of her own pathetic hubris, caught in a horror beyond her ability to comprehend.A personal favorite is \\"Hunger\\", one of the longer pieces in The Female of the Species. Kristine, the second wife of a wealthy man, begins a casual dalliance with an enigmatic, exotic stranger, Jean-Claude, a new arrival in the elite oceanside community where she is vacationing with her small daughter. In the accepting society of this well-heeled colony, Kristine opens a door she is unable to close, her impulsive romance imbued with the menace of incipient violence, helpless against her consuming passion for the forbidden, en route to a stunning and elaborate betrayal. There are more: \\"The Banshee\\"; \\"The Haunting\\"; \\"Tell Me You Forgive Me?\\"; \\"The Angel of Death\\" and \\"The Angel of Mercy\\", each with a uniquely bizarre perspective. This collection is fascinating and unsettling, written in the evocative prose that is natural to this author, with random images of threat and menace, birds screeching through the sky, teeming hordes of feral cats, bucolic scenes threaded with nature's unpredictability, the power of one character's preoccupation with another, stalking death, all the ingredients to send a chill up your spine in the dark of the night. Luan Gaines/ 2006."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"Joyce Carol Oates, a writer long fascinated with the macabre, has compiled a solid collection of tales of suspense and violence. These nine stories portray women at their most murderous, motivated by passion, desperation, righteousness, or just plain nastiness.One of the most chilling tales is \\"Doll: A Romance of the Mississippi,\\" a story about perpetually eleven-year old Doll, a shrewd child prostitute prone to \\"mean moods.\\" Oates plunges into the psyches of both Doll and her (step)father Ira, exposing the deranged and macabre relationship between the two: what keeps them together and what divides them. \\"Hunger\\" is equally memorable, although less for its actual violence than for the way Oates develops the story of a woman hungry for passion. Kristine is vacationing on Cape Cod with her six year old daughter when she meets a mysterious stranger on the beach. When the stranger begins to show up at the upscale parties thrown in Kristine's circle, Kristine finds herself driven to possess him. But her actions have repercussions she does not expect. \\"The Haunting\\" focuses on the horrifying hallucinations (or are they?) of a girl whose mother is said to have burned her father alive. The more experimental \\"Angel of Mercy\\" entwines the lives of a long-dead, infamous nurse with the youngest nurse of the ward nicknamed \\"the City of the Damned.\\" \\"So Help Me God,\\" the story of a woman prompted to take action against her controlling husband after receiving a series of anonymous calls, is less successful, primarily because the motivation Oates provides is more overlaid than deep-seated in the protagonist.Each story is this collection varies enough from the others to keep the reader's attention through one sitting or many. While Oates's characters might not always seem to be capable of the atrocities they commit, the suspense she builds holds everything together. The most engrossing stories have the momentum of inevitability, where both the reader and the characters know where events are heading but from which neither can tear herself away. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"Would the woman writing under Joyce Carol Oates' name these days please return America's greatest living author to us?Seriously, this was the most unenjoyable, in fact most distressingly bad, book by Oates I've read, among the maybe thirty I have had the utmost pleasure to read.I don't know what vein Oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all, the stories themselves are unimpressive, unwelcoming, unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration. And worse still, I find this is a trend with Oates these days. I can't think of a single book she's published since Middle Age that has been (yes, strictly in my opinion) any good. The short story in Female of the Species that was called \\"Madison at Guignol\\" was perhaps the worst Oates story ever published. (And yes I do understand the connotation of the word \\"Guignol\\" in the title.)Some might accuse me of approaching Oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what I, myself, wanted, but that's not the case. One thing I have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people. I have avidly read along thru Gothic stories, mysteries, romances, non-genre pieces, novellas, poems, short fiction, novels, literary criticism and plays by Oates, and so I believe I can fairly say I do not stereotype Joyce Carol Oates or expect any one thing from her, but in this case, as much as reporting it pains me, this was a bad book and I can only hope Oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has, and that her next book(s) will be much better."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"This latest book of short stories by Joyce is quite good. In this book, she abandons her usual esoteric vocabulary for a \\"plain language\\" writing style. Interestingly, while the stories are very good, they are not her best. Her style is a little prosaic in comparison to most of her other works. And; her plots and especially the endings lack a certain degree of poignancy that so characterizes most of her work.On the positive side, she has not lost her touch for incredible character development. While most of the stories involve murder, they also touch on other highly interesting and sometimes perverse topical areas. Her story \\"Doll\\" is truly fascinating as she centers on a kiddie prostitution scheme which is run by the girls father. He had developed a concept that is \`look, don't touch.' The clients get to have an hour with Doll, a radiant girl of about 13 who undresses for them and poses, talks and watches TV, while the \\"John\\" gets excited.Her story \\"Angel of Wrath\\" is truly an inside look at a very strange and psychopathic boy how is in love with a woman he does not know. Yet still, he believes he has a connection to her. And in fact, before the story is over, he has a very clear connection to her.It is interestingly noticeable that her longer stories are better than her short ones in this book. With more words, she can be more precise about the nature of the sociopathic behaviors she is describing. Some of the shorter stories are lacking in the development, and also lacking in the ending. They do not give you the typical feeling that her stories usually do. She seems to be fond in this book, of leaving as much up to the imagination of the reader as possible. In some cases, too much to the reader.Nonetheless, this book is highly recommended as a very fine use of plain language to tell tales of serious psychosis and other maladies. It is surely recommended to all Joyce Carol Oates readers, and also all readers who are interested in seeing society from the inside out. The book is well worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"I certainly beg to differ with some of the disappointing customer reviews I have read here for Joyce Carol Oates's latest short story collection, \\"The Female of the Species\\". While Oates is not my favorite writer, I have yet to be disappointed with any of her work; whether these are short stories, novellas or novels demonstrate her considerable range and artistic abilities as a writer of superb fictional prose. In her latest collection, Oates certainly doesn't disappoint with her richly textured, stylish prose offering tales of women and children who are forced to commit acts most foul. My own favorite stories are \\"So Help Me God\\", \\"Madison at Guignol\\", and \\"Hunger\\", but the others are well worth reading too. \\"So Help Me God\\" chronicles the loneliness of a young wife who takes matters into her own hands when she finally deals with her older, violent husband, after being taunted by an unknown obsessive caller who knows intimate details about her life. \\"Madison at Guignol\\" is Oates at her stylishly wicked best, as a young fashionista gets her just desserts at the hands of some salesgirls in an opulent Madison Avenue store. \\"Hunger\\" describes a married woman's obsession with a young, handsome French-speaking visitor, who wins not only her heart, but also her young daughter's. Without question, Oates is still at the height of her creative powers with these elegant tales of diabolical mischief and mayhem; these are tales worth reading, but in small doses - as an editorial reviewer noted - to enjoy not only her elegant prose but also her splendid plotting."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"After reading First Love, I realized I hadn't read Joyce Carol Oates in a while and missed her incredible writing and dark, literary language. I love her short story collections and have read some of her novels and novellas (and I still have some unread stuff by her on my TBR pile). I wanted to read one of her short stories again, which is why I picked up The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense. I wondered if Oates still had it in her when it comes to writing short stories. The answer is a resounding yes! This incredible collection centers on women, women who are far from ordinary. These women are murderers, and they have needle-sharp teeth, razor claws and killer instincts that would make a male serial killer shake in his boots. The women in this collection have also had a history of abuse and obsessive behavior. This isn't surprising, for most, if not all of Oates's works have centered on some form of abuse. My favorite stories are \\"Angel of Wrath,\\" \\"Angel of Mercy,\\" \\"The Hunting,\\" \\"Hunger,\\" and \\"Tell Me You Forgive Me?\\" My one complaint is that I wish this collection had been longer. There are only nine stories total in this collection. Joyce Carol Oates's writing is rich with substance, symbolism and darkness and she is one of my favorite authors. I hope I will read another new short-story collection by her soon."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"Dark and fierce, these girls are ultimately savage yet all too believable. The writing is personal and bold, specific and so full of life one can almost smell the threat of danger.I guess I should disclose that I'm totally biased about Joyce Carol Oates.

Now for that cold shower.It's definitely worth the read if you're into noir and dangerous women."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"The violence is gratuitous. pointless, and just plain stupid. As are these stories. A women commits the capital crime of being married to an older wealthy man. In addition, she is often exasperated with the fawning and usually hypocritical \\"service providers\\" with whom she interacts. After Oates exhausts the dictionary heaping scorn on this character--over and over again until the repetition turns the reader numb--Oates has her tortured to death in the back room of a Madison Avenue boutique. Once a provocative and original writer, Oates now writes with the screechy, scolding tone of a bitter crone."},{"Title":"The Female of the Species: Tales of Mystery and Suspense","review":"This short story collection centers around the workings of the female minds, from six years of age onwards. The mystery and suspense are provided by everday incidents, ranging from something as seemingly banal as playing with a baby brother to murder and euthanasia. It's creepy how Oates lets us into the protagonist's mind and have readers live the story.This is my first Joyce Carol Oates book and I didn't know what to expect. I think this collection is very well-written and was successful in stringing me along for the heroines' adventures (and misadventures).

While it has a decent introduction to Chinese medicine, I found the book to be confusing in its organization and poorly edited.

I now see why!"},{"Title":"Nine Ways To Body Wisdom","review":"In a very readable and user-friendly style, this unusual book offers many suggestions for health and healing within the frameworks of Chinese medicine, augmented with other complementary/ alternative therapies. For instance, in Chinese medicine various elements and organs are associated with emotions. The Earth Element is linked with worry or sympathy; Wood Element with frustration and anger; Fire Element with laughter and joy; Water Element with fear; and Metal Element with grief. Each of us has natural traits and characteristics that incline us towards the spectrum that is typical for one of these elements. Harper provides a questionnaire that allows readers to identify their element.... There are five emotions, which are connected to the five elements and to the maor yin organs (the liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys). Anger relates to the liver, you to the heart, pensiveness to the spleen, grief to the lungs and fear to the kidneys. Extremes of emotions can have a negative impact on the organs, especially when they are intense or have been suppressed for some time, just as an imbalanced organ can have a profound effect on the state of our emotions. (p. 3)Life rhythms are important in Chinese medicine because each organ has a two-hour period during the day or night when it is at its maximal activity and greater sensitivity to treatment. Various foods support various organs and energetic processes. Harper simplifies this complex series of relationships with tables that help to identify the various elements related to organs and feelings and their special times of peak energetic activity. Detailed lists of approaches that can help with problems of each organ - as it is associated with its particular Element - help to identify ways for healing. What I find particularly helpful is the attention to both physical and psychological issues that are often interlinked.Harper's nine ways to understand and deal with health issues include: nutrition, herbs and spices, exercise, reflexology, acupressure, aromatherapy, flower remedies, affirmations, and visualizations/ meditations. While the index is amply detailed, I found that by using the table of contents I was able to identify which organs are associated with which elements - within the frameworks of Harper's discussion - and then explore which of the nine approaches could be helpful for problems with that organ.This is a rich feast for therapists, augmented with helpful illustrations, resources and references. Those with little familiarity with complementary/ alternative healing may find the wealth of details a bit overwhelming. Patience and persistence, however, may lead readers to remedies and therapies that are helpful and safe."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"Stuart Wilde changed my life...

This one is one of the BEST."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"This is the second of Wilde's books that I have read. In The Quickening I thought that it was odd that the author would say on the one hand how unfair society was, yet later on, would state that the world was exactly as it should be and that you should not try to change it. O.K. I thought, perhaps he meant this in terms of this world being a testing ground for free will, where we refine our soul through suffering and struggling against injustice. However, this book makes it clear that the author totally rejects any benefit through trial and suffering. He emphasizes that the system is unfair, but that as a &quot;superior spiritual person&quot; you should wholeheartedly join in and get all that you can. He says that the weak and &quot;whimps&quot; get what they deserve, and that one shouldn't hesitate to use and discard them. As for Wilde's concept of flow, it appears to be little more than a callous attitude of &quot;no problems, no worries- as long as I get mine.&quot; Wilde seems to offer nothing but a watered down version of old-fashion theosophy tailored to the business-minded sociopath who wants to feel better about himself. I should have known there was something seriously wrong here when the man expressed deep admiration for Genghis Khan...."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"I am pleased to say I had the good sense not to buy this book. Indeed, I'd never heard of this \\"author\\" until a friend indicated he'd read his work and felt he was a \\"Master.\\" I looked Mr. Wilde up on the Internet and determined in less than one minute he is yet another charlatan taking advantage of people's desire for easy answers and assurance that they can have all they desire simply by wishing.Mr. Wilde has written that the fossil record \\"proves\\" we \\"weren't here one day and we were here the next.\\" I'm at a loss with regard to what sort of fossil record he is referring to, but, clearly, the man has a child's grasp of science. He also suggests that most of the earth's human population will soon \\"dematerialize\\" and go to another planet, leaving only a handful of humans and all animals to \\"clean\\" the earth.His best comment goes like this (quoted verbatim): \\"I have a dear friend that is a true skeptic, he believes in nothing. I told him I could show him how to dematerialize and that I'd done it for people seventy times before without failure. He said he'd have to see it to believe it. I waited for a bit then I decided not to show him as dematerialization by its very nature requires you to \`not see' what it is that you don't believe in, so I thought the effort was pointless.\\"If that doesn't say it all, I am not sure what would! And if anyone can read that and still buy anything penned by Mr. Wilde, I can only wish I could \\"dematerialize\\" and go to a planet inhabited by reasonable beings!"},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"Many of us were taught by parents and teachers that the only way we could be &quot;good&quot; was to struggle. We were taught that struggle is noble. Wilde debunks this widely held myth and helps us rid our minds of this tape running there. He compares struggle vs. effort and identifies struggle as effort laced with negative emotion. He posits that &quot;going with the flow&quot; is a much better approach. This may sound simplistic, but many of us forget this simple lesson in our day to day battles out in the fray. Keep this book handy. I have re-read mine many, many times and it helps me get re-centered and concentrate on what is truly important in my life. Also, you may want a couple for friends as you will begin to identify the patterns of struggle in others. Wilde asks us to teach others to forego their struggle, and ultimately live."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"At the risk of sounding like a commercial, this booklet is a genuine bargain, so do yourself a favor by including it on your next order from Amazon.

I also agree that if you purchase this book, purchase more than one because you may be able to \\"carry the message\\" to others who have not yet learned the lesson of this book. What I do have to add is merely a personal anecdote about the book. I stumbled upon the book in a gift shop on a small book rack in a tourist area. The title slapped me upside the head, like a brick hitting me. I was always taught in my family that I wasn't a \\"good\\" person unless I struggled and that struggle was noble (as other reviewers note). I too carried the book with me in my brief case and re-read it often. I also learned that I have had to un-learn many mindsets inculcated into my psyche by parents and others. One sad note though: I have largely removed struggle from life using resources beyond this book as well. However, its sad when I return to my family and see them struggling, not having learned the lesson(s) I have been blessed to learn."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"First off, I'd like to address most of the reviews here as laughable. Particularly the reviews from those bashing a book that's 50 pages long and disappointed that the solution to wonder hunger, famine, AIDS, and cancer isn't in a book of this size. Really now? At any rate. I've ACTUALLY READ the book and have come to a few conclusions about it. First, it is not a book that is going to change your life. I've found the nature of a lot of self-help/inspirational books is that you take a bit from everyone you read and begin to apply it to your life. Bashing a 50 page book for not being \\"deep enough\\" or \\"wonderfully insightful\\" is childish. That's not what Wilde is trying to do with this book. Wilde is trying to get the reader to question his or her basic assumptions about the world and to identify what areas of life they are struggling in. While Wilde's solutions aren't as in-depth as I would like, I realize at the same time that that's the entire point of this book. It's not meant to be one of those door-stoppers that is 400/500 pages long and breaks down problems chapter by chapter. Those books are nice to an extent, but books like these are exactly what I need sometimes when I don't feel like re-reading the more extensive books out there. Sometimes, I just need a quick reminder on an idea I read long ago or a quick reminder on how to identify/change some stressful areas in my life. I think in this sense, people are disappointed because they expect too much out of a book that barely cracks 45 pages.Don't expect too much. Read this book for what it is - a nice, affordable, and well-written book that should serve as review material for a lot of people who can learn things from this book. For the cost of $4-5 with shipping, what have you really got to lose?-Travis"},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"This is an easy read that can be finished in one sitting.

There are only 5 chapters, with the fifth being a summation. Chapter 2 is the \\"Strugglers' Hall of Fame\\". It describes different categories of strugglers. It is very witty and right on target, and straight to the point.Every time you get pissed off at someone or some situation, you need to pull out this book and re-read it."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"In another short but powerful dissertation on taking responsibility for your own life, Stuart Wilde, in Life Was Never Meant To Be A Struggle, explains that you create your own destiny through your innermost thoughts and feelings about yourself. Whenever life seems to be flowing smoothly, something inside us triggers thoughts of self-sabotage, thus diminishing our experience and making life difficult. However, Wilde explains that life should be easy, and by recognizing the indicators of difficulty, we can head them off and get back on the natural path of simplicity.First, your physical body is a powerful indicator, one you have control over. You can recognize your weaknesses as gifts, opportunities to learn and grow. Emotionally, you can train yourself to be more forgiving of yourself and others. You can avoid conflict and learn from these experiences. The relationships in your life will tell you a great deal about yourself, as those we choose to associate with reflect back certain aspects about ourselves. Your living circumstances, including your home, and your financial situation can also add to life's struggles.One of the most profound and original concepts within the book is Wilde's suggestion to see the world as perfect, the way God created it, and to understand that it doesn't need fixing. By leaving the world alone and focusing your own life experience, you are actually having a significant positive impact on the world at large. Additionally, how you handle conflict and stress as well as your own psychological state can deeply impact whether or not life is a struggle. Finally, Wilde explains that those with a strong spiritual connection tend to find that life is easier. Those who remember their spirituality live an authentic life, knowing who they really are, rather than playing a role that society, culture, or religion has dictated.Someone who struggles typically has low self-esteem. They crave the acceptance of others. They often have large egos, and struggle ensues when the natural path of their Higher Self conflicts with the direction of the personality or ego. Those who struggle often set unrealistic goals for themselves, expecting to achieve something in a timeframe that is unrealistic based on the current position of their energy. They worry what others think and are susceptible to the suggestions of others as to how life should be. Strugglers lack stability, they worry, and they find it difficult to concentrate. Those in the natural state of flow have learned to accept and love themselves exactly who they are in the present moment. Successful people have established action plans and are constantly reviewing the circumstances of their own lives. When struggle ensues, they evaluate the situation to determine whether or not the struggle is worth the effort. Oftentimes, it is not, and successful people are capable of changing those circumstances.To rid your life of struggle, you must understand the underlying emotions and feelings behind the circumstances in your life. You must face life directly with an action plan of realistic timing and trust in God and the Universe to deliver. You must evaluate the people within your life and decide whether those you associate with are contributing to your highest good. If they are not, you may need to separate from some of them. You must understand what it is you are trying to manifest in your life and determine if you are wasting energy on something you don't really want or need. Also, you may be resisting an easy life, forgetting that you are in control, and it is important to remember that it is ok to get from life exactly what you want.In about 50 short pages, Stuart Wilde presents a profound directional manual for eliminating struggle from your life. The concepts are common sense and revolve around positive thinking and remembering that you are part of a divine source of unlimited power. You are the creator of your own experience and must take responsibility for your own life. Read this book anytime you need that reminder."},{"Title":"\\"Life Was Never Meant to Be a Struggle\\"","review":"It seems that Wilde cant go wrong in his writing.

It was quite refreshing to see such a detailed examination of a western theater campaign. The marketability of eastern campaign themes and marquee battles such as Gettysburg is disportionately high. True scholars of the Civil War appreciate the significance of the western campaigns and the preponderance of so many myths created during the biased postwar period that have in themselves become a source for many flawed 20th century publications. This particular issue of Civil War Regiments finally does justice to one the wars almost forgotten and usually misrepresented units, the Regular Brigade of the Army of the Cumberland. Anyone who has ever been affliated with the army or the military will appreciate the complete and objective treatment given to the Regular Brigade at Chickamauga by Major Mark Johnson. At last the Regulars have been revealed for what they were. A standard of discpline and dedication that was proven repeatedly in all of the major western campaigns.

If you are new to WFRP I would definatley pick up the PotD adventure books.

I must say, I am more a fan of the linear play. It allows GMs without the time to think on things to run a campaign without any preparation work, while at the same time GMs who have time can spend it tinkering with the specific of the scenario. The reason I gave this book 5/5 is because of those preferences. It seems that at the end the developers finally found their stride in a manner with which they could please both camps. My only complaint is that I wish that they had made things seem as epic-adventure as they did in \\"Ashes of Middenheim\\" (SPOILER: when a god pats you on the head and tell you that you've done a good job, that's a *VERY* high mark to try and beat)."},{"Title":"Murder at 75 Birch (Signet)","review":"I just came across this book a few months ago. A reviewer that I follow thought it was a pretty good read and I agree. I enjoyed this book. It's the story of Pennsylvania dentist, Glen Wolsieffer, who murdered his wife Betty in 1986. I googled his name recently and found that he ultimately confessed to the murder and was released from prison around 2005 (I wonder if his paramour was waiting for him?). The author had an opportunity to speak at length with Glen. So throughout the book, there are chapters called \\"In His Own Words\\" where Glen speaks about his life and the crime itself. It's interesting to see how this man thinks. Glen's brother Neil plays a big role in this book. Although he had nothing to do with the murder, he is targeted by the media and police. So there are really two stories going on about two brothers. Glen is not a nice person and I was almost starting to think that he was going to pin the blame on Neil by the time his trial took place. He actually could have because by this time, his poor brother was dead. A good read - all new material for me. My litmus test for a 5 star is - Would I read it again? Because I said \\"No\\", I give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Murder at 75 Birch (Signet)","review":"MURDER AT 75 BIRCH deals with the murder in 1986 of Betty Wolsieffer, the wife of Wilkes-Barre, PA, dentist Glen Wolsieffer. Glen claimed to have been the victim of an intruder in their home who knocked him out before murdering Betty, and he professed his deep love for his wife. But his stories quickly fell apart. His account of his struggle with an assailant in his house the night of the murder was soon seen as ridiculous, and if Glen loved his wife, he was not faithful to her.The reader learns that not only had Glen had a girlfriend for the past 7 years, but that within the year prior to the killing, he started a relationship with a second woman as well, effectively, at that point, cheating on both his wife and his first girlfriend. And Betty, who had learned about the first, if not the second, outside relationship was, according to her friends, planning on confronting Glen with an ultimatum about their marriage the night she was killed. Subplots abound as well.Richard T. Pienciak is a fine true crime writer. MURDER AT 75 BIRCH is well researched and well written. As in his other true crime books (MAMA'S BOY and DEADLY MASQUERADE) he writes intelligently for adults. Pienciak does not feel the need to dramatize his work excessively and he does not attempt to tell the reader what to think. He simply presents his research in a profesionally written manner allowing the reader to form his/her own conclusions.MURDER AT 75 BIRCH is formatted in typical true crime style, but Pienciak uses the device (also used in MAMA'S BOY with considerable success) which he calls \\"In His Own Words\\", short chapters in which Glen presents his own explanations of the events surrounding the murder. I like the device, but it is less successful in MURDER AT 75 BIRCH because Glen, other than his continued and patently false efforts to cast himself as misunderstood and innocent of anything more than cheating on his wife, has nothing interesting to say.I have rated this book 4 rather than 5 stars because of the sections dealing with Glen's trial. Pienciak himself states that the technical testimony in the trial was often confusing and numbingly boring. But he then details, in my opinion, too much of it in his narrative with the end result being that the book during those sequences becomes boring as well.This is a book that I think will appeal to any lover of the true crime genre who likes well researched and written stories. Pienciak does not appear to be particularly well known. I think he should be."},{"Title":"Murder at 75 Birch (Signet)","review":"It took me a while to get into this book but once I did, I found myself very interested.

This is the setting for Douglas Reeman's fourth book, as a special Royal Navy team is detailed into the Adriatic to destroy a Nazi floating drydock.The pressures and tensions of undersea warfare make this book more of a psychological thriller than some of Reeman's other titles. Nevertheless, naval warfare is still Reeman's specialty, and this book doesn't lack for exciting scenes.

When I received it and began reading it, I felt as though I'd been duped. The font is abnormally large making it look initially like a book meant for young adults or children. As I read I was completely shocked to see many misspelled words, subject verb disagreements, problems with modifiers, incomplete sentences, you name it. I considered sending it back, but I'm a serious fan of Shoeless Joe, so I kept on reading and discovered something very interesting. This book isn't the product of a huge publishing conglomerate, in fact, it's a truly home-spun effort. I examined the credits and realized the author published it himself much the same way an underground band would market it's own music. Members of his family provided the photos. It looks like he may have had friends proofread and edit it. It seems to have been printed locally as well. The upside is that it has a &quot;down home&quot; charm that a true fan of Joe Jackson can appreciate. I'm sure Joe would considerate it a literary masterpiece. I'm currently writing a one-man-play about Joe, and I've found things in this book that I haven't read before. After allowing myself to digest its differences, and accept what it really is, I can honestly say I'm thoroughly enjoying it.

Prices are way off - but that could be due to inflation (though this is 2005 edition and I went there in 2005).Overall - disappointing for a Lonely Planet book but functional."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Istanbul (City Guide)","review":"I have always found Lonely Planet books to be helpful. This is by far the worst I have ever purchased. The maps were helpful but so were the maps we picked up at the airport. This book is inappropriate and overly effusive.Most Lonely Planet books are written by people far more authoritative than this. They have either lived in those places or worked there for several months at a time. It seems like this writer just took a few trips to Istanbul with her friends and somehow landed a pretty sweet book deal. She barely touches the neighborhoods that are not the main tourist attractions.As for the touristy areas, she may as well have been a writer for the Turkish Tourism Association. She gives very little history of the places she writes about and does not give a realistic take on them. For instance, she says that Topkapi Palace is so great that \\"tourist attractions rarely get better than this.\\" What she fails to mention is that very little of the palace is left in its original state so you don't get a sense of palace life. The rooms are lined with shelves with old artifacts so it is essentially a museum in a palace. The Turkish government only let the palace become a tourist attraction bit by bit so this is to be expected. It is a great place but Maxwell hardly conveys that.Also, she says that Ayasofya will take your breath away. This is the worst-maintained historical place I have ever seen. She fails to mention that there has been scaffolding in the dome for nearly 10 years.Also, the ferry information she gives is wrong and we missed a trip to the Princes' Islands because of it.Lastly, I don't think phrases like \\"wet dream\\" belong in a tourism book. What does that even mean anyway?I am not saying Istanbul is not worthy of praise. It certainly is an amazing city in its fusion of East and West and I had hoped to be guided through it by someone who better understood that rather than a bubble gum fan. I honestly cannot understand how this book made it to publishing with its lack of detail and gushing style. I usually have far better Lonely Planet experiences. Hopefully the company will update this book with a new author soon who can give Istanbul the assessment it deserves."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Istanbul (City Guide)","review":"I am fan of Lonely Planent Encounter guides as I travel a lot in cities around the world for work. Very often I get to stay there for three months and therefore I fing Encounter guides very useful for me with all the nice shops and bars/restaurants tips given by locals.This book is full of outdated information even though is only from last year: many of the bars/cafes/restaurants mentioned are closed. Second, many addresses are wrong. Third and most important: all the shops, bars, cafes and restaurant mentioned are really REALLY tourist traps. I do not think the author is a local at all (if she is, she hanging with tourists all the time). Also, I did not find any value added in this guide book than any other Istanbul guide book.When I buy encounter (I have London, Tokyo, Berlin, Rome and they are top notch) I expect a different level.A new author (please a local this time....) should completely rewrite the entrie book.This book is a loss of money and TIME (you will loose time looking for the shop/restaurant she mentions finding out is either a tourist trap or wrong address...)"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Istanbul (City Guide)","review":"Worthless...incorrect info abounds. I am still on my trip in Turkey and and am in an internet cafe urgently wanting to warn others who might buy this piece of useless and misleading and just wrong crap.

Luckily I also have a copy of the Moon Handbook to Istanbul and Turkish Coast and this has proven to be ABSOLUTELY GREAT. No more of Istanbul Encounters. The trash can is too good for it, but it is too non-absorbant to put it to it's best use.I will take a seemingly innocuous facet of the book---ferry recommendations. The schedule times are wrong. Imagine missing a once a day Bosprous ferry cruise. I made it aboard. I wanted to see the European side so sat where the book recommended only to discover I was seated on the Asian viewing side of the vessel with no way to change to the other side since the ferry was full. Then I noticed the author had misidentified which shore several landmarks were on. I could only conclude the author had never actually taken the cruise but had relied on second-hand, wrong info. She also suggests taking the ferries to various Golden Horn locales failing to mention that the ferries run sporadically if at all, leaving me stranded and cursing. If you use this book after reading this review, heaven help you.It also directs the tourist to a couple of really abysmally dreary and to be avoided neighborhoods. The book devotes far too much space to recommending pathetic and often out of business restaurants.In my 40 years of travel never have I encountered such a poorly researched and presented travel guide.I can only conclude that unless they provide specific examples, the positive reviewers liked the format of the book but did not acutally attempt to use it--a plague among travel book reviews on Amazon."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Istanbul (City Guide)","review":"I love Istanbul, having lived there in the early 1990s. In 2005 I made my first return visit since then, and although I feel confident I know the city well, much has changed. This guide contained information which locals I stayed with weren't aware of, particularly public transport info.My main criticism of LP books is that the maps are pretty useless, and this is once again the case. You really need to get a separate map f you are going to venture beyond the really well trodden path. (There are a couple of bookshops on Istiklal Cadessi that sell good maps).I found the tone of the book suited me - it is enthusiastic about an amazing city, and the author certainly knows the place well. I don;t usually follow guide book suggestions for places to eat, preferring to discover those on my own. I am gald I allowed Maxwell to lead me to a couple of cafes and bars, however, as they were excellent.I recommend this book for both the novice and experienced traveller to the city (which I don;t with all LP City Guides - some, like Paris, I think reather too basic for the experienced visitor to that city)."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Istanbul (City Guide)","review":"This book is already annoyingly out of date, but is still the best guide to Istanbul out right now.

Why? Because they're not proper city guides.One would expect a city guide to have more detail about the city than a country guide. However, LP's Kindle city guides are just the chapter of the city that's covered in the country guide. so it's not the kind of in-depth info one finds in LP's own paper city guide. It's adequate information, but a let-down compared to what LP sells in print.ON top of that, LP lazily copied all the introduction stuff from the country guide into the so-called city guide. Lots of information I don;t need, plus several pages with itineraries for the whole country, covering sights and destinations that are not even covered in the city guide. And an index that doesn't work (not hyper-linked).This is what I mean- half-assed. LP has the content available- why don't they transfer it to Kindle format? Instead, they're doing this lazy copy-paste job that leaves much to be desired.I have the LP Istanbul print edition and wanted to replace it by the Kindle edition- but that has so much less information that i returned it and used my paper version instead.

This is a good story, more adventure than science, about his Polesotechnic League people. It is quite an adventure. David Falkayn gets thrown into the story and is saved by his boss and cohorts from an ignomious fate. The characters are pretty much stereotypes from mythology and history. I was surprised to realize that Nicholas van Rijn was based on Baron Von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, of Germany. There are aspects that are not appropiate to the Baron, but a lot of Mr. van Rijn's character is similar to what I read the Baron would have felt and done.There is a lot of daring do well in this story and some rather farfetched incidents that come out well. It is just amazing. Like Prof. Asimov and his pschohistoric saga, \\"Foundation\\", this is always peaceful to a fault. Quite a bit far from reality, but it is all science fiction."},{"Title":"Satan's World","review":"Satan's World is a planet that is falling out of interstellar space into the heat of a Blue Giant Star.

David Falkayn and his alien teammates Chee Lan and Adzel. Others also want this world, and another alien race is discovered that is a threat to the Polesotechnic League.

Each page also has a brightly colored picture that reinforces the text's message.The illustrations by Jeanette Winter are beautiful, richly colored accompaniments to the colorful life of Diego Rivera. The motifs in them are those typically found in Mexican folk art and include appropriate colors and subjects, often echoing those found in Rivera's work. This is a delightful and age appropriate introduction to an artist whose tempestuous personal life sometimes overshadows his outstanding artistic accomplishments both inside and outside of Mexico.

He was a daydreamer in school but his parents encouraged his artistic abilities. He studied art in Europe but was inspired by his memories of life in Mexico. Winter ends the book as Rivera's career as a painter whose \\"murals told the story of the Mexican people\\" is just beginning.The text is in English and Spanish. Each of Winter's illustrations is edged in a unique painted frame. I wish they had chosen to feature the illustrations in a larger format.

Diego spent his whole life painting, drawn to the vibrant colors and magical rituals of Mexico as well as the troubles of the people as they fought for equality and better working conditions.At birth, Diego was not a strong child. He had a twin bother, Carlos, who died before he reached the age of two. Diego's parents, fearing their other son would die from the same illness as his small brother, sent him to a nurse, Antonia, who was also an Indian healer and lived in the mountains. Her cozy hut fragrant with burning candles and healing herbs, Antonia's mountain home was filled with fresh air and the natural plants necessary to make the boy well. Diego entertained himself with the animals around him; he even had a pet parrot and was soon well enough to return home to his parents.Upon Diego's homecoming, his imagination already infused with the brilliant colors of nature, the boy began to draw and paint on very surface. He had difficulty in school, constantly distracted by the paintings he was dreaming of creating, unable to concentrate on anything but the wonderful world his mind inhabited. Finally Diego attended art school, but even that failed to stimulate the artist, for he felt constrained by the rules and the life drawings the teachers expected from their students. The paintings Diego imagined were of the bright fiestas, the celebration of the Day of the Dead and the struggles of the people confronting soldiers in the streets. Holding nothing back, it was Diego's plan was to show it all, the many faces of his beloved land. Returning from a visit to Italy, where he was impressed by the religious murals that covered the walls of the churches, Diego knew what he wanted to do.He spent the rest of his life painting murals throughout Mexico, drawn to the folklore, rituals and struggles of the Mexican people, hiding from nothing, even the sometimes brutal street battle between soldiers and the workers. Diego Rivera is revered in Mexico, his paintings as popular today as when he first created them. Surely this little boy was destined to write the history of his country on the walls and churches of Mexico, a gift to last through time. The illustrations are small and filled with brilliant colors, retaining the same style as Diego's murals, the faces of people and place recognizable in their simplicity and natural beauty.

The papers cover dolphin brain evolution, anatomy and physiology, event related potentials (ERPs) and latency in auditory processing, sensory and behavioral psychophysics, echolocation capabilities, communication capabilities, perception and intelligence, signaling behavior, and social cooperative behaviors.Some scientists today consider dolphin intelligence to be little better than a dog's. Others like Daniel C. Dennett come close to denying the existence of either intelligence or consciousness in people! But, perhaps Dennett has done us a favor. If it so hard to prove the existence of high intelligence and consciousness in people, then this explains why it is so hard to prove the existence of intelligence and consciousness in other species like dolphins!This text is refreshingly free of such contemporary biases. It sticks to medical, neurological, cognitive and physcial evidence. A lot of attention is paid, as it should be, to echolocation and the physics of sound transmission and reception underwater, the dolphin's biological version of active and passive sonar.One of the editors, Jeanette A.

It provides a practical toolset of writing techniques that are easy to understand, powerful and succinct.I highly recommend this book for a screenwritier interested in interactive storytelling, or for the game designer interested in story development.I understand why it has recieved some poor reviews from game design fans who simply want to create the next Quake, and do not properly appreciate story development, because this topic is not considered important to them.For those enlightened enough to appreciate emotion and storytelling, Freeman's book is a significant achievement and I believe lays out the foundation of meaningful story-development in many games to come. Because slick graphics and exciting action without engaging and meaningful storytelling become duller with each new day.The techniques presented by Freeman can be seen in many of the best games today-- put simply, they work. If you are a game developer who is open to embracing character development, of shying away from the cliche, and interested in combining gameplay with excellent storytelling, this book is for you.Consider GTA San Andreas-- why do we care so much about these characters? Freeman's 'emotional engineering' techniques can help you do the same thing.If you don't give a damn about storytelling or screenwriting, maybe this book isn't for you. And if that is case, perhaps you shouldn't be involved in game design-- because creating an emotional bond between the player and NPC's is becoming more and more important in game quality, as the novelty of the medium wears off. Unlike a million other game design books which dismiss story and character development, Freeman's book gives SORELY NEEDED insight into this severely neglected and overlooked aspect of game design.The only bone I have to pick with Freeman's book is his trademarking of the concept of \\"emotional engineering.\\" Freeman has collected the very best storytelling techniques and described their effective use in his book, though these techniques are certainly not exclusive to Freeman-- they have been crafted by screenwriters, novelists and storytellers over thousands of years. For Freeman to claim this assembled cluster of technique as his trademarked \\"emotional engineering\\" toolbox is a little overdoing it. But hey, I am not complaining. Freeman's techniques WORK. If you're sick of cliche game design, this is absolutely the book for you. If you aren't sick of cliche game design, perhaps you should read this book to learn why you should be."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"Something died in today's games. In the past years i would play a game and surrender to rush of adventure. Whole array of emotional experiences was vowen in those digital stories. In the age of today that element is simply lost in the commercial warfare. There is barely any game that a man can play and feel enriched as a human. That spirit from Deus Ex, Twisted Metal 1 & 2, The Longest Journey, Baldurs Gate saga and other gems... They are all gone. Lost somewhere in the realm of Azeroth where a bunch of unmature people are fighting over next spawn of whatever...This book reenliven emotional element, the way it can be put in games again. Very rarely these days games do have this spark.By many examples and through explanations, author pinpoints key areas for creating emotionally rich game.He shows a scene from a specific game or from concept art and break it into small pieces, explaining what would message be if this was like that and this like that.I personally recommend this book if you intend to create \\"human\\" game."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"Basically, Creating Emotion in Games is a collection of techniques that you can use in your games to help make the player become emotionally attached to the characters in the game. These aren't necessarily shortcuts, but ways of looking at characters and plot that are common in the screenwriting world, but aren't common in the world of videogames. He goes into ways of making the player care about the main character, about the side characters, about the actions they choose, about the world, etc. Nearly all of the techniques are valuable depending upon the context, and can be applied readily to games that are currently under development. They also focus on the part of game development that, sadly, most developers are unfamiliar with.Unfortunately, like many other game development authors, he has a self-aggrandizing tone that is difficult to get past. Occasionally he'll tell you the \\"greatest game idea ever\\" and all you can think is \\"Wow. That doesn't sound like fun at all.\\" The example games he gives for his techniques are completely generic video-game ideas without a lot of originality.Overall, though, this book succeeds in opening up avenues of exploration for game designers to improve their craft. It certainly added depth to the way that I think about the games I design, and did so in spades. I can't think of any more glowing endorsement."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I liked the book. A lot.But to be fair, I've met David Freeman and spent time with him on 3 different occasions. Once, when he attended a 3-day course I was teaching in Austin, and twice when he was teaching his exceptional Beyond Structure screenwriting course at the Los Angeles Film School. I like David, so it shouldn't be surprising that I would understand his book, appreciate its insights, and highly recommend it.But I think I would probably have liked his book and recommended it regardless of whether I had ever met him or sat through his class.In a nutshell, anyone who needs a linear, sequential, step-by-step method for creating emotion in games is going to be disappointed by this book's lack of numbered \\"steps.\\" Seven Habits of Highly Effective People it ain't.But if you're capable of:(1.) meeting a person who is a bit of an innocent, and(2.) accepting his style of creating intimacy with the reader through personal disclosure, and(3.) intuitively perceiving the big-picture principles he colorfully describes,you'll like this book and learn a lot from it.Think of this book as an early introduction to a new artform. David's later books on this subject will doubtless be more detailed and specific. God knows he's capable of it, as anyone who has ever taken his Beyond Structure screenwriting course will testify.Pioneers like David Freeman always excite the open-minded and frustrate those little men who hide behind technicalities.If you know yourself and are honest in your self-appraisal, you now know whether or not you would like this book."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"THANK YOU DAVID FREEMAN!!Not only is the book packed with tons of specific techniques for making games emotionally engaging, but Freeman shows exactly how to use every single technique, illustrating their application in (depending on the technique) hypothetical game designs, in dialogue samples, and in artwork.Furthermore, the organization of the techniques is wonderful, done in such a way that you can quickly locate the appropriate techniques for enhancing any aspect of game design. Freeman is an experienced game designer and writer, so the book is very rooted in reality. Additionally, from his highly popular \\"Beyond Structure\\" screenwriting workshop (the biggest in L.A., where he's quite well known) he has obviously mastered the ability to take what could be complex material and present it in ways that makes it simple to grasp and apply.I work as an animator in a very large LA game company. Game animators have always been concerned about emotion, for we try and put the characters' personalities and feelings into the way they move, fight, react, etc. What I liked most about this book that there are many techniques for making rich and intriguing characters which don't involve writing or dialogue at all, and which I immediately integrated into my animation palette.My sentiments about the book are echoed by others at my company. The designers, the character artists, and even the guy doing the music for our game have all extracted relevant techniques. In fact, the Creative Director assigned one of the designers the task of going through the book and noting every single technique that can be used on our current game.If you are involved in any facet of game design, this book is an absolute must."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"As someone who plays games as well as works in the industry, this book is a major breakthrough in isolating what is currently missing from most games. David does a brilliant job of bringing what he calls &quot;emotioneering&quot; to the gaming experience, finding literally hundreds of techniques to insure that players find deeper emotional gratification with the game play and the characters they're identifying with. David has great knowledge of games as well as television and movies upon which he draws. It's a great read - I found myself laughing, getting insights, and just having a great time with David's writing style and wit. I recommend this book highly to gamers, designers, writers, and anyone who wants to know more about what makes a great entertainment experience."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I know Dave personally. He is my boss. This book opened up a new world to me. I love playing video games, but after reading his book, i realized that if a character in a game has his family killed, i find out why i would feel bad. Its not just common sympathy. This book is serious. The people that it took to make this book and the amount of time it took, its amazing. Whats up with all these people hating? Just because you didnt like it, doesnt mean its not good. The people who review it poorly probably dont even play games. Honestly, come into this book expecting your mind to be blown away. This book will not displease. seriously, this book is 576 pages of gold."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I found the book really helped me understand how to use dialog in an entirely new way.I particularly liked the structure of it, it appealed to my programmers mind.If you work in games and are tired of cliche stories and dialog, you better read this book!"},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I work in the game industry and have done so for 23+ years. I mainly create role-playing games, which are driven for the most part by the quality of their stories. So, I know of what I speak when I say that David Freeman's book is the ONLY resource I would recommend to anyone looking for guidance about writing for games.All too often in this industry, we are pressured to be purely derivative in our work. &quot;Stand on the shoulders of Giants,&quot; I have often been told, in lieu of taking the time to try and figure out an original way to solve a story problem in a game. The only trouble is that the Giants being alluded to are named Cliche', Banal, Hackneyed, and Ripoff.Under the guise of pandering to the 'needs of our audience' we are encouraged to be unoriginal, sophomoric, amateurish, and, at worse, plagaristic. Why, in an industry that prides itself on its creativity, are we so instructed?Because of general ignorance in the industry about how HARD it is to write well. About how much time it takes to generate truly original material that is funny, dramatic, emotional, and true. Games don't go there very much because, for the most part, companies don't want to take the time or spend the money to do it right, and even when they do, they often don't know how to find their way there with both hands,No longer is that a valid excuse. David's methods, when applied artfully, will raise the creative bar in any game in which they are used. A master teacher and even more masterful writer, David's book is a must-have for any game designer, producer, art director, level designer, creative director, executive vice president, or quality assurance specialist.In short, anyone involved in game development.Bravo, David!"},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I'm a senior game designer with almost a decade of experience creating console based action/adventure games. I'm very confident in my ability to create fun gameplay, but I've always been hesitant about my abilities as a creative writer. The stuff I've tended to put into games has been &quot;okay&quot;, by game standards, but is also cliche-ridden and emtionally flat.But having read David's Freeman's book, I can honestly say that I now feel equipped with the necessary tools to create solid, dramatically compelling narratives for the games I work on from now on. David's book is filled to the brim with useful writing techniques that are easily applicable to any creative writing application... things like easy step-by-step processes to create emtionally complex characters, inserting symbolism into gameplay, writing realistic and entertaining dialog, etc. etc.Also, the book is great for those without any professional screenplay training (like myself), who are called upon daily to create Hollywood-level scripts for their games. All of David's techniques are backed up by real-world examples taken from hit motion pictures or top-notch games, and David also provides dozens of original gameplay and story ideas that could easily be used as a basis for great new games.As if that wasn't enough, the book is also full of really beautful art, drawn from comics, games, and plenty of original stuff too. The book is just beautiful to look at, with a very unique structure and typography that makes it easy to keep reading through its 500 information-packed pages.In short, if you're looking for inspiration to get you writing better games, you must get this book. While there's plenty of theory, it's really a manual for application. Use these techniques and you WILL create better dramatic content for your games."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I have to agree with the other negative reviews given here - this book was nothing more than a fluff filled, gimmick driven, repetition of screenplay advice which honestly isn't even all that good. What primarily irked me right off the bat (besides the horrendous titles and terms) was the blatant assumption the author has that games and movies are basically driven by the same forces, therefore, anything that works in movies would work in games too. They're both visual entertainment right? Poo on you sir, your assumption cannot possibly be wholly correct in that one is an active medium and the other passive. Are you really going to tell me then there are no differences in creating meaningful emotional experiences when the audience is passive in one and active in the other? I couldn't believe that he consistently used movies as examples and not a single real game. Shouldn't a book about games use games as examples? I'm not even going to attempt go in depth into all the basic concepts which were flawed and unsupported by any research - I'd basically end up writing a work as long as his. Just this - reader beware and save your money.I had to unfortunately read this for a class in my game design MFA and was severely disappointed and angered that this was considered good literature in the field. Its poor scholarship and reads like a time-share brochure, out to entice and enthrall the reader with flashy shiny things without providing any real content."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I've been writing for several years now, and after reading Freeman's book, I realize I still haven't gotten serious enough about writing. &quot;Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering&quot; is an excellent book for anyone interested in creating emotional experiences, and the techniques obviously carry over into many genres of writing. Just from the first two sections, I've seen my creativity soar, and the depth and involvment of the designs I am working on reach levels I never even considered.Here's the downside: It's not enough. Now that's not exactly a fault of the book, or of Freeman, as he stated he had to cull 1500+ Emotioneering techniques down to merely 300. In order to get everything, we'd be reading a whole library. Still, this book is an amazing and outstanding book to use as a diving board, but anyone really serious about writing for games (or other genres) should commit some very serious time into some very serious study.If this book inspires you as it has me, you'll find yourself more eager to do some serious writing time."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"For the naysayers: I'm not affiliated with David S. Freeman.I had the pleasure of taking a seminar from David S. Freeman several years ago, who specializes in narrative techniques exclusive to enriching the emotional experience in films. These techniques translate just as well to video games.Now obviously emotion in games is nothing new at the time this book was published, but the emotional aspect of storytelling in games was underdeveloped and hadn't reached the heights of cinematic storytelling. This book is not for those who are looking for a technical guide to game writing. As the title says, it is for CREATING EMOTION IN GAMES. You already have a story, now how do you ratchet up the emotional tension in a believable way that creates an emotional stake for the player? While the buzzwords are completely annoying, the book serves its purpose in opening up tried-and-true techniques that introduce emotion to gameplay without feeling sappy or over-baked.Don't look for paint-by-numbers guidance for writing a story that doesn't break gameplay. If you haven't already practiced writing, then you might be a little lost in this. If you're looking to enhance the emotional resonance of your existing story ideas but aren't sure how (and believe me, too many designers don't), then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"This book feels like a big PR piece for the writer who sounds like an egomanic. He does not even seem to understand the whole idea of game play! Some sort of washed up screenwriting teachier trying to apply his ideas to game development. I found this book almost unreadable - the ego and references to his life really get in the way. You have to really sift through so much attitude and filler to get to any points that are generally covered in most screenwriting books - but far better.Buy this book if you want an expensive ad for David Freeman."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"Mr. Freeman has captured, in a delightfully readable way, enough practical techniques to help me master my craft (and inspire my art) from here until I cack.My disclaimer: I am a playwright and a choreograher so I am jumping genres here.That disclaimed, I devoured the book and am now going back section by section, rewriting my current script utilizing his methods for creating deep and interesting characters, plot structures, dialogue, etc.Mr. Freeman makes the claim, and I concur, that it is the subtle things, not easily discernable, that raises the magic and artistry and captures the audience.He teaches carefully layered &quot;deepening and interesting&quot; techniques, i.e. &quot;simple ways to create complexity&quot; that he says will bring the players to your game and develop a loyal following for your product.I believe the book is improving my competency by (the cliched) leaps and bounds.

Meaning there are VERY clear examples of how the professionals pull it off and it's easy to adopt those tried and tested techniques yourself.It's also quite an amusing read as he does not get too bogged down, and ultimately surprises you with just how many parts you need to understand to make up an emotional story.I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"A definite don\`t buy!This guy takes credit for something that\`s not his own and he dares to Trade Mark it!Emotioneering is his!

I can't help but think the author wrote most of the glowing reviews himself, but apparently couldn't \\"emotioneer\\" enough creativity to think that normal people don't use their job description as their name."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I think David's book was pretty good. You do not need to be the seasoned professional, but it would be helpful to understand basic gaming mechanics before reading it. But as far as \\"Emotioneering\\" goes, in his classes and this book David has tried to make otherwise complex ideas and terms into easy-to-understand elements. Most of the techniques were not created by him and he says that in his class. Most have, in fact, been a part of storytelling for thousands of years. What David does here is give us the opportunity to understand how to implement them into our own designs and writing. It has taken him decades to piece this together from different medias. This book is a very good addition to his Beyond Structure class. For me, it reminds me of the techniques he passed onto us in the class. I would highly recommend it to any amature writer or game designer. We need more creative and deep characters in our games and movies."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"Finally, a book that covers what many of us in the game industry have been searching for -- a way to make games that offer players rich emotional experiences. The author, Mr. Freeman, has been working for most of the game industry heavyweights -- Sony, Atari, Activision, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Microsoft -- and so the book is rooted in solid game design and game writing experience.The state of emotion in games has been, up until this book, simply dire. Most gamers can count on one hand the number of games that triggered in them anything but the standard limited stable of emotions associated with battle (joy of victory, fear of being discovered or killed, etc.).Into this vacuum comes Mr. Freeman's book. Like a torrent of rain after a long drought, he offers so many practical and immediately applicable techniques (over 300 of them) that it's almost overwhelming.There are several things he does that make these techniques highly digestible. The first is that Mr. Freeman has categorized these techniques according to a very useful and almost intuitive system.Best of all, he gives demonstrations of exactly how to apply just about every single technique in a game's design. Thus this is literally a handbook that anyone can pick up and immediately start using.And let me not to forget to mention his humor. This is one funny guy! Most game designers have a good sense of humor, and Mr. Freeman is no exception.At the game development studio where I work, almost every game designer, and more than a few of the artists and programmers as well, have a copy of this book on their desks. (I've heard that the book is being used as a textbook in the game departments at Carnegie Melon and USC, which makes sense.)Mr. Freeman calls his collection of techniques \\"Emotioneering,\\" and some of the categories of Emotioneering include ways to make a player identify with the character he/she is playing -- techniques to use symbols to both convey emotion and help in gameplay -- ways to make NPCs (non-player characters) lifelike -- techniques to bond a player to the NPCs if so desired -- and ways to take the player through a wide range of emotions while playing the game.My guess is that many of the techniques in this book would have value for anyone who writes. I know that Mr. Freeman teaches one of the most popular screenwriting classes in Los Angeles (and other cities around the world) and that many Hollywood professionals have been his students. I imagine that some of what he teaches them has been retooled for this book.I'm glad Mr. Freeman decided not to keep all these techniques to himself, but instead share them anyone who wishes to design emotionally engaging games. I'm sure his Emotioneering techniques will have a huge impact on games for years to come. I've already seen the impact they're having at my company -- and in my own work."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"From: A Film ProducerFirst off, I want to say that I'm not an expert on games. Having worked in the film industry for many years as a producer and produced movies you might have actually seen, however, I'd like to think I know a thing or two about scripts. I probably wouldn't have taken a look at a game design book except that I was in a fellow producer's office and he was reading Freeman's book and laughing out loud. He showed me the funny passage - Freeman's wit is off-beat and original -- and I was hooked.Once I picked up a copy and started reading, I found that the delicious humor was just the icing on the cake. The cake is here a very substantial body of techniques - organized, practical, and a very powerful set of tools indeed for anyone who writes or works with writers.Someone in my capacity must frequently give \\"script notes\\" to screenwriters, guiding them through draft after draft. The techniques in this book have been a great help, and I find myself utilizing this book quite heavily. Like many in the film industry, I had heard of Mr. Freeman's reputation as a screenwriting teacher; I assume that's where he developed some of these creative tools.It's true that there are many techniques here which apply only to games, such as ways to make nonlinear stories emotionally powerful, or techniques to make someone playing a game identify with their character. However, even for someone who is interested in writing scripts or fiction instead of game design, or who, like me, must help bring out the best work in writers, this book is packed with techniques you'll find incredibly effective. Kudos to Mr. Freeman for writing such a book which is not only of value to so many creators, but is a fun read too."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"This book deals with techniques game writers can use to grab players attention.

I know we've never met, but would you mind reading this book, 'Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering' to me? I seem to be dyslexic.\\" In the midst of an everchanging world, it's nice to see that, throughout the centuries, one thing rings true: Games still can be emotional as long they are emotioneered properly with appropriate use of craft and art and creation."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"This is THE book everyone at my game company is reading. I like:1. The tons of techniques for creating emotion in games (weaving emotion right into the game designs -- these techniques go far beyond &quot;writing&quot;)2. The excellent examples showing how to use each technique.3. All the impressive art.4. Freeman's humor. (He's very funny, in a left-field kind of way.)Freeman knows his stuff, since he uses these game design and writing techniques in games he's worked on for Ubisoft, Sony, Activision, Microsoft, Atari, Vivendi Universal Games...Errrg! I've had TWO of these books swiped off my desk by others at my company. Therefore, be warned, Freeman's book contributes to crime.If you want recommendations, check out the back and front covers. This book has been endorsed by Wll Wight (The Sims), Scott Miller (Max Payne), Mike Morhaime (Warcraft; Diablo), Raph Koster (Star Wars Galaxies, Chief Creative Officer for Sony Online), and Warren Spector (Deus Ex).That should tell you something about the importance of this book.If you want to know how to create emotion in games, stop reading this review. You should be reading Freeman's book instead."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I first bought this book after reading all the great reviews of it here on Amazon. I passed it around at my company, and by now the game designers I work with and I (at a large Los Angeles developer) have worn our copies of this book ragged with use. With its 300 specific techniques, \\"Creating Emotion in Games\\" moves emotional game design ahead by decades.It's quite generous of Mr. Freeman to share so many secrets. It's clear why Will Wright (The Sims) chose to write the forward, and why gamasutra said it was the best book ever written on the subject.The book is helped by the fact that Freeman is such an expert on gameplay. He has been hired to help design and write games for Sony, Electronic Arts, Activision, Microsoft, Atari, Midway, 3D Realms, and others.In the book (which, by the way, is packed with beautiful art), Freeman divides all the ways of making games emotionally engaging into 32 categories. He then gives about 7 or 8 examples of techniques from each category, and shows exactly how to apply every one, without exception.For instance, one category involves techniques to get a player to identify with the character he/she plays. Another category is techniques to make the player bond emotionally with the NPCs (non-player characters). Another involves ways to make the world of the game emotionally rich and inviting -- be it a military game, science fiction, or something else.Freeman's clear and warm style, and his off-beat sense of humor make the book a fun and easy read.After buying the book, I got curious about the author and did a little research on Emotioneering on the web. I learned that Freeman is an in-demand speaker game conferences in the U.S. and around the world.He has sold a bunch of scripts to Hollywood studios, and is writing a pair of big fantasy films which are being shot in the summer of 2005. He also teaches the largest screenwriting workshop in Los Angeles (based at Universal Pictures) -- no small feat in a city with hundreds of such teachers.My goal as a designer is to enhance gameplay by moving players emotionally, and to leave them changed by my games. If you share these goals, your creativity is in for a rocket ride when you apply the techniques in this book."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"This book has about 10 anonymous, 5 star reviews that all sound the same. I'm VERY suspicious that these are fake reviews.I've read parts of this book and I understand why most of the non-anonymous reviewers have problems with it. While it has some interesting aspects, it doesn't go very in depth and the amount of ridiculous buzzwords (like Emotioneering) make it hard to swallow."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I'm surprised by the reviews from people claiming to be game industry veterans who say they've found this book to be useful. Either they're not really in the game industry (possibly PR flaks?) or they haven't learned much in their time here.General comment on content: Between the massive amounts of interior artwork, the big body type, the big (and frequent) headers, unusually wide margins, and lots of white space, there's probably only about 75 pages of actual information in this \\"500-page\\" book. Think of it as more of a booklet.Mr. Freeman's credits are hard for me to verify. Web searches turn up some titles he's gotten credit for contributing to, but none of them were AAA titles. And there's no way to know for sure how much he actually contributed to them. Having been both a freelancer and internal writer/designer, I know outside writers who've been completely useless to games' development, so a claim of credit doesn't mean much, IMO. I have no clue what expertise he has with movies or other media, but I'm not too hopeful after reading his book on game writing.One big problem I have with his book is the jargon he insists on excreting everywhere. This isn't game industry jargon, movie jargon, or any sensible jargon that I know of. It's jargon he seems to have made up to try to claim writing techniques and mechanics as his own. And he really, really likes to capitalize the (sometimes excruciatingly long) names of \\"his\\" techniques. A sense of impending doom approaches when you first see the word \\"Emotioneering\\" (capitalized, of course), looms high overhead when you see such phrases as \\"Plot Deepening Technique\\" and \\"Dialogue Interesting Technique,\\" and crashes down with skull-crushing force upon reading the phrase \\"Player Toward NPC Relationship Deepening Technique.\\" Ouch. Lack brilliance? Try BS!How can anyone read a sentence such as \\"A Character Being Genuine is an NPC Rooting Interest Technique, but not a Character Deepening Technique\\" without laughing? (And, yes, the capitalization and comma fault are the author's.)The bottom line is that this book doesn't seem (to me) to have much of value to offer anyone who's been in the industry for any length of time. If you're trying to break into the industry, however, you could be deluded into thinking that you're learning something useful here. FWIW, that's the opinion of someone who's actually been in the games industry since 1984. I keep trying to read this book, hoping to get something out of it, but can't get more than 20% into it before giving up."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"If books had a dressing contest, this one would surely take first place. It applies every imaginable gimmick for the sole purpose of impressing the reader. There are many pictures in it, all of which are sensational adolescent fantasy material, many filling a full page and sometimes in color. The text is broken up in various ways, with intervening boxes and sidebars in incosistent shapes and sizes, as if designed specifically to distract you. Its \\"techniques\\" are trademarked under the bombastic name \\"Emotioneering\\", and worst of all, the author makes a point of repeatedly flaunting his screen(game)writing prowess.But what are these \\"Emotioneering\\" techniques? has freeman actually invented a set of technical rules which applies to drama? No, that would be Aristotle. If you're really interested in the rules of drama, that's whom you should read. What Freeman refers to as \\"Emotioneering\\" are nothing more than a pile of bad screenwrting practices you can pick up in any second rate screenwriting book - except for two differences; first, in this sorry book they are given mind-blowing names like \\"technique stacking\\" and \\"Emotionally Complex Moments and Situations Techniques\\", and second, the examples used are said to be taken \\"from games\\" instead of from films, but, of course, all of these \\"games\\" have been imagined by Freeman for the purpose of the book (which he expressly admits), because there IS no real world game that would serve his purpose - he is really talking about films.But when it comes to films, Freeman seems to think the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about the best you can get. Ask any amateur screenwriter and they'll tell you that the one award these films honestly deserve is Worst Screenplay. The Lord of the Rings, like Freeman's book, is all spectacle and no content.What kept me trudging through the morass of simpleton notions and overflowing filler text was the hope that, as a man who has some experience with writing for games, Freeman would have a few words to say about the intersection of stories with interactivity - the most alluring aspect of combining games with stories. Although he doesn't take up the subject directly, he does mention at some point that writing for games is complicated by the need to accommodate for the actions of the player. He says that he uses branching statements in his scripts for this, and that this is a very tough problem. Other than that, there are some minor points like how to allow the player to experience the events of your computerized screenplay in several different orders (which is made possible only by the ridicules simplicity of the story proposed as an example), but nothing which actually deals with letting a human have a meaningful interaction with a story.To summarize, except for the pictures (if that's your cup of tea) I really can't see any reason to buy this book over any other random heap of text. If you want spectacle, you got it. If you want knowledge, you do yourself a favor and read three books: The Poetics by Aristotle, for the real \\"Emotioneering\\" techniques, Chris Crawford on Game Design, for an understanding of why the problem is not nearly as simple as Freeman pretends it to be, and Chris Crawford on Interactive Storytelling for the best solutions to the problem currently available."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"The book has some good ideas -- but they are incomplete. If you want The Rest of the Story you will need to pay Freeman for his services. Example: Freeman says he has a list of over a thousand character traits for creating characters.

Caveat emptor."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I've had a handful of screenwriting classes, and some limited practical experience with making games. I thought this book delivered on what it promised, yet at the same time I felt there are many problems with the way its written.Freeman uses what seems to be a highly methodological way of dealing with the 'soft' issue of emotion in games. You'll find countless references to elaborate terms such as &quot;NPC Toward Player Relationship Deepening Techniques&quot;, &quot;Emotionally Complex and Situation Techniques&quot; and so on. Some very specific examples even get their own designated capitalized label. Structured as this seems, it actually only helps to make things confusing. A lot of the &quot;hundreds&quot; of techniques are quite similar, and without a clear overarching framework, things get very convoluted.Some great knowledge and insights are contained in this book, mind you. I personally found some of the hypothetical games and game scenarios that are presented valuable. However, the knowledge is fragmented and disorganized. Freeman quickly jumps from one thing to the next, without a clear underlying logic as to how all the information is distributed among the chapters. The book especially emphasizes quantity - Freeman even refers to things beyond the scope of the book, i.e. &quot;this would take way too long to explain, but let me give you the short version&quot;. I think the book would be a lot better if the information were better organized.The book leaves a lot to be wanted in terms of focus and clarity.

You won't learn any of that here.On the other hand, if you want to know how to hire David Freeman and the Freeman Group, this book is for you.In general, there are 2 types of &quot;How to&quot; book: 1) &quot;How you&quot; books, which actually try to teach you something; and 2) &quot;How I&quot; books, which explain how the author will do what he does as soon as you hire him to do it.This is definitely a &quot;How I&quot; book.Finally, any book that sums up the plot of &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; as &quot;Two Major Characters Change Places&quot; (capitalized because this is one of the vaunted &quot;1500 Emotioneering Techniques&quot;) is not going to teach you anything useful."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I've worked in the game industry, and like many other recent reviewers, I have doubts about many of the positive reviews for this book. Too many of them 1. are written by someone who gives his job title but not a name, 2. are written by someone has written no other reviews, 3. are written in the same gee-whizz-buy-this style. Interestingly, none of them show the insight into the games industry an insider would have (the book's author is a consultant with very limited experience) and none of them refer to the books considerable faults, which have made it rather more disliked than otherwise by professionals."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"Good book. A good book indeed.For those of us interested in writing/designing pc and videogames, a book like this one really comes in handy.But before I ramble with the good side of it, I'll mention the three aspects I disliked about it:First, I was a bit annoyed with the cocky attitude. Most of the time it sounded as if, either you use emotioneering techniques (term created by David Freeman) or your game will never have emotion or be any good at all. This might sound like a big deal, but I have to accept it, after reading the explanation of what emotioneering is and why it is better than simple writing, well, he does make some very good points... nonetheless, the attitude bothered me a bit so you might want to be ready for it.The second thing that bothered me is that the author teases TOO much about the hundreds of other techniques that exist... but that is it. I do understand that there had to be a limit as to how long the book would be and mentioning all the techniques and explaining them in a proper way would take way too much, but still, where am I supposed to learn about the rest? I WANT MORE!The last issue doesn't really have to do with content as it does with form. And is definitely not a very big issue, as a matter of fact, I only mention it because I thought that, in order to stay as objective as possible, I needed more \\"bad points\\".The thing is there are many typing mistakes. They aren't orthographic mistakes, they definitely look just like typos, but still they hinder a bit the quality of the book.And that is it, as far as I am concerned, the rest of the book is just good stuff.For starters I have to praise the great pointers on creating characters. The ideas for both the physical and internal aspects of an NPC and PC opened my eyes to a whole new way of giving life to characters. And the goodness doesn't stop there. You also get techniques for plot, dialogue, relationship between NPCs and PCs, ways to make the game more immersive, pointers on cinematics, etc.Trust me, even when David Freeman cuts back on the list of techniques available (and if you are like me, you'll also be left craving for more), there are many more than the ones I mentioned, and most of them have subdivisions with great explanations and examples of how to use them or how they have been used.I am sure you'll also enjoy the foreword by Will Wright (The Sims guy) and the lovely art scattered throughout the book. Another point in favor of Mr. Freeman is the fact that he gives credit where credit is due. There is even a section at the end of the book that mentions every artist, where you can find more about them and comments on most of them.The last tidbits of ideas are very interesting, very fun to read because they seem like the ramblings most of us write in that old notebook, the scattered ideas that someday might find their way into a book and/or game.Now I think I've written too much, so I'll wrap this up by saying that if you are interested in game designing/writing, this book is a must for you. You won't regret buying it and if you do... nah, that won't happen if you are interested in games , I'm confident about that =)"},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"I'm somewhat surprised to see all the hate here for this book. It's one of the few books I recommend to new people in the industry (I've been designing and writing games since 1996). It's all focused on storytelling, not gameplay, but it has the best sense of how the two converge that I've seen. The advice in here is actual practical advice that you can use in making a game. Most of the storytelling discussions in other books are high-minded literary theory or purely from a linear non-game perspective. This has some movie bias, but not much. And it does try to make the material fun and attractive, which seems to annoy many reviewers but I found refreshing.And I like that it doesn't focus entirely on dialog - it looks at all aspects of storytelling and emotion-building across the design. It's not a perfect book and won't make you a great game writer on its own, but it will make you think of some new techniques you might have forgotten and get you thinking about your games as more than just gameplay, which is good."},{"Title":"Creating Emotion in Games: The Craft and Art of Emotioneering","review":"It does tell you a lot of techniques, but it doesn't tell proper practice. Its ok for game design since the (western) industry isn't very sentimental when it comes to games. Mostly the Japanese are coming out with RPGs with a lot of sentiment. I think its good that someone is trying to help with dry gaming. I do like games like unreal, tetris, street fighter, which have little to no plot, but I don't like to be a weapon of mass destruction without a cause.The book can be comparable to a core paper-pencil rpg book for storytellers.As far as \\"emotioneering,\\" I think its a catch phrase. And many of the dimensions used for creating characters you could get out of a white-wolf book.Overall, the book is good at telling you how to use techniques for characters and story/plot.

Darcy was a very feisty and confident heroine and Reece was almost a regular guy with his flawed personality. Note that I said \\"almost\\". My main beef with this book is the same one I have with a lot of Harlequin Mills and Boon romances: why do the heroes have to be incredibly wealthy men? I know romance novels aren't reality, but I like to relate to aspects of them and nothing turns me off more than a billionaire hero (except maybe a heroine that is a shy virgin).That said, I gave this book 4 stars because I found it to be well plotted, humourous, interesting and most of all because I liked the hero and heroine and I cared about them and their story. I've been reading a lot of romance novels lately (totes props for Christmas vacation time) and this is probably the best of the bunch and certainly one of the superior Harlequin's.The sex scenes are really well done, explicit but sensual.

Seeing his fundamentalist manifesto at a local Target Store (remember, Target kicked out the Salvation Army from its premises and renamed Christmas Tree as \\"Holiday Trees\\") I immediately picked it up and started reading.The teachings of this book, like Pastor Hagee's sermons are absolutely absurd. John Hagee is more of a Jewish lap dog, than a servant of Christ. He believes the Jews are the apple of God's eyes (he mentioned this fact like 10 times in a 1-hour sermon) and that the only way to salvation is for Christian's to become virtual slaves to the Jewish Master. The good Reverend does occasionaly takes a break from his pandering to \\"GOd's Chosen\\" to take a swipe at Muslims and Islam.Long story short, this book is filled with factual inacuracies and a disgusting bias. What true facts are present, are twisted by Hagee to suit his bigotry.As a Christian supporter of the Palestinians, I stand firmly behind them in the war brought upon them by the Jews. But Christians in America must also realize that we are at war with the Jews here in America as well.

I just read the last portion of the book as a study, taking a long time to digest what he is saying. I know very little about the author but am an evangelical Christian.My understanding after studying the book is that Jews may have their eyes opened by the Holy Spirit. I don't remember reading anywhere that anyone would be saved aside from hearing the Gospel and believing it.I found this book very helpful in confirming Bible prophecy. I don't agree with everything Pastor Hagee writes. My biggest concern with his book is that he keeps saying he is writing the book \\"in April 2005,\\" and then saying things such as, \\"In September, 2005....\\" While I realize it took months to write the book, it appears to me that much of it was written much later than spring 2005.I appreciated seeing Pastor Hagee's perspective, but I will continue studying my Bible, praying, and asking God himself to show me what He wants me to know."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"John Hagee says he wrote this book April of 2005. It would be seen as prophetic if he would have released it then, but since he did not, we will either have to disbelieve him or take his word for it. The truth is much of this book is a rehash of Dawn Over Jerusalem that Hagee wrote back in 1998. The only fresh stuff here is that Iran is currently a nuclear problem for the United States and Israel. The reason I gave this book three stars is because Hagee states his purpose is to make everybody aware of how important the Iranian escalating conflict is to the world. Hagee does this, but any newspaper in the Western World could have done the same. His second point was to inform us of the countdown in the Middle East as all being a part of God's plan for the Jews. I think that Hagee's interpretation of Scripture is skewed, but nevertheless, he does lay out clearly his interpretation of those scripture. Hagee says over and over again that \\"Anti-Semitism is sin and as sin it damns the soul.\\" This is a major point that he wishes to get across and because of its repetitive nature Hagee does accomplish his goal.Hagee opens by speaking about Iran and the current crises that the U. S. and Israel as well as other parts of Western Civilization and the world face. He even gives a map of Iran and where at least eight of the nuclear development facilities are. He tells of privileged conversations that he has had with former Prime Ministers of Israel and other sources that he does not name both in Washington and in Israel. The first part of the book is interesting in the same way that the newspaper stories are interesting. Hagee then begins to speculate about what kinds of nuclear attacks are going to happen in the USA. He predicts, unashamedly that America is going to have a nuclear bomb set off in not just one but several major cities in the United States at the same time.After this Hagee speaks about Islam and how militant the religion, or at least the radical fundamentalist element of the Islam religion really is. Hagee is not far off base here. He then goes his own history lesson from the Hagee point of view about the history of the nation of Israel. It is not so much that the facts of history that he gives are inaccurate, but he has a particular bias on the facts. For example, he says that Christians forsook the Jews during the Roman siege. If they did it is because Jesus himself told them to leave the city, as well as Jewish Christians and all Jews for that matter. Jesus warned and predicted the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD. The city was under the judgment of God. Hagee may have the historical story correct, but he puts a negative spin toward the \\"Christians\\" that left and went to Pella. He does give a history of Jewish people being wrongly persecuted, but at the same time he fails to mention how the Jews persecuted the Christians in history. Let me say that he is correct however, so called Christians were wrong at many junctures in history for their persecution of Jews. Another twisted concept is the story of Began and the bombing of the King David Hotel. Hagee says this was not a terrorist act. I guess it all depends on which side of the act that you are on. The Al Quada faction responsible for 911 probably sees that as an act of war, but everyone else defines it as terrorism. Hagee wants to present Israel as pristine and pure for all to support, but this is dishonest. When Israel of old tells her own story they include all of their failures in the story. They never paint a puritanical picture of themselves, but would tell the truth about their own sins and the sins of their kings. They did not make excuses or conveniently leave things out. I would hope that Hagee would reevaluate his approach to this, but he seems to think that brash arrogance is more convincing than the full truth.Several times Hagee speaks of Anti-Semitism and how that it is sin. He is right, but does he not know (I am sure he does) that the Arabs are descendents of Shem as well and the term applies to them as well? Hatred against Jews or Arabs is wrong, not just hatred against Jews.In the third section of this book Hagee gives his version (of which he claims scriptural support) of the future. He bases most of his end time events scenario on Ezekiel 37-39, Jeremiah, and portions of Daniel. He maintains that the Bible teaches that Russia will form an evil alliance with the Arab nations and march on Israel and that God will step in and send an earthquake, cause the armies to panic and turn on one another and rain down fire and brimstone upon the invading armies in order to demonstrate to the nations that He is God and that He loves Israel. He consults some older Hebrew Scholars to get the fact that Rosh in Ezekiel really means Russia and Meshech means Moscow and blanketly says that this is attested by virtually all scholars. He is right if you consider all Scholars to be Hal Lindsey, John Walvoord, and whoever else has graduated from Dallas Theological Seminary. The fact is that such an interpretation is scarce among scholars. If it were so prevalent he would not have to go back to the 1800's to find a lexicon to support his (really Hal Lindsey's) theory. It seems to me that for someone who is suppose to take the Bible literally, he does an awful lot of not taking it literally when it comes to the weaponry described as bows and arrows. Hagee sees nuclear rockets and such. This is not the only place that he takes literal interpretation not so seriously.Hagee takes several chapters to discuss Romans 9-11 in order to prove that the Jews are the elect and chosen of God. He says that this portion of Romans is God's position paper on the nation of Israel and that it is what he calls the magnificent codicil. In other words it is a stand-alone document that does not need Romans 1-8 and 12-16. I do not have time or room to take this on here. Let me just say here that there is plenty of evidence to the contrary.Pastor Hagee takes a two people of God approach and he does so emphatically. In perhaps his bizarrist (and that is saying a lot) interpretation of scripture for someone who says that scripture should be taken literally, Hagee interprets God's promise to Abraham saying that the stars of the heavens which Abraham was to count was the Church and the sands of the Sea shore are the Jewish people on earth. This is a remarkable stretch of exegeses that has no New Testament support whatsoever.Perhaps most damaging in Hagee's theology is his belief that the Jews have a different covenant and that the proclamation of the gospel is not powerful enough to open their eyes to who Jesus is and be saved. This is where Hagee is at his most heretical.For me, Hagee has missed the message of Jesus in the Gospels all together. Jesus condemns the Jewish establishment of his day (Hagee would agree with this statement with limitations to Caiphas and the Herodians only) and the Temple and predicted there coming destruction. Jesus reconstitutes Israel in himself, in other words Jesus message is repent and believe the gospel or give up your way of being Israel and come trust me for mine (see N T Wright). Jesus redefines Israel, not as a Gentile Church replacing Israel, but by being the true Son (Hagee rightly points out that Israel is called the true son of God), or the New Israel himself. Jesus is the New Israel and appoints twelve apostles and tells them that they will be the new judges over the twelve tribes of Israel. He is not only Israel but also He, himself replaces the Temple as well. Jesus said \\"Destroy this Temple and I will build it again in three days.\\" He spoke concerning his body that would be raised from the grave after three days. Hagee does not see that Jesus fulfills in himself the promises made to Abraham and David. This is the point of the opening of Matthew and the genealogies that are there given. Anyone interested in further discussion send me an email at darrengjohnson38@yahoo.com.I realize that by criticizing John Hagee I am opening myself up to people not liking my review. People generally judge something like this on the basis of whether you were kind to their favorite preacher and not was the book review really helpful. There are some good things in this book,the historical chart at the end being one. Hagee also wakes us for the necessity to pray for a hurting part of the world that we would rather forget about and hope that it just goes away. I am not sure if there will be an attack like Hagee predicts and even if I were sure I am not sure what good it would do to know. We cannot live in fear. We must hold to the hand of the one who holds our future in His. Jesus the Messiah is the answer. I only wish Hagee would say this more."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Although I enjoyed reading certain parts of this book, the fact that John Hagee seems to be struggling with God's work of election - God's choice of people to be saved, and stating that the 'non-believing in Jesus' Jews are still considered to be holy (page 183) at this time of history, forced me to rate this book with only 1 star.On page 192, he states \\"the doctrine of divine election applies to nations and not to individuals. A remnant of the Jewish people has been divinely elected, and when the Gentile era ends, 'all Israel will be saved'.\\"However, my Bible reveals that God elects individuals and not nations. Although the nation of Israel has rejected Jesus, thousands of individual Jews have come to faith in Him (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 6:1) and many more after those times.Hagee's interpretation of the \\"remnant\\" is also questionable. Some, but not all of the branches of Israel were removed. God always preserved a believing remnant.God did not choose this remnant (small part) because of race, culture, etc. but solely because of His grace. Human effort (Thora) and God's grace are mutually exclusive ways to salvation (Acts, Galatians, Titus).The fact that \\"all Thorah Jews on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur attend the synagogue where the liturgy calls for Jews to pray that their sins would be forgiven and their names written in the Book of Life\\" (Hagee-page 129), doesn't take away the Bible truth that God doesn't forgive sins without Jesus' blood sacrifice on Calvary's Cross and faith in Him as Israel's Messiah, our Saviour and Lord.The nation's blindness does not extend to every individual Jew. Most of the Jews were blinded because of their hardened hearts, just as what is happening to non-Jews.But thank God, Israel's blindness is not irriversible. God intends to use His offer of salvation to the Gentiles to draw the nation back to Himself.It is also clear that the balance of Israel will be regrafted in, but only through the cross and by faith in Jesus as their Messiah. And you can't blame God for the fact that most Jewish people reject and are still rejecting Jesus.Israel's fall is temporary. In the future, Israel will repent of unbelief and will embrace the Messiah (Zech.12:10). In the terms of Paul's analogy, God will at that time gladly graft the (believing) Jewish people back into the olive tree of His covenant blessings because it was theirs originally - unlike the wild branches (the Gentiles).\\"All Israel\\", all the elect Jewish people alive at the end of the age, not the believing remnant of Jews within the church - since the remnant has already embraced the truth of the gospel.In the end, God will judge the apostate church, just as surely as He will judge apostate Israel. Salvation is ever and always by faith alone."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I first learned of this book by watching an interview with Pastor Hagee. This book is on the forefront of the political debate with Iran.The Chapters of the book start with a discussion on where the situation with Iran is today.

The next chapter deals with what the future holds and concludes with a Christian perspective on the situation.Hagee's writing style is clear and consise. The book is compelling and chilling. It is a page turner. I couldn't put it down. This book is not about preaching the bible, it is about the realities that Western Civilization faces with the Islamic Radicals in Iran and their quest for Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction.With Iran's leader telling the world that Israel should be \\"wiped from the map\\" and his denials about the holocaust, we can see how his pursuit of Nuclear Weapons is a threat to Israel and to the United States of America.Hagee points out that Iran must be prevented from obtaining nuclear weapons. He provides detailed information obtained from Israeli Officials that suggests Iran will have the Nuclear Weapons by October 2006. The book tells us that Israel will not allow Iran to threaten its' existence and will take military action.The book then talks about the response of the Arab Nations and how that ties into the bible regarding Revelations.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about the growing Radical Islamic threat the world faces from Iran."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Just as most Americans look at Islamic radicals and ask \\"Why do they hate us?\\", Jews look at Christian Zionists and ask \\"Why do they love us?\\" Some believe that the only reason for Christian support of Israel and Jews is that Jews play a crucial role in the \\"End Times\\" theology of some Protestants. And to be sure, this is one of Hagee's motives: he asserts that shortly before the Second Coming, \\"144,000 Jewish people [will] have a supernatural revelation of the identity of Jesus Christ as Messiah.\\" [What happens to the rest? Hagee is a bit fuzzy on this point.]But contrary to liberal myth, End Times theology is not, repeat not, the only motive for Hagee's philo-Semitism. To oversimplify a bit, Hagee interprets the Bible (both Old and New Testaments) to mean that Divine love for the Jewish people is boundless, and that as a result God favors Gentiles who favors Jews, and punishes Gentiles who harm Jews and/or seek to dispossess them from all or part of the land of Israel.Although we Jews are temporarily \\"blinded\\" (according to Hagee) to Jesus's status as Messiah, Hagee interprets Romans 11 to mean that this is a necessary part of the Divine plan.Since I don't share Hagee's religious assumptions, I express no opinion as to the correctness of his interpretations; I leave that task to people far more familiar with the Christian Bible than I.Nevertheless, I do give this book only 3 stars, partially because I don't quite understand its organization: the first few chapters of the book [which discuss Islamic extremism] seems to me to be only marginally relevant to his defense of Jews. From the standpoint of 2008, the first half of the book seems hysterical. He claims that Iranian entry into the nuclear club is imminent- yet Iran still has no nuclear weapons. He suggests that the U.S is chock-full of sleeper cells and that al-Qaeda already has nuclear weapons- yet nothing resembling a major terrorist attack has happened in almost seven years. He claims that Islam is inherently intolerant- yet fails to explain why, during the Middle Ages, the Ottoman Empire was less anti-Semitic than much of Christian Europe."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"\\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" joins the pack of those funny, alarmist books of \\"prophecy\\" that always seem to get published when the world is going through tense times. Keen salesmen like John Hagee always know where to point out Satan and when to predict the world's end, remember in the 1980s when the Soviet Union was apparently the trigger for the Second Coming? Hagee and his ilk have found the perfect cash cow in predicting or even demanding war with Iran because these sorts of books always make money, their flock are always desperate to see what their glorious leaders have to say about who this week's boogey man of the apocalypse is. \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" is a collection of various thoughts, mostly anti-Muslim and pro-imperialism, with a rabid devotion to Israel that borders on hysteria. Hagee's basic premise in the book is simple: Muslims hate us because we are Christians and our women wear mini-skirts, so therefore we must back Israel on an apocalyptic war to destroy Iran, conquer a good chunk of Syria and Lebanon and then wait for Jesus to return. Oh, and Russia, because you can't forget them, somehow get involved. The book's treatment of Muslim and Iranian culture is incredibly ignorant, Hagee doesn't even bother to explore modern Middle Eastern history, he goes from Persia in the Biblical times and jumps right into the present day. This is convenient for Hagee considering in 1953 we overthrew Iran's elected government because it nationalized the nation's oil, re-installed the brutal regime of the Shah and then saw the Shah be overthrown by the 1979 Iranian Revolution which gave rise to the regime currently in power. Hagee also skips over Israeli atrocities in the occupied territories, sometimes even endorsing them because apparently Arabs aren't worth squat next to \\"God's Chosen.\\" \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" gives some flashy predictions and interpretations taken from Biblical prophecy, but a lot of Hagee's conclusions fall flat when compared with basic history, with basic facts of what's been happening in the Middle East. Never is the CIA training of what became Al Qaeda mentioned, or our current backing of brutal regimes in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, both Muslim nations you think would figure in Hagee's end-times scenario. It's a pity the book was published before the NIE report revealed Iran has no nuclear weapons because this is Hagee's prime obsession: Attacking Iran. The man is convinced the U.S. must go on a suicidal, catastrophic mission to bomb Iran back to the stone age. Of course Hagee forgets Pakistan has nukes, or that Israel is also pretty well-stocked when it comes to nuclear weapons. Hagee's predictions are fine and reassuring for the average American conservative, but they fall apart once you take the time to read something other than apocalyptic Christian literature. Hagee of course fully backs the invasion and destruction of Iraq, another example of the frightening vision these groups have for the world. \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" has a short shelf-life, but a very chilling premise only in the doctrines Hagee promotes."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"....because I disagree with some of the Pastor's Theology; however, I've never read a book (except the Holy Bible) with which I agreed totally.

I'm not talking about current events, or history, I'm talking about Bible facts. For instance, pg 78 - Peter cut off the ear of a soldier? Bible says, \\"servant of the high priest.\\" Pg - 87, Solomon built the second temple? I thought he built the first temple. Pg 107 - the first source of contention in the church was doctrine Acts 15. What about the widows of Acts 6? pg 129 - Hagee's math is off by 130 years. He said that the Romans conquered Jerusalem in 70 A.D. then, it would be over 2000 years later they would be declared a state. That would mean it would be at least 2070 A.D. But it was 1948. Over exaggeration is annoying. Pg 147 - I had no idea Gideon and his 300 men fought the Philistines, I thought it was the Midianites. Pg 203, The morning after Elijah ate the food from the angel God asks, \\"What are you doing here?\\" It was actually 40 days later. Pg 237 - Haman and his 7 sons were hanged from the gallows Haman prepared for the Jews of Persia. Uhhhh, Haman and his 10 sons, and the gallows were prepared for Mordecai, not all the Jews of Persia. I'm confused, who proof-read this if is has been revised and updated? #2 - I'm confused...If Hagee has been preaching for several decades, shouldn't he know his Bible better than to have all these errors? Some would say that it's not a big deal. It is to me. Hagee should stop writing maybe, and start reading, his Bible! And stick to preaching, he's a far better preacher than he is an author. Book is not bad, just, inaccuracies from someone who should know better bothers me."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":". . . on this poorly written, badly researched -- and, in some places, very bigoted book.Just to clarify a few points, before I get bashed as an anti-Christian kook:I am a devout Christian; I have been all my life; I have dedicated my life to serving God and the Church, and to spreading the good news; I am a teacher, and spend my time encouraging the study of Scripture and Church History. Furthermore, I believe that Jesus will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead. I'm not a secularist, trying to attack Christianity.This being said, in my professional opinion, this book does great disservice to the Body of Christ.Item: The entire doctrine upon which this book is based -- fundamental dispensationalism -- is a doctrine formulated in the 19th century by a radical anti-Catholic sectarian. It is not a doctrine of the \\"End Times\\" which would have been recognized by any of the Fathers of the Church -- OR by the great Reformers -- OR by the leadership of the Great Awakening. It is a novel doctrine; a \\"doctrine of man\\" that has little to do with authentic Christianity -- Catholic, Orthodox, or Protestant.Item: This book takes a look at Judaism, Catholic Christianity, and Islam through rather oddly tinted glasses. Dispensational fundamentalists WANT and NEED Judaism (and Israel) to mean a certain thing -- but it is certainly questionable as to whether the average 21st century practicing Jew would recognize his own religion based on what Hagee says. The same is true for Hagee's views on Islam. Frankly, he does nothing more than repeat cliches, many of which are stereotypic at best and offensive at worst. Hagee's views of Catholicism and the history of that Church are just plain wrong. To me, this is intellectual laziness -- because there are good history books and source materials out there. Catholic Apologetics has picked up tremendous ground over the last 20 years -- and radical anti-Catholics just can't get away with the propaganda they used to.Item: Finally, the research used in this book is of highly questionable quality. It certainly does not rise to the level I would expect in a college-level theology class. Free, on-line encyclopedia websites (which anyone can edit at any time) are not valid source material.The dispensational fundamentalists have now been predicting the End of the World for about 40 years now. Every timetable they have devised has been demonstrably false. Yet they continue with false prediction after false prediction (making a great deal of money in the process).Our Lord Himself stated that no one knows the day nor the hour. So let's just leave it at that! Preach the Gospel; live your life as though today could be your last -- and don't worry about what is God's business -- and not Hagee's."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I have read \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" in its entirety, along with other books by Rev. Hagee, and though I acknowledge his research effort and do not doubt the accuracy of his estimation of Iranian war capabilities and intentions; I am thoroughly convinced he goes way beyond scriptural boundaries in his association of modern Jews, Judaism, and Zionism with the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. To borrow one of Brother Hagee's phrases... He is 'exactly wrong'.First of all, \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" is generally based on the faulty premise that geographical Israel of today must be protected and undivided, as it was given to Israel by God. \\"Grave consequences\\" are promised to any who would \\"divide up the land\\" with the Palestinians or any other people (page 194). This sets aside the fact that modern Israel is but a small portion of the geographical land given by God. If we must support Israel's occupation of the original God-given land, as Rev. Hagee insists, then Israel must occupy Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon with our blessing.Secondly, \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" is full of inaccuracies, such as, the many references to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, etc., as \\"Jews\\". Abraham was not a 'Jew'. Jews did not exist in his day. Also, Hagee manufactures end-time fulfillments of prophecies concerning Israel's salvation, which were all fulfilled in Christ, when He came the first time.Most importantly, Rev. Hagee reveals throughout the book, his heretical idea that \\"Torah Jews\\" have no need of Christ --- that they are forgiven and their names are written in the 'book of life' (i.e., page 129) --- and that anyone who would teach that modern Jews (outside of faith in Christ) have no place in the family of God are 'antisemitic'. All of this, in my opinion, is most dangerous, especially to Jewish people who would want to know the truth, concerning their Messiah.Pastor Eddie Hughes"},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Forget even finishing it, the book is unreadable.

He's more confused tha just about anyone else on the planet. His book is not history, not theology, I think he was trying to write his own version of Mein Kampf.It seems that there is a great war ahead of us, one where Russia and her Arab allies will attack Israel while America and the West sits idley by and does nothing. Hagee must not be able to sleep at night as his fear of Iran has taken over his senses completely.He starts out his book explaining how Iran will create a nuclear bomb. Just in case Iran is too stupid to figure it out on its own, he gives complete directions for making a bomb on pages 7 and 8. He then gives scriptural lessons from Ezekiel 38-39 and identifies Russia as the great power from the north. Pastor Johnny then explains on page 25 that because the Treaty of Versailles lacked compassion, the world erupted into war twenty years later. On this he has a point, but on page 21 he quoted George W. Bush as saying America can \\"never back down, never give in and never accept anything less than complete victory\\" over our enemies. Where's the comapssion? On page 28 he talks about a \\"fake satellite\\" 280 miles high that will knock out our power grid. On page 29 he changes his mind and says it will be a $100,000 missile from a submarine 200 miles off our shores that will do the job. He can't seem to make up his mind.Johnny then takes on every Christian denomination from Roman Catholicism (page 75), to Lutheranism (page 77), to the Southern Baptists (page 141) in his attempt to glorify Judaism at Christianity's expense. I do agree that anti-Semitism is a sin, as is the oppression of any religion by the government or by popular culture. He rightly criticizes the Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades for their cruelty towards Jes and everyone else deemed a heretic, but he fails to see how he actually viollates the first commandment. Pastor Johnny believes in two Gods, the God of Israel and the God of Islam.Ironically, Johnny shoots himself in the foot on page 72 when he writes of a \\"poisonous stream of venom [that] came from the mouths of spiritual leaders to virtually illiterate congregations, sitting benignly in their pews, listening to their pastors.\\" If you've ever seen Hagee's television sermons, I can't think of a better way to describe Cornerstone Church in San Antonio.So Hagee is confident that his un-named sources in Israel, who supplied him with inside information on what Iran is really working on with their nuclear program, have given him accurate information. He quotes Dick Cheney as a knowledgeable source on Iranian nuclear capacity. Perhaps if Cheney had become president, Hagee would have been his nominee for Secretary of State.This book is more than fanaticism, more than absurdity. It's an attack on Christianity, it's an attack on history, it's also a tremendous waste of time. By the end of the book he's repeated himself on Ezekiel 38-39 and on Israel's status with God ad nauseum. He desparately wants to convert the Jews to Christianity as he seeks for them to acknowledge Jesus Christ as their messiah, 200 years after they rejected and crucified this very same Jesus. In Johnny's mind, if he can get the Jews converted, then he'd have an endless supply of congregants for his own church. Wouldn't that be nice?So in the end the reader is left to wonder when Johnny stand before St. Peter at the Pearly Gates, will he be ushered in on a red carpet or bitch slapped in front of everyone. Perhaps Hitler, that misguided descendant of Esau, will repent before John's very eyes. Or at least perhaps Martin Luther will. But then again, if Hitler was related to Esau, and Esau and Jacob were brothers, doesn't that make Hitler a direct descendent of not only Jacob and Esau, but of Isaac and Abraham as well? Religion, like politics, makes for strange bedfellows."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I read the 2005 edition with interest, especially the first chapters about the impending threat of Iran against the USA and Europe, backed up by Russia and other Arab countries.I also read and generally agree with the preceeding reviews by Johnson, albeit rather lengthy, Zampino and Ellis. The contents of the book include a number of themes, including that Christians must support the Jews, or suffer the consequences, his having repeated the verse, \\"I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you, etc.\\" many times. Somehow he turns not doing anything to help Israel in its time of need into a \\"curse.\\" This is one example of his going too far in his scriptural interpretations. He doesn't even point out that the Nazis were destroyed for having annihilated the Jews of Europe.Another theme is his bashing of the Catholic church as a whole, for the supposed acts of a few Christian Crusaders, charging them with going to Palestine only to kill jews. I always thought they went to the Holy Land to outst the Muslims and return the Holy Land to ownership of Jews and Christians. I dispute his claim that the Crusaders burned alive 960 Jews in a Synagogue.Another bash against the Catholic Church is his assertion that Pope Pius 12th did nothing to help Jews during WWII. Really? I wonder how he could have, being surrounded by Antichristian Nazis, waiting for any excuse to invade the Vatican, kill the incumbents, and set up their own Pope. I think that modern scholarship has shown that the Pope did all he possibly could, under the circumstances to help save Jews, and had great successes at that.Hagee insists on a pre- (or maybe a post-) Tribulation Rapture--he mentions both. This theory was published in Great Britain in the 19th Century and seized upon in many Protestant denominations in the \\"Hope against hope\\" belief that Believers would not have to go thru the holocaust of the Tribulation period, basing their theory on a few separated and misinterpreted scriptural verses. In this regard, Hagee reduces his credibility considerably overall by injecting his own personal interpretations, opinions, non sequiturs and conflicting statements into the book.The book would have been much better had he left out these gratuitous bashes against another Christian denomination, and his rather strange interpretation of Christian history. He doesn't even mention at all the Covenants made by God with the Jews--they should occupy a prominent part of his central theme. He makes the rather naive mistake of blaming the entire Catholic Church, and by extension, the teachings of Jesus Christ, for the actions of a few supposed members of that church. These gratuitous deviations from his central theme do nothing to support his credibility as an End Days Theologian.The book is very uneven. I am not impressed with his overall scholarship. I would recommend only the initial chapters regarding modern geopolitical considerations in the Middle East, and skip over his personal opinions in the middle chapters."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I have followed Pastor Hagee for the past 30 years and upon reviewing his latest book to be totally contrary to what the Bible teades.

In these last days God's Word declares the truth will set us free, The true Gospel of Christ, The Salvation of Man by and through the Cross for all to have redemption, it is not a requirement, but a gift of grace for all of us, gentiles and Jews alike.

Hagee uses the Bible, the news and inside informants to show that the coming confrontation with Iran may lead us, toward the end time, and the battle of Armageddon. Hagee puts the period that Iran would have a nuke between right about now (April 06) and the next 6 months, and he was right. Iran just announced that they refined yellow cake into fissionable materiel (God help us). If you have read \\"Hal Lindsey's Book (s) or Tim Lahaye's Book (s) such as \\"the late great planate earth\\" or \\"are we living in the end times,\\" they you know how the prophecy's play out, but if you have not then this book is a good place to start. Hagee's information on Iran's EMP plot, against the USA, is startling and his info on Al Quada and there plans to use 7 nukes inside the USA is downright terrifying and I think everyone should know. One last thing there is a short exposition on ROMANS chapters 9, 10 and 11 which is extremely important in dispelling the anti-Semitism (in the false doctrine of replacement theology) that was grown in many of our churches. Again a must read for those not in the know about bible prophecy and a must read for everyone the exposition on Romans chapters 9, 10, and 11 alone."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Although this book contains some good historical information, it quickly falls into error and makes for a very confusing read. Other reviewers of this book have also pointed out other valid errors.First of all, most of the references Mr. Hagee makes about the \\"Jews\\" is incorrect. Don't take my word for it - check this in your Bible. The word \\"Jews\\" was never used in the Bible until 2 Kings 16:6 (Hebrew word \\"Yehudi\\"), and it referred to the tribe of Judah after the kingdom split during the reign of Solomon's son, Rehoboam. At the time there were two nations with separate kings, the northern ten-tribed kingdom, often referred to as the House of Israel or Samaria (their capital), and the southern portion known as Judah, which included the tribe of Benjamin and the Levites, who were the priests and didn't have their own land. The two nations were warring against each other, and during that time they began to be referred to as \\"Jews\\" -- the tribe of Judah. Jews = Judah. Therefore, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were not Jews. Jacob was the father of Judah. Moses did NOT lead the Jews out of Egypt. He led the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL out of Egypt, which included all twelve tribes. Moses did not come down off the mountain and give the \\"Jews\\" the law given to him by God. He gave it to the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, again, all twelve tribes. I can give more examples he uses in the book, but they are too numerous to mention. So if you read this book (which I don't recommend), you need to first have that information so you can sort this out.The same problem reoccurs when Mr. Hagee speaks of the 144,000 who will be marked. Again, these are not just the Jews. Please read Revelation 7:4-8. John starts off by saying that 144,000 will be marked of ALL the tribes of the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, and then it lists all the tribes. Judah is first. Judah is the Jews. The other northern ten tribes were carried off to Assyria in the 8th century B.C. and migrated ... but that is a whole other subject.Unfortunately, many books are written along the same lines as Mr. Hagee's, with the same errors. Please check the main authority on this subject - your BIBLE!! -- before you swallow hook, line and sinker everything that is written in this book. It is sad that so many preachers and teachers who have studied the Bible for so many years are still ignorant about this subject.In short, I feel I was taken in by the book's sensational title, and I'm sorry I wasted my money. I would not even give this book away, since I wouldn't want anyone else to read it."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I am a seminary student.

He is reading CIA security briefs, he is interviewing 'inside sources' in Washington and Israel, he is discussing intricate details on how to make nuclear bombs, he is making calls to 'insiders' as to the cost of missiles, and etc etc.To my knowledge, Hagee is not trained, experienced, nor qualified to be gathering facts and making assertions on foreign policy, surgical missile attacks, or terrorist attacks on the USA from satellites above.Does anyone else think he should be focusing on getting his doctrine and theology straight before attempting to scare his readers in OTHER areas he's even LESS qualified in?Whether he's right or wrong with his assertions...that's not the point.

Jacob was also called Israel as were the collection of descendants. Mr. Hagee claims that Abraham was a Jew as were all the figures in the Old Testament. No, Mr. Hagee, the people were known as Hebrews, not Jews. The people were named from whom they were descended, not by the people who came later. Thus Moses was a Levite since he was of the tribe of Levi, not Judah. Also, after Solomon, the nation was split into Israel and Judah, later known as Judea. Israel was eventually conquered by the Assyrians and when the Assyrians were driven from the region, it is likely the captive Israelis went with them into Europe. The tribes of Judah and Benjamin residing in Judea went into captivity after being conquered by Babylon. The Jews eventually got to return to Judea until the Romans named the place Palestine after the Philistines as an insult to the Jews. As time passed the Jews were driven from the region. For some strange reason, when the nation for returning Jews was reformed after WW II, the place was named Israel. There most likely are no descendants from the 10 tribes biblically known as Israel in Israel today. Would not prophecy calling for the return of Israel to the original territory include all the 12 tribes?

Salvation is for everyone and the new birth experience is a requirement to make heaven our home. To enter it any other way, is to be a theif and a robber, according to Bible. We can't rewrite it or change it to suit any group of people or ourselves. Shame on the author and anyone else who teaches this.

They will never come to the realization that the Bible is true literally and John Hagee comes across with recent events backing up what the Bible reads will come to pass.

Mr. Hagee takes great liberties with scripture to try to convince the reader of the accuracy of his end-times fantasy. He tells us in this book that Jews do not need Jesus as their savior as they have \\"the covenent of the Torah\\". Of course, this is a recent, revisionist Christian viewpoint. It is directly related to Mr. Hagee's idolatry of Israel and its role in the coming \\"countdown\\".In this book, he beats the drums for war and seems eager for the US or Israel to bomb Iran as soon as possible. He has a special hatred and contempt for Muslims in general and Palestinians in particular. In the manner of typical demagogues, he uses the techniques of deligitimizing and demonizing to stoke the hatred. Unfortunately, he has severely strayed from the teachings of Jesus.

In all fairness, I read the book and actually agree with much of what it says, despite the author himself, who, in my opinion, doesn't have alot of credibility.I support the existence of Israel and I don't believe that the Jews are excluded from salvation. I'll let God decide who is saved and who is not. However, I don't believe that all Palestinians are terrorists and I don't blindly support everything Israel has done in the past. I believe that Christians should set an example as peacemakers and not try to pretend to be military strategists. With all of his intelligence sources, I'm suprised Hagee isn't on the CIA's payroll or doesn't at least sit in on the President's intelligence briefings.Before we bash Arabs and Muslims, we can't forget about all the Egyptian, Saudi, and Iraqi police officers and soldiers who have sacrificed their lives fighting the terrorists. I may not agree with their religion, but am I going to lump them all in one category and condemn them? No!I'm amazed that a man who claims to be so knowledgeable can be so ignorant of history, especially the history of the religion he preaches. First of all, on page 68, 69, and 71, he says that it was only the Hellenistic gentile Christians who fled from Jerusalem to Pella before the Roman destruction in 70 A.D. This an example of the author making up his own facts. Eusebius' History of the Church, which is the oldest account we have, states that the Jerusalem Church and all those who believed in Christ fled in response to an oracle given to them by Christ Himself. The fact that the Romans confronted members of Jesus' family years later near Pella is proof of that.The separation of Judaism and Christianity began in the second century when rabbis declared believers in Christ to be heretics who could no longer be Jews and referred to Christians as \\"minim\\". This included Jewish Christians as well. After the destruction of Jerusalem and the disastrous Bar Kochba revolt, Jews could no longer believe that Jesus was coming back as the Messiah. In order to survive in the Roman Empire, they had to distance themselves from Christianity. Christians had no choice in the matter. In the second and third centuries, it was the Christians who bore the brunt of Roman persecution. The persecution of Jews by Christians happened centuries later.On pages 72 and 73, Hagee trashes the early Church Fathers, particularly Justin and Origen. Justin was brutally martyred by the Romans in the second century. Origen was imprisoned and tortured by Romans in the third century. It was these courageous early Church Fathers who kept Christianity alive during its darkest moments. It reminds me of one of Hagee's sermons where he described the Apostle Thomas as a \\"thumb sucking wimp\\" for initially doubting Jesus' resurrection. According to the earliest traditions of the church, Thomas took the Gospel as far east as India where he was brutally tortured and martyred.If it weren't for the early Church Fathers, jet set evangelists like Hagee would not have a pulpit from which to rant every Sunday morning and from which he has made a very lucrative career selling doomsday books to the gullible.On page 89, Hagee describes Harry Truman as coming from a Bible believing \\"Zionist\\" home. At the time Truman was growing up, he would have been baffled by that term. While Harry Truman supported Israel, by his own admission he was open minded about other faiths and didn't trust loud-mouthed evangelists.Other example of Hagee making up his own facts are on page 102 when he claims the name Russia is derived from the Hebrew word \\"Rosh\\". The Vikings who settled in what is now Russia called themselves the \\"Rus\\" and had no idea there even was a Hebrew language. Again on page 102, Hagee tells us that Moscow is derived from the Hebrew word Meshech. Wrong! The Vikings first named it Moskva. On page 106, he claims Moses married an Ethiopian who was a Shemite. What Bible is this guy reading?!While I am not a big fan of Russia, its alliance with Islamics is hardly likely. Has Hagee ever heard of Chechniya or the Afghan war?I gave this book two stars because I agree with Hagee's rejection of hyper-Calvinism, his debunking of alot of anti-Semitic myths and his exposition of Romans 9-11. Christians need to look at Jews as their spiritual brethren but not to blindly approve everything they do. Jetting back and forth to Israel and hob-nobbing with big wigs does not make one an expert. If Hagee were to spend some time in the refugee camps, he might get a better understanding of what is going on over there. I doubt if he will ever do that since it would require a measure of humility on his part. Therefore, I refuse to take him seriously.There is a difference between Christianity and buffoonery. What Mother Theresa did was Christianity. What jet set prophets like Hagee do is buffoonery. Despite all of his grandstanding an self-aggrandizing, John Hagee has proven the old adage, \\"empty drums beat the loudest\\"."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Awesome book, very inspiring.

Most of us are aware of the dangers and violence that occurs so often in the Middle East but it was interesting to discover some of the specific threats that surround us today (suit case nukes,etc.) I also appreciated the information on the origins and history of Islam. The book caused me to become more intimately aware of the present tensions that exist in our world. It also helped to serve as a reminder and an incentive to continually pray for our country and Israel as well.Someone that I was once speaking with refered to John Hagee a \\"fear monger\\". But if the things which he writes about are true (and they are very well-documented) then pehaps we do have cause to be concerned.I also admire the courage of John Hagee to be \\"politically incorrect\\" at times and to unabashedly proclaim the truths of the Bible in a world that is growing progressively hostile towards God."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Apparently this book is selling like gangbusters, but that is no indication of its worth. Theologically incoherent at best and and dangerous at worst, Jerusalem Countdown is based on Hagee's avoidance of a true debate and obsession with attacking straw men such as replacement theologians, political liberals and anyone else who doesn't agree with him--most of whom he labels as antisemitic: If you do not accept his version of premillennial, dispensationalist eschatology, you're an antisemite. If you don't support every political action of Israel (apart from the dismantling of settlements), you're antisemitic. In his typical absolutist rhetoric, Hagee argues against any attempts at converting Jews. (As other reviewers have noted, this is ironically antisemitic.) He lambasts those who interpret scripture \\"allegorically\\" and \\"figuratively,\\" and then (on the same page) claims that the \\"stars of the sky\\" and \\"sands of the sea\\" in Genesis represent Gentiles and Jews respectively. He argues that modern NT scholarship--motivated by antisemitism--has portrayed Jesus disconnected from his Jewish roots. However, he fails to cite any of this so called scholarship. (Interestingly, if he had engaged any current scholarship, he would have seen the dramatic shift in the last 50 years toward interpreting Jesus in the context of Second Temple Judaism.) I could go on, but the bottom line is that this book was apparently fashioned for the purpose of capitalizing on current events for the sake of book sales.

This books is NOT a chicken crying that the \\"sky is falling\\"."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"John Hagee has got to be one of the most ignorant, uneducated bumpkins ever to have been published in this country. \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" reads like a last-minute book report slapped together by a 15 year old simpleton. Its horribly written pages are jam-packed with blatantly false (and of course, un-cited) historical assertions, certifiable paranoia, war-mongering, religious bias (compares Catholicism with Satanism and paganism) and worst of all, a false gospel supported by the most moronic Biblical exegesis I've heard since David Koresh was holed up with the Branch Davidians at Waco. Hagee believes that Jews do not need to accept Christ to be saved and that we must unconditionally support Israel to the point of making war on its enemies, specifically Iran. This book would be laughable if this modern-day Judaizer didn't have the ear of Presidents and the loyalty of millions of credulous followers.To give a few examples of the level of \\"scholarship\\" in this book, on pg 65 he says that 1 million Jews were living in Israel at the time of the crucifixion. On pg 68 he says that 1.1 million Jews were killed during the siege of Jerusalem a few decades later. Did more Jews than existed in the whole land of Israel somehow crowd into the city of Jerusalem knowing that they would be more easily slaughtered there? On pg 69, Hagee writes that \\"Hellenistic Christians\\" abandoned the Jewish Christians during the seige, thereby bringing about the permanent separation of Gentile and Jewish followers of Christ. His history is just not true. Leaving aside his unintelligible statement about \\"causing a separation\\", the records tell us simply that Christians left Jerusalem for Pella during the seige. In any case, Hagee must have been confused when he wrote that, because a few pages later (72), he says that it was the Edict of Milan in the year 313 which caused the separation of Jew and Christian. Since I'm at a loss as to how the legalization of Christianity could cause a Jewish/Christian rift that in reality existed since the time of the Apostles, I'll just go on to quote his hilarious statement that because of the Edict, the \\"Roman Church grew in power until it ruled most of the known world through Papal States.\\" Another funny one was when he quoted the early Church Fathers as calling the Jews \\"shylocks\\" (pg 72). Since that word was only coined by Shakespeare some 1200 years or so after the Church Fathers, I was glad to see a rare citation next to the quote. Unfortunately, Hagee's source for the quote was one of his own books! He also says (pg 78) that Martin Luther died two days after writing his famous tract against the Jews, presumably as punishment from God for daring to speak against His \\"Chosen People\\". In reality, Luther died 3 years after the publication of \\"On the Jews and their Lies\\". Hagee claims that the Catholic Church and Hitler \\"conspired\\" to exterminate the Jews. The Pope not only publicly condemned Nazism but saved somewhere around 800,000 Jews from death, according to Jewish historians. The Pope's intercession for the Jews was so great that the Chief Rabbi of Rome converted to Catholicism after the war and took the Pope's name as his own. Hagee claims that the name of the city of Moscow is derived from Hebrew (pg 104), and that Russia will invade Israel because it needs a warm water port and access to oil. There are plenty of warm water ports a lot closer than Israel, and it was just reported that Russia has the largest oil reserves in the world, even larger than Saudi Arabia. Hagee also dishonestly leaves the impression that Russia is still an officially atheistic nation, the better to shoehorn it into his warped eschatology, which he incompetently and incompletely cribbed from \\"The Late, Great Planet Earth\\" anyway. The list goes on and on.Of course, the main problem is not Hagee's demonstrable historical ignorance but his warped theological ideas. I don't even know why Hagee is a Christian minister, except perhaps he best serves his Israeli masters through his influence over us stupid goyim. Hagee delights in calling Jesus Christ a \\"prominent Jewish rabbi from Nazareth.\\" He says that Jesus was not a Christian (pg 66). Hagee, like the first century Judaizers condemned by Paul, Peter and every single early Christian of authority, believes that the Old Covenant is still in effect. This belief is a contradiction of basic Christianity and it is a testament to the theological ignorance of his followers that he has not been cast from the pulpit in disgrace. I guess when you live in a country where anyone can start his own \\"church\\", any half-baked theological concept can get off the ground, especially with enough Israeli shekels. (Hagee's church is entitled \\"evangelical nondenominational\\", two of the most meaningless and disingenuous terms in current parlance. In practice, that means that Hagee runs a personality cult that is answerable to no denominational authority, except perhaps the Republican Party or the Israeli embassy. He describes Jesus as an \\"angry, radical right-winger\\"). Hagee ignores the fact that the Old Covenant was conditional (DT 30:15-20) and despite frequent forgiveness by God, the Hebrews constantly rejected God's mercy, culminating in the crucifixion of the Savior. Jesus said that anyone who rejects Him rejects the one who sent Him. (LK 10:16) Hagee simply twists and misrepresents Scripture to such a degree that it's very difficult to ascribe a charitable explanation for his exegesis. He has powerful financial supporters he has to satisfy, the Gospel be damned. The entire New Testament proclaims the end of the Old Covenant and its replacement by a better way (2 Cor 3:7-11)(Heb 7:18-19). Hagee describes that Christian message as \\"anti-Semitism\\". To cite all the New Testament verses (as well as Old Testament foreshadowing) would fill up this entire page. Suffice it to say, Jesus Christ said, \\"I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\\" (JN 14:6) John Hagee would probably report Him to the Anti-Defamation League."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"A Baptist Bible Lover.I thought the book was on Iran, but that ended on page 29 with \\"I believe this is military action will lead to Russia bringing together a coalition of Islamic nations to invade Israel. The prophet Ezekiel paints that portrait clearly in Ezekiel chapters 38 and 39.\\"Hagee wants me to believe the Battle of Armageddon is before the Return of Christ? It may sell books (fear), but it is theologically inaccurate at best. This book is on Hagee's Theology of Divine Election \\"which is not for the gentiles\\" along with an attack on organizations that \\"target Jews for conversion\\" (like the Southern Baptist Convention, of which I am a member.)There is no way in this review to challenge all of Hagee's biblically inaccurate statements . Page 39, 55, 82, 90,106,117,125-129,130,147,149,150,153,163,165-177,183-187, 191-192.197.Hagee's chief problem is his complete obsession with Hyper-Dispensationalism, a theological system subscribed to no longer in ANY Pentecostal or Charismatic academic community to my knowledge. Even Dallas Theological Seminary has greatly modified it's positions in recent years away from Hagee's archaic mind-set. He is an interested phenomenon attempting to combine Hyper-Dispensationalism with Dual-Covenant modernist liberal theology to support the diabolical effort to take all Jews to hell.He is so theologically nave, he is fully unaware that indeed he is a replacement theologian inasmuch as he teachings Israel has been replaced by the Church for the past two thousand years, on the one hand (Dispensationalisn,) and as a Dual-Covenant ambassador suggesting that Jews really don't need Jesus to be right with God.Verse 5: Paul is here alluding to the Messianic Jews of the apostolic period who were true to God's revelation in Messiah Yeshua. They were not cut off branches, as were all the Jewish unbelievers, but remained attached to the original Patriarchal root to fully live out the patriarchal blessing promised by God. It is true that Patriarchal root and the Olive Tree remain the same; God does not go back on His word, ever. But only those trusting in Yeshua continue to be connected to the life source. The unbelieving branches are indeed \\"cut off.\\"Greek for remnant is \\"laymma\\" : lei&#8730;mma, n: a relatively small part which continues to exist - \`remnant, small part.'Verse 16:Plainly from the preceding verses it is apparent that apostolic teaching anticipated Gentile Christians functioning as tools in God's hands to successfully engage in provoking Israel to jealousy. If some Gentiles had benefited from the Gospel IN SPITE OF ISRAEL'S REJECTION OF GOD'S TRUTH, how much more would the world's gentiles benefit when ISRAEL ACCEPTS GOD'S TRUTH.Of course, God had not rejected Israel, as Paul emphatically states in Romans 11:1,2. But Israel has tragically, and detrimentally to the Kingdom of God, rejected the Truth. But Paul is confident Jewish unbelief is a temporary problem.His allusion in verse 16 is a reference to the fact the remnant of Jewish believers, as recipients of the New Covenant Message and experience, have representatively laid the groundwork for the full mission of God to be extended through Israel to all nations and peoples. That remnant of Israel, the believing small lump, have the potential leavening effect upon the entire world.Verse 23 make clear the balance of Israel still needs to be regrafted in, which according to verse 24 is not a concept too difficult for Christians to grasp.Verse 25: The partial hardening is no reference to \\"judicial blindness\\", the theological concept originally created to suggest God had completely washed His hands of the Jews and wanted nothing further to do with them having replaced Israel entirely in His program with the Church. Hagee is exhibiting his own theological \\"blindness\\" at this point to the apostolic mindset that fully anticipates a speedy redemption of \\"All Israel\\" when the Gentile Christians walk in their spiritual fullness and successfully provoke Israel to spiritual jealousy.Hagee, as do most dispensationalists, would contend that \\"the fullness\\" should be translated \\"the full number.\\" The NIV is the only version I know that uses \\"full number\\" and nearly all other commonly used translations use \\"the fullness.\\" Why is this important? Because of the theological fantasy that is here eisogeted into the text to suggest Israel will not experience national salvation until the divinely predestined number of Gentiles come into the kingdom first. God won't be bothering with Israel until He has a point of satiation with Gentiles. Then and only then will He determine to turn back toward the Jews and offer salvation. At this point, still according to their systematic thinking, \\"All Israel Shall Be Saved.\\" That is, when enough Gentiles have come in, God finally sends Jesus on a white horse and Israel mourns for Him and only at that moment embraces Him.A couple problems with this theology:1. The word for \\"Number\\" in Greek is the word \\"arithmos\\" from which we derive arithmetic. But this word does not appear in Romans 11:25-26. It is an indication of pure theological prejudice against the Jews to supply the word \\"number\\" to justify the theological teaching that Jews don't need Jesus or won't respond to Jesus until God gets good and ready in the future. The Gentile Church has thusly shoved off the salvation of Israel to the eschatological future rather than fully engaging Israel in serious Gospel dialogue at present.2. The word Paul uses for \\"fullness\\" is the word \\"pleroma.\\" This is the same word used of Jesus to say \\"in Him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily.\\" The Greek definition of \\"pleroma\\" is: totality, completeness, full measure. If Paul had wanted to reference a \\"full number,\\" he would have clarified it with the added \\"arithmos.\\" But Paul is rather (in the context of Romans 11) addressing the Gentile Christian's responsibility to proclaim the Gospel, to serve as conduits of God's kindness, channels of His grace, to serve as provokers to spiritual jealousy all in the interests of the Jewish people. And when, and only when, the Gentiles Christians fully discharge the fullness of their mission to Israel in the fullness of the Spirit, \\"All Israel Shall Be Saved.\\"Those who would listen to the politically-driven and socially-correct teachings of John Hagee on this subject will undoubtedly contribute to the perennial rejection of the Gospel by the majority of Jewish people. If he refuses to warn the Jewish people of the dangers of Gospel rejection, their blood will be on his hands.Hagee is so nave theologically speaking that it is a crime for him to have a nationally televised platform to spew his heretical ideas. Any theology student should be able to recognize that personal salvation NEVER resulted from strictly obeying the Torah. Personal salvation was never the objective of the Torah. The Torah is a national covenant designed to preserve the nation of Israel's well-being. It never dealt with eternal matters or offered heaven to repentant believers. What makes Hagee fantasize that suddenly the Torah has all such powers to save Jewish people when it never did in Moses day, never in Jesus' day, and never in Paul's day. It met an entirely different need and had a different focus. It was ancient Israel's \\"Constitution and By-law\\" for a recently liberated slave group who had no notion of how to govern or maintain social stability. The Torah met that need while at the same time revealing how far below God's standards of righteousness men really lived. The Torah never gave anyone assurances of salvation but quite the opposite; it revealed what sinners they were and how desperately they needed deliverance. Why would Hagee believe that today Jews can be saved by Torah-keeping. He fails to comprehend Paul.Pg 192---\\"Not all Jews are lost at this present time since some have been chosen by aSovereign God according to the election of Grace.\\"Hagee here has adopted double-predestinationism, the misconception that God has predestined some people for heaven and some for hell and that really nothing can be done to change their destinies. Therefore, Hagee concludes some Jews are saved today who must not even know it since they do not believe in Jesus. This bizarre notion of course removes any responsibility for Christians to evangelize the Jews or anyone for that matter.Pg 193 \\"The doctrine of election applies to nations and not to individuals\\"Hagee on p 192 plainly embraces the doctrine of election. This statement of p 193 is senseless in this context.pg 191 -\\"Romans 9-11 is in fact a theological codicil a stand-alone documentRejecting Gods position on the Jewish people after the cross is written\\\\ exclusively for the Jews...God has chosen a remnant of surviving Jews according to the election of grace.\\"Hagee would rip Romans 9-11 right out of the biblical context to try and support his slant. God's position on Israel has never changed. Only anti-Semitic theologians over the centuries have suggested God has a new posture on Israel since the execution of Jesus. But these chapters are not for the Jews alone anyway. They are written to the Christians at Rome who were questioning Israel's status of superiority in light of the majority Jewish rejection of the Gospel. Paul sets the record straight by admonishing the Christians to not boast against the Jews but rather recognize that Christians have no status or position with God apart from the divine promises God made to the patriarchs. If Israel is beyond God's grace, the Christians will be soon in the same condition.Hagee continues to trip over his logic constructs by embracing on p 191 the concept of chosen (remnant, Messianic) Jews as opposed to national Israel when he has stated that chosenness applies only to nations. He can't get it straight.pg 183-\\"if some of the branches are broken off some of the branches are still attached to the tree and they are holy. Paul very clearly states that the Jewish people are still God people and are considered by God to be holy. \\"Hagee plainly overstates the case if he is suggesting the branches that have been broken off remain holy. The unbelievers are not regarded as holy, as sanctified. They should be and will be when \\"all Israel shall be saved.\\" But today only those sanctified by the Holy Spirit and walking in obedience to the will of God as revealed in Jesus are holy. To suggest people can be holy (sanctified) or righteous (justified) in God's estimation without belief in Jesus is completely out of the bounds of NT apostolic teaching.Pg 176---\\"some organizations who target Jewish people for conversion use the phrase from Romans 1:16...to say God prefers the salvation of Jews over gentiles is to say God is a respecter of persons which the bible plainly denies. \\"Hagee's statement is blatantly false. No one I have ever heard use this verse has ever suggested God prefers the salvation of Jews and is a respecter of persons. Hagee misses Paul's point entirely. Paul recognizes the central role Israel is to play in successful global redemption and mankind's reconciliation to God. Paul knows the task of world salvation and the climax of salvation in history will never come until God successfully uses Israel to be \\"a blessing\\" to all the nations since \\"in you shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.\\" Paul recognized in Exodus 19:5-6 that Israel still had a ministry to perform as her very reason for existence, \\"You will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\\" Israel has not yet performed this task except in remnant representative fashion. Paul knew that when the Gentiles successfully provoked Israel to faith in Jesus, Israel would carry the Gospel universally and it would be like \\"life from the dead.\\"Pg 175- \\"gentiles come to Christ by the propagation of the gospel...this is not true of the Jewish people who have been judicially blinded to the identity of Messiah. \\"Hagee is nothing short of anti-Semitic in this statement. It was vital for the Jewish religious establishment to be blinded to Jesus true identity the three years of his earthly ministry. As Paul says that had they known He was the Lord of glory, He would not have been crucified. But of course, no crucifixion-no salvation, no salvation-eternal alienation from God and hell. So God was keen to blind the religious power-brokers to make sure Jesus would be executed. \\"It pleased the Lord to bruise him; He hath put him to grief.\\" \\"The Lamb of God slain before the foundation of the world.But with the resurrection of Christ and the full atonement for human sin forever accomplished, there was no more need for divinely imposed blindness. In fact, the first 50,000 believers were ALL Jews and included many of those former religious power-brokers who had been blinded before.One cannot dispute that a blindness today rests upon the majority of Jewish people. But that blindness is not from God. 2Cor 4:4 reads:the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.Our responsibility today is to proclaim Jesus to the Jewish people to restore sight to the blind, to work in full cooperation with God against the blinding tactics of the devil. For God is not willing that any should perish. There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Plainly God does not discriminate against the Jews, as does John Hagee, in withholding the Gospel from them. God is no anti-Semite.Pg 129 -\\"the book Moses spoke about is none other than the book of life of revelation 20:12 \\" Most Christian do not know that all Torah Jews on high holy days (Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) attend the synagogue where the liturgy calls for Jews to pray that their sins would be forgiven and their names written in the book of life \\"Hagee does not understand the simplest things of Judaism. The book of life discussed on Yom Kippur has absolutely no correlation to the Lamb's Book of Life. And since when did God begin forgiving sins without the compulsory blood sacrifice? Judaism offers no blood sacrifice and mocks the Christians as believing in \\"human sacrifice\\" in our dependence upon the blood of Jesus. Hagee is on very dangerous ground here in his ignorance.Pg 82-\\"Its time for all Christians to stop praising the dead Jews of the past..Abraham Isaac and Jacob while resenting the Jews across the street. They are our brothers and sisters who worship the God Of Abram, Issac, and Jacob just as we do.. \\"No doubt the Church and Israel are related in God. Paul makes this amply clear in Romans 9-11 and Ephesians 2. However, those Jewish people rejecting the blood of Jesus as the atonement for their souls are those relatives of ours who Paul calls the cut-off branches. They can be restored to their own olive tree but only by faith in Jesus. Jews who do not believe in Jesus will go to hell the same as any Gentiles who have no one bring them the Gospel or otherwise reject it. To put unbelieving Jews on the same spiritual platform as born-again believing Jews is an insult to apostolic teaching.163-\\"Salvation here does not mean that the Jews will run down and join the Christian church on the corner. They didn't do that for Martin Luther and they won't do that in the future.\\"I know of no Jewish believers, no matter how radically \\"Messianic Orthodox\\" their claims, that would refuse to recognize their spiritual relatedness to the rest of the Body of Messiah. Bodies of Messiah celebrate Yeshua in a wide range of cultural styles, several of which may appeal to Jewish believers. While Jewish believers do not join anti-Semitic or Jewish-unfriendly congregations, they should connect with either a Jewish cultural expression of Messiah as found in Messianic Jewish congregations or in Christian Churches with a biblically sound Jewish-friendly NT theology. How many Gentile Christians would Hagee expect to legitimately refuse fellowship and spiritual accountability?"},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I found this book very thought provoking and actually quite frightening.Could not put it down.

He said they gave him information about what the heads of the Israeli government and military think and are doing in response to countries which hate Israel.He also uses info from the Bible and the American and Israeli media to back up his claims. He drew the the conclusion that the world is in immanent danger of being ruined by Iranian Muslims and Russia. He warns that some enemy may use anthrax or an emp pulse weapon (which he confusingly refers to merely as an EMP in certain places) on us or Israel.In general his book is about:1) Islam being a threat to the Jews2) Islam being a threat to the U.S.A.3) Russia being the leader of a coming attack by various countries against Israel4) The Jews' right to Israel5) Types of weapons that can wreck the world6) Terrorists in America will nuke major citiesAlthough many similar books have come out on this subject Pastor Hagee made the most up to date, concise, and helpful one, so far.Problems I had with his book:He implied that Amercica was a good guy in the world, but we all know it's not that simple and on top of that, anyone who very thoroughly knows America's war history (it's not what American public school history teachers have been teaching) knows that it is not a good guy at all.He endorses attacking Iran, however that is not the business of Christians. It's not our job to go about judging the world and saying, \\"Blow up this guy or blow up this thing,\\" no, we are to go about leading people to Christ, not blowing them up.He perpetuated the 9/11 myth, which was that terrorists are the ones who blew up the Twin Towers, and even if they did play some part many Americans know that the U.S. Government seems to have played some part in it to give them a valid or rather stronger reason to get into the Middle East (while helping out the owner of the Twin Towers to collect on the insurance of the damage to the buildings.)He perpetuates the rapture before the tribulation myth (pre-trib ratpture) and gives no evidence that the rapture will occur when he says it does (typical of pre-tribulationists who can only come up with verses that have nothing to do with what they claim and emotionalisms. No doubt he thinks his book will be picked up by the \\"Left Behind\\" folk and that they will then think, \\"Oh he was right, those Christians were right all along,\\" and then turn to God.I at first thought this book would be decent to use to try and convert someone, but I don't think so anymore. It seems to bad to me to show someone a book in which a pastor is endorsing or urging that someone be attacked or their property be destroyed.For those Christians who think we should defend Israel, as Hagee does, you're wrong: Israel has plenty of weapons including nukes and many soldiers. On top of that it's not our job to play soldier. The way to defend Israel is through peaceful means, not swords."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"If you could do one thing better than GOD, would you still believe?...............I would like you to imagine for a moment, a mother's love. I think we can all agree, the bond between a mother and child is one of the strongest bonds known to mankind, in any time or culture. Now imagine you are the mother of two children. One boy and one girl, their ages are unimportant.Got the image in your head? Great, now imagine one child is always a troublemaker, quite a little heathen if you will. The child never listens to anything you say, gets in trouble at school, and even sometimes says they hate you. Child number two, is a perfect little angel, always does what they are told, hugs you and kisses you often and whispers their love for you every night before they fall asleep.Of course you may discipline the naughty child, but do you still have unconditional love for both children mommies and daddies of the world?Of course you say?Well let's see..........Late one summer night you decide to go to the corner store to buy some milk after the children have fallen asleep, upon returning only ten minutes later you are horrified to see that your house is engulfed in flames. Knowing both children are inside, and could be burning alive at this very moment, you know you need to make a quick judgement.Which child will you save??????What ??Both you say?Why would you save both children?????What?? Because you love both of them??? Why?One child is a complete terror, and doesn't even love you!!! Why would you do such a thing???God wouldn't!!What you say??? God has unconditional love, even more than a mere human mother?Really????Well, let's take a look at the GOD of love for just a moment...God has many children in this world yet he punishes those who do not love or \\"believe\\" in him, with fire for ALL ETERNITY does that sound like unconditional love to you???If I, as a mere human mother, can love my children with the unconditional love that GOD cannot, does he truly love and forgive better than us \\"silly\\" humans that he supposedly created? Think about thatOr are we all just ignorant children, hoping that our \\"father's\\" approval (with strict unrealistic conditions), equals love?You decide... Can you do something better than God? I can, so can most parents I know it's called loving without conditions. Sure we set rules, but we don't punish with a smoldering pit.What you say, if he didn't love us he wouldn't have sent Jesus to \\"save\\" us and forgive our sins?We'll believing in Jesus is still a condition isn't it?Something to think about.Ps.The sins of god include: murder (of the whole world except the ark), impregnating a virgin, rewarding lot after he tried to give away his virgin daughters to the town, acceptance of polygamous marriages in the old testament, etc. etc. etc. If a human were on trial for the same things we would put them away forever. Yet we excuse God by saying he knows what's best for us and he can do whatever he wants because he is GOD. Our American laws are based on the ten commandments yet we follow the laws of GOD who cannot keep his own commandments. If God was truly a perfect being he would have known in his \\"all time seeing vision\\" that we would mess up, and he wouldn't have tested eve with the apple. If God never made mistakes why did he wipe out the entire planet with a flood after the first batch of people did work out? If God didn't make mistakes why bother with the ten commandments if he knew nobody could follow them and he would have to send Jesus to get crucified on a cross to make up for it?

This becomes evident as you read Jerusalem Countdown. Basically, the theme of the book is that Iran is preparing nuclear weapons, and that very soon, we will be seeing the invasion of Israel that Ezekiel prophesied in Ezekiel 38-39.Not only is Hagee wrong in his predictions of Iranian acquisition of nuclear materials (he predicted that it would be known by the fall of 2006), but his facts are wrong in many other places.For example, he claims that 6000 people died in the September 11th attacks, when we know now that it was closer to 3000. He also overestimates the number of casualities in the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor.He also equates support for the people of Israel with support for the current secular national government in Israel, not necessarily the same thing.But Hagee's biggest mistakes are with the Scriptures. He takes Bible passages referring to the destruction of Solomon's temple in 586 BC, and applies them to the destruction of Herod's temple in 70 AD, a common mistake that Bible students make.But the worst part of the book is Hagee's mishandling of the book of Romans. He claims that Romans 9-11 is a separate tract that doesn't fit at all with the rest of Romans, even though Romans 1-8 has numerous references to God's plan for the Jewish people (see especially Romans 1:16-17, Romans 2:1-32, Romans 3, etc).Another bad thing about the book is that it is a war-mongering, fear mongering book designed to scare the wits out of people. There is no sense of God's love shown in Christ's death on the cross, no sense of hope, no discussion of the future millennium, no discussion of the final victory of God in the new heaven and the new earth.The bottom line is that God is sovereign over history and by looking unto Jesus and putting our hope in Him, all things will work together for the good of those who love God (Hebrews 12:2, Romans 8:28).The best part of this book is when Hagee compares the life of Jesus with the life of Moses, and with the life of Joseph. That part of the book was right on and was very informative.The rest of the book was right wing Zionism on steroids. I agree that someday, Christ will reign over the earth in Jerusalem for a thousand years, and that the people of Israel will be back in the land.But I think that the gathering of the Jewish people into Israel is something that we should let God orchestrate (Ezekiel 39:25-29, Jeremiah 31:23, Isaiah 43:5-7, 51:11, etc) rather than to let it be the work of conservative activists."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"In this incredible book John Hagee describes, from the perspective of a righteous Christian the dangers facing Israel and the world, and describes how G-D will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel.As a believing Jew, I will not comment much on the theology and will rather concentrate on issues of commonality with righteous Christians like Pastor Hagee, except to make the sharp distinction between righteous Chritians who recognize G-D's eternal bond with the Jewish people, and who respect Israel and Judaism, and anti-semitic Christians who espouse replacement theology and believe that G-D's covenant with Israel has been replaced by that of the Church.Pator Hagee does a very good job of exposing replacement theology for the evil fraud which it is , and explaining that the bond between G-D and the Jewish people is eternal and unbreakable, and that the Land of Israel was given to the Jewish people as an eternal and unconditional gift.Hagee begins the book by focusing on perhaps the greatest threat currently facing the free world today, the building by Iran of a nuclear weapons arsenal.Hagee records the testimony of dissident Iranian sources and Israeli sources, and reveals that Iran's nuclear weapons programme is now in place, and can be used for genocidal purposes at any time.Iranian president and modern day Hitler, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has countless times made clear the purpose of Iran's nuclear arms programme, promising that Israel will be wiped off the map, and making ugly threats that Iran has the capability to destroy Israel i.e incinerating five million Jews in a second holocaust.Hagee reproduces an interview by Ronen Bergman, a journalist with Yediot Achronot newspaper, of Dr Manoucher Ganji, former Iranian Science Minister under the Shah of Iran, before the Islamic fundamentalists seized power.Dr Ganji reveals that the Islamist regime no longer enjoys popular support in Iran and the Ahmadinejad regime believs that the only way out is nuclear war to prevent other from assisting the Iranian people.The Islamic fundamentalist regime in Iran see's it's primary goal as the liquidation of Israel and then the USA. And the Iranians are working with Russian, North Korean, Syrian, China South Africa and others to make this genocide a reality.A source of Dr Hagee's in Israel also reveals the lie that Iran needs nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, as a result of oil shortages. Those who know the volume of oil in Iran admit they have enough oil to last over 130 years.Hagee reminds the world that it is not Israel's international obligation to commit national suicide for the sake of world peace.any decent and reasonable person will concur that Israel is fully within her rights to strike at Iran's nuclear facilities.Hagee documents the long time United Nations hatred of Israel, and the UN objective to destroy Israel.He warns that a major war of armageddon is on it's way if the world does not act against Iran and her allies now.He also outlines the history of Israel and the Jewish people, and explains through a painstaking analysis of scripture that G-D favours the Jewish people and will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel.He warns that G-D judges gentiles for the abuse of Jews, and rebukes President Bush for, at the same time as waging a war on terror, pressing Israel not to retaliate for Arab terrorist atrocities commited against the tiny Jewish State.Pastor Hagee ends the book with a reproduction of the magnicent speech by Senator James Inhofe explaining the 'Seven Reasons why Israel is Entitled to the Land\\".This document of truth can be found at the following URL:http://www.internationalwallofprayer.org/A-007-Senator-Inhofe-Peace-In-Middle-East.htmlPastor Hagee includes a timeline of the history of Jerusalem,Pastor Hagee is a truly righteous man in the mould of Pastor Niemoller and Raoul Wallenberg.May G-D bless this man."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"Pastor Hagee tells Americans that they must unconditionally support Israel or America will face dire consequences. Central to his argument is that the Jews are God's chosen people and that there exists an ancient covenant between God and Israel. Such a covenant no doubt existed but Christ made a new covenant with His followers. [Matthew 26:28]. We Christians celebrate this covenant in the Lord's Supper and it is this covenant and the New Testament that Christians should be focused on. The Gospel tells us to love our neighbors and to work for peace. It does not tell us to engage in war-mongering or agitate to bring about the Second Coming. Mr Hagee warns us of four kings from the South, North, East and West which he identifies, respectively, with the Arab states, Russia, China and the European Union (EU). He goes so far as to call the head of the EU the Antichrist and false messiah to Israel. That covers just about every country that could ever pose a present or future threat to America in its quest for world hegemony. Is it plausible to assume that a global military empire such as the United States and its ally Israel are the only good and righteous countries left on planet earth? Pastor Hagee and his followers would be shocked to read a very contrary view given in John Peter Allemand's book \\"A Poetical Offering\\" in which the author offers his own prophetic insights. He claims that the Babylon described in the Book of Revelation is none other than America's greatest city and the world's financial capital, New York, and that the man with the number 666 is a prominent, living German-Jewish immigrant and resident of that city. How does that square with the notion promoted by the Christian right that Americans and Israelis are uniquely blessed people favored by the Almighty?

I have read \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" in its entirety, along with other books by Rev. Hagee, and though I acknowledge his research effort and do not doubt the accuracy of his estimation of Iranian war capabilities and intentions; I am thoroughly convinced he goes way beyond scriptural boundaries in his association of modern Jews, Judaism, and Zionism with the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy. To borrow one of Brother Hagee's phrases... He is 'exactly wrong'.First of all, \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" is generally based on the faulty premise that geographical Israel of today must be protected and undivided, as it was given to Israel by God. \\"Grave consequences\\" are promised to any who would \\"divide up the land\\" with the Palestinians or any other people (page 194). This sets aside the fact that modern Israel is but a small portion of the geographical land given by God. If we must support Israel's occupation of the original God-given land, as Rev. Hagee insists, then Israel must occupy Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon with our blessing.Secondly, \\"Jerusalem Countdown\\" is full of inaccuracies, such as, the many references to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, etc., as \\"Jews\\". Abraham was not a 'Jew'. Jews did not exist in his day. Also, Hagee manufactures end-time fulfillments of prophecies concerning Israel's salvation, which were all fulfilled in Christ, when He came the first time.Most importantly, Rev. Hagee reveals throughout the book, his heretical idea that \\"Torah Jews\\" have no need of Christ --- that they are forgiven and their names are written in the 'book of life' (i.e., page 129) --- and that anyone who would teach that modern Jews (outside of faith in Christ) have no place in the family of God are 'antisemitic'. All of this, in my opinion, is most dangerous, especially to Jewish people who would want to know the truth, concerning their Messiah."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"facts? not in this book. insight? nope. this book seems like a collection of sermons and passages from other books..not much in the way of foresight or insight.

It has definitely changed the way I look at the nation of Isreal. If you are a Christian, you need to read this book. If you are not, and want a glimpse into the future, then you also will want to read this. My only caveat is, I feel like either it was written in a hurry, or the Author did not use proof-readers. In today's world everyone uses computer spellcheckers, and they don't recognize incorrect words, only misspellings. Case in point, very early in the book there is the word interrupt, when the Author obviously meant interpret. Also a College English 101 teacher would edit the Author when he repeats himself several times, sometimes within sentences of himself. Case in point; the date May 14th, 1948 at 4:32 P.M. is forever etched in my brain, as it is mentioned about 20 times in the text. But these are small complaints, still this book needs to be read."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"probably one of the most important books I've ever read, very educational. Unfortunately the cover has a doomsday photograph which kind of turned me off, but the actual book is about much more than Iran trying to one day wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Of interest is that he discusses in Ezekiel 38-39 where it refers to an Arab coalition of nations that will invade Israel. That coalition will be decimated by the hand of God on the hills of Israel. He also discusses that the bible tell us that a man will come out of the European Union and will try to resolve the Islamic/Israeli dispute. This political orator and charismatic personality will make a covenant with Israel for seven years guaranteeing their safety and protection as a nation. In Scripture he is called the Antichrist. When Ezekiel 38 opens, the nation of Israel has been given a covenant by this political leader, who is the head of the European Union. The Jewish people will be confident that the European powers will protect them from any outside aggressor or invader.This book even answered some questions for me that were confusing, for example we've all heard the verse about \\"unless those days were shortened (the great tribulation) no flesh would be saved but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened\\" Matthew 24:22. That always seems to be a confusing verse for Christians when they debate pre-trib versus post-trib etc. Hagee presents the possibility that the elect are the Jewish people who have been temporary blinded to the fact that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, but that they are still His chosen race. Hagee believes that Christians will not be here during the great tribulation, but that some of the Jews will be. He explains why today's current Jews should still be considered God's chosen people even though we Christians (Gentiles) have been grafted into their tree of life and we have eternal life also. He also lays out a plan for the future of Israel. It is going to be so interesting to see how the current day war situations in Israel get played out. Just keep in mind that if a charismatic leader from the European Union tries to guarantee Israel's safety for seven years that THAT person is associated with Antichrist. Even if you don't agree with everything presented in the book, it has some very educational Israeli history and it is good to be up to speed with the details about the nation of Israel."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"This book started out with some very interesting observations regarding Iran's nuclear development and how this would interact with the United States, Israel and the European Union. After several somewhat insightful chapters regarding current middle eastern concerns, the book then plunged into revelations concerning ancient history and the Bible. It would probably be of some value to biblical scholars, but it's relevance to today's concerns about what is going on in Iran and the rest of that region is totally absent. Any applications of ancient history to the present is only Nostradamus type speculation and cannot even come close to any answers vis a vis Iran and nuclear threat.Another question comes to the fore concerning this book. How does a pastor become privy to such confidential information that is more than likely not even available to our top intelligence operatives?This book just does not have any credibility, except in the area of biblical history which one can find in the Bible if one chooses.

All I need do, after reading this book, is to watch the facts unfold on the evening news. It's almost like having the answer to the puzzle, before you attempt to do it. John Hagee and his sources, are so well informed, that every day, I can see another page turned that I have read in his book. Each of us have to make a choice, and the time for that choice is right now.The fact is that Islam is not, nor ever has been a peaceful religion, and the Facist-Islamists that seek to change the face of the world, will follow through on their threats, because they have a whole different ideology about life itself. They will try to make the whole world \\"Islam\\", and they will cause a war, like no other, in order to take the city from which the Messiah will reign as King on this earth. They will try to force the Israeli nation into the sea. Many have tried, but no one has ever succeeded.

The point is to focus on our spiritual lives and become more Christ-like everyday by helping our fellow man and spreading Christ's love through our actions. Examine your hearts and motives!! Do you think that God wants or needs your welcome mat of nuclear holocaust to usher in his return?? What a prideful delusion!! This is what happens when any crack-pot, self appointed theologian can start a \\"Church\\". It also doesn't help that evangelicals by and large, take the Bible as \\"literalists\\" verses in a literal light, that is taking into account the time, places, conditions, and circumstances the particular book/letter was written. This has led to upwards of 50,000+ individual churches with their own slight differences on scriptural interpretation. Ask yourself, is this good for the Body of Christ on Earth to be fractured like this?? Has Christ's message been tainted by pastors and preachers who have been unqualified, or worse, self interested, megalomaniacal doomsday seekers? Yes!! And you're all about to go off the deep end again, with gleeful anticipation I might add. Except this time, you'll suck all of us into this mess with you. It would be different if you all were just drinking cyanide Kool-Aid in South America somewhere, but you're not.What are you going to do when the nukes have scorched the earth and your feet are still on the ground and not in the clouds??

We (the US and Israel) need to \\"take down\\" Iran before Iran \\"takes down\\" the US and Israel. Hagee is serving up baloney, plain and simple.For the sake of argument, let's assume the Iranian government is every bit as evil as Hagee contends. Hagee's casus belli against the Iranians is that they are working to get a nuclear weapon. What Hagee conveniently omits from Jerusalem Countdown's 270 pages is that Israel already has 200-300 nuclear weapons, as well as multiple ways to deliver them, including submarines purchased from Germany. Iranians may have used \\"suicide waves\\" against Iraq, and they may use \\"suicide bombers\\" against Israel and others, but I have yet to see a government intent upon its own \\"regimicide\\".Hagee not only omits the fact that Israel is the regional nuclear powerhouse, but also that the Israelis have biological and chemical weapons capability. Any act of massive aggression (e.g. a full scale attack) upon Israel by its hostile neighbors would unleash a rash of plagues not seen in the region since Pharaoh and Moses squared off.And what of Pakistan - our \\"ally?\\" Pakistan is already a nuclear power, and Gen Musharraf's hold on power is none too secure. What happens if Pakistan is taken over by a virulently anti-US regime? Do we go after their nukes, and mix it up with their population of 170 million?Hagee does not say; this too, would spoil his plot."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"An astonishing and horrible thing has been committed in the land; The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own power; And my people love to have it so.

I am a supporter of Israel. I wish I could rate this book five star, but I cannot. I have found all the copy from the book in other books in my library that Pastor Hagee has written,except for the short copy on Iran.I thought the book was on Iran, which really, it is NOT. I was really shocked because I could not find anything new at all. I have read this information in the Jerusalem Post for months. I am going to be very careful in buying more books. I feel I was tricked on this one. I also have many friends that are Jewish and am troubled by the statements, \\"Gentiles come to Christ by the propagation of the Gospel, this is not true of the Jewish people.\\" Pg. 175...\\"Not all Jews are lost at this present time since some have been chosen according to the election of Christ.\\" Pg.192. I believe we are all lost without the Savior and that everyone needs the proclamation of the Gospel (The Great Commission). I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation, to the Jew first and then to the Gentile. I don't understand the theology, so I cannot explain how a person can believe an unsaved Jew is holy and will not go to hell if he or she does not except the cross and the blood that was shed. This new revelation seems like new age. Please pray for Pastor Hagee. I still support his TV show, but not this book, nor his revelation regarding the Jews."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"This is Pastor Hagee's latest contribution to prophetic interpretation in which he applies innumerable scriptural passages directly to front page events in the Middle East. While there are parts of this book to commend it, the work is more than conservative; it's reactionary and alarmist.Hagee argues that God expects the United States to defend and advance the perceived interests of Israel no matter what the government of that country may do. There is no middle ground, no complexity of issues, and no independent American interest for Hagee. I'm not saying the United States should not support Israel. I'm just saying that Hagee's view applies the Scripture in some curious ways. And I'm also wondering if Hagee remembers that God created Arabs and Palestinians, Persians and Turks in his image too.There's no doubt Pastor Hagee believes what he writes, but it's fairly obvious the title, cover art, and content are all clearly designed to sell books. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"For those of you looking for a concise, knowledgeable understanding of Bible prophesy in view of world events, this is the book for which you have been waiting .

To me it seemed as though two different people wrote this book. The first part of the book is very factual, very detailed about the threat of Islam, current affairs of the world, and the very likliehood of what we will be facing soon if we do not do something about it. I was very impressed with that part of the book. However, Mr. Hagee just had to start skewing scripture and history to attack other Christian Denominations.I for one would really like to see his FACTS on how The Catholic Church \\"produced\\" Adolf Hitler, and was in league with Nazis for the extermination of the Jewish people. That part of his book pretty much makes me wonder as to the other \\"facts\\" he uses. I would have really had more respect for Mr. Hagee and this book if he would have left out all the stone throwing and name calling, and bashing."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"I typically don't write reviews, due to the fact of, books are meant to be read without personal bias going into it, but rather letting the author make his/her case. Regardless if you agree with Hagee or not, the question MUST be asked...who in the HELL uses wikipedia as its primary source for information...Oh, that's right, John Hagee. If you turn to page 245 and read through 256 you will find most of his resources are secondary in nature and not primary. He cites wikipedia some 7 times on page 246. If I could give a no star I would. I have the 2007, \\"Revised and Updated\\" version. As a reader I was greatly offended and disgusted that I spent money on something that is most likely fabricated in nature. FIRST rule of research is FIND the PRIMARY source JOHN!!!!If you still want to read it just go to wikipedia. I'm sure you will eventually stumble across some of what Hagee did too."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"The apostle Paul admitted that he only saw through a glass dimly...he did not claim to know the details of the future. What he did claim though was that at the heart of his faith was a divine love that will outlive all. Mr Hagee's book seems a long way from Paul's spirit. Using the likelihood of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon (by 2006), Mr Hagee believes that Israel will attack Iran which will unleash a terrible war, with the Russians and Arabs joining forces to crush Jerusalem, and so we have Armageddon. As well as fear, Mr Hagee's pages are full of judgementalism and racism. All those who question Zionism, that is a lot of fellow Christians, are branded as anti-Semites; and his racism is such that he is ready to withdraw normal moral judgements when it comes to the Jews fighting for their homeland. So Begin's bombing of King David's Hotel is 'not an act of terrorism...it was an act of combat between two warring parties' That is just what the IRA used to say, and indeed what Palestinians would say now.The book also has serious inaccuracies such as the statement on the very first page that the Iranian government is in league with Bin Laden. Mr Hagee footnotes this, but after carefully checking the reference, there was not a single statement in the cited article to support Mr Hagee's. That's not so surprising as Bin Laden is a fanatical Sunni who loathes Shias, and the Iranian government is fanatically Shia. It is surprising that a Christian author has such a cavalier attitude to facts, and an expectation that his readers will take at face value the most unlikely assertions.However the most serious inaccuracy in the book is that the author - a Christian pastor - has essentially failed to understand why Jesus Christ died. Christ died to save the whole world from the punishment of sin and this is the good news his followers have been called to preach. There is nothing in the New Testament about Christians needing to get involved with worrying about where they or anyone else lived, indeed they are told to look foward to a 'better country'. This is the gospel that St Paul spread - a gospel concerned about heaven, a gospel for all, a gospel of love. There is nothing of this gospel in this 'Countdown' - just fear,racism, and condemnation - wrapped around material that seems very similar to that used by Hal Lindsay twenty years ago. Lindsay was proved wrong...but he sold a lot of books. I expect this will sell a lot of books, but doubt very much if it will further the Gospel that St Paul preached, especially in the Middle East. Here people need to see true followers of the Palestinian Man of Peace, not hear sensational speculation."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"This is another propaganda repeated over again to show that Israel is the innocent nation while the Arabs and Muslims are the fascist terrorists. Well I would like to remind you that \\"Terrorist\\" means the person or individuals who terrorize others meaning kills unjustly. In that perspective we can say that the Israeli Regime is very close to the Nazis. Both of them have done similar actions. Killing people based on their ethnicity, occupying people's land and homes, creating walls and ghettos, not letting those who left their country to come back (more than a million of Palestinians aren't allowed to come back to their homeland), Stopping food and medicines from reaching an entire populations, throwing people in prisons without being convicted (today over 10,000 Palestinians are in Israeli prisons), etc.Moreover the author should be penalized for a lot of racism in this book. Perhaps this book should show how the Israelis are getting away with killing Palestinians without being sanctioned due to the fact that they control the US government through the Jewish lobby and the media controlled by them. (CNN, FOX NEWS, NY TIMES, HERARLD TRIBUNE, etc. which all of them are Pro Israelis)."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"John Hagee has a well-deserved reputation as a man of faith and a servant of God. His reputation and good work certainly shine much brighter than this particular book which seems small, cranky, and a little bit mean.I am certain that the good pastor knows that God is on the throne and well in charge, even of Jerusalem. The middle east is God's timepiece for the world. What is about to occur there has already been foretold and is unfolding before our eyes in these last days. Matthew 5 would admonish us to pray for, bless, and even love the very militant muslims who would unleash destruction on Israel.I read \\"Countdown to Jerusalem\\" for God's word about the end-times, not celebrity quotes from Rush Limbaugh and Cal Thomas. There are many good books about the future of Israel. This is not one of them.I recommend Paul Yongi Cho's \\"Apocolyptic Prophecy\\" instead."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"This book is not true to the Bible.\\"!! It denies Jesus is the Only Way to be saved for everyone. Everyone includes Jews, Arabs, all of us because we are all sinners saved ONLY by believing that Jesus died for our sins, which most definitely includes both Jews and Gentiles.This book is propagating the worst kind of anti-Semitism. It is denying many Jews the opportunity to learn about redemption and eternal life by believing in Jesus.It is deceiving naive believers that after reading Mr. Hagee's book will wrongly believe they no longer need to witness to their Jewish friends which most definitely need to be saved just as we all need to be saved through the blood of Jesus (the Jewish Messiah).Why do I say this? Because the Bible says, \\"For I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to Salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek\\" (Romans 1:16). Mr. Hagee is ashamed to witness to the Israelis he's met, thus he is using them for his own gain.What Mr. Hagee has written in his book, that there is another way of Salvation for the Jews, is in direct violation of Paul's warnings in Galatians 1:6-9.His book is even fulfilling one of the \\"signs of the time\\" because Jesus said the last sign of His Return would be DECEPTIVE teachings propagated by false teachers.Mr. Hagee's belief in \\"Jewish divine election\\" is another gospel, not the Gospel of Jesus, the Son of God, who died for the sins of both Jews & Gentiles. How can Mr. Hagee be so deceived?Is not Mr. Hagee denying the very history of the Church? Was it not the Jews that became the first believers in Jesus? Many Jews were martyrs for believing in Jesus.Mr. Hagee is denying the Gospel to the Jewish people because of the Old Covenant that Jesus, a Jew, died to provided a New Covenant, forgiveness of sins through the blood sacrifice of God's Son, Jesus.Even the Old Covenant required a blood sacrifice for the atonement of sins, but there is NO blood sacrifice in a Temple in Israel for our dear Jewish friends! Why?.... Because Jesus was the supreme blood sacrifice to the Jew, & to the World.I feel bad when secular Humanism denies that Jesus is the WAY, the Only Way to Eternal Life, but for a \\"preacher of the Gospel\\" to deny Jesus is the Way for Jews to be Saved is the ultimate form of anti-Semitism. Mr. Hagee is as deceived as secular Humanist are deceived!You can't teach about Jews not needing \\"the proclamation of the Gospel\\" unless you are willing to take all the Jewish believers out of the history of the early Church, which would be doing away with much of the New Testament. Why did Jesus bother going to the Jews first? He should have just gone straight to the Gentiles if what Mr. Hagee teaches is gospel."},{"Title":"Jerusalem Countdown: A Warning to the World","review":"How is it Hagee in the 80's was saying this exact same stuff about the USSR?

Much of the material covered in Pastor Hagee's book was covered in Hal Lindsey's work from the 1970s, during the Arab oil embargo.

A similar book, clearly labeled as fiction and written for the express purpose of entertainment, is The Da Vinci Code.

Authentic Christianity is based on the correct understanding of the Bible. John Hagee provides excellent insight concerning Judaism, Catholic Christianity, and Islam. His views are right to the point and should be a wake up call to all Christians and those who need to be Christians!Hagee's views on Islam, Judiasm, and of Catholicism and the history of the Church are right on! John Hagee's research used in this book is excellent in quality and it's an easy read! The truths pointed out in this book are bold, and should encourage every reader to turn their lives to Christ.Jesus made very bold predictions and encouraged Christians to be aware of the signs that would indicate his soon return.

I wish I'd had it in high school; it is a wonderful thought-provoker for inquisitive people who don't take everything at face value.Some things have a kernel of truth; this book has a kernel of hokiness, used as a device to keep the narrative flowing and lively."},{"Title":"Decisive moments in the history of Islam","review":"\\"Decisive Moments in the History of Islam\\" by Muhammad Abdullah Enan (Inan?), formerly of the Egyptian Bar and Egyptian Society for Historical Research; originally published in 1940 in Lahore (Pakistan); revised third ed. in 1949; revised fifth ed. in 1974. Written by a Muslim who contended that the pagans living in North Africa were generally \`happy' to be informed of the peaceful message of the Prophet Mohammad - as long as they paid their dhimmi jizyah tribute-taxes (p. 22). The author quoted both the English historian Gibbon and the German von Schlegel about the dhimmis' happiness. The author tried to down play the military aspects of the Muslim's \`peaceful conquests' by the early Muslim militias (or as the author defined these military campaigns: \\"the Arab Outburst\\"), but in a moment of candor the Muslim author gushed that in Oct. 732: \\"The Muslims captured and pillaged Poitiers [France] and burned its famous cathedral. They then attacked Tours...captured it and destroyed its cathedral...the Berber tribes were anxious to retire with their great spoils...They plundered all its rich churches and monasteries...and carried away innumerable treasures, spoils and captives\\" (p. 61). The author discusses other various Muslim battles: Constantinople, Crete, Sicily, Sardegna, Corsica, the battle of Manzikert, Hattin, Mansurah, De Joinveill's Memoirs, slavery in the Middle Ages [eight short pages of banal generalities; no discussion from the hadith], the Fall of Toledo and Granada, and bemoans the collapse of Muslim Spain (or as the author titled it: The Fall of the Moorish Civilization). Not really an extensive nor detailed in-depth analysis of the history of the early Muslim era, but probably interesting when it was originally written. If you are already familiar with Islamic history, I don't see this mid-1950s book adding much to a reader's knowledge. Past its prime; stale-dated."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"First of all, some reviews I've read appear to want to make much of the book's status as \\"metafiction.\\" Yes, here the metafiction works--but why? It seems that in this novel metafiction has finally reached a point where it's not even \\"experimental\\" anymore; it serves a simple artistic purpose. Because the book deals so much with mental illness, I understood metafiction simply as the acknowledgement that this is Gilad Elbom's (properly meaning here the character of the same name as the author, which of course is no accident, but anyway...) way of acknowledging that this is not an authoritative reality he is weaving but, largely, a record of his own complexes confronting a sort of \\"given\\" outside himself. The metafiction is not overbearing; for the most part it reads as a straightforward fictional narrative, and a fun one too.The plot centers around an era of Elbom's life when he works in a mental hospital in Israel and its setting both inside and outside of this hospital. Elbom records his experiences on the inside mainly as the social interactions he has with, and observes between, six patients whose illnesses/quirks have been covered elsewhere. On the \\"outside\\" Elbom records his experiences with Carmel, a married woman waiting for her terminally ill husband to die; with a man who had his vehicle \\"drafted\\" by the Israeli army; with said army as they, in their way, \\"draft\\" Elbom's vehicle by asking (forcing) him to take soldiers between bases; with a very friendly, hospitable Arab associated with HAMAS who collects motorcycles and goes into an unexpected (even somewhat feminist?) disquisition on ancient epic poetry; etc. (Read the book!) Such episodes are interrupted or embellished by Elbom's fascinations, obsessions, complexes: heavy metal, sexual fantasies of an occasionally bizarre nature, and (maybe most of all?) linguistics.The book is driven by dialogue; in fact, it seemed to me the dialogues were the whole \\"point\\" of the novel, at least for me. If you simply excerpted a dialogue without any reference to characters, who would be speaking? Would they be the \\"mentally ill\\" or the \\"sane\\"? Cinematically speaking, the dialogues were reminiscent of both the lighter Monty Python and the more philosophical Richard Linklater, often at the same time. And it was this tension between the serious and the zany that is not only highly entertaining, but begs the question: Who is insane and why? Is a society plagued with inter-ethnic and interreligious violence \\"sane\\" while a man incapable of believing in anything \\"crazy\\"? It is fascinating to think about, and *Scream Queens of the Dead Sea* offers a lot of food for thought, especially (I thought) in the last chapter.All throughout the novel I was trying to find something concretely inferior about this novel, yet I was having such a good time reading it. I have to give it 5 stars out of 5; this book was my sort of thing. I'm happy I read it."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"i've pretty much given up hope in the novel these days--but this one restores some faith. the german version has a much better cover, but you've gotta read it in english to get the jokes. vive!"},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"In Gilad Elbom's witty, metafictional novel of life in Jerusalem, an iconoclastic \\"fictional\\" speaker named Gilad is writing a novel which parallels events in the life of the book's real author Gilad Elbom. The main character, a young man who studied languages and linguistics at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, has taken a job as an assistant nurse in a mental hospital, and as he speaks to us in his lively and sometimes flippant style, the reader observes his personal relationships, the lives and behavior of the inmates in the asylum where he works, the uncertainties of daily life of Jerusalem, and the overriding question of what constitutes sanity in modern-day Israel.Gilad's girlfriend Carmel is married to a dying man whose death she anxiously awaits. His patients, a motley crew whom the reader comes to know well, include an atheist who describes himself as suffering from Faith Deficit Disorder, a Beat poet who writes paeans to a porn star goddess, a woman who believes she is dead, and the Palestinian murderer of a young Israeli woman, whom the military has assigned to the asylum for observation.The dark humor of daily life in Israel permeates the novel, from Gilad's delay of his departure for work until he has heard that the daily deaths and bombings by terrorists have already occurred (and have missed him once again), to his running around to military camps throughout the country to obtain files and paperwork for one of his patients. His trip to the Palestinian territories to a casino (populated entirely by Jews, since gambling is anathema to Muslims), and his attempts to take his patients on an outing to a restaurant add to the color and sense of absurdity.Moments of hilarity abound, varying in style from rapid-fire, who's-on-first interchanges, to descriptions of personal quirks, the inclusion of absurd poems by a patient, Carmel's constant, chorus-like interruptions of Gilad's day at work, and literary discussions of Robinson Crusoe, which Gilad is trying to read at work. Stream of consciousness writing and free association, some of it related to Gilad's interest in heavy metal music, are interposed into discussions of life and literature, creating a wild, existential tone. Plot is almost non-existent. Fortunately, the light touch, the humor, the self-deprecating commentary, and the pseudo-angst of the main character provide enough intrinsic excitement and charm to keep the reader going in lieu of a \\"real\\" story. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"Enter Gilad Elbom, purveyor of dark ramblings and metal-infused interludes, straight from the heart of Israel. In this freshman release from an up-and-coming literary powerhouse we find Elbom, also the main character of Scream Queens, reflecting on his life inside a mental hospital as an assistant nurse. Through driven dialogue and off-beat characters we plunge into a world of mental instability and quirky obsessions where we are often lost between insanity and reality. A fun, tight novel told through the eyes of a self-deprecating (albeit self-involved) Israeli national, Scream Queens of the Dead Sea is bound to be a cult hit."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"Its subtitle says it all. In his highly impressive debut novel, Gilad Elbom zaps between sex, heavy-metal and linguistics (not to mention crazy people) and takes you right along with him. Sometimes photorealistic down to the institutional kosher blue and orange cups familiar to most Israelis, then just as easily hilarious and over-the-top, this is fresh and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"I am so grateful that Gilad Elbom decided to write his first novel in English. I can't imagine reading this book in translation (but if English is not your first language, I'm sure the translations still stay true to form). Gilad's ability to effortlessly draw me into his make-believe(?) world is really what I enjoyed most about Scream Queens.Some compare Scream Queens to a ride on a roller coaster. I'd agree, and add that it left me panting, excited to read Mr. Elbom's second book. This is a fun, accessible book for anyone who wants a glimpse into many minds crazier than their own. Plus, you get a rear-view-mirror glance at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from one underexposed Israeli perspective.You should read this book. It fills up your senses."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"Gilad's stream of consciousness pulls you in. This book is fascinating on many levels, from the first hand account of modern day Israel as seen through the eyes of a candid and cynical young writer to the hard core sex scenes. The collection of unlikely characters will keep you guessing as to who is sane and who is not. In this must read novel you will meet an intelligent HAMAS activist, a man who spent his whole life sleeping for a living, a silent ethiopian girl and many more chararcters. All this together with the references to grammer and heavy metal will keep you wanting more."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"The only complaint I have with Gilad Elbom is that he appears to have disappeared from the internet entirely. I suppose he's teaching or something. This is one of the funniest most horrifying books you are ever going to read about one of the funniest most horrifying places on the planet. Like Lenny Bruce or Sarah Silverman, Gilad Elbom knows what makes his reader uncomfortable and he's going to poke at it for all its worth until you're laughing with tears rolling.Sure this book loses some steam towards the end and some of the characters get lost in the shuffle, but it's worth it alone for the Israeli astronaut musings. Read it. Buy it. Realize that there's more to literature than Dan Brown."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"Perhaps the only ones entitled to an understanding of the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are madmen. Gilad Elbom has managed to create the best analogy for the middle east from the most unlikely building blocks: an insane asylum in Jerusalem, a very literary obsession with Z-movie porn actresses, a passion for heavy metal and linguistics and a deep sense of emotional detachment from everything else. Elbom's fictional self, just wants to relax in his new job as a male nurse, as he tries to repress the complexities of his affair with a married woman awaiting her husbands death, his conflicted attitude towards Israel's Arab population and his mother's nagging him to do something with his life. But as the narrative unravels through serpentine dialogues between him and his patients, from Immanuel Sebastian who doesn't believe in anything (not even nihilism) to Hadassah Benedict, who is quite convinced she is dead, his grip on reality gets increasingly shakey. Scream Queens of the Dead Sea is a convoluted paradox in which split personalities take over the plot and plot to takeover, all without ever really escaping the stagnation that defines their existence as it reflects the regime that created it."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"This book is one of the funniest things I've ever read. I laughed my ass off, but at the end it turned out to be a pretty serious book. I loved the heavy metal references. I loved the dirty sex scenes. I loved the smart take on the Middle East. And even though I don't know jack about linguistics, I thought that stuff was interesting too. Get it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"I could not put this book down till I finished it.If you are interested in the way sane young Israelisthink today, in their chaotic home country, let thisbook guide you through a fair measure of blackhumor, and cynisizm, that are part of everyday lifein Israel today. The portrayal of the mad patients atthe asylum, in which the protagonist serves as anassistant nurse, is both touching and funny. For thosethat are interested, the book also includes a fairamount of linguistic analysis, and many allusions toheavy metal music (which surely will attract any heavymetal fan). Although I am neither a linguisticexpert nor a heavy metal fan (my soul knowledge in thisarea dates to my long ago high school days when a friendthought I lacked expertise in this musical genre), thedigressions into these subjects did not reduce my pleasurewhile reading the book. On the contrary, I think they addedto it. The sex scenes in the book maybe a bit hard to take,however, they are well justified. They emphsize the violencethat is constantly tolerated in Israel these days. If youcannot stomach it, just skip these scenes, sincethe rest of the book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Scream Queens of the Dead Sea: Sex! Heavy Metal! Linguistics!","review":"Form follows function as Gilad Elbom dares you to distinguish truth from fiction in this epic, quazi-autobiographical, Gen X, narrative, set in the Isreal, a land rife with contradiction. Loaded with deflection and diversion, it's more about what isn't said than said, though what that means is left to the reader to figure out. Nevertheless, Elbom brings frustration to new and hilarious heights as we follow along with this Israeli everyman, through an Odyssean journey reeking of raw sexuality, heavy metal, and red tape.

Unfortunately, in my opinion, he's just not very good at that. Now, O'Reilly doesn't give bad advice--he simply gives advice that pretty much everyone reading his book is going to agree with. In the chapter about parenting, for example, he says, \\"Don't lie to your kids.\\" When it comes to careers, O'Reilly suggests that you \\"keep your mistakes to a minimum.\\" Although what O'Reilly writes isn't offensive or false, it's--well--boring.If you're a regular viewer of \\"The Factor,\\" you won't hear anything new when O'Reilly discusses his opinions about the government, taxes, the war on terror, immigration, the Catholic church, Jesse Jackson, and every other topic O'Reilly's already debated (several times) on his TV series. If you're not a regular, you might find O'Reilly's opinions interesting; but if not, you might find yourself falling asleep as he rehashes what he's already said on \\"The Factor.\\"The good news is that it's not at all old material; Bill does recount a few interesting personal stories, including his brief encounter with Bill Clinton. And, to my great surprise, O'Reilly actually discussed the time he was accused of making a racial slur at a fundraising party. (In one memorable episode of \\"The O'Reilly Factor,\\" O'Reilly's guest, Neal Boortz, mentioned the accusation and suggested that O'Reilly was doing an anti-racism story in an attempt to restore possible damage to public relations, to which O'Reilly quickly responded, \\"You vicious son of a b----!\\" The alleged racial slur was never again mentioned on O'Reilly's program, but stunningly, Bill addresses it in his book.)Unfortunately, those two stories are the highlight; the rest is what you've already seen and heard on \\"The Factor.\\" If you're a big fan of O'Reilly, maybe a couple of personal anecdotes is worth twenty bucks. For me, it was worth exactly the fifty cents I paid to put the book on hold at the library."},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"If you are a fan of O'Reilly and are interested in his personal anecdotes and their place in his life's journey, then you'll enjoy this book. Don't expect any startling revelations, but do expect a good dose of common sense and a challenge to apply it in your own life."},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"I love O'REILLYThere are aspects of his personality that I do not like but Bill is a voice in the wilderness of cable news today. He yells and screams as much as the next guy but he actually does research to back his ranting points up. This separates him from everyone else cable news (and radio) weather those people are liberal or conservative. I honestly don't know what side of the aisle Bill sits on.Overall-I think reading this book is worth your time."},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"Bill O'Reilly gets down with this book. He lays his heart and soul out for the reader. He puts it all in a nutshell for you while keeping it &quot;pithy.&quot; This is Bill at his best. A great read for anyone."},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"Although I haven't read any other book penned by Bill O'Reilly, I have heard others note that his books are alyways straight, to the point, and with the trademarked &quot;no spin&quot;. This book, &quot;Who's Looking Out for You&quot; seems to do just that. No &quot;bull&quot;, just the facts to let you know who in fact is and more importantly who is NOT looking out for you. O'Reilly has his faults for sure (I know this because he tells the reader..again...no spin); but even with his self-admitted faults, he comes through a winner - a very believable winner. I read the book in just a day and a half, not putting it down because so much applied to me. I recently resigned from a well paying, well respected job because the people I worked with were weasels (weasel is the word of choice by O'Reilly for those louses who really only think of themselves and are not looking out for you. All of us could benefit though reading this book, as all of us have people who we may think are looking out for us, but in reality are truly weasels. Just pick up the book and read what Bill has to say about lawyers, or the Catholic church (Bill is a Catholic). You may not agree with everything Bill has to say, but then again he probably does not agree with everything you or I say. Read the book and find out. I strongly recommend the book."},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"My husband brought this home, and reading some of it, it reflects some very common sense realities about politics, along with some fairly harsh criticisms of many of the &quot;players&quot; associated with campaigns and elections. A long time Boston resident and close to the action in most cases, the author exhibits an uncommon knowledge of more than a few &quot;events&quot; and cautions the readers to try and look beyond the momentary hype to assess the value and the progress of our American political campaigns to see who really winds up on top, and too often, who really winds up on the bottom, and often screwed. A highly informative read, and one that appeals to logic as the ruler by which American democracy is played out, and its relation to &quot;ordinary citizens.&quot;!"},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"Unlike the Flaming Liberals who have not read Bill O'Reilly Book,I read the book and have nothing but great praise for it. Bill tells it like it is. Most folks cannot handle it. That's why they do not have what it takes to win in life. Bill O'Reilly shares with us what brought him down and what built him up. Attitudes, behavior can either serve you or ruin you. Kudos to Bill for helping us focus on what kind of communication is going to take us where we want to go. Bill is an all around good guy, sharing his wealth of experience and knowledge.As Bill O'Reilly states in his book, We are in dire need of community around us that will look out for our best interest.At times Bill O'Reilly is also a wealth of entertainment as he shoots down the bad guy, It really makes me smile. Thanks Bill for another good read!"},{"Title":"Who's Looking Out for You","review":"Do you get angst just thinking about your upbringing? Do you get intoxicated regularly? Are any of your friends bad seeds? If you're a parent---do you think of yourself as your child's friend? If you can answer yes to such statements then this is a book for you. Who's looking out for you, thus, is not necessarily for everyone. It's thesis is basically that if you want to live in a nanny state & be coddled, then move to Europe. But, if you live in the USA & like the idea of doing so, then don't expect for many others to be looking out for you. The justice system---O'Reilly states---won't be looking out for you. Neither will lawyers in the USA; nor the Catholic Church; nor the likes of Jesse Jackson types---who only look out for themselves; nor the media; nor schools. Who SHOULD be looking out for you include your parents, as well as--hopefully---some close friends. And as a parent, one should be a Parent, NOT a friend to one's child, because a child has nobody to look after him/her except a parent---and it's not possible to accomplish both in Mr. O'Reilly's opinion. In short, this is a book about disapline: that one must proactively seek one's own motivation; that one ought to seek knowledge/read/and engage one's mind; that one ought to respect one's body (ie., to exercise, control one's weight & forgo smoking); that one ought not to associate with destructive people; that one ought provide a safe & secure refuge for one's children at home (with no abuse, drunkeness, foul language, etc.). If you have children or are contemplating such, Mr. O'Reilly sternly advises that you take the responsibility involved therein extremely seriously---and that you ought be successfully looking out for yourself first before taking this step. His book is a primer on individual self-responsibilty; common sensical at its heart, but also food for thought & worth 6 hours of your time if you are open to---and think you could benefit from---at least a dash of self-improvement. If so, do get this (unabridged) audio version, read by Mr. O'Reilly himself; as his words of advice are more pertinent in his own voice.

The author claims that if you do that, your life will be much better and you will probably live longer. The rest of the book is a lot like the statements above. It has some common sense 'wisdom', but nothing that is really new or Earth shattering.O'Reilly quips that problem solving is what differentiates successful people from those in the penitentiaries. Although that may be one factor, the statement is pretty simplistic and misses several other differences. O'Reilly states that this book will 'give you the edge'. This claim is a bit overstated. I didn't run across anything in this book that is much more than run of the mill advice.Throughout the book, he does a good job of pointing out many types of people and institutions that can be and often are not 'looking out for you'. These include some parents, certain types of 'friends', the government, the entertainment industry, the media, the Courts, the ACLU, Jessie Jackson, the educational system, and many politicians. There are some quite good things such as some keys that he gives for good parenting, but these are not unique to this book. Another thing that he does hammer home quite well is the suggestion to avoid 'toxic' people whether in romantic relationships or otherwise.I wasn't disappointed in this book as it was given to me as an audio book that I listened to while on a recent road trip.

Usually authors do the easy work---criticizing and pointing out poor outcomes. Although it is important to study poor outcomes it always seems to me this is the easy half of the analysis. Suggestions for improvements are rarely included in such analyses, but they are included here which makes this such a unique, helpful resource.Based on data/research from the real world yet analyzed by academics who obviously do not stay in ivory towers. The authors identify poor outcomes as a means to an end---the end being alternative actions to avoid poor outcomes. A valuable resource---insight and application. Superb! Wish there were more authors who viewed their role as informed advisors rather than op-ed writers, decrying poor outcomes, yet offering no positive interventions/alternatives."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"\\"Marx's Concept of Man\\" is essentially a pamphlet establishing the humanist, philosophical side of Marx as against the orthodox, Soviet view of Marx as tyrannical and economistic, and against the degree to which this view has seeped into academic literature in the West also. Famous Freudian Marxist Erich Fromm uses the \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" as well as \\"The German Ideology\\" to stress the importance of humanist concepts such as alienation, freedom, and creativity for Marx, and in so doing explains what these and similar terms mean in Marx' work. Fromm has clearly paid careful attention to Marx' philosophy, and this part of the book is quite good as a simple overview.The second half of the book covers the English translation of the aforementioned \\"Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts\\" by Tom Bottomore, as well as excerpts from various other works by and about Marx meaning to show his humanism, his good nature, and his sensitivity to culture. Of special interest are the excerpts from the memoirs of those who knew Marx, like his daughter Eleanor as well as Paul Lafargue. These works are often quoted, but rarely does one find a larger part in English, not even in McLellan's biography.Fromm goes a bit overboard here and there in stressing Marx' 'spiritual' nature. Although nothing Fromm writes is of itself incorrect, it may unwittingly reinforce the old canard of Marxism 'really' being a religion, and Marx a millennarian prophet, and so on. Fromm obviously rejects this old refrain, but should have made that clearer. In other aspects this collection is an interesting primer on Marx as thinker on human action and human nature, and sheds good light on this side of Marxist thought for those not familiar with it."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"Marx? Communism? Please!That's the gut reaction of most of us. Why is this? Why is the man who's ideas stimulated nearly half the world to revolution automatically rejected without even being seriously looked at by most of us the U.S. today? What's that you say? \\"History shows us that communism is an impossible system that leads to the greatest tyranny.\\"The fact is Marx is much more than communism. His most famous work is not called Communism but Capital. (The manifesto was a small pamphlet next to the thousands of pages of the planned four volumes of Capital). He is strongest in his analysis of the very history and machinery of this economic system. In fact, it is in his critique of capitalism (not his proposition of communism) that he is most original.Today, we see yet another crisis in global capitalism. Almost all of us who seek understanding of this crisis do so using the very same conceptual tools of the capitalist doctrine itself. But what if there are incorrect assumptions that the governments, universities and media networks of the world continuously overlook?Marx's Concept of Man serves as an introduction to such an analysis. It is a compilation of various manuscripts of the early Marx and is quite digestible--especially after Fromm's preface. Erich Fromm--a significant 20th century philosopher in his own right--introduces us to some of the most timeless aspects of Marx's concept of man in a way that makes his thought significant to this day."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"This book is an excellent book for anyone wishing to gain a readable understanding of Marxist thought. The first 92 pages are especially insightful. A must buy for anyone interested in Marxism."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"Erich Fromm, displays a different profile of Karl Marx. According to Fromm, Marx is very different than the one told by the Russian Communists. Fromm tries to show the humanist ideas of Marx and he describes Marx's philosophy as a synthesis of humanism and naturalism. There are also good descriptions of what socialism means: \\"Socialism, for Marx, is a society which permits the actualization of man's essence, by overcoming his alienation.\\".Fromm describes the Marxist socialism as the heirs of propethic Messianism.This book is really interesting because Fromm tries to explain the humanistic values in socialism.Indeed, all the communist propaganda has claimed that their way is the real Marxist system; however Fromm claims that their system was just a crude communism which neglected human beings and humanistic values."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"Fromm's analysis of Marx is incredible, finally someone truly understands Marx's writing. This is an excellent edition for someone looking for a side of Marx not often discussed."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"This is a book that should, but given the existing political culture, won't be made required reading in schools and universities.Eric Fromm was a humanist writer who lived from 1900 to 1980, and exerted a strong influence on Baby Boomers with his popular books. This book about Humanistic Marxism shook the intellectual world when it was first published in 1961. It rattled the conventional wisdom at the time it was first published. The West had, as Fromm readily admits, a glaring misconception of what Marxism meant. They could hardly be blamed for this misunderstanding. The only example the West had to look towards to see Marxism in action was to observe the Soviet Union. The Eastern Block shares responsibility in misconstruing the meaning of Marx. Its monumental government apparatuses, unwieldy bureaucracies, its virulent oppression of human rights, all these characteristics were definitely NOT how Marx envisioned a communistic society.Fromm goes into great detail on the humanistic philosophy of Marxism. If Hobbes' Leviathan emerged to protect man from a state of nature, the true goal of society according to Marx is to provide the conditions by which man may reestablish his relationship with nature, with others, with society at large, and with himself. The impediment to this reestablishment is alienation, a common concept of Marx, which drives a wedge between man and the other elements to his life and to himself. As Fromm repeatedly reminds the reader, alienation does not simply exist in Western societies; it is equally prevalent in those countries under a so-called \\"Communist\\" form of government. Fromm states that the governments of Lenin, Stalin and Khrushchev were simple totalitarian states.There is a decided spiritual aspect to Marx, in that the goal of a person's life is self-realization. This self-realization, however, is one which allows a person to achieve their own personal goals, based on that person's abilities, talents and labor.Fromm was addressing a world in the middle of the Cold War, and published in an America just emerging from the crushing conformity of the 1950's. It has continued relevance today, where the societal pressures are hidden and the urge to conform reemerging.This is a short book and can be read in two or three sittings. It is a well worth read."},{"Title":"Marx's Concept of Man","review":"...someone dusted off Marx and took a good psychological look at the wealth in his writings! One needn't be a Marxist (I am not) to appreciate this fine book. My one concern is that Fromm is to Marx as Kaufmann is to Nietzsche: both men either ignore or euphemize the weaknesses in the visionaries they write about (e.g., Kaufmann's remark that Nietzsche's hateful, cynical, and demeaning remarks about women &quot;do him little credit&quot;). Nevertheless, this book provides a good compensation for the Western tendency to demonize a man very much misunderstood by those who turned his writings to political purposes."},{"Title":"Dream with Your Eyes Open","review":"This is a small inspirational book.

Cleopatra's breasts are mentioned on the first page. This is typical of the level on which Ludwig deals with his subject. This is, in a way, an historical novel. Ludwig invents things, as for example, he says that all four of the children of Cleopatra's father were clever and bright. There is no proof of this, this is just off the top of Ludwig's head.

Results showed a small, temporary boost but no long term effects.The disappointing, temporary nature of these results is corroborated by many Amazon.com reviews of Anthony Robbins materials.Sorry, there is no fast, cheap and easy way to success (unless you can cook up books like these)."},{"Title":"Unlimited Power: A Black Choice","review":"Unlimited power is a milestone in black personal achievement. It tells the reader how to take control of your mind, body and emotions to get what you want and become a force for good. What I like about it the most and what sets it apart from other black self help books out there is its based on science. NLP is the science of modeling excellence in people wherever you see it whether its in self made millionaires or someone who just knows how to be healthy or you could even use the technology to learn algebra or calculus it doesn't matter. I've used it myself to learn computers now I'm using it to learn how to make more money. The book has Anthony Robbins name on it but it's Joseph's voice through the whole book except for the intro. I think it is essential reading for any black man or woman that wants to become a success in this white dominated society. This book does show you the skills of persuading yourself and other people to do what you want them to do.The book's goal to give black people access to \\"unlimited power\\" I think definitely this book should be read by all african americans because it got me to make decisons about what I wanted and got me to take action. I also learned to actually control my emotional states of mind. There are some deep things in this book about the lies of success that didn't make sense to me initially but they do now. I can sum this book up like this : If black people are to succeed they must change three things: 1. We must raise our standards. 2. We must change our beliefs. 3. We must change our strategies . This book if taken to heart is a golden opportunity to do all that."},{"Title":"Unlimited Power: A Black Choice","review":"A must read for people who want to receive help in making positive changes in their lives.

He starts off by telling of some of his experiences - being beaten up one night by a racist gang, being asked by the police \`What were you doing in that neighbourhood?' when he reported the incident. He speaks of how this resulted in his developing a fear and mistrust of all white people - which also affected his relationships and interactions with Black people. McClendon's experiences, attitudes and feelings will echo those of many of us.He then goes on to describe his first meeting with Robbins, and the workshop Robbins led which helped the author to turn his life around. McClendon describes and explains many techniques which Black people can use to improve our mental and emotional states in order to empower ourselves in any situation.

McClendon then proceeds to pack the many ideas of Tony Robbin's Unlimited Power program into the rest of the tape. I feel he did a wonderful job of introducing how the techniques can be used to address the unique challenges faced by African Americans. The audio mentions the Rodney King and OJ Simpson incidents which I found fascinating looking back from the perspective of President Barack Obama being newly elected.

It starts out by addressing some of the real issues that plague African American people today dealing with racism and oppression. The fact that the book speaks directly to African Americans takes into account the lingering affects that past oppression has had on black psychology. I liked that the authors acknowledged that these problems are still present, but enocouraged a greater focus on self-accountability. They effectively motivate the reader to visualize themself as an achiever rather than a failure. It encourages people to focus on achieving the outcomes of their desire.

Although it is aimed at Primary level, I personally think it will work best specifically for grades 1-4.It is different from other books in the way it is organized. Instead of talking about a different tribe or a different tribal region in each chapter, it talks about a different aspect of life in each chapter and gives an overview of how that feature was developed by the different tribes. Some of the chapters are: Homes and Lodges, Food, Animals in Life and Legend, Transportation, Clothing and Jewelry, Toys and Games. Each chapter starts with a couple of pages of information about the topic and provides examples for each tribal region and for some specific tribes. Afterwards, each chapter contains lots of reproducible activities that will help the students reinforce what they just studied in a fun, hands-on way. For instance, in the chapter of Homes and Lodges, students will make a Southwest pueblo pop-up, a 3-D tepee, and a booklet of Native American dwellings and shelters among other things.For the chapter of Animals in Life and Legend, students will color and cut out a small Totem Pole, a herd of buffaloes, a puzzle of a Grizzly Bear, a Flying Eagle puppet, a board game of animal tracks and much more.I highly recommend this book for all teachers who really want kids to enjoy learning about our wonderful origins and traditions."},{"Title":"Native American Arts & Cultures","review":"All articles were very easy and fun to understand for kids.

A wise choice because so much of what he covers is not exactly at eye level. Just flick through the pages and be amazed at the amount of exterior Deco delights still standing and hopefully now preserved.Hundreds of photos are arranged in these four chapters, Tile & Terrazzo, Glass & Neon, Stone & Plaster and Metal & Wood and as Schwartzman took them the color and compositions have a pleasant evenness throughout the pages and this certainly makes all the detail sparkle.I particularly liked the chapter on stone and plaster with dozens of photos showing just how creative some stonemasons were decades ago, just look pages 122-123 and see six stunning interpretations of the American Eagle.If you live in Los Angles this super book will be a useful checklist of what to see (the captions all give the street address) for others, like me, it is a good visual record of the best Art Deco gems in LA.2007 UPDATE: Schwartzman has published a similar book about Art Deco in London (ISBN 1845132432) lots of photos especially of exterior detailing not really visible from the ground.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Deco Landmarks: Art Deco Gems of Los Angeles","review":"If you're \\"into\\" this sort of thing--and you enjoy marveling at Deco Architecture and sculptural designs--L.A.'s treasures add up to the next most bountiful trove of this type offered by the Three Deco Capitals of the U.S. (the Big Apple and ChiTown lead the way). But clearly the City where the aesthetic entered our collective consciousness by way of its movie product and its film set designs is the obvious place to look. LA's major growth occurred during the heyday of Deco and so much of its urban conceptualization was permeated by that design sense.

I am not in any way a Deco authority, but it would be nice to read (and see) something new about LA. Most photos are a rehash of already printed material and many need additional shots to explain the architecture. For example: the Wiltern Theatre.

For someone who was just old enough to (16-17) to witness the period, without having as much at stake as those slightly older, this book reveals how much was sacrificed by the Vietnam generation. I keep hoping that someday Tauber will write a sequel which will let us know what happened to Willie, Joanna and the rest after 1970."},{"Title":"The LAST BEST HOPE. A Novel.","review":"At the time I first read this book I was living in Africa, fairly disinteresteed in the boomer generation, and this was the book that turned it around. In many ways it was my first introduction to the decade, the way it was experienced here in the US, and also to the modern American psyche. Although it is a brilliant comment on the politics and mores of the time, the driving force throughout is the accurate, human, living characters that inhabit and inspire the novel. On top of the sometimes bleak, sometimes ecstatic narative thread, is the most poignant, wonderful love afair. Honest, not a word of schmaltz. I am perhaps biased by over 10 yrs of fond absence from this fantastic book, and I must confess that I'm more interested in finding a back copy than giving a constructive, objective review."},{"Title":"The LAST BEST HOPE. A Novel.","review":"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. Charles Dickens said it at the beginning of his story about revolution, love and lost dreams. Peter Tauber could have said the same at the start of The Last Best Hope. Fact of the matter is both stories have a preternatural similarity that says much more about life than about two authors from wildly different points of view.Coming of age in the 1960s, Tauber carried the burden of privilege, obligation and socio-political awareness with which all white middle class baby-boomers were burdened. The battles fought to escape or remain affected us all in myriad and more than a few found neither side of the cultural fence to be all it was cracked up to be.The story's protagonist was no different even though his epiphany and subsequent rapture is harsher than most. \\"You can't always get what you want,\\" said the Stones, \\"but sometimes you get what you need.\\" Another reviewer used the title American Beauty. If this referenced the movie rather than the Grateful Dead album or a cynical aside, then I applaud that person. That movie is the lineal descendant of The Last Best Hope.While many of you may disagree with the Old Testament implications of this comment, it is nonetheless what happened here, though perhaps with overtones that are Shakespearean. One can try to do his/her best but sometimes the fates are going to step in and let you have it. Maybe it's the result of vacillation; maybe it's comeuppance for not taking a stand earlier and maybe it's a case of no good deed going unpunished.Our notional hero exits college and becomes a member - or at least works for - the establishment. That it is the military/industrial complex makes the temptation and conflict at once deeper and more insidious. All the while his success in this arena is made somewhat distasteful by who and what his muse is and represents. This dichotomy is what I found most thought provoking in the book. How does one balance wants and needs, hopes and dreams, plans and schemes and just where does/should making a living fit into the equation?This is a wonderfully crafted story about a time of great impact to me personally. I found the ending to be devastating (I hadn't a clue until it happened) and - after some consideration of the use of that certain event - to have been the appropriate vehicle to an appropriate end.This is a far cry from \`Sunshine Soldiers,' Tauber's first book, a names-have-been-changed-to-protect-the-innocent comedic romp through basic training seen through the eyes of a reservist. Curiously, the distance is about the same as for this story's lead character as it was for the author."},{"Title":"The LAST BEST HOPE. A Novel.","review":"First of all I must point out that I read this book more than 15 years ago. It was a book that was passed around to so many people that the last time I saw my copy it had rubber bands holding it together. More important was the fact that people of all ages and backgrounds read it and took their own special meaning from the lives portrayed. This is probably the single best fictional historic account of a person coming of age in the 60's and 70's ever found. The characters were all reasoned and presented the joys and frustrations of an era that saw some of the best and worst times of the modern era. If anyone wants to understand where baby-boomers came from, and how they lost their souls, this is the book."},{"Title":"The LAST BEST HOPE. A Novel.","review":"I first read this book my freshman year of high school for honors History class. I must say, at the age of 14 I found the book overwhelming. Tauber gives what I now know are very accurate depictions of the social environment of the 60's/70's. The characters come to life in such a way that one can identify with them and understand the emotions of the time. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the social atmosphere of the 60s/70s. For anyone who wasn't grown or even born at this time, reading this book will give you such a great insight into what was going on and why it was such a turbulent time in our history."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"I have been a fan of Amazon for quite a while now but I have always resisted the temptation to write a review. That's until now. I have one whole bookshelf of Spanish courses and how-to-learn Spanish books. And in one of my closets, I have a box full of the same. Out of all the courses, only 3 or 4 of them have been actually helpful in teaching me how to speak Spanish. The others were courses that I do not regret buying because studying Spanish and evaluating different Spanish courses has grown into being a hobby of mine that I enjoy nearly as much as actually traveling to Latin America.Needless to say, FSI Programmatic Spanish is one of the courses that I know that really teaches you how to speak Spanish. But what separates this course from the other two or three courses that helped me speak Spanish is that this course also teaches you how to read and write Spanish, not just speak Spanish. I couldn't not imagine why anyone would want to speak Spanish and not be able to read and write it. Or maybe that might work well with a young single man looking to pick-up Latin women. But for a 50-something year old (quickly approaching 60)who enjoys traveling with his wife as I do, the thought of being in Latin America with your wife and not being able to read what is written is far from a pleasent thought.That's probably the reason why FSI Programmatic Spanish is my favorite Spanish course. If you are looking for a course with a method that has been proven over decades, and a course that can hold its own with any of the newer courses that only teach youhow to speak Spanish, but you also want a course that will teach you how to read and write Spanish, there's no need to search any further."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"I have tried several courses for trying to learn the subjunctive mood. This is the only course that really does a thorough job teaching the subjunctive.You may be able to make yourself understand in Spanish without knowing the subjunctive. But you won't sound too educated saying \\"quiero que usted llama\\" when the correct way to say it is \\"quiero que usted llame.\\"But like the other FSI courses, this one is also only for the serious student. If you are not serious about speaking Spanish fluently, stay away from this course and buy a Spanish phrase book for tourists for less than $2.It's a big plus that you also get the full FSI Spanish 3 and FSI Spanish 4 courses by downloads as bounus gifts when you buythis course. I also thought it was a good idea for them to re-master the original FSI recordings with enhanced digital sound. After being spoiled with today's technology I'd hate to have to listen to the recordings in analog as opposed to stereo."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"I really don't understand the wildly positive reviews for this product unless they are company plants. The audio quality is poor and there are no pauses to be able to repeat. The manual is also poor quality and full of stuff that seems to have no relation to what is happening on the tapes. Finding the matching section in the manual involves paging through numerous pages until you happen to stumble on the part you are looking for. No logical layout to any of it. If you have lots of patience and extra time to waste you could probably get some benefit from these, but there are much better products out there. I was thinking of trying the regular Learning Spanish Like Crazy Courses but now I'm reconsidering after seeing this mess."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"This is a good program but nowhere near as good as FSI Spanish 2. When you buy this, you can download FSI Spanish 3 and 4 for free. That is why I basically purchased this product.

But getting FSI Spanish 3 and 4 for free is the real draw."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"I sent this product back because it arrived very damaged. The CD encasements were broken and most of the CDs were scratched. The CDs looked like burned copies of the program with an FSI Programmatic Spanish label stuck on top. The PDF \\"textbook\\" was hard to follow along with the CDS and overall is an inconvenient replacement for a hard copy of the actual textbook. I also felt that it was overpriced, as I believe level 1 & 2 of the same program is actually available online because it's quite old. I cannot say that the program isn't effective being as I returned it, however I would recommend checking it out online at this website- http://fsi-language-courses.com/Spanish.aspx first to see if it's what you're looking for and to try to get a copy of the actual textbook."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"While the educative quality is good, it's totally ruined by the failure to update either the material and, particularly, failure to use decent media quality. The digital/print material is a bad copy job, the digital/audio material is sadly dated and poorly constructed, and the many of the discs don't function because of poor quality control.I'd look elsewhere for material and not waste my money here. The frustration is simply not worth it."},{"Title":"FSI Programmatic Spanish, Level 2 (Re-mastered)","review":"It's great to see how many people are learning Spanish, instead of barking about \\"English Only\\" laws and whatnot.I get a lot of material to learn this language. \\"Learning Like Crazy\\" has been very helpful. I'd also recommend the magazine, \\"Piensa en espanol/Think in Spanish Magazine,\\" which includes an optional CD supplement. Also, most DVDs have a Spanish subtitle option. And some DVDs, like those for the HBO series \\"Six Feet Under,\\" have a \\"dubbed in Spanish\\" option. These methods of learning keep the process fun."},{"Title":"Daredevil Punisher: Child's Play","review":"Although this depicts DD's first showdown with the Punisher- the first of many classic clashes between these two- and was my first exposure to Frank Miller's comic writing &amp; illustrating abilities, this collection is (literally) flawed. Every single copy of this TPB I've ever looked at has a few pages that are out of sequence. There's also a missing moment that was likely removed because the backstory involved was not included in this collection.Fortunately, all the issues reprinted in \\"Child's Play\\" have also been reprinted in the new \\"Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller\\" trade paperbacks. The color's better, the pages are in order, the missing panels are restored, and the backstory that caused the omission of these panels- AKA the \\"Death of Elektra\\" issue- is also included. Pick those up instead.\`Late!"},{"Title":"Daredevil Punisher: Child's Play","review":"Child's Play is a reprint of Daredevil #182-184, which co-stars the Punisher. These issues take place during Frank Miller's long and glorious reign on his seminal book. His hard hitting writing, and gritty, crime noir art style (with a heavy assist by the brilliant Klaus Janson) are definitely present in this volume. Punisher, long before his overexposure in the 90's, is cold blooded, ruthless, and absolute, much the way he is now, in his Marvel Knights and Max issues.Yet, the reason this book receives four stars instead of the full five, is the pure power of both these characters is lost in the quagmire of an overly preachy plot. Focusing on the inherent evils of drugs, namely \`angel dust', the story becomes trite, and sadly at the end, predictable.Do not let this be your one and only exposure to Frank Miller's run on Daredevil. Several graphics, including the Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller showcase his talent so much better. Especially recommended is Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller volume 2 ISBN: 0-7851-0771-1."},{"Title":"Peter Pan: Peter and Wendy and Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (Penguin Classics)","review":"If you never read the original tale and all you know is Disney's Peter Pan, be prepared for a completely different mood. Yes, Peter Pan is the kid that didn't want to grow, the lost boys and Wendy are there, but there is a constant sense of tragedy in the novel due to Peter need of love and denial of it.The book is masterfully written, borderline with surrealism, and very vivid imagery."},{"Title":"Peter Pan: Peter and Wendy and Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (Penguin Classics)","review":"I had only seen a movie of Peter Pan, but the book \\"Peter Pan and Wendy\\" is infinitely better.

The novel spans a great stretch of time through an important period in history with a big cast of characters. It has all the classic elements of those fun VCD dramas: a love story, a family breakup, a tragedy, political intrigue, some military action and enough history to make you think it's a true story.This was a fun book to read and very interesting; Oxnam really knows his stuff when it comes to this tumultuous period of Chinese history. But it's not a history book; it's a story about the lives of two people who are in love, but can never express that love. I can recommend this book not just to people that are interested in historical novels, but also to anyone that enjoys a good story in an interesting setting.The only thing I didn't like about this book is Oxnam's choice of writing style. It's written in third person omniscience, with shifting viewpoints, which is something more akin to nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century writing. Granted, it would be difficult to capture the full story with a limited viewpoint, but I found it hard to know who the viewpoint character was, especially as the viewpoint shifted with every paragraph and sometimes even within a paragraph. But other than that, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Ming: A Novel of Seventeenth-Century China","review":"Robert Oxnam is a member of the Asia Society &quot;think tank&quot;, the Council on Foreign Relations, and high level advisor to government and business elites who shape &quot;multilateralist&quot; China policy. Not surprisingly, this work of fiction papers over a pivotal period of Chinese history that remains a flashpoint for Chinese people (who know that the history was otherwise), with a globalist revision in which (for example) brutal Manchu conquerors were instantly benevolent and wise(they were not), turncoats are heroes (&quot;peace and stability&quot; are preferred to liberty and revolution), Jesuit missionaries are ethical (they were not), and Confucianism (his version of it) conquers all. While Oxnam does a decent job with period details, he thoroughly fails to grasp the psyche of real Chinese people. This is a trip in the curio shop, from a western perspective, and it has an agenda."},{"Title":"Fleeting Things: English Poets and Poems. 1616-1660","review":"This book is an absolutely wonderful read. It's both scholarly AND entertaining. A must-have for anyone interested in seventeenth-century lyric poetry."},{"Title":"Instant Period Costumes: How to Make Classic Costumes from Cast-Off Clothing","review":"This is NOT a guide to constructing period costumes -- her identification of the \\"periods\\" is more fantasy than fact -- but it does have clever ideas for fast and inexpensive costumes. This might make a good starting place for a costuming newbie who's overwhelmed at having to put together a whole show in just a few weeks. Experienced costumers can skip this book, since you've probably already come up with these ideas on your own.A word of warning: the author frequently dyes the second-hand clothing she uses, but you could probably skip that step in many of the examples (I don't know about you, but I don't know anyone who would let me use their washing machine to dye a wedding dress blue...!). It's the tips on combining parts of different garments that most people will find helpful.My main problem with this book is the title; if you just omit the word \\"period\\" then you've got a good idea of what this book IS good for. It would be useful for school musicals, masquerade parties, parades, Halloween, etc. but don't expect to costume a decent production of Shakespeare with the aid of this book.

Looking at her pictures will really help you to see the potential in those ugly old bridesmaids' dresses. I also appreciated her tips on how to use things like glue guns and cardboard for quick construction.

There's not enough detailed information for me to make these creations easily (I sew, although I'm not against using glue, staples, masking tape, whatever, in a pinch). If you have a thrift store with lots of cool cast off within a reasonable driving distance, many of the ideas in this book would be exciting to try. If someone had a good imagination, I might share this book with them to prove to them that they can think up ways to create interesting costumes.

Even though I'm enjoying my new geographical location, the book helps to fill those moments of nostalgia.Ann Zwinger's well-written text is evocative of my every Yosemite memory and Kathleen Norris Cook's breathtaking photography truly does justice to the magnificent scenery to be found in the Park.If you're able to find a copy and purchase it, don't just put it on your coffee table, read it!"},{"Title":"WHISTLE STOP","review":"I discovered a lovingly-preserved copy of Whistle Stop in the basement sale of the Boonton Public Library in Boonton, NJ, and frankly, my life has never been the same since. Maritta Wolff wrote this, her masterwork, in college, and it emerged from her pen almost utterly flawless, written with an artless candor perhaps only possible at her unaffected age.It's the story of a down-at-the heels family in a sleepy farm town in Michigan, and how they endure fate, and how they tempt it. Some are in pain, some are violent, some are ambitious, or selfish, and some have given up. Descriptively, you smell the sun-baked overgrown grass, you hear the creak of dilapidated floorboards, you hear and feel each taunt and jeer, and you feel their love and hate as if it is your own. Everyone is flawed and desperate, but everyone is alive in a way people don't seem to be anymore.After you invite these characters into your home, they won't ever move out, which is for the best, because each one is a touchstone to a facet of your soul."},{"Title":"WHISTLE STOP","review":"It was great to discover this book. I ordered three of Maritta Wolff's books. She was a very prolific writer.She was only 20 or so when she got this book published."},{"Title":"WHISTLE STOP","review":"I am a big fan of American literature of the early 20th century and liked this book very much for several reasons. I think Wolff does a fine job depicting the lives of the Veeches, their many small triumphs and big tragedies. I did find the list of characters a bit overwhelming at times, but got used to it after awhile. When one considers how young Wolff was at the time, then the book is even more an amazing feat. It is definitely worth the time reading; the 1946 film version, which I saw online, is not, unfortunately. The movie wastes the talents of George Raft (Kenny) and Ava Gardner (Mary) and distorts the novel's plotline beyond recognition. The only thing worth watching the film for is Ava Gardner, who is -- at 24 -- amazingly beautiful in every frame of this film.Back to the book. I would say that Wolff reminds me of Dawn Powell a bit and strives to achieve the realism of Theodore Dreiser or Sinclair Lewis, or even Willa Cather. Cather is the master novelist; Wolff falls short. She does not even reach the level of Dawn Powell, the great and relatively unknown author of very powerful novels of New York in the forties and fifties, as well as Ohio in the twenties. I am a fanatical Cather reader; a devoted Powell fan. Maritta Wolff has my appreciation and admiration, if not the emotional allegiance of Cather and Powell.I do recommend this book, however. It's a good story; the characters are believable and interesting. I am contemplating even reading more of Wolff, and commend this book to others with the caveat that there are better eye-witnesses to life in the forties and better books out there to be read and considered."},{"Title":"The Official Guide to the Smithsonian","review":"This book is just what you would expect from the Smithsonian, 224 pages of glossy pictures that leave you wanting more. The _Guide_ starts with about 35 pages of useful information such as how to get around DC and some of the history of the Smithsonian Institution. Then comes a quick survey of the different museums starting with that favorite, the Air and Space Museum, which is the home of the Wright Brothers first flying aircraft. And don't forget the Steven F Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport or you will miss a proto-type space shuttle. After surveying the rest of the Smithsonian museums near the National Mall, the _Guide_ includes a few other attractions in DC such as the National Zoological Park. A few noteworthy mentions in NYC round out the _Guide_.Of course, you could spend your entire two week vacation at the Smithsonian and never see it all. (Do an online search to see how big it is.) If you use the _Guide_ to plan a trip to DC, one thing I might suggest is that you learn to use the Metro (subway) system. The _Guide_ mentions it, but it is too bad that a map of the Metro system was not included. (Get one online.) If you buy the _Guide_ in order to remember a trip to DC, one thing that will quickly catch your attention is that the National Museum for the American Indian mentioned is the one in NYC.

I have not read the book yet so I am not able to comment on the work itself."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This book is really two books. It is arranged chronologically, with every chapter containing two part: first, the personal and \\"chessic\\" biography of Tal during the period discussed in the chapter, and then, a selection of games (annotated by him) played in that period.The biographical section (wittily written as an interview between \\"journalist\\" and \\"chessplayer\\") is extremely well-written. It is choke-full both of funny anecdotes (e.g., how Tal lost the first game of the 1962 Olympiad to \\"a tactical shot by an unknown player\\"--a drunk hit him over the head with a bottle before the opening ceremony) and of serious, insightful observations about Tal's own playing style, the style of other masters, and what being a chess master in the USSR was like. We get to \\"see\\" not only Tal's personality and thought, but also that of Smyslov, Spassky, Botvinnik, Geller, Bronstein, and the rest.And then there are the games. Analyzed by Tal himself, of course, long before computers, the analysis of the almost 300 games in the book is wonderful. It shows not only the lines Tal was considering, but also the psychology of the game, Tal's stylistic preferences, and so on. It is lightyears ahead of computer analysis--not because it is more accurate, but because Tal takes us into his mind and tells us the real reasons he chose move A over move B AT THAT MOMENT, giving us the feeling we are \\"in\\" the game.Unlike so many chess books, it's positively EXCITING to follow Tal's annotations. The difference between them and Fritz's analysis is like the difference between reading the baseball statistics the next day or watching the commentators during the live game. The statistics are sometimes more accurate, but...Each one of these parts would be well worth the price in itself as a seperate book. Together, they're amazing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This is not just a chessbook. It is a a complete biographical account of M. Tal's life and chess games. I am wholly satisfied with his notes on the games, how he shows his evolution in chess and how he displays his abilities of calculation.It is far more difficult to show a game with comments regarding it than just pasting some variations hurriedly. Tal explains what was going on in his mind while showing the different variations. In that sense, the book will not leave the amateur in the dark.A book replete of good humor and anecdotes... I recommend it because not only will you learn about chess but also entertain yourself."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"What makes Mikhail Tal's games collection different from that of other top GMs is that Tal's personality and unique thinking process shows through in this book. With other chess books, you get the impression of I went to the tournament, played and here are my notes to the games I won.What struck me about Tal's games is how so many of them were intuitive, i.e., Tal did not analyze to the end but was able to determine that his sac would maintain the initiative and to stop the attack required an immense amount of d calculation, impossible under practical limits.My only complaint with this book is that the binding started coming apart when I got to page 70 and that's inexcusable for a book costing in excess of $23."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"Mikhail Tal's entertaining writing is almost comparable to his games and his excellent commentary. It seems that Tal was one of the chess players who had a well rounded personality, besides being a great chessplayer. In his book you can follow the life of the person Tal besides his chess. It can be seen that he is a good natured and warm person. It is a pity that he had to pass away so early. The games are a joy to follow.

The only thing which might stop someone from buying it would be its high tactical complications. Often Tal will rattle off a variation and write \\" would obviously not work\\". However, he doesn't bother to explain it, assuming the reader understands why the variation can't be played. This is ok for an advance reader, 1800-2400+ range. But for the average player it maybe very difficult in some positions, especially complex endgames to see why white or black has a win.

However, the jewel in RHM's crown was The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal.I read this book, and found it enthralling. It is two books in one. The first part is a long, witty, superbly informative life of Tal up to 1975, in the form of an \\"interview\\" with Tal, which is actaully a self interview. This section is chockful of interesting positions and unanottated games. The second half consists of a hundred magnificent games, all brilliantly and instructively annotated.The book met with the acclaim of the whole chess world.

There are many books about Mikhail Tal, &quot;The Magician&quot;, an attacking player from Latvia who conjured up explosive tactics in the most surprising ways. This particular book blows away all the others, though; anyone who thinks chess is boring, or who is burned out as a chess player, should treat himself or herself to Tal. Tal went from a complete unknown (outside the USSR) to World Champion in a few short years. Tal's life, as well as his astonishing games, reminds me that chess is a beautiful and exhilerating hunt where everything is possible! He was also a very impish, funny man and this book's conversational style brings his personality through cleanly. Recently I read an interview with a Senior Master in the US who said beginners should avoid reading Tal because &quot;there's no way you can understand what he's thinking!&quot; Well, I may not understand his thoughts, but I can certainly enjoy his games!!"},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"I have always been a big fan of Mikhail Tal and, when I saw this book on a Barnes & Noble's bookshelf, I couldn't resist. This is a thick book and it would take a serious commitment on my part to read it so I postponed taking this plunge as much as I could. It came to a point when I started arguing with myself on what would be the point of having the book if I never read it. So, I did!The book has a lot of humorous comments regarding the surrounding circumstances involving each game. It is a very attractive and entertaining read. The problem is that I was spoiled by Bronstein with his masterpiece \\"Zurich 53\\". I had finished reading it just before starting Tal's book. Bronstein analyses each game and derives valuable positional concepts from them. From each analyzed game you learned something that could be immediately applied to your own games. Tal's book, in the other hand, is a sequence of brilliant games that are very pleasing to the eye but carries a huge baggage of unending tactical variations. There is nothing else but the tactical variations! If you ever read any of Kasparov's books you will know what I mean.If you are a devoted fan of Tal, then this book is for you. It has a selection of 100 of his best games analyzed by himself. Out of the two hundred plus games and positions covered on this book you will certainly improve on your chess skills by the simple fact that you are exposing yourself to this massive number of chess games. In addition to that, you will probably improve on your tactical skills as well. Very often, Tal would make analysis that didn't seem very thorough and I believe that he did it on purpose. On many occasions I felt like he didn't consider an obvious winning move but found out, after a few minutes of personal analysis, that a discovered attack or a fork made that move an obvious mistake. I'll have to admit it. This style of treating the reader as a grownup and not giving all the obvious continuations felt a little disconcerting and intimidating at first. However, once I got use to it, this teaching device turned out to be very refreshing and rewarding.In all, this is a good book to have and read. However, now that I've gone through it, I wish I could have chosen a book that gave me a better return for the great time invested."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"One of the things that make for a great biographical chess book is the honesty that author imbues in his life narrative. Although there have been a number of outstanding chess books of this type, Tal's book did break ground in the quality of his views.Outside of the great honesty and candor in the text is some great notes that help put you into the shoes of the late great Tal.Like the other reviewer, I have to report that the diagrams leave much to be desired."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"Pretty difficult book. The first few diagrams I didn't like very much, but if you continue you'll start to appreciate the book more and more, now I just love it. I likethe text combined with the games. I reccomend it to players who are already quite good."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"The book is a chess classic, one of the finest written by a world champion in the second half of the 20th century. It is a sort of 'monologue int&eacute;rieur' in which Mikhail Tal (Riga 1936 - Moscow 1992) interviews himself about his life and career, meanwhile presenting a selection of important and illustrative games.The book (covering up untill 1975) was first published in the seventies; it was reprinted in 1997, worked over by the best chess editor there is, the British grandmaster John Nunn. That is the edition this Kindle version is based on.For a chess player, of which many 'read' such a book with a board and pieces at the table, the original printed version(s) had a drawback: it was a very unhandy 500 pages fat paperback. The Kindle is much more convenient for playing over the games.The only pitty is (again, as with more chess books over here) the poor graphic quality of the chess diagrams with the games in the Kindle edition.For the rest it is as John Nunn says: \\"This is one of those rare chess books which is not only splendidly instructive, but also conveys a real impression of the author's personality.\\"And quite a personality Mikhail Tal was."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This book was the first book I purchased from Amazon, and was the reason why I applied to have a credit card to order it online. It's true that Mikhail \\"Misha\\" Tal is my chess idol, but nevertheless I wouldn't be biased if I said that of the many chess books I have, I'v never seen a more enjoyable book than this one. The book is written in a form of an interview with a chess player (Tal), and he talks about his Chess career and personal life mixed together in a very witty funny-way that would force you to love him and his style, even if you weren't a chess player already.The Chess theories that Tal has used in the book to illustrate his chess games, might be old and outplayed now. And perhaps I made a mistake to buy an old games book, to learn some openings from it, still, I learnt a lot from his games and personality. Mind you there are four things that you need to know before buying this book:1- The book is fairly old, as it was written in 1975, lots of the openings he played have changed in order a little bit, so make sure you analyze them right. The poor chap didn't even have the luxury of having Chess engines that time, and yet he was this brilliant. (I'm dead serious, you would think he's crazy in some games where he sacrifices material like crazy, so much like you're watching a thriller!).2- Some of the cool games played by him, aren't exactly annotated.3- The worse thing that broke my heart, is that he doesn't talk about his personal (romantic) life as I'v wanted. He mentions his wife and the birth of his son yes, but nothing about his personal problems that his 1st and 2nd wife talked about, nor his daughter Zhana. So you better know this fact from now on. He does mention though on how he grew up learning chess and how did meet and learn things from the other players, most notably his Trainer, Koblents. The latter is mentioned as his trainer in the World Championship final against Botvinnik, not GM Nezhmetdinov, which is very strange that the latter wasn't mentioned at all, despite how much Tal liked him?4- Am not sure if reading, and using the book too much is the reason, but if you did that the pages might fall! I don't know about the other copies or publishes, but I have an Everyman Chess copy. Still, unlike one of the(1 star) reviewers, pages falling apart is a silly reason not to buy a true chess classic, such as this one.I still carry the book with me if I had to travel, and always read it again and again, you just never get board of this book about Tal. You would really believe that he was the best tactical player ever, and that he was indeed ahead of his time. To me, he is the best Chess player ever, on and off the chess board. The book would just show you what type of a modest, kind, witty personality Tal had, that made him the legend he is today.Finally, to me this is the best Chess book ever written as a review, if not, to many it's at least one of the best 5 Chess books ever written. A must to have in your collection of Chess books. Hope you'd enjoy it too."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"The games in this book are great. I think Tal was ahead of his time with his fierce and cunning style. This is a very nice book and he makes it fun to read also. I am not very experienced in chess but I love it and I love to learn. That being said, this book is just great."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This is one of my favorite chess books, one of the few I can't do without. The chess is spectacular, of course, but what makes this book a classic is the way Tal's wit and wisdom shine through. He's a funny, engaging writer.Unlike others reviewers, I haven't had any trouble with the binding (knock on wood). I can recommend this book without reservation--just don't expect to undertsand all of Tal's moves on the first--or second, or third--go around."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"I own the original edition of this book got in the 1970s. It's binding is now held together with duct tape, pages are falling out, margins are filled with scribbling... well, you get the point. I used to carry it with me everywhere I went, until I became afraid of losing pages. It was and is my favorite chess book. Tal is a great writer with a wry sense of humor and an incredible imagination. His games are among the most entertaining in the history of chess. Opening this book to any page will reveal something that will amuse, astonish or instruct. It was with great pleasure that I greeted the news that this classic was once again in print. Every chessplayer should own a copy. The new edition from Cadogan (the original was from RHM, now defunct), is in algebraic notation ( I prefer the descriptive in the original edition, but only because my eyesight has worsened, and the descriptive notation was larger ) and Tal's complete tournament and match record is included ( this volume covers his career up to 1975, but he played great chess up until his death in 1992 ). Not much else is different. This book ranks up with the greatest classics of the game (Bobby Fischer's 60 Memorable Games, Alekhine's Best Games of Chess, Timman's The Art of Chess Analysis and Kasparov's Fighting Chess). The re-release of this book around the same time as the publishing of Shirov's &quot;Fire On Board&quot;, is the attacking player's dream. It has made my year."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"I've been a chessplayer for 40 years (best rating was 2250 ELO) and I still enjoy Internet chess. During my chess life I have read dozens of chess books, mostly in openings which are quickly outdated. Not this book. This is a great book by one of the five all-time best chess players (the others being Kasparov, Fischer, Alekhine and Capablanca). It's a book I return very often, simply for enjoying myself. In Chess, beauty does not lie in winning a game, but in the ideas and the conceptions that are required for the battle. Mikhail Tal had it all: an amazing mind, and the free-thinking that illuminates the lifes of lesser mortals. And the book is exceptionally well-written and well commented. I agree with other reviewers: this is probably the best chess book ever written."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This book is pervaded with a literary and anecdotal air that is rarely found in Chess literature (and, as I see it, is much needed). One gets the sense that he is reading the work of a man who deeply loved life and who took great pleasure in those little disjoint stories of which it is comprised whether or not they occured at the board. This book reads like a true biography with brilliantly annotated games acting as much welcomed photographs. Upon seeing the position from Tal's 1959 Interzonal game against Fischer, anyone interested in Tal will be captivated to hear Tal speak of how he tricked Fischer into losing a won position. The games and stories presented in this volume compliment each other masterfully. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest chess books ever written: In it one finds both great chess and great comedy. One must conclude that Tal was not only a master of chess but also of the pen!"},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This book, as many of the other reviewers have commented, is enjoyable to read in its own right even without the games. Tal comes across as self-effacing and amusing, for the most part; the inclusion of things like a diagram showing Tal blundering away a queen against Averbakh in a blitz game is a refreshing change from the egomania that seems to run rampant in high level chess. The book is broken up into nine chapters representing Tal's breakdown of his chess life into various eras. Each chapter has prose discussion of major events that Tal played in that time period, with lots of anecdotes and interesting asides. In these sections he occasionally inserts diagrams and partial game scores, with minor commentary.The latter half of each chapter is dedicated to games and their annotation. All in all there are 100 annotated games. I have not, by any means, thoroughly studied all of them. But I have looked at a fair number, and the quality of the annotation is generally quite good. Tal employs the same clear writing style in his annotations that he does in the prose sections, and it makes for good reading. The games can frequently be difficult to follow for a mediocre player like myself, but they certainly look cool.Many players stronger than myself say that careful study of this book will improve your play. After reading it, I found myself occasionally making sacrifices with absolutely no justification whatsoever, so it definitely did something. I plan to try to work through it thoroughly when I am a stronger player, but at the moment I feel I'm not making the best use of its lessons. Right now I'm giving Alekhine's best games a try instead.As a final comment, I see many people have had problems with the binding. While it certainly doesn't look very sturdy, I have read the entire book and haven't had any pages fall out. Admittedly I'm not keeping it spread open doing long analysis sessions, so it might be more of a comment on me than on the book."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"Easily the best autobiographical chess work I've seen. Tal's love of chess oozes from each page, and his light-hearted approach to a serious game is refreshing. The games are interesting, sometimes amusing, and always instructive.I only have one issue with this printing, and that's the horrible binding. The spine cracks easily if the book isn't held gingerly, and pages will fall out shortly thereafter. Very shoddy, especially in a book of this price. I still recommend it, because its content is so fantastic, but handle it with care."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This book has it all, Tal's autobiography told as a fictional interview, key positions of some games that are interesting to analyze and complete games with a thorough analysis.I remember that when my rating was 1500 USCF I got a book which had some games by Tal that were not analyzed and I couldn't understand a thing. It was funny, because with other players I could find some sense in the games, but with Tal, half the moves were unexplainable to me. This book helped me understand some of his games, and when you see the reason behind some of his moves explained and the analysis to support it, you will be awed! Although now I am a player rated 1800, there are still some sacrifices that are very tough to swallow, like the masterpiece in which Tal sacrifices his queen for a knight without any immediate compensation (a reviewer claims it is a queen for a bishop and another reviewer says there is no such game...well, it is a queen for a knight!).This book will fascinate you, I guarantee it! And you will open your mind to new tactical combinations and sacrifices that you had not considered in your wildest dreams!"},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"Mikhail Tal's autobiography is unique among chess literature. It combines Tal's self-effacing humorous style with his analysis of the games that made him one of the greatest combinational players of all time. He discusses his meteoric rise to attain the world championship and without any complaint, discusses how he lost it in the shortest period of time of any world champion. But most of all, are his games, his daring sacrifices, and his ability to pull wins from thin air (hence the nickname \\"the Wizard of Riga\\"). One thing a chess reader should not do is attempt to analyze Tal's games with a chess engine like Fritz, for Tal made many mistakes. His brilliance lies in the fact that his chess ideas were so complicated and beautiful that they overwhelmed opponents whose minds could not operate at pentium processor speed. Probably players in the intermediate to advanced range will find the book most enjoyable. However, the beginner will derive great benefit just from getting to know Tal. In any event, this book is a must have for any chess library."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This is the only chess book I have seen that is written as literature. Most of the book takes on the form of a witty self interview between a fictional reporter and a Chess player (Tal himself). The games and annotations are simply enchanting; Tal's anecdotes are sure to put a smile on your face. This is a truly excellent book that will improve your chess while it entertains you as well."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"I bought &quot;The Life and games of Mikhail Tal&quot; on the advice of many chess authors who have mentioned it in their works. I felt that if many Grandmasters rate it as the best chess book ever written, I probably wouldn't be dissapointed. I wasn't. The book is at once a superb peice of annotations and an insightful look into the life of one of the most beloved figures in chess history. It is a rare treat to be transported so vividly into the situations during some of the most famous games of modern chess, from the viewpoint of one of the players. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This is a great book that everyone should own that cares about Chess. Tal was one of the most exciting players to ever play the game of Chess. He came at a time when matches were just home preperation and memorization. This was not the way to play the game and he shattered Botvinnik. At a time when he was thought almost impossible to even consider beating. Also it was the ultimate challenge of Science vs. Humanity. Would the almost machine like logician be the victor over the Magician... The book is very well written and a real joy to read. I actually bought an original copy from 1976 of this book as well. I still have it wrapped up and kept very well. I bought it after getting the the newer version just to have. The cover on that book is different than one used for this version.What makes this so great is that Tal has a style to his writing unlike anyone else. Also he seems to be a bit nuts and that always helps the enjoyment. He actually takes the role of a journalist asking himself questions. So that is a bit of an odd thing if you consider it. Still he tries to explain situations and even what he is thinking sometimes. He comes off as being a really human person which is important. He makes it clear that he is not a machine he is mortal. He does not try to elevate himself and disrespect anyone etc. Some of the stories are very interesting also. He talks about a game vs. Fischer that most likely he was gonna lose. He explains how Bobby wrote down the move in almost russian notation and showed him. Hoping to get some sort of reaction I suspect. Tal knowing this was the move that just about beat him explains his thought process. The way he reacts causes Fischer to actually change his move and ends up losing or drawing to Tal. This is rather interesting esp since I think Tal had a + score over Fischer. He talks about another game where his opponent planned to wear dark glasses. He hears of this and decides to don his own sunglasses. What happens next you will have to get book to read :). The popular Hippo story is also a favorite of many of his fans. He talks about other not so happy topics as well. I had wrote a really long review for this book some time ago. Yet for some reason it got deleted so hope this one works out better. I have some other books from Tal I have yet to review as well. Reason it takes so long to review them is there is so much to the books. Makes it very difficult to explain just how good the book is. Maybe I am biased cuz Tal is one of my favorite players. Yet I really do not use any of his openings or anything. Just from this book and other things I guess it helped create a strong liking. I am not sure I can really explain it. Yet I know there was and still is something very special about Tal. I regret that I never got to meet him in person etc. Still if your just into the pure chess side of things the book is also good. He did play lots of great players and his career spanned a long time. So consider with great care picking up this book. I enjoy just reading this book, him talking about the games though is priceless."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"Mikhail Tal's game collection is one of the best books ever written by a world champion, but I cannot recommend this edition and here's why: Cadogan Books always fall apart! Regardless of the size of the book, I cannot get through a Cadogan book without half the pages falling out. The pages started falling out before page 80 of this 496-page book. Tal is probably the best writer of all the world champions, but do you really want to pay twenty-five bucks or so for a book that falls apart while you're reading it and has little or no resale value? Despite all that, if you don't mind reading your books in pieces, by all means buy this book. For you, I give this book 5 stars. Cadogan has several other great chess books and will surely publish more great ones in the future; but I won't be qualified to review them, because I will NEVER buy another Cadogan book again."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"This is truly a GREAT book!!

It is a very witty account of his life up to 1975 but far from the truth... It is still an open question to know wether Tal was obliged to lose his return match to Botvinnik in 61. As a jew with a very original thinking in soviet Russia, the man was not free; accounts of his life released after his death in 1992 make this clear( see Gennadi Sosonko's \\"my Misha\\" in Russian silhouettes); nevertheless, it stands apart in the dull world of chess players autobiographies..."},{"Title":"The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal","review":"Well, the games are owesome, great games selections, you can the see the instic of Mikhail Tal, the brilliant of the tactic combination.Buying this book, you gain a tactic manual and chess culture about one of the most natural skills in chess history.The author, knows the critical position, and show in diagram, you can taste how Tal manoeuvres, crash some position.When i open the book, i was trully disapointed, this book doesn't have pic's, Everychess, is the second time they did this to me.They never insert pic's, in the book, when is about the life of a chess player, is because of that i took one start.

I admire Tal for his humble approach to analyzing his own games and discussing his extrodinary accomplishments. Through this book I have learned an artistry and attention to detail, and possibly enhancement in my own games. The autobiographical accounts discussed by Tal give you a good perspective of the competitions he takes part in. There is also accounts of when and how he became a smoker, details into his medical procedures and how it affected him in his play and mood. I feel very thankful to have this unique account of Tal through his own words and through his own assessment of his games. Be prepared to be inspired by his colorful calculations that seem to come alive at the board the creativeness and amazing use of the pieces. I believe chess players that try to aspire to one brilliancy in all of Tal's games will benifit by the creative approaches and look beyond the simplification towards more complexity, and to not be afraid to sacrifice a piece for activity, initiative, or tactical devilry.

Like I said, kind of a bridge between the real Anne books and the books about her kids. I also missed the presence of the Avonlea people like Marilla, Diana, Mrs. Lynde, and so on.

They make life long friends that are as pleasant as Diana Barry and Rachel Lynde. L.M. Montgomery makes the charecters come alive. They go through things that we can relate to today. Her excellant writing makes this easy to read whether you are 10 or 100. I highly recommend that if you enjoy this book you need to read the first four books. Then there is three more books. If that isn't enough there are two movies. I hope that you enjoy this series as much as I have."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I'll always have a special place for the earlier books, especially 'Anne of the Island', but nothing is unmatched to 'Anne's House of Dreams'.I always have a certain problem when reading Anne books. Although I enjoy the plot and characters, I resent the melancholy, wistful feel to it everytime Anne goes into a new chapter of her life. There was the last chapter of the first book; 'A Bend in The Road', where the simple description and mood of the scene was so heart-wrenching that I almost cried. 'Anne of Avonlea' was just as sentimental as the previous book, with Anne realizing she cannot turn back time to when she was eleven. We, as readers feel the impact too. We have come to love each and every one character in Avonlea and we cannot stand to watch the years go by and be forced accept that the people are changing. 'Anne of the Island' cured that depressing tone slightly by bringing in cheerful college life but still retained the usual Avonlea village scenes into it. A romance brewing between Gilbert and Anne also helped distract readers from getting too upset about Anne growing up and leaving her childhood days forever. But nevertheless the proposal scene at the last chapter brought up those suppressed feelings out once again and left us smiling a bittersweet smile at the closing descriptions of the book.But in 'Anne's House of Dreams', we are introduced to a whole new atmosphere. No longer is Anne running dreamily into magical forests and delighting in fairy brooks, listening to the whispers of the trees or playacting as a Fair Maiden with her childhood friends. The fairy-tale, static forests of Avonlea are replaced with a vast sea, salty breezes and spicy scents of seagrass in the air. Whereas the previous books were stuffy and melancholic, this book is wonderfully refreshing and light. Instead of feeling that everything is going to end (growing older, beloved characters dying, leaving Green Gables and Avonlea), we find ourself anticipating Anne's new life as a married woman.And the plot construction! I've never read an Anne series with a plot so tight and focused. The twist at the end concerning Leslie's husband was the cream of the crop, and I've also enjoyed the beautiful life-story of Captain Jim. Even Anne and Gilbert are involved into this snug plot, they are mostly the benefactors of the events: Gilbert's idea to cure Leslie's husband and Anne's idea to have Captain Jim's life-story written down.On the other hand, I would complain that there weren't many scenes of the old characters; save Gilbert (duh) and Marilla. It's as if Anne is losing contact with her old life, which makes me a bit sad. I was dying to know more about Davy, Diana, Paul Irving, the Pyes, and even Charlie Sloane. I would love the series more if Anne remained in Avonlea and raised her family in the midst of the atmosphere that we have come to recognize and cherish. What's the use of getting us attached to the 'Lake of Shining Waters' and 'The White Way of Delight' and 'Lover's Lane' and 'Hester Gray's garden' and 'Dryad's Bubble' if Anne was going to move away and leave all those memories behind? Blame it on Gilbert. (kidding)I finished reading this book with a heart-warmed feeling in my heart for the first time, it seemed more appropriate as a beautiful closure to the series. It should have ended here instead of dragging along until she fades away to become a secondary character in the next three upcoming books."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I love Anne but I've always felt that L M Montgomery's depiction of her degenerated in the later books. Anne was happy having children but I don't believe that meant Anne had to sacrifice all her dreams and talent to the altar of Gil and children (not to mention Susan). I hated how Anne would constantly put herself down. It is almost as though L.M. Montgomery was saying that girls could not have it all. It's awful how Anne would say things like &quot;I had wonderful dreams when I was younger, but I'll never make Who's Who&quot;, or how she never even made an attempt at writing Captain Jim's life-story, saying something like &quot;I know what I can do, I can only write fairy stories.....&quot;, which implies that it was beyond her. Anne topped the batch in English at Redmond and her talents in her youth were prodigious. It is cop-out for Montgomery to have condemned Anne to life as a doctor's wife in a provincial town. Her creative potential was never fulfilled."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"&quot;Anne's House of Dreams&quot; is my least favorite of L. M. Montgomery's novels in the Anne of Green Gables series, which does not mean it is not a first-rate novel. For me, I guess it was a bit anticlimactic for Anne and Gilbert to finally get married, especially after it took three novels for the Anne girl to admit what everybody else knew from the start, that Anne Shirley and Gilbert Blythe were made for each other. But then I read the books in the order they are numbered and not the order in which Montgomery wrote them, in which case I would have skipped &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot; and would therefore not have been bothered by all that time between the engagement and the wedding.In this fifth Anne of Green Gables novel the newlyweds move into their House of Dreams and start their life together. For the first time Anne is more of an observer than a participant, as the two main characters of the book turn out to be the storytelling Captain Jim and the tragic but romantic figure of Leslie Moore. The most fascinating part of the novel is that the only way you can tell Anne is about to have a baby is that she stops going outside and Marilla shows up (and I have to admit I was shocked, shocked I tell you, that her son's first name is James rather than Matthew). Perhaps no other aspect of Montgomery's work gives us as good an indication that she is writing about another time.After this volume the emphasis will be more on Anne's children and their friends than our beloved red-haired orphan, so &quot;Anne's House of Dreams&quot; is very much a transitional book in the series. As she becomes an adult and starts living a grown up life, Anne Shirley becomes less interesting to Montgomery than the children (and in &quot;Rainbow Valley&quot; the interesting ones are even the Blythe kids). It is nice to say that if this is the &quot;low&quot; point in the series, then other writers should be so lucky with their high points."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I have all of the Anne of Green Gable series and continue to read them over again, delighting in each new discovery that I missed when reading it before.Anne's House of Dreams starts when Gilbert Blythe, who has loved Anne ever since they were children, becomes the doctor he has set his ambitions for. Anne had discovered that she was in love with Gilbert and so they are happily married and off to Four Winds Harbor where they start their new life, together.Finding beauty and adventure wherever Anne turns she is forever making friends and finding new discoveries. Miss Cornelia becomes a friend as does the forever-interesting Captain Jim.A mysterious young woman capitivates Anne's curious attention however and she finds that the young woman's name is Leslie. She cannot forget the beautiful but sad creature who seems to be hiding something. Enters Owen Ford and by chance mystery starts to be slowly revealed ...This book was (and still is!) a fantasic read and I recommend it to anyone! As well as any other &quot;Anne&quot; books!"},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"Some of the wit and magic is missing from Anne's life in the beginning of this book. She's grown up, and there seems to be no real hurdles to cross, or conflict. It makes for a slow read for the first third of the book, while you wait for something to actually happen, instead of a completely idyllic life. Thankfully, things pick up by the 2nd third, and the reader is rewarded by the Anne we all know and care for- responding with love and romance to life's situations and participating in the redemption of those around her. Certainly the ending is a O'Henry twist you wouldn't ever expect. Here again is Anne that you have to sigh over in delight, and kick your feet in the air and laugh in the exhilaration of love found again."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"The Anne novels never cease to amaze me. With all the trashy romance novels out there today, it would be hard for someone to call this book &quot;romantic&quot; in its simple, pure ways, but it is. The setting of the story is described so well that I could nearly feel the ocean air on my face. There was also a vivid cast of characters that was very much alive. The plot itself is far more complicated than other Anne books, but that does not reduce the quality of the author's work, nor does the book lose its poetical sense. Anne's House of Dreams is like reading a very long poem that is difficult to forget."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"Anne's House of Dreams is a very enjoyable book to read. LM Montgommery's writing style is so easy to follow. I read the other \\"Anne\\" books in sequence and felt I couldn't stop reading them until I got to the end.

They always make me laugh and cry as much as they did the first time I read them, possibly even more so now, because I can now relate to a lot of the experiences she has as she grows up into a woman and mother.Many readers are aware of the 6 original Anne books by Lucy Maud Montgomery - Anne of Green Gables, Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island, Anne of Windy Willows, Anne's House of Dreams and Anne of Ingleside (all beautifully written and thoroughly enjoyable books), but there are two further books by Lucy Maud, which may or may not be in print now, called Rainbow Valley and Rilla of Inglside. These final two books in the series tell more of Anne's story through the exploits of her 6 children and are well worth a read - both made me laugh and cry in equal measure.All of these books leave you wanting more from Anne and I believe that is the mark of a truly fabulous book! :)"},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"\\"Anne's House of Dreams\\" is the fifth of L.M.

Longtime admirer and patient suitor Gilbert Blythe has finally completed medical school, and the two can at long last be wed.

It is a time of transition for the former red-haired orphan Anne Shirley, fresh from three years of independence as high school principal and teacher at Summerside. At long last wed to former childhood rival Gilbert Blythe, Anne must leave Green Gables and Avonlea for a new home in Glen St. Mary and a new life as wife, housekeeper and mother-to-be.Montgomery takes her time getting Anne and Gilbert to Glen St. Mary. The first chapters are a measured farewell to the characters and locale of the early novels. However, the author wastes no time introducing new characters, including the priceless old storyteller Captain Jim, Anne and Gilbert's mysterious and beautiful new neighbor, Leslie Moore, the strong-minded Miss Cornelia Bryant, and the unique maid of all work Susan Baker.In Glen St. Mary, Anne will face the challenges of newly-wed life and parenthood, and the demands of new relationships.

It's a small house, since Gilbert is still new in his career as a doctor, but Anne just loves her pretty House of Dreams and the new friends she makes, including Leslie Moore (who has a interesting story of her own with a surprising conclusion) and a captain that she eventually names one of her future children for.As Anne grows into her role as a wife, she prepares for one as a mother - but her first birth is bittersweet as the child dies (through absolutely no fault of anybody's) and this of course hurts Anne deeply. This experience is a painful lesson, but one from which Anne learns and matures further from.

This book is a wonder and a true helper to my own life."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I really like Lucy Maud Montgomery and her books but I have to admit this is not one of her best books. I loved the middle books about Anne is college and it is kind of hard to see her grow up and deal with grown up issues. I am used to her being the little girl who uses large vocabulary and is awkward. I am used to her being a girl in college living at &quot;Patty's Place&quot;. But I'm not used to her having children. I thought this was sort of a depressing book. Maybe LMM was going through a tough time in her live when she wrote this. Usually her books are so cheerful and lively with such vivid characters. But Mrs. Cornelia Bryant (even though I loved her character) got a bit offensive and annoying. Leslie Moore seemed a bit melo-dramitic. I really did like Captain Jim though. I give this book 4 stars because I would never think of giving LMM less than that but I thought this book was very bitter-sweet."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"Being a devoted Anne fans, I will no doubt say that I love and treasure all the Anne Books just as I treasure my family and friends. But among them....this book is certainly my *love*. Not only can we really see the bloom of Anne and Gilbert's love, we can really learn a lot from Anne in this book, ie..the way how she treats her friends. Anne is the kind of person whom everyone would love to be friend with, see how Captain Jim, Miss Cornelia and Leslie love her. She is the kind person who won't mind how other talks about her, and is always ready to console and help her friends...see how she still loves Leslie after Leslie had told her about her jealousy over Anne and Gilbert.Anne Shirley really belongs to the race of Joseph and if I were to be born a hundred years ago, I am sure I would love to be accquainted with Anne too.

There is the romantic aspect of Anne and Gilbert setting up house together, then there are some of my very favorite characters - Captain Jim and Miss Cornelia. They certainly don't make them that way anymore! Between the four of them (five including Leslie) there are so many thought provoking discussions, and we get a fascinating view of life \\"on the harbor\\" for those times.But what really sends this book way over the five star category is definitely Miss Cornelia! This is a character that not only is living and breathing throughout the book, you wish she would pop up in your living room! Wouldn't I love to meet her! If you like strong, independent women, and you thought that they were only a character of fiction (surely a hundred years ago women were meek and timid?), well, this book was written quite some time ago, and Miss Cornelia could almost put Gloria Steinhem to shame! Miss Cornelia is the strong, independant woman that you thought did not exist in those days - she owns her own house and fields, she manages very, very well, thank you very much, will not get married because she doesn't want a man telling her what to do, and certainly does not need a man to help her self-esteem! She also thinks that men were only put on this earth to enslave women, and the world would be much better off without them \\"believe me!\\") I love her favorite phrase \\"isn't that just like a man\\", it became part of my mental thinking process.Certainly better than anything written today!"},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"This is about Anne Blythe and her husband Gilbert Blythe who, after their marriage move to a quaint little house and meet their few neighbors, one of which is Leslie Moore, a beautiful young woman who has suffered many tragedies.

We only see someone that we now is Anne but from her actions it dosent seem like her. Anne is depressing and not self asured in this book and you cant help but wonder where L.M.M character that we love so well went.

It's handsome Owen Ford and the beautiful Leslie Moore who are passionately in love. They are one hot, gorgeous couple--in fact, they make Anne and Gilbert seem dull, bland and boring by comparison!Both Leslie and Owen are renegades--non-conformists who follow their own rules and live by their wits. They've both been hurt and disillusioned by the world around them. But they're also idealists who secretly desire love--and when they first met, the sexual attraction is so intense you can almost feel it through the pages of the book! This attraction grows stronger and Owen eventually decides his love for the married Leslie is wrong--so he tragically leaves town, assuming he will never see her again. By an odd twist of fate, Leslie eventually becomes a \\"free woman\\" and they reunite. The passion and desire felt between them is beautifully written--and it's extremely sensual for a book first published in 1917.By comparison, Anne and Gilbert are the boring married couple who are settled in their ways. We are even treated to their \\"first fight.\\" Lucy Maud Montgomery admired men who were creative free-thinkers and non-conformists---both Owen Ford and another favorite--Barney Snaith of \\"The Blue Castle\\"--fit this description perfectly. Unfortunately Gilbert doesn't even come close. As the tiny town's physician, he has become self-righteous and uptight. Lucy Maud stopped making Gilbert interesting after her second \\"Anne\\" book and he's basically a non-entity from there on. But you won't say that about Owen!"},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"First of all, I must confess I'm not a huge Anne fan. I don't read this book so much for Anne and Gilbert as for Leslie and Owen. Their story is so romantic, so dramatic, fairy tale like, and sort of sappy. It's not the sort of book you are always in the mood for, but when you are it definitely 'hits the spot' as they say.Picture a beautiful, love starved, miserable girl suffering silently on a gorgeous harbor in a gloomy house. Watch as she is transformed and comes to live happily ever after. Definitely all- girl and definitely fun.The way Lucy Maud Montgomery describes the scenery, the ocean and all at Anne's new home is beautiful. Leslie's story is beautiful. If you want something sweet, fanciful while not fantasy, and just. . . lovely read this book.Only thing I don't like is Captain Jim. He is boring and sort of drives me crazy, but he is in the book a ton. I often just skim the parts he's in.Miss Cornelia is another new character, and she is sometimes annoying but on the whole is amusing.I guess that's it. I also like all the Biblical references in the conversations. A lot of them are somewhat obscure, so they're probably some I'm not even picking up on, but they're good."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I love the Anne of Green Gables Series. I loved all the books. I am also an avid fan of Anne and Gilbert and I was horribly disapponted that this book didn't have much romance in it. First of all, Anne's Wedding, I mean, she was so excited about the prospect of her future wedding in the first book I was sure there would be this big huge description about it, but alas, much to my dismay, there wasn't. I also thought there would be lots of stuff about her and Gilbert, and sure, it surpassed all the other books, but it just wasn't enough to satisfy my unpleasable needs.My personal favorite part was when Anne lost her baby. I know that sounds horrible, but it really was. Lucy Maud Montgomery did such a good job of scripting it out. But my favorite part was when Anne was asking Gilbert why he wasn't happier and if something was wrong with the baby and it said that he took a long while turning around, then looked into her eyes. That right there almost got me sobbing, but then again, as a hopeless romantic, almost anything does.I liked it, I always tell people to read the series. I read Anne Of Green Gables, the first novel in third grade and didn't really get into it enough to read the rest of the series. Then our teacher gave it to us as required reading in the sixth grade and so of course I resented it. Then, eight years later, I thought, \\"Gee, it's a Friday night and I'm bored.\\" So I went to the bookcase and saw the series that had been sitting there patiently since I got the boxed set for Christmas at age nine. I thought of just reading the second one but decided to give the first one final chance. And I was completly [into the book], I finished it in three days and had completed the whole series in less then a month. I reccomend them to anyone who has a bit of imagination."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"This was a good book with a delightful set of characters. My own personal favorite was captain Jim, with his stories about the sea, and of his lost love, \\"Lost Margaret.\\" It's not just a happy book that bores us because Gilbert and Anne do lose a child, and they do quarell. However, I think my biggest dissapointment is the lack of Gilbret throughout the entire Anne series. Really, in Montgomeries books we see much more of the male friends of her heroines than their lovers. Gilbert as a character isn't built up at all, I don't really know anything about his personality. He's just a puppet. I'm so eager to know more about him, but it's like he's just a foil for Anne's character. If they were friends perhaps we would know more about his personality. I wish Anne had married someone like David in \\"Mistress Pat\\", Barney in \\"The Blue Castle\\" or Dean in \\"Emily's Quest\\" , or even Jingle in \\"Pat of Silver Bush.\\"The relationship between Pat and Jingle is especially moving. But because Gilbert and Anne did not grow up as friends the way Teddy and Emily, and Pat and Jingle did, it's hard to fully understand their feelings for one another...or appreciate the developement of their relationship. I was also dissapointed that Anne gave up her ambitions with marriage, although I understand that Montgomery must have been catering to what society wanted of her during that time period."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"Although most of the book was a bit iffey, the description of the death of Anne's first baby was incredibly powerful and real.

I cried when Anne and Gilbert loss their first born, Joy.Read this book."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"For those who love Anne of Green Gables, this book is one to cherish. It is the fifth book in the series. In the books between Green Gables and House of Dreams, Anne grows up, quarrels with Gilbert, goes to school, teaches, makes up with Gilbert, and gets engaged. In House of Dreams, Anne and Gilbert finally get married and settle down with a small medical practice in a cove on Prince Edward Island. They meet an interesting old lighthouse keeper with many stories to tell, Anne makes friends with Gilbert's patients and the townspeople, and gets pregnant. This is a marvelous love story, and one of the best of the series. I have been reading and re-reading these books since I was a child. I own the whole set, some in first editions, some in reading copies for friends. If you have read Anne of Green Gables, you will definitely love this book."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"This book is about finally finding your true love and creating a home for him. Anne's House of Dreams is fairly anticlimatic, and does not have quite the same romantic suspense as Anne of the Island. But the reader cannot help but be taken in by the turn of the century seaside setting and the dreamy quality of the narrative. Anne finds happiness with longtime friend and beau Gilbert Blythe. We see the mature Anne as a young married woman who still has adventures. She meets a host of other characters, neighbors who enrich the story. There are stories within stories, spooky nights, misty harbours, and safe shores. I was rooting for Anne as she danced along the seashore, singing to herself, taking up her skirts by the waves. And she makes friends and acquaintances along the way. A pleasant book altogether. It takes you to a place you want to go back."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"Most of the new characters are very entertaining and have great stories, the memorable 'Captain Jim' could have his own novel! The stories of the new characters take up a lot of the book, but the worst part is that Anne is changed. She is a good housewife--but a housewife only; it seems her aspirations are gone. She refuses to write a book for a friend because \\"she can only write fairy stories\\". What were the years at Redmond for? Her childhood/adolescent dreams? The joy she felt after having a story published during college? She also comes close to groveling at Gilbert's feet. For example, in one chapter, Anne strongly disagrees with a subject that could make her new friend's life dark and difficult. She shows her firey temper and opinion then--but when all works out as Gilbert said it would, she apologizes profusely. Not for her temper; but for disagreeing and saying that he was wrong. I really miss the peppy Anne of the first three books. Thus, read the book to get the whole Anne story--but get it from the library."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I was super excited to read this book, knowing that Anne and Gilbert would finally be married in it.Little did I know that Anne would become totally boring once she got married, that L.M. would completely lose the magic that is anything about Anne, and that the folks in Avonlea would get maybe five brief mentions each in the book. (I exaggerate, but only slightly.)This entire book was about the other characters in their new location. Anne and Gilbert may as well have been minor incidental characters. It'd be like if Jane Austen had done a follow-up to Pride and Prejudice and then took Elizabeth and Darcy almost completely out of it, when THOSE TWO are the ones you want to read about.Extremely disappointing."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK!

Gilbert was a little too soppy in this story, but it is okay. And I really, really enjoyed the wedding scene. And the whole Leslie Moore story is so exciting, but sad...until she meets the sexy (by 1900's terms :-p )Owen Ford! And Captain Jim is something else...he is such an enjoyable, lovable character and the story of lost Margaret is slightly cliched (perfect love swept away, man vows never to love anyone else), but WONDERFUL."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"Anne and Gilbert finally have what they've been waiting for.

Montgomery's Anne of Green Gables series. The book begins with Anne and Gilbert's wedding at Green Gables, and chronicles the first few years of their lives together through happiness and hardship.Despite the fact that Anne and Gilbert finally seem to get their happy ending in Anne's House of Dreams, some of the magic of the earlier books is lost in this novel. I can't really put my finger on any one thing and say, \\"that's it - that's where it went wrong,\\" but something is definitely missing.Anne, of course, is still Anne - a young woman with a enviable zest for life, who seems to touch the lives of everyone around her - but one thing has changed: she's forsaken her creative dreams for a set of different dreams. It was a switch from the Anne I've come to know and love, and I didn't really care for it. Montgomery has also created another fabulously eccentric cast of characters, but they don't seem as well-drawn as past characters.Thankfully Montgomery's writing is still beautiful. She was a master of descriptive and lyrical fiction:\\"The garret was a shadowy, suggestive, delightful place, as all garrets should be. Through the open window, by which Anne sat, blew the sweet, scented, sun-warm air of the August afternoon; outside, poplar boughs rustled and tossed in the wind; beyond them were the woods, where Lover's Lane wound it's enchanted path, and the old apple orchard, which still bore it's rosy harvests munificently.\\" Can't you just picture it? The one thing that remains wonderful about this series is Montgomery's wonderful style of writing.Although it is not my favorite, Anne's House of Dreams is still worth reading. This novel has lost a little of the \\"feel\\" of the earlier books, but still makes a good addition to Anne's story."},{"Title":"Anne's House of Dreams (#5 in Series)","review":"I am so very, very pleased that the book that was sent to me is identical to the cover shown on the product page!

I'm a VB6 developer trying to make the transition to VB.NET. I analyzed a number of different books, including those published by Microsoft Press, and ultimately decided on this one for its thoroughness. Overall, the book is very well written, organized quite logically, and doesn't miss any details. On top of that, the bonus CDs you get with this &quot;complete course&quot; over just the book alone are incredible! I found most of the audio commentary extremely dry, and didn't really add much to the printed material, but the extra exercises and having all the code and answers right inline with the text was amazing.The exercises at the end of each lesson are extremely challenging and really sound down the concepts into your mind. For example, on the chapter dealing with arrays, including sorting and searching, one of the exercises is to rewrite the QuickSort algorithm that Microsoft uses natively in the Array.Sort method. This exercise really impressed on me how to get the most out of recursive functions, and how to build efficient procedures.Currently, I'm only about 400 pages into this 1500+ book, but I'm eagerly looking forward to finishing it. To be honest, I think this book is better than taking an instructor-led course. I can't wait for Advance VB.NET to come out from Deitel so I can tackle that as well.Bottom line, buy this complete course.

I surely can not recommend this book.Richard BonnMCSE"},{"Title":"Deaf Artists In America: Colonial to Contemporary","review":"I first heard of this book while corresponding on the internet, and when I purchased the volume, I was immediately struck by the twin artistries which assailed my eyes - a selected group of beautiful drawings and paintings, and the mellifluousness of the descriptive prose which brought each work of art to life. The skill of the author, who is totally deaf herself, in making you feel that you are standing at the artist's elbow as each work is being painted, has to be an art form all by itself. As I read her cogent words, and examined each of the photographs, I could not help feeling that just as we marvel at the master works of such great musicians as Beethoven and Smetana, works composed when each was deaf; we must also stand in awe of such beauty produced by artists who lived in a hearing world, a world which often shunned the art of the deaf, and yet their magnificent works betrayed no sense of resentment or jealousy; just people and a world as they saw it, complete with clowns, society ladies, acrobats, deaf people, still lifes, barnyard inhabitants, and a lot of love. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who loves art, and sensitivity, because both are evenly portrayed in this beautiful volume."},{"Title":"Deaf Artists In America: Colonial to Contemporary","review":"A long overdue book. When are we finally going to appreciate the creative impetus of impaired dimensions? I am that I am. Whatever the Mind's Eye reflects onto the genius of Art, that is the corner of Infinite Ecstasy for the beholder!I have personally known a NY deaf artist, who is well mentioned in this excellent book (Wildbank), and I found him extraordinary in all aspects with his sense of color, re-visualization, approach to subliminal sources of imagery: a feast of senses, where senses are not there in full. How can you not stand in awe?The illusionism of the images presented in this book works because it reflects the vision of artists envisaging through another plane of appraisal. Artists here so carefully construct the perceived space, create the sense of texture in objects, and naturalistically render light effects that the viewer feels immediately drawn into that world.Wildbank for instance provides me with acceptance of his work's existence as a matter of course. My overriding sense in looking at his production is that if illusionism exists here, it is to be found in the Mind, not in the reality it reflects.The artificial constructs of certain paintings presented in this books are dynamically charged in space and are convincing because of the realistic character of the light and textural effects the artists create, that can only be engedered by a different perceptual stance. Colors range from the deep reds, blues, and blacks in the shadows to the very light, almost pastel tones of the summarily indicated patterns on sunlit and receding planes along top and left edges.In many instances the artists presented accent the textural characteristics of their painted objects through the way light hits their surfaces. You can comprehend the interest of a deaf artist in the interaction of light with such objects, when silence dominates everything else around them. Upon examining these light effects, one realizes not only how carefully the artist observes its various characteristics, but also how he uses them selectively and creatively. By selectively eliminating shadows, at times the artist minimizes the temporal quality of the light entering the painting. The shadows create the semblance of reality while minimizing the transitory nature of the moment.A must read for the discovery of silent creative auras."},{"Title":"The Essential Mixer Cookbook: 150 Effortless Recipes For Your Stand Mixer and All of Its Attachments","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The photographs are gorgeous and all the recipes sound and look divine. But I have yet to try a recipe from the book that didn't need at least minor tweaking to work, and one of the recipes ended up causing a huge (and expensive) problem.Some of the problems are minor: The basic pasta dough needs about two tablespoons of water to come together properly, and the spinach pasta will need more. Some aren't so minor: I have no idea what on earth the pretzel recipe is supposed to produce (paving bricks, maybe?), but the dry, stiff, crumbly dough was impossible to work with even after I added a lot of water and kneaded it vigorously with the dough hook and with my hands. I went over the ingredients several times to make sure I didn't miss something, so I'm inclined to wonder if the recipe as it's written in the book is missing an ingredient or a step.And then there are the downright disastrous problems: The tagliatelle (pasta) recipe produces too much dough for a 5-quart Artisan KitchenAid to handle. The dough clogged the workbowl, jammed the dough hook, and burned out my KA's motor in just a few seconds.Maybe there are some decent recipes in the book (I'm too afraid to try another one and risk my poor mixer again), but I'd advise fellow KitchenAid addicts to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Essential Mixer Cookbook: 150 Effortless Recipes For Your Stand Mixer and All of Its Attachments","review":"About a month ago, I received a Kitchenaid stand mixer for my bridal shower.

The heading's a tad too ephusive but I JUST LOVED THIS BOOK! The Spike is a news- paper term for killing a story. That's the meaning of the title. Written in 1980, it's about Robert Hockney. It begins in 1968, where Hockney, a journalism major at Berkley, participates in the antiwar movement. The war at the beginning and throughout the first half of the book being the Vietnam War. He's sent to Saigon to cover the Vietnam War for the New York World--a newspaper that's out of business in real life. Hockney meets Tessa Torrence, an aspiring actress who's like Jane Fonda. Hockney's father is a retired admiral. Hockney himself is 4F, unfit for service, because of a bad knee. His girlfriend, Julia Cummings, is the sister of Perry Cummings, a KGB mole in the Department of Defense. In the second half, Hockney goes around the world trying to uncover a plot by the Soviet Union to bring down the United States. Viktor Borisov, a a KGB agent in Switzerland, defects to the West with his wife and family. Borisov goes to Washington and testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee and names names. Some of them U.S. Senators--others high officials in the new Connor Administration. A Soviet backed coup North Yemen, spreads to Saudi Arabia and brings down the Saudi monarchy.

He also warns the Soviets that they'll face a nuclear attack."},{"Title":"The Spike","review":"At first, what caught my attention in this book was the writing style. Like a pretty face. What kept my interest for the first half or so was its resonance with my feelings about my past--college in the 60's, etc. But what really got my undivided attention was de Borchgrave's ability to predict the future. The book copyright was in 1980--the year Ronnie got elected and Jimmie got the boot. The author's predictions about the complexion of the White House was accurate, but 12 years early.It's all here: the Soviet threat, the disgrace of the Clinton administration (read Connor admin) and its refusal to see the coming terrorist threat, etc.Makes for a great read, if little sleep."},{"Title":"The Spike","review":"\\"The Spike\\" is the only novel I was ever warned not to read. The warning came from a bookseller, oddly enough. She had to stock it because this was 30 years ago and it was a hot new paperback. But she didn't like it.\\"It's one of those right-wing novels,\\" she told me. \\"Everyone in the media is a bad guy in it.\\" I was properly horrified.Today, I'm pretty conservative and the notion of a media playing into the hands of anti-American forces doesn't strike me as far-fetched. For a spy novel, the concept has particular promise, paranoia being a strong undercurrent of the genre.The 1980 novel presents the thinly disguised idea of anti-American elements at such places as The New York Times working hand-in-hand with Carter Administration doves to render the United States powerless in the face of a renewed Soviet push for global domination. In this fictional construct, Robert Hockney is a left-leaning reporter who discovers his friends and contacts serve invisible forces behind the Iron Curtain, some knowingly, some as what Marx called \\"useful idiots.\\" Hockney figures he's onto the scoop of the century, but as he pushes to get the story he becomes reviled by editors who find his expos&eacute; hits too close to home. They'd rather spike it then publish it, and do.\\"Hockney had learned that it is easiest to commit treason if you do not recognize it as such,\\" authors Arnaud de Borchgrave and Robert Moss write.As a political argument, \\"The Spike\\" intrigues. As a spy novel, it's pathetic. However believable you might find the concept, the clenched prose style and total lack of subtlety is a reminder that there is an art to good airport fiction just like any other kind of writing. Characters are introduced to us in the first sentence as being KGB agents or left-wing moles, and reappear always in a one-note way so as to better advance a political argument disguised as a plot. The female characters are mostly randy Bolshevik nymphos for whom revolution and orgasm are the same. Frequent sex scenes are described with odd clinical detachment. The less frequent fights and chases are likewise synopsized in a way that feels like it has been translated from its original Vulcan, killing any possible tension.Strained metaphors highlight the problem of unnaturalness, like: \\"There was good fishing for [Soviet spymaster] Kromar and his people amid the troubled reflections of the Potomac.\\"People who remember the late 1970s with any detail will have fun picking out who's supposed to be whom from among the various major and minor characters. There are a few entertaining episodes decently told, like Hockney's tour in Vietnam (de Borchgrave made his career as a reporter there) and his later meeting with a legendary CIA operative I'm pretty sure is based on James Jesus Angleton, which would make Hockney a kind of Edward Jay Epstein stand-in.Reading \\"The Spike\\" is definitely a nostalgia bath for me, sometimes amusing when it tries to be and more often despite itself. Even though it resonates as a kind of ur-text for today's conservative gripes against the \\"lame-stream media,\\" its ham-fisted approach to fiction and suspense makes it hard to take seriously."},{"Title":"The Spike","review":"Shall I say this is a book whose time has come... again? Reviewers from ten years ago felt the same way. It is a book about the REAL WORLD of international influence peddling in the arena of media relations, \\"spin control,\\" and image crafting back during the Vietnam War (and the Cold War). I remember reading when the book first came out in 1980 that the characters and incidents were based on real people and events. Because I had a career in the intelligence field, I actually ran across accounts of some of the people and some of the events. This is a suspenseful spy novel which also teaches some important truths about the news media, the history of Soviet influence on American affairs through front groups and agents of influence, Soviet KGB organizations and operations, and particularly Soviet influence in the anti-war movement of the '60s and '70s. In this day and age, the USA again seems to be losing the media wars, this time to the very savvy and ruthless men behind radical Islamic terrorism. Whether they're actually operating out of caves on the Pakistani frontier or not, they KNOW how to manipulate the media and craft images which hurt us and help their cause. Front groups and agents of influence abound, and today's enemies are trying every bit as hard as the Soviets did to bring our free society down from the inside. Read this book as an escapist spy story of great intrigue and suspense, but afterward, take a fresh and more informed look at the news stories being peddled by the media about the critical issues of today. Not only will you enjoy this great story, but you'll also profit from expanding your understanding of how the media wars are still being fought today."},{"Title":"The Spike","review":"Most international thrillers focus on men of action. Man to man, one on one in combat, we win. Our special ops guys and Marines are the class of the world. But what about our idealistic young journalists? Isn't the information war also worth winning?At the time The Spike was written, mainstream Washington journalists didn't have to compete with the internet or cable news. Editors filtered the truth. Of course Soviet agents worked them hard.The hero, as in many stories of this period, is an idealistic journalist. He is also a fundamentally loyal American.Thrown in a sexy movie star with left wing leanings and a President not unlike Carter or Obama to up the stakes, and you get a first class thriller that should appeal to readers of authors from Brad Thor, Tom Clancy and Vince Flynn to Bernard Goldberg, Glenn Beck, and Bill O'Reilly."},{"Title":"The Spike","review":"The Spike was written by two reporters who should have stuck with reporting or at least roped in a ghost writer to help flesh out their characters. We follow the adventures of bland stud reporter Robert Hockney and his meteoric rise in the field of journalism. After just one article published, he gets to go to Paris to dig up some dirt and get laid. After his second article, he's qualified to cover the war in Vietnam, and get laid. Here's a sample of our smooth operator: \\"If you are the revolution, I'd like to join.\\" Believe it or not, that line actually works on the chick with the let's-just-get-this-over-with attitude. In between traveling around the world and nailing anyone he can, Hockney works in time enough for a quickie with his one true love, a blip on the radar called Julia. Pretty much all the female characters are just there for decoration and convenient sex. If you enjoy reading about passionless and uninteresting sex between mannequins, this book is for you!Can I say anything good about this book? Well, I did manage to finish it. And towards the last part of the book, after Hockney experiences a tragedy, he starts to grow up just a teeny tiny bit, so there is that. I know this book was supposed to be about the Cold War and espionage and such, but I was so distracted by the boring sex every few pages, which is why my review is more about that than about the Russians plotting to take over the world."},{"Title":"The Spike","review":"It is a good book, i read the Chinese version in my 20 ten years ago.

She is bound and determined that Kate can't have him.The story is fascinating as it unfolds on the strength of true love and betrayal, trust and distrust, and fragile emotions.Learning that Kate is a strong, healthy young woman and that Race loves her to distraction - I find it had to believe that after 15 years of marriage Kate is only on her fifth child.Given the fact that Race is wealthy, Kate is healthy, even in a growing country, five is a bad average for 15 years given the time in history.My mother had 7 in 12 years, Daddy was from a family of 10 and his father from a family of 10 [approximate time of the story]- Ah, well it is the only discrepancy in the story I could find.Still excellent story!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- M?

Walgreen Foundation lectures)","review":"\\"The People of Plenty\\" is one of the most interesting books I have read in the past two years: informative, instructive, entertaining, challenging, provocative. The book deals with the effects of economic abundance on the American national character as a relationship between history and the behavioral sciences. It is organized in two major parts. Part I outlines the concept of national character from the viewpoints of the historian and behavioral scientist. Part II is about how economic abundance has shaped the American character.To begin with, if Arthur Schlesinger Jr. is correct that \\"History is to a Nation what Memory is to an individual\\", national character is the changing memory of a nation. This is no new assertion, but the author argues that popular generalizations of national character are incorrect. They weave traits and habits in there descriptions, and so they \\"show how badly the true analysis of national character will be hindered if historians, like the blindmen who examined the elephant, mistake the part for the whole\\" (p. 13). The problem is that nations are made up of people, and people's characteristics are cultural, political, economic, historical, and so on. Rather than nation units defining character, national character may be conceived as a national culture expressed as a political unit called a nation.Previous explanations of national character, and here the author sweeps the canvas as only a historian can do, have been flawed. Many paid little attention to what character actually is, or \\"how they would define the \`nation' as the unit to which the character is attributed\\" (p.20). The historian's generalizations of character have ranged all over the place, from such things as that (a) character is God-given (chosen nations); (b) character is driven by environmental factors like technology; and (c ) character is a genetic disposition like race. For the behavioral scientist national character stems from any number of behavioral factors: psychological traits, group propensities brought about by socialization, and so on.From the literature the author gathers that the American character is a measure of success. Success, \\"the American measures as his own worth by the distance which he occupies; he esteems high current income more than the possession of long-accumulated wealth. Mobility and change are natural by-products of his quest for success, and departure from the patterns of the past is a matter of course\\" (p.48). This passage suggests that \\"the American character is a large measure of group responses to an unusually competitive situation\\" (p. 60) - an early indication of the hypothesis that national character is a function of economics - the subject of the second part of the book.Abundance leads to the American character, but abundance is simultaneously a function of human and nonhuman factors, with human factors being more important and less exhaustible. Hence, the national bounty of a nation increases with human productivity. Increased productivity enables social mobility, which in turn ensures equality of opportunities. However, equal opportunities are not equal outcomes, since the former does not eliminate barriers so that social stratification is often inevitable. Nonetheless, the Americans belief in equal opportunities and the social mobility it implies is simply a rejection of status, because status is failure to progress.American tend to believe that abundance is positively related to freedom of choice, and so to democracy. \\"To succeed as a democracy, a country must enjoy an economic surplus to begin with, or it must continue to attain one\\" (p. 116). And so abundance = freedom = American world mission. The book uses the \\"frontier hypothesis\\" to strengthen the idea that abundance is central to the American character. The frontier represents the individual spirit liberated from institutional restrictions to pursue his/her self-interests - the present is better than the past, the future preferred to both the present and the past. However, this representation is both a benefit and a cost. The benefit is obvious; the cost is that too much individualism is less democratic and civil, both being inconsistent with freedom and mobility. Thus the frontier ceases to determine national character when it is no longer a source of abundance.The book claims that advertising is a key institution of abundance; advertising helps in spreading the economic surplus by educating, instilling, training, and hastening the consumer to adopt new tastes and preferences. It helps character formation. Abundance affects the family (a form of social structure), which in turn affects a child's character. Abundance affects society by affecting the basic human needs: food, shelter, clothing, and culture. For example, states the book, \\"the economy of plenty has influenced the feeding of infant, his regime, and the physical setting within which he lives. The material conditions alone might be regarded as having some bearing upon the formation of his character, but the impact of abundance by no means ends at this point\\" (p. 198). Child rearing is another important consideration.As far as I am concerned the book has successfully presented and defended it case: A uniquely American character is made up of traits, experiences, ideals, time, and institutions. These are strung together by a thread called economic abundance. Now whether one agrees or disagrees is a secondary point. As an economist I have trouble with the phrasing \\"economic abundance\\", because the term \\"economic\\" means \\"scarce\\", so that \\"economic abundance = scarce abundance - which is an oxymoron. Yet the book goes beyond economic determinism in a refreshing manner even today, fifty-three years later. I strongly recommend this book to anyone, especially to those in positions that require or authorize them to speak on behalf of America and Americans.Amavilah, AuthorModeling Determinants of Income in Embedded EconomiesISBN: 1600210465"},{"Title":"People of plenty: Economic abundance and the American character (Charles R.

The Gospel according to John and the Epistles provide the authoritative teaching for Christians today. I found the discussion on free will versus predestination especially helpful.

With the family plantation heavily mortgaged, she's married off to much older David Lattimer, since he's willing to pay off the mortgage in exchange for a bride who will give him the entrance to society he craves. Not exactly a marriage made in heaven, but David is kind and Taylor makes do, until David's son Brent arrives for a visit and it's insta-love. Even with a husband complicating the path to true love, Taylor's Southern bred to the core and Brent's a Yankee and with war between the States looming things look pretty bleak...That's the gist of it and I won't spoil, but you will guess every plot development coming a mile away, with plenty of foreshadowing to let you know it's a-coming. This is very much a wall-paper type of romance, light on the history and historical details. While there's nothing wrong with that (to each their own taste in books), I suspect potential readers looking at that cover and expecting a sexed up romance will be sorely disappointed. The big love scene lasted all of a few sentences and then fades to black, otherwise you'll just get a few steamy kisses here and there, and a very odd ending leaving you hanging. Meh.

It is an anti-war story, and the devastation of war, the profiles of the all too human generals and of Lincoln are an important footnote of history. The poetry is musical and sometimes stark.

Set in southern Sweden in the late fifties, the age of early space flights (with dogs and monkeys) and Elvis (as well as \\"that drip Pat Boone\\"), Jonsson's story shows a firm sense of place and time. His protagonist, 13-14 year-old Ingemar Johansson, is caught up in the usual maelstrom of raging hormones that is adolescence. His name, the same as that of the then-famous Swedish heavyweight boxer who knocked out Floyd Patterson and reigned ever so briefly as world champion, doesn't make things any easier either. There are plenty of highly comical scenes here that have to do with sexual awakening and early experimentation with girls. But as Ingemar's story progresses, a much darker aspect emerges. The poor kid begins to realize that his mother, invalided by tuberculosis, never really loved him. And his merchant seaman father is hardly ever at home, but somewhere off in the south seas, loading bananas. Boarded out to relatives or the children's home, often separated from his older brother and younger sister, the boy endures a kind of second-hand, unwanted life the best he can, often fantasizing that he is a dog (hence the title), which gets him into even more trouble. The book plunges from the heights of hilarity to the depths of sadness before it's through. Translated ably from the Swedish by Eivor Martinus, it is a compelling read. Swedish director Lasse Hallstrom's film adaptation (available with English subtitles) has also become a coming-of-age classic.I understand that MY LIFE AS A DOG is part of a trilogy. The sequel, also available in English, is calledMy Father, His Son. I may have to snag a copy. I wanna know what happened next. I've had this one on my shelf for a few years now.

This book is also meant to serve as an explication for the events which took place during the Second Vatican Council regarding the position of the church on the Jews and Judaism. According to de Poncins certain powerful Jewish forces (backed by organizations such as the freemasonic B'nai B'rith) were able to infiltrate the thinking of Vatican prelates and Roman Catholic bishops to force a church decision on the \\"Jewish question\\" and to re-configure traditional Christian teaching. It is well known that the Gospel accounts of the Passion of Christ (in particular the Gospel of Matthew) do not show favorably for the principal Jewish leaders at the time. Indeed, the Roman official Pontius Pilate was said to have not wanted to murder Christ and later to have washed his hands, symbolically cleansing himself of the murder, while the crowd demanded that Christ be crucified. Upon crucifying Christ, the crowd cried out \\"His blood be on us and all our children\\" (which some interpreted to mean a curse upon the Jewish nation - regarded by certain fanatics as \\"the deicide people\\"). In addition, certain church fathers including especially Saint John Chrysostom, Saint Augustine, and Saint Pope Gregory the Great were known to teach the doctrine that the Jews served as a \\"witness people\\" given their failure to convert and recognize the Messiah. Many Jewish scholars including Jules Isaac (whose writings de Poncins examines) have questioned the historical validity of the Gospel accounts, arguing for the exoneration of the Jewish leaders at the time of Christ (as well as the condemnation of the Romans). Jules Isaac in particular, challenges nearly 2000 years of Christian teaching by calling into question many of the familiar Christian formulas and blaming Christians for anti-Semitism among Europeans. Indeed, individuals such as Jules Isaac may have helped to sway the minds of the Catholic bishops (such as Cardinal Bea who led a progressive faction in pushing for the church statement on the Jews and Judaism). Conservative forces within the church as well as those among the Arab states (including many Arab Christians) argued against this measure and were able to get the official statement amended so as not to mention the \\"deicide\\" charge specifically. De Poncins attempts to demonstrate how the church's position has changed with regard to the Jews as well as how anti-Semitism has arisen among the European nations. Indeed, it was during the modern era when both the dictators Hitler and Stalin sought radical solutions to \\"the Jewish Question\\" involving mass murder. However, according to de Poncins, this must be considered within its historical context and within the context of Jewish-Gentile relations. In modern times, an entirely new issue has arisen, that of the involvement of the Roman Catholic Church and in particular the pope, Pius XII, with the Nazi and Fascist regimes. Certain Jewish writers especially have called into question the activities of Pius XII during this time. However, by bringing up dead issues and besieging the American people with an endless series of books detailing Christian involvement in the Holocaust, the Jews have been able to further their own control within government. Indeed, many Catholic writers and de Poncins himself have written exonerating the Roman Pontiff of all wrongdoing. Thus, Jewish and Roman Catholic relations remain strained. Despite the attempted patch-up job done at the Second Vatican Council, it can be argued that Judaism and Christianity remain fundamentally irreconcilable in a way that Christianity and other religions (e.g. Islam) do not."},{"Title":"Family Computer Fun","review":"Bond shows how your PC can be an invaluable and fun part of your life, if you want to capture and manipulate pictures, video and audio.

An orphan, the result of a particularly bad cholera epidemic which wipes out his whole family, Daniel apprentices himself to the boatman, John the Brawn, as a helper in lieu of living in an orphanage. But when the boat containing the actress Magdelena Colon, her maid, and niece, Maud Fallon, is upset by a large block of ice, fate intervenes, causing Quinn's fortunes and fate to be interwoven with Magdelena, Maud, and John the Brawn.This was a wondeful novel, full of rich language, and subtle humor, which portrays the life of the Irish in the mid-nineteenth century with startling realism. Daniel's family seems to have arrived in America well before the parade of famine Irish, so starkly portrayed by Kennedy in all their squalor. While not attempting to stereotype the Irish immigrants, we see them as the white, upper-class citizens of New York did, a scourge and pestilence bringing filth and disease with them. At one point in the novel they are herded on railroad cars and transported away from Albany as undesirables, dumped on some less fortunate area of the state.Though the fate of the Irish immigrant is not the main theme in the novel, Quinn's background of being a penniless Irish orphan doesn't increase his chances of gaining the hand of Maud, though she declares her love for him upon their first meeting when she is but thirteen to his fifteen. Fate throws them together over the years, but it is not until he is a grown man that he finally seems worthy of the precocious Maud.Besides the obvious love story the historical perspective works well. We are treated to a look at the anti-Catholic Know Nothing Pary, the forerunners of the modern Republican Pary, Abolitionists, the Underground Railroad, and the New York City Draft Riots. A very enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"Recently, in reviewing an early William Kennedy Albany-cycle novel, \\"Ironweed\\" I mentioned that he was my kind of writer. I will let what I stated there stand on that score here. Here is what I said:\\"William Kennedy is, at least in his Albany stories, my kind of writer. He writes about the trials and tribulations of the Irish diaspora as it penetrated the rough and tumble of American urban WASP-run society, for good or evil. I know these people, my people, their follies and foibles like the back of my hand. Check. Kennedy writes, as here with the main characters Fran Phelan and Helen Archer two down at the heels sorts, about that pervasive hold that Catholicism has even on its most debased sons and daughters, saint and sinner alike. I know those characteristics all too well. Check. He writes about that place in class society where the working class meets the lumpen-proletariat-the thieves, grifters, drifters and con men- the human dust. I know that place well, much better than I would ever let on. Check. He writes about the sorrows and dangers of the effects alcohol on working class families. I know that place too. Check. And so on. Oh, by the way, did I mention that he also, at some point, was an editor of some sort associated with the late Hunter S. Thompson down in Puerto Rico. I know that mad man's work well. He remains something of a muse for me. Check.\\"That said, this little novel takes place in an earlier time in the Albany novel cycle, the earliest period thus far in my reading of the cycle. This is a story of the hard period in America for those \\"famine ship Irish\\" that were driven to seek a new life in the new world against their collective wills. But, certainly they were driven out of Ireland by economic necessity and desperation. For the most part the snippets of character detailed here, including the earliest generations of names that are familiar from later generations in Kennedy's book , do not suggest that they were driven out due to some criminal activity, political or not, against old \\"Mother \\"England\\".That snippet of character reference above also can be used as a point that makes this novel a little different from the others in this cycle. The narrator, Daniel Quinn, a teenage boy-man orphan (nice touch, as narrator in a fresh, young country) with plenty of spunk and ambition, as is usually the case gets plenty of character build-up throughout. However this novel is driven more by the plot than by character development than prior Kennedy reads. That plot, such as it is, centers on Quinn's \\"golden quest\\" to win the hand of the \\"teen angel\\", Maud, come hell or high water. Along the way, we are taken on a Kennedy version of \\"magical realism\\", 19th century Albany Irish style: of the \\"famine ship\\" Irish; of the old Dutch squirarchy that ruled the Hudson Valley in those days; of the American racial and political scene in the pre-Civil War period, and much else. That \\"much else\\" sometimes gets in the way of the \\"golden quest\\", but as almost always with Kennedy he gives us a good read, if not a great one."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I should have been writing my senior thesis during the last 24 hours, but instead I was whipping through this novel. I really like mystical realism, and the idea of the author following the large cast of characters through the twists and turns of their eventful and intersecting lives. It reminded me of novels by Isabelle Allende which I really have enjoyed."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I have read all of William Kennedy's books. I admit to being from Albany, the subject of his books. Kennedy unravels the tales of one of the nation's great \\"open\\" towns in the U.S.They are history on a more personal level. It will not ast long on the night table."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I admit to being biased (my family moved to Albany around the time this story is set and has stayed since) but still insist this is a great period story that is at times hilarious, at times heart-wrenching, and never dull.Although period literature is definitely in no short supply, Kennedy writes this book with a distinctly mystical flair that adds a stern dose of magic to a time most authors relegate to stuffiness and pomp. In addition, his characters here are immediately endearing, espescially Maud, Magdalena, and Daniel Quinn himself.I'm less coherent than normal having spent the night awake reading this great story in lieu of sleep, but for anyone interested in, well, good storytelling set with a historically accurate backdrop of Albany and canal-town New York as a whole,Quinn's Book recommends itself."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"I came late to William Kennedy's work and may have to take other reviewers at their word that this is not his best. But it's certainly pretty good, and I'll find out if the rest is better. He captures a kind of crazed picaresque worldview which is something like E.L. Doctorow on drugs. His disasters are gigantic, larger than life, and so are most of the characters. It's hard to tell if it's magical realism or just totally unlikely, but it's funny as hell and a tremendously fun and quick reading experience--in spite of the mass violence and misfortune and desperate poverty it describes."},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"An excellent book, just excellent. My cousin read me the first sentence and I was hooked. This novel made me think of Doctorow's Billy Bathgate and Helprin's Winter's Tale, and it's just as good as those masterpieces. Now, has anyone else wondered about the mysterious but obvious relationship between this book, Winter's Tale, and Paul Auster's New York Trilogy (e.g., there is a character named Daniel Quinn in New York Trilogy)? And what other references am I missing? What is going on here?"},{"Title":"Quinn's Book","review":"If someone set out to write a parody of Kennedy's works, it would read a lot like Quinn's Book. Hard to put down, yes; telling details, of course; but undermined by preposterous characters and an offensive kind of magical realism. Billy Phelan's Greatest Game and Legs were much better."},{"Title":"Yuletide Hearth","review":"Yuletide Hearth: Christmas In An 1806 Pennsylvania Farmhouse by writer and photographer Katharine Z.

Quick read, logically structured."},{"Title":"Financial Reporting of Environmental Liabilities and Risks after Sarbanes-Oxley","review":"Before I read Greg Rogers book, I thought accountants were mere number crunchers and that the lion's share of the crunching would eventually be performed by a sophisticated software package-- or at least people in India. The happy truth (for accountants, anyway,) is that accounting is an inherently SUBJECTIVE (and, therefore, not highly-outsourcable discipline.) A less happy (and somewhat scary) truth is that I actually found Rogers' treatment of accounting fascinating. Yes, it may be that I need to get a life, but this book is a must-read for anyone who wants to excel in the environmental industry.As a testament to the readability of the book, I will share a short anecdote. In preparation for a presentation that I was to give at a large accounting firm in New Jersey on behalf of my environmental consulting company(Hydrotechnology Consultants, Inc.), I asked my assistant to order Rogers' book on Amazon. She unwittingly requested shipping via media mail (a.k.a. snail mail.) As the date for the seminar approached, she assured me that the book was scheduled to arrive \\"any day.\\" It was two days before the seminar and the book had apparently taken a detour to media mail hell. I told her that she needed to secure the book for me by the next day or invest in a warm hat and a pair of gloves-- because it tends to get rather cold in the unemployment line. In desperation, she called Greg Rogers and begged him to ship the book overnight. Greg took pity on her plight and shipped the book for morning delivery-- leaving me exactly one day to read the book, digest its contents and regurgitate it to an audience of accountants. To make a long story short, the presentation went off without a hitch. The accountants were highly impressed with my knowledge of environmental accounting, but seemed somewhat uncomfortable with my level of enthusiasm. Therefore, I offer this advice to Greg Rogers: place a label on the book cover which reads, \\"Caution: Contents May Shock and Awe!\\""},{"Title":"Novell's Guide to Integrating Netware 5 and Nt","review":"Of all the books on computers, networking, technology, and testing that I have ordered and read, this book is the most easily understood and complete instruction yet. 7 Years of networking has taken me through many books to learn the craft and I always find myself searchng for more resources. The book &quot;Novell 5 and NT&quot; will get you 99% there and give you sources for the things it doesn't. This book is a high-paying career all by itself. Learn Novell and NT integration and you will be highly sought after. How do I know? It's my job! How did I learn? This book!"},{"Title":"Novell's Guide to Integrating Netware 5 and Nt","review":"Although published in 1999, this book is more than a little outdated. About 1/3 of the book centers on the utility, &quot;Novell Administrator for Windows NT&quot;. The book touts the utility as a free snap-in to NWAdmin, allowing a network administrator to administer NT Workstations and Servers through NDS. Herein lies the major problem with the book: the &quot;Novell Administrator for Windows NT&quot; is no longer available. It seems that after speaking with a Novell salesperson that the replacement is &quot;NDS Corporate Edition&quot;, which is certainly NOT free. I have not figured out whether the book's content concerning Novell Administrator for Windows NT applies to NDS Corporate Edition, and I am not willing to pay thousands of dollars for the NDS Corporate Edition product to test it out."},{"Title":"Novell's Guide to Integrating Netware 5 and Nt","review":"Nowhere in this book does it claim to be a study guide for the Integrating NetWare and NT exam, however I'm sure many people will buy this book for just that purpose (myself included). The best book to study for the Integrating NT exam of course is to read the white book, however if you cannot get your hands on one, you do not have many choices. Pretty much the only viable alternative you have at that point is this book and the Sybex book - which is very outdated but still covers NT itself very well, which is essential for the exam and for getting the most out of this book. If you are going to use the Sybex book together with this book to prepare for the Integrating NT exam, make sure to take all of the other Novell tests that you need first, in order to get as good of a feel as possible for what Novell tests for on their exams. Then read the Sybex book (read everything about NT in there, and skip the chapters on integrating it with IntraNetware), followed by this book. In this book you can safely skip the first three chapters. Chapter 3, the one on NT networking, is the one where the authors do their worst Microsoft bashing, and as another reviewer here said, that chapter is practically unreadable. However, do make sure to read Chapter 5, in which the Novell Client is discussed, Chapter 6, in which synchronizing the directories is discribed, Chapter 7, which discusses NDS for NT, and Chapter 10, in which ZEN Works is discussed, very carefully. As you read those chapters, make yourself a list of EVERY last NLM, exe, command, vxd, etc. that you come across, along with a note of what that file or utility does and where it fits in. Also write down every procedure, where they are done, how you get to them, and what they do, and then memorize them. I have to emphasize that you do this for EVERY utility, file and procedure, no matter how obscure and insignificant they may seem from the text. If you do that, then IMO you will have a very good chance of passing the test with confidence."},{"Title":"Novell's Guide to Integrating Netware 5 and Nt","review":"After reading a negative review on this book I still purchased it.

It isn't!!!How can one integrate NetWare 5 and NT? This book tries to address this question and does a decent job. First, in chapter 1 the question &quot;why integrate&quot; is addressed. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a little background on NetWare and NT. Finally, in Chapter 4, we can begin discussing integration of the two. From this point on, I found the book informative explaining various ways to integrate, why integrate, what are the down sides to each option, etc. For someone wanting to know the concepts for integrating, it's fine. If you are actually trying to implement an integration method, I'm not sure if this book will be enough.I must agree with some other reviews I've read here... the book is a little dated and, being from Novell Press, a bit Novell biased.

Chapter 4 is the best part of the book - it lays out what your options really are (or were 2 years ago). The rest of the book goes into detail on each of the options outlined in chapter 4, then throws in some extra stuff on ZEN and scripting. Overall it was very helpful, but unfortunately dated. There have been many significant developments in this area since this book was written that, of course, aren't in the book (ie Win2K, eDirectory, single sign-on, etc.) Its also definitely slanted towards the Novell way to approach this issue with the MS options mostly omitted or only briefly mentioned.

Want mine?"},{"Title":"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt and Music","review":"On at least three occasions during my reading of this novel, I found myself in tears. Not from sadness, but from joy at the beauty of Kurlansky's writing. I can't really explain this reaction, except to say that it is a perfect depiction of Manhattan's lower east side, and its inhabitants, at the end of its role as the melting pot of immigrant culture, and the beginning of what it is today- the melting pot of American yuppy transplant culture.The time frame of this novel is the late Reagan period, when drug sales were an engine of economic development for many striving Caribbean immigrants, and something affecting the previous generation of Jewish immigrants' scions. But this is merely one aspect of this multi-faceted mini-saga. Ultimately, this is, in the Seinfeldian sense, a novel about \\"nothing\\". But it's a vastly entertaining and engrossing \\"nothing\\".Not being conversant with Kurlansky's other works, I was slightly shocked at his post-conclusion chapter of recipes for dishes mentioned in the plot. I would normally avoid food-themed novels like the plague. However this one could work with or without the recipes or the loving (and lustful) depictions of pastry-making in the \\"plot\\". Foodies can consider this aspect as a lagniappe- non-foodies can stop there, and not miss a thing."},{"Title":"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt and Music","review":"I read this book and was pleased to find a fantastic jumble of characters, philosophies, and pathos. Each character, even the \\"bad\\" ones, is treated humanely by the author. The last moment of the simpatico culture of this New York neighborhood in the late 1980's is captured joyfully."},{"Title":"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt and Music","review":"Mark Kurlansky, author of best-selling non-fiction niche histories about Cod, Oysters, and Salt, tackled this fiction work, that integrates his Lower East Side upbringing and love of pastry, early on in his career. My version was an audio rendition, narrated by a Broadway actor whose name I can't recall, who really provided color and atmosphere to the reading.The story revolves around a middle-aged Jewish man and his family, who have lived in the neighborhood for several generations. It's hard to say exactly what the plot is; as I reflect on it, it seems mostly to deal with the man's guilt-ridden affair with a German baker's daughter. Also prevalent, plot-wise, are: a dilemma about selling the family business as the neighborhood grows and becomes more expensive; the travails of a Dominican (or is it Puerto Rican?) trying to get out of the drug business; a murderer stalking the local ATM machines; an uncle's search for the German baker's nazi past; and more.I was impressed with Kurlansky's intimate knowledge about the neighborhood's ethnic cultures and characters, many of whom must have been far removed from his own American/European background. I lived in the neighborhood during the same period, and he brought forth here vivid details about people who I saw but interacted with only superficially. This seems to me to be the triumph of this book: its wonderland mix of ethnicity, whose unique apsects Kurlansky makes vivid. Stamaty's chaotic cover really nails this aspect of book, and the virtuoso narrator's uncanny & subtle characterizations in the audio version make it a listerner's delight.Unfortunately, this may be the book's downfall too, as there are so many characters that I became confused... and with all the plot lines, the book loses any natural trajectory it might have had if Kurlansky had focused on fewer characters and plots. I might not have finished the book had I not gotten the audio version. Still, I enjoyed it, thought it illuminating and interesting, and certainly an accurate and heartfelt portrayal of a neighborhood that has, sadly, greatly changed since the 1980s."},{"Title":"Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue: A Novel of Pastry, Guilt and Music","review":"From Publishers WeeklyThe bestselling author of 1968, Salt and Cod makes an uneven transition to fiction in his first novel, an erratic snapshot of the East Village's ethnic melting pot set during the late 1980s. The story opens with a bang when a Jewish restaurant owner is murdered in the first chapter, a tragedy that sends protagonist Nathan Seltzer into spasms of anxiety as he wonders if he should cash in, sell his lucrative property (the Meshugaloo Copy Shop) and leave his drug-riddled neighborhood. But Kurlansky ditches that promising subplot to track Nathan's erotic, pastry-obsessed affair with the daughter of a German baker. Nathan's brother Harry also enters the picture as he engineers his own affair with a hefty, African-American prostitute and junkie named Florence. Unfortunately, there isn't much rhyme or reason to the rest of the novel, which consists mostly of scattershot introductions of wacky secondary characters, including a Latin drug dealer who becomes a successful restaurant owner, a therapist who tries to help Nathan conquer his claustrophobia while passionately rooting for the Mets, and a singer named Chow Mein Vega who incorporates Yiddish influences into his lone dance hit. Occasionally the scenes are funky and entertaining, but the lack of a story line eventually wins out over Kurlansky's obvious love of the neighborhood.Copyright Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(Thomas Y. Crowell, 1957)Ah, the wonders of bucolic Denver in the fifties. Weber has finally ditched the last traces of overt McCarthyism, hopefully for good (remember, we're only halfway through the series at this point). Beany has finally ditched the last traces of her Norbettism and can finally view him as simply a friend. But with Andy gone off to the Marines, that leaves Beany without a beau. Well, a new one pops up almost as soon as the book begins, with that weird disjunct common to the Beany books, in Hank, who is, in contemporary terms, an investigative journalist. Hank's helping Beany's dad Martie on an expose of uranium land scams. (The series dug into this, if you'll recall, back in the previous book, Make a Wish for Me.) Meanwhile, Beany's seventeenth birthday is approaching, and while she and Mary Fred are cleaning out the old window seat looking for something for Johnny, Beany comes across an old, unopened letter from Miggs Carmody, her closest childhood friend, sent right around the time Mrs. Malone died. Last anyone in the family heard, the Carmody family were transient, so Beany sets herself to the task of hunting Miggs down so the two of them can celebrate their birthdays together like they did when they were kids. But Beany learns the meaning of \\"be careful what you wish for\\"...The book does have some scenes that are shocking today that may well have been par for the course back in 1957 (in at least one scene, Hank's behavior crosses well over into the \\"domestic violence\\" arena, and Weber gets a mention of the lingering bruises in at least once per chapter for the rest of the book). Be aware. Otherwise, though, it's your typical Beany Malone novel, which means it is at once not a real standout and miles better than Beany Has a Secret Life. A decent entry in the series. ***"},{"Title":"Napoleon's German Allies (2) : Nassau and Oldenburg (Men at Arms Series, 43)","review":"This volume focuses on the military uniforms of Napoleon's Bavarian allies from roughly 1792 through 1815.

Each chapter begins with a quote from a Sherlock Holmes mystery to set the tone of the material to follow. Chapter one provides a short introduction to the genre pointing out the popularity of mysteries. Chapter two defines mystery, explaining the thirteen types and offering suggested reading for each type. In chapter three, entitled Appreciating Mysteries, Larson affirms that mysteries are generally very moral and \\"moral lessons found in mysteries are obvious and understandable\\" (p. 16). Chapter four looks at mystery series including major series and Christian series. Suggested reading, activities, and web resources are also provided.Using mysteries in curriculum and programming is covered in the final two chapters. \\"Mysteries have a great deal of potential for encouraging reluctant readers to read and challenging gifted students to expand their learning\\" (p. 37). Subject areas such as science, social studies, and history have suggested books to share and activities. Outlines are included for mystery programs for different age groups with suggested books to share, activities, crafts (patterns provided), games, and food.Appendixes including online resources an annotated list of film/video resources, professional resources, and an extensive bibliography follow the final chapter. A subject index completes the book which makes it easily searchable.Larson's book is a valuable resource for librarians and teachers providing an abundance of ideas for sharing mysteries with children and young adults and programs which motivate and encourage children to read and enjoy mysteries."},{"Title":"Bringing Mysteries Alive for Children and Young Adults","review":"Bringing Mysteries Alive for Children and Young AdultsBy Jeanette Larson\\"Mysteries are the most popular choice for free selection reading and offer teachers and librarians opportunities to attract reluctant readers, encourage the habit of reading, and challenge outstanding students to stretch their brains.\\"Bringing Mysteries Alive for Children and Young Adults by Jeanette Larson is an introduction to various types of mysteries as well as a guide to using the genre effectively in the library or classroom. Larson's mission is to \\"hook kids on reading and promote learning with this handy reference to the mystery genre.\\" The content is ideal for school librarians and all subject area classroom teachers. Chapters include: an introduction to mystery, defining mystery, appreciating mystery, series mysteries, suggestions for curriculum integration and programming with mysteries.The first several chapters introduce us to the mystery genre and define the many different types of mysteries. Detective stories, suspense thrillers, crime stories, ghost and gothic stories as well as many more are introduced and explored. Larson also provides a list of suggested books for each subgenre.Chapter three examines the appeal of mysteries as well as the barriers to appreciating this genre. \\"Children enjoy mysteries because they are curious about the world around them.\\" Some children, parents and teachers however are concerned that mysteries can lead to violence and crime. Larson addresses these concerns as well as several other barriers.Chapters four through six provide curriculum connections along with many creative programming ideas. Larson provides numerous suggestions and examples for discussion, writing, research, storytelling, games and craft activities. These activities cover a large range of student abilities and ages.The book concludes with a detailed appendix that includes an extensive annotated bibliography, an awards list, an online directory and a list of additional resources. This section is an excellent source for programming ideas as well as a collection development resource.Larson, a self proclaimed mystery fan, has provided a wonderful resource for the novice as well as the seasoned professional. Kids love mysteries, and teachers and librarians will love using this outstanding resource to promote literacy, learning and an excitement about the genre of mystery. For educators interested in exploring this genre with students, this book is an absolute must!REFERENCESLarson, Jeanette. Bringing Mysteries Alive for Children and Young Adults.

One or two essays are mediocre at best, one or two are great, and the rest fall somewhere in between. I find Haraway unreadable, the ultimate in academic hype (write enough gibberish and people will think you're a genius), and the interview with her isn't much better, but fortunately she isn't the whole book. Hartouni's thoughts on reproductive discourse are worth reading, and Penley's piece is great -- it revealed a really nifty subculture I'd never realized existed in addition to clarifying just what it was about Mr. Spock that made him so desirable to men and women alike. Overall,I thought this was a fun book to read, although I don't think it'll ever achieve classic status."},{"Title":"Technoculture (Studies in Classical Philology)","review":"Collected under the theme of technoculture Constance Penley and Andrew Ross have collected various case studies circulating around the promises and threats, facts and fictions of contemporary technological culture.

I was wrong! This is a very informative book written in a lighthearted way. I have two cockatiels and I found out things about my birds I never knew. I couldn't understand why they didn't like to take baths, for example, and learned that they are from a more desert type area of Austrailia so it's not in them to like to bathe the way it is with parakeets.

I expected it to include a lot more of things I didn't know instead of simply telling what I do know in a fun way.For the more casual cockatiel companion, I think this is a nice book and certainly a great gag gift for someone you know who has cockatiels. But for someone who invests heavily into her birds, it is maybe a little too elementary. Most people who invest in their cockatiels like dog people do for their dogs will probably know almost all of it like I did.This is a book more for entertainment than education.

His mother wants him to get a good job with a large company; he wants to be a writer and goes through a series bad, low-pay jobs instead. He is engaged to two women (one of whom he's lied to in order to get to bed with her). His circle of friends is populated with odd characters such as Jose who is infatuated with his cousin Rita, a nun at the local convent, and plans on marrying her. The narrator's openness about discussing sex is shocking for the time.But, today, they have lost their shock value. We are so inundated with sexual weirdness and innuendos in the media that the narrator's exploits don't effect us in the same way. He's just a man who enjoys sex. That does not detract from the readability of the book. In fact, the novel which the narrator is writing -- concerning a man who loses his floggis and becomes invisible -- is one of the best things about this book and makes it worth reading. It is a good glimpse into sexuality and society of that time period."},{"Title":"Powdered Eggs","review":"Way back at the beginning of time, when I was \\"coming of age,\\" there was at least one obligatory book on that subject that had to be read, with a \\"forbidden word\\" on page 186, of my paperback copy (it's amazing what sticks in the neurons). The book wasThe Catcher in the RyeIt still seems to alive and kickin', with over 3,000 reviews at Amazon. Yet at the same time there was this book, with the same coming of age theme, which seemed to be so much superior, and much funnier. I read both books in the early \`60's, and I decided to re-read this one. It was a delight the second time around, and I was truly amazed how many of the passages I had retained. With apologies to Bob Dylan's \\"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,\\" it did truly seem to be: \\"...with your sheet-metal memory of Powdered Eggs.\\"The book was published it in 1964, and I sprung for the $3.95 hard copy. The author explains the title straight off: the hen is impregnated, lays an egg, but then someone comes along, sucks all the juice out, puts the contents in an envelope, and sends it off. Not the original purpose of the process at all; a metaphor for life. Religion and sex, the taboos of polite dinner party conversations, are dominant themes throughout. Politics and the coming war are nowhere to be seen. And there is the painful introduction to the work world. Though he can be scathing about religion on an \\"equal opportunity\\" basis, much is reserved for the particular bte noir of his upbringing, the Catholic Church. It resonated, for sure.Simmons packs a lot into 220 pages: an unfavorable dissection of the medical establishment over the death of his father; Mary, the bright-eyed Irish Catholic girl who wants to keep her membrane in tack; Prudence, who wasn't and although pregnant by another, might be a suitable spouse. Of fond remembrance was the novel within the novel. It involves Austin, who loses his floggis, the organ that gives everyone their opacity, and therefore becomes invisible, and fears capture by the opaque scientists. Simmons has a lot of good fun with that theme. And there is a truly marvelous section on our hero, the would-be writer, working for an encyclopedia publisher - of a most dubious character, since it steals its entries from other encyclopedias. He does \\"test runs\\" on how it would be sold, with laugh out loud scenes. Later, there are additional scenes involving the corruption in the publishing industry, with $500 paid for favorable reviews. Hum! And towards the end, he visits Italy (in pursuit of Prudence) and so there are the inevitable European-American observations.Bon mots? More than a few: \\"Tremendous vacuous mush, the kind of much Billy Graham stirs the gallstones of old ladies with.\\" \\"Sometimes I think the worst thing that could happen to Jews would be for everybody to become a Jew.\\" \\"What would Francis be without that collar, without the skirts of the Church, the ready blessings, the power to loose and to bind, the mumbled Latin and the talismanic breviary? Either a f*g, practicing or frustrated, or an impotent married man.\\" \\"What's with Italian cooking in America? That's not Italian food; it's a base for condiments.\\" \\"They decided to remove the offending foldout, and they said that I too was a genius. Should I be proud or ashamed?\\" Now, how often have I used that last sentence?Poignancy. Another brilliant scene has him washing his Austin-Healy sports car, expanding much energy, \\"high caloric potentials,\\" and three old ladies pass, one in a wheelchair, pushed by two others: \\"Yesterday they opted for life, bought a few minutes of the earth with a nickel of their fund, and I had said Enjoy the day, ladies. We understood each other, the old ladies and I...From these old ladies childhood admonitions about and against sex had dropped away. It no longer seemed to them a problem to be female, you choose a man, he chooses you, he has his way with you, but you with him, he works, you bear, you both donate your bodies to the future and you die. Why do the young females make such a thing of it, old ladies think now?\\"Looking for a doctoral thesis? Why wasn't this book the \\"coming-of-age\\" book of the early \`60's, instead ofThe Catcher in the Rye? Simmons went on to be the editor of the NY Times Book Review for a number of years, but waited a long time, almost to the millennium to try his hand at the same theme, inSalt Water, which will be an obligatory read.A great book, whose potential to entertain and instruct a generation was lost. 5-stars plus."},{"Title":"Powdered Eggs","review":"An old boyfriend suggested I read this years ago and I had given it back to him but recently found it on line...it is a hootMarguerite"},{"Title":"Trinity :Isaac Asimovs Science Fiction M","review":"A Science Fiction StoryClone twin teleological trance test.4.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Annuals (The Time-Life encyclopedia of gardening)","review":"This series is famous.

The need to address the cost of maintaining a collection against its usefulness to the institution and society in general has been much in my thoughts and this book helped me to see that I am not the only one thinking about it. Ms. Keene covers all of the bases: What good is this stuff? Who does it belong to? How well should it be cared for? Who cares about it and why? Who should pay for its care? Who gets to use it? Should we add to it, keep it in stasis, or dispose of it?Backed by real-world examples from collections in multiple disciplines and locations, Ms. Keene attempts to defend the need for collections as providing cultural keys and mirrors. She reflects upon the usefulness of objects in education and research, but more than that the ways in which objects can provide a creative spark, something I would like to see more museums advertise and own. She also touches upon the responsibility of institutions to care for their collections as well as to make them accessible and relevant in order that others will see them as important and worth funding. She takes a viewpoint that might be seen as heretical by museums when she separates collections from their institutions in asserting that \\"collections are all too easily confused with museums, but they are far more durable and valuable than the museum that happens to house them, perhaps temporarily\\". But it wouldn't be a good read if there wasn't a bit of controversy!I recommend this book to anyone who manages or curates a collection, but even more to anyone who exhibits, educates or administers a museum either as staff or trustee. Those who work with the collection are usually already aware of its value and usefulness, but those who manage the institution may be far removed from the potential it holds and this book might inspire them to visit the shelves and cabinets that hold the treasures of their institution and lead them to seek ways to bring it safely into the light."},{"Title":"Designing Usable Electronic Text, Second Edition","review":"I'm researching systems-development related topics at the moment and this book is one of the few I've encountered that gives an abundant amount of carefully considered information. Most books, it seems, can be summarized in a sentence or two. Dillon's work, on the other hand, is one of the most detailed--and purposeful--I've seen. I'd recommend this book not only to text designers but anyone interested in user-centered design. Its implications for users (who are often scanners, not readers!) are broad and significant, encompassing motivations (why people read, or why they visit websites and what they expect to get out of their experience) and navigation and wayfinding issues. Another useful component of the book is its discussion of using models and frameworks as a tool to faciliate structured research and development. Many thanks to Dillon for providing a first rate book on a pervasive, yet largely ignored topic. I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future."},{"Title":"Designing Usable Electronic Text, Second Edition","review":"This is by far the best analysis of reading of electronic text that I have seen. He provides an excellent insight as to what is, what might be, and what is not important for on-screen reading.He does not limit text to just fiction/non-fiction categories, but instead discusses: WHY it is read professional/personal reasons, to learn or not, out of interest/need, etc. WHAT type of information it contains technical or non-technical, subject matter, general or specific, textual or graphic, etc. HOW it is read serially or non-serially, once or repeatedly, browsed or studied in depth, etc.His book suggests to me that text should alter its format to the meet the users - Why, What, and How. Possible examples: switch to all caps when searching for words or phrases, turn off hyperlink indicators for linear reading, ...He points out that there have been many studies on editing text, but few on reading text. A good fraction of the book deals with on-screen reading.Screen reading was better with: high resolution characters, increased space between lines (leading), proportional font, limiting the number of characters on a line, and not splitting a sentence across a page boundary.He indicates that users preferred on-screen reading over paper reading for some tasks when the screens had enough improvements.Screen reading might be improved with: landmarks/navigation, serif fonts, full left/right justification, ...Screen reading was no different than paper reading for: orientation of the media, flicker rate, screen dynamics, and visual angles (&lt; 36 degrees)."},{"Title":"English Reformation: The Effect on a Nation (Studymates)","review":"English Reformation: The Effect on a Nation, is a fascinating overview of the Reformation occurring in England beginning under the reign of Henry VIII. This series of events which helped to shape the modern English speaking world, began with the monarch petitioning the Vatican to dissolve his marriage to Katherine of Aragon, his brother Edwards widow, whom he took as his wife following his brothers untimely death. Because he had to have special dispensation from the pope to marry Katherine in the first place, when no male heir was forthcoming from this union, he sought to divorce her and have the marriage annulled due to the fact that it was \\"an abomination to have married her\\" in the first place, because of biblical prohibitions against marrying someone with a closer affinity to the king than a fourth cousin. In short, he used an incestuous argument as a basis to seek to dissolve what he had originally petitioned the Vatican for in the first place.The other reason that this annulment was not going to happen is that the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V invaded Rome and took the Pope prisoner and basically made the pope his puppet. Charles V was also the nephew of Katherine and sided with her in this matter as she did not want a divorce.This Reformation was a very different event than the Reformations occurring on the continent. Henry was a devout Roman Catholic, previously the recipient of the title Fidei Defensor, or defender of the faith for a treatise written against Martin Luther's attack on the sacraments. But within a decade he found himself completely at odds with the Vatican and would get the divorce he sought be any means necessary.This is a fascinating read, but it is basically an outline of England, the Church, the monarchy and who really had the authority of law, the Church or the monarchy."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"The nature of time is a difficult subject. Fortunately, Craig Callender (dig the name!) has made the subject (or at least the most relevant views and issues) easier to understand in this superb little book. He begins by surveying what may be considered different types of time, including our psychological experience of temporal succession, measured time, and biological time. He then covers the difference between an absolutist (i.e., temporal succession is independent of any change in the universe) and a relational view (i.e., time just *is* change in the universe), as well as the discussion over whether time really has a direction, or whether or not reality is a space-time 'block' whose moments are individuated by an entity's location on the space-time block. In doing so, Callender surveys various arguments for or against these views, and he discusses even more intuitively odd scenarios such as backward causation and time travel. The last third or so of the book deals with time and its relation to physical laws, such as the entropy law. In treating the subject, Callender introduces the reader to all sorts of odd theoretical entities like wormholes, lightcones, and mobius twists in time. All in all, this is a great book for anyone interested in thinking a bit about what, exactly, time *is*. It is especially useful as a precursor to more academic works like MacBeath and LePoidevin's anthology, The Philosophy of Time."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"Introducing Time is one of the Introducing series most popular selections. For an Introducing book it is also one of the most detailed, thought provoking, wide-ranging and heady science volumes around. If you want to know anything about time then Introducing Time does just that and then some more, but be prepared for lots of difficult diverse thinking.In most cases the first 100 pages will be more than enough for most people and the Introducing series could easily have made this book 200 pages long with that material alone but instead has condensed the opening philosophical thought on time into a shorter amount and goes straight into Einstein, relativity, lots on time travel and a great finish on entropy. Most of these topics are actually books in their own right such as Introducing Relativity and Introducing Einstein so Introducing Time really is good value for money.If you are thinking about starting a collection of science titles from the Introducing series then you would do well to get this book or add it to your collection for two reasons. First of all, Introducing Time includes the best explanation of Boltzmann's statistical mechanics and entropy I have read anywhere. It could be worth it for that alone. You may not expect entropy to have such an impact on the topic of time and that can be a very nice surprise when reading that it does. The second is really just the breath of the coverage that time gets in this book.

If Introducing Time doesn't change your worldview then nothing will."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"Time is a concept that all humans have a fundamental grasp of. We all know that there is a direction to the events of our lives and that once an event happens, to the best of our knowledge it will always have happened. We break it down into units of years, days, hours, and minutes and in the last minute of some sporting events, tenths of seconds. However, when we really try to get a precise intellectual handle on it, time becomes fuzzy and it is very difficult to be precise. The passage of time is also relative to the situation; a few minutes in a dentist chair can appear to be much longer, yet a few hours with our true love can seem like minutes.In this book, Callender and Edney describe some of the attempts by scientists and philosophers to precisely define what time is. Some argue that to be logically consistent, time cannot exist. That of course seems absurd, whatever else we may know, at least locally, time does have an existence and a direction. Newton, Einstein, Godel and others have refined the concept, Einstein in particular demonstrated that the passage of time is slowed when the objects are traveling at high rates of speed. Although the authors do an excellent job using cartoons and other visual devices, the true nature of time is a difficult topic. Like the apparent fate of the universe, in the end, time simply comes down to an overall increase in entropy, for that is the way we recognize the passage of time.This is an excellent book about an apparently simple, yet very complex subject. Time is a subject that we all think we know, until we really start to think about it."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"Introducing Time starts off with Aristotle's view on time then goes on to talk about many philosophical and scientific views of time. It includes Newton's absolute time, Einstein's special and general relativity as they relate to time, including Godel Universes, and also Boltzman's statistical mechanics based view of time. All in all a lot of information in such a short book."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"Great book. By the time you get to the end, you'll know quite a lot about this topic and the whole theory, but you'll be pretty confused. Why confused? Because it's a hard topic to understand or interpret. And the book explains that as well as it can. But it sure will make you think."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"The author did a very good job for introducing this big and diffuclt topic within simple paragraphs.Here I'll try to figure out the main points which are hidden in the structure of the book.In the beginning, the author started to talk about several concepts such as1.Clocks2.Psychological time3.Time scenarios4.Relationalism and absolute time5.Relative and non-relative6.Tenseless and tensed7.Dimensions8.Motion and changeThese conceptions can help us to rethink our world in several different ways.Then, he introduced special relativity--to explain Time Travel is logical possible(under the classical logic: A=A).It means that we can not violate the rule \\"A=A\\" when we think about Time travel.Further, he continued to discuss General relativity to explain--is it possible for phyical Time Travel?After that,he used a very good,in my opinion,method- Thermodynamics- to explain:1.where and how did the universe come from?2.what possible will the universe be in the future?According to a great German philosopher-Kant,we human beings carry a piror facualty-Time,Space,Cause,Effect-when we were born. We percept our surrounding under this framework. Hence,to understand these categories (Time,Space,Cause,Effect) are important. Physics has devoted a big part to Time and Space(or Timespace). In history, many great thinkers-such as Newton, Einstein-proposed thier unique worldview of space and time to promote human beings' intellection. The book included their conceptions and discussed two of categories well.I do not have any background of physics. However, I bet that even you are in lack of fundemental knowledge of physics, you still can learn about \\"Time(Space)\\" through this book.Finally, I have to say again that the author introduced the difficult topic very well.By the way, I think my review may be more suitable for someone who has finished the book than those who don't.p.s.Sorry for my poor English."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"This graphic novel series is wonderfully done. Great for adults who just want a refresher or a great way to get kids interested in these usually profound subjects."},{"Title":"Introducing Time","review":"I purchased this book because I hoped to gain a deep or profound insight about Time from educated, intellectual minds. And while I did in fact achieve this goal, it was not thru the manner that I expected.I support the entire \\"Introducing...\\" series by Totem because their illustrations along with genuine, serious educational content make the books highly appealing, attractive and inspiring. And this one was no exception -- in terms of doing its best to present, primarily chronologically, what informed minds from involved and associated fields had to say, or present as theory, about \\"Time.\\" But -- and this is meant to have a dramatic impact -- BUT... it was through reading what these thinkers and scholars had to say about time that verified to me that nobody knows what it is. Which is a good thing; a great thing! To me this means that a little boy or girl living out in the middle of nowhere has just as much right -- and is equally \\"correct\\" -- in whatever they feel or suppose \\"time\\" is. After reading this book, I realized that nobody can 'know' what Time is, but rather they attempt to define it in ways, that when one looks at it clearly, should come to see as solely based on the way 'time' is measured. Again, time is not definable; it is open to interpretaion; one must be wary of definitions that purport to define, but really do nothing more than present notions based upon how 'time' is measured. A person who sees \\"time\\" as seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years is no more correct than a person who experiences time as an independent, deeply-personal intuitive experience.The best part of the book is the brief area where Einstein's theories of relativity are introduced. As for the rest, to this reader, it was truly great minds \\"mentally masturbating.\\" The question is: Do these great minds know they're \\"m.m-ing\\" or do they truly believe they are offering a profound contribution to the study of Time?But, in all fairness to the book, it was not until I read it that I came to understand what I have attempted to present here. And what I would like to say to any person wondering if they should read this book: Yes, do so; but be confident in whatever you get out of the experience, in terms of your idea of time, do know that you too are equally correct!Nobody knows or understands time. It is open to interpretation. And that is what makes it a beautiful phenomenon. \\"Time\\" has not given its secrets over to any one."},{"Title":"Mach 1 and beyond: The illustrated guide to high-speed flight","review":"Great book for anyone who wants to learn all about high-speed flight without having to learn Calculus, Thermodynamics, and other things associated with an Aerospace Egnineering degree."},{"Title":"SPARC-90, a code for calculating fission product capture in suppression pools (SuDoc Y 3.N 88:25/5765)","review":"This is a wonderful history book of the Chieftains.

It is amazing how many successful Irish bands (of all types) have emerged from this tiny Island of 5 million. Yet in no small way can they all point to a single pioneering band that helped put Irish music on the map.The Chieftains are more than simply a successful collection of great musicians who have toured the world for over 30 years. When they started, in the mid 1960's, there was little interest in traditional music in Ireland. In Ireland, Irish music wasn't considered to be &quot;hip&quot; and broadcasts were limited to relatively unimaginative ceili music. The most famous Irish musicians of time, the Clancy Brothers, were not even living in Ireland when they began.The Chieftains took traditional Irish music and infused it with a new energy and style. They soon developed a cult following, but after doing the sound track for the movie Barry Lyndon (early 70's) their popularity exploded. Even after upwards of 30 albums, they and constant touring, their popularity never falters.The Chieftains : The Authorized Biography by John Glatt tells the story of how it all happened.

I found Nanci Griffith's reading of the story to be very rushed and lacking in feeling and emotion. At various times, interviews with different band members are inserted. Many of the interviews are full of background noise, sounding like they were conducted at a party. I really don't know much about the editing process, but it seems that some of this superfluous noise could have been removed to make the speaker's voice more audible.

She is an \\"autobigraphical\\" writer, and her novels fall into two groups: 1. the earlier \\"Ohio\\" novels which are based on Powell's childhood and adolescence in small-town Ohio in the early 20th Century and 2. the later \\"New York novels which are heavily satirical and describe Greenwich Village where Powell spent most of her adult life.Powell wrote \\"Dance Night\\" in 1930, and it is an early novel in the \\"Ohio\\" group. It describes the fictitous small-town of Lamptown, Ohio in the early 20th century. There are gritty pictures of the local bars and saloons and of the railroad men who frequented them. There a pictures of the factories which were the chief employers of both men and the young women. The book focuses on the life of the working class in Lamptown, with their cramped, limited ambitions and opportunities, their rickety homes, and their sexual repressions and liasions. (Books such as this remind me of George Gissing, a Victorian novelist who remains too little known, and who depicted somewhat similar scenes and people in London.)The two primary characters in the novel are Morry Abott a young man on the verge of adulthood and Jen St. Clair, a young girl just beginning adolescence who has been adopted from an orphanage. The book is how they come of age, sexually and emotionally, and how they attempt in their own ways (including their frustrated relationship with each other) to leave Lamptown. Morry, in particular, seems based upon Powell herself (she generally uses male protagonists in her books that I have read) and the frustrations she experienced in the rural midwest and her dream of a life of glamor, freedom, and adventure (sexual and otherwise) in New York.In the novel, Morry lives with his mother who runs a small woman's hat shop, the Bon Ton. The father is a travelling salesman and mostly absent. When he is present, things are very ugly.The title \\"Dance Night\\" derives from the chief social activity in Lamptown, the Thursday evening dances. Morry, his mother, and the young factory girls of Lamptown frequent the dances to flirt, dance, and arrange dates and sexual encounters.There is a great deal of emphasis in the book on furtive, repressed sexual encounters between the young men and women of Lamptown. There is always a hope of escape -- then and now -- based primarily on the dream of sexual liberation. The book is also a story of economic change and ambition at the time of the beginning of the Depressions. The book shows the passing of chance and the attempt to make a quick dollar without thought or training.The story is really within the American tradition of the coming of age novel -- of the young man finding himself. The book gives a memorable picture of Lamptown. But it leaves its main character Morry as he departs Lamptown in search of broader horizons and an uncertain future. This is an excellent, little-known American novel."},{"Title":"Dance Night","review":"Dawn Powell is without a doubt one of the most remarkable writers of this century. Anyone who wants to know how this country truly looked, sounded, and felt in the 30's, 40's &amp; 50's owes it to themselves to stock up on her books. Her New York novels, like &quot;The Locusts Have No King&quot;, can be almost savage in their bitingly hilarious portayals of life in mid-century Manhattan and Greenwich Village. &quot;Dance Night&quot; is something else, entirely. Powell brings the grubby town of Lamptown, Ohio to aching life; you won't soon forget her finely-etched characters and their desperate efforts to create some happiness among the cargo trains and factory whistles and backsteet affairs that define the limits of their lives at the dawn of the Great Depression. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Powell fans may want to order a copy of &quot;The Best of Dawn Powell&quot;, as it contains &quot;Dance Night&quot;, &quot;Turn Magic Wheel&quot;, and a collection of short stories."},{"Title":"Dance Night","review":"I previously read Dawn Powell's The Golden Spur, which was a combination of Dorothy Parker's wit and Iris Murdoch's use of a multitude of characters, and liked it enough to purchase and read Dance Night. Of the two, Dance Night is, by far, the better. Powell has created two characters - Morry and Jen - whom you come to care about, while also accurately depicting small town life in the early 1900s and how it is to be young. Her female characters such as Morry's mother, Elsinore, and, particularly, Jen, are complex and well rounded, which is refreshing, given that the novel was written in 1930. Though it is not as humorous as The Golden Spur, Powell still utilizes her wit with occasional one-liners that are capable of making you laugh out loud. Definitely worth reading, and further proof that more of her novels should be reprinted."},{"Title":"Dance Night","review":"This novel of early 20th century Ohio deserves a place with the novels of Willa Cather and Theodore Dreiser. Unlike Dawn Powell's satirical New York novels, this is a straightforward and touching story of a young man growing up and growing out of a stifling small town. The story paints a wonderful picture of a simpler time in our country. This portrait, along with Powell's knack for characterization and interesting plot turns, make the book a treasure."},{"Title":"Dance Night","review":"The four stars are simply because, as a huge Dawn Powell fan, I feel that some of her other novels are a little more well rounded. Having said that, I feel that four stars for Dawn Powell is the equivilent of five stars for anyone else. Dance Night is an engaging and easy to read novel, with Powell's usual flair for nailing character types. I highly recommend this novel, but more importantly, I recommend all of Dawn Powell's works You never develop too much compassion for the main characters, but the wit and insight with which they are drawn is really what makes them so enjoyable. Do yourself a favor and start reading Dawn Powell today."},{"Title":"Quantitative System Performance, Computer System Analysis Using Queuing Network Models","review":"This text was published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., in 1984.It remains the definitive work on analytic modelling ofcomputer systems.The publisher has returned the copyright to the authors,who made the material available for viewing ordownloading, in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.Do a Google search for \\"qsp.zip\\" or \\"Quantitative System Performance\\"."},{"Title":"Quantitative System Performance, Computer System Analysis Using Queuing Network Models","review":"wish some one provide the publication details of this boo"},{"Title":"The River","review":"I liked the book because there was a lot of action but some of it was hard to believe.

The one man that is on the trip with him to record what is going on gets struck by lightning and leaves Brian all alone in the wilderness. Again.

So Brian has to build a raft and take Derrick down \\"The River\\" to the trading post.In this story Brian of course is the main character and he is a teenager with very black hair. He likes being in the woods and/or in the wilderness more than the city. I think that that is one of the similarities that I share with him. There are a few other characters in this story also. There is Derrick and Brian's mother.In my opinion this book was a pretty good book. I did like The Hatchet a lot more. So, the next time that you are looking for a good book to read, I suggest that you read The Hatchet. And if you have a lot more time on your hands and don't care what book you are going to read, then you might want to try to read The River. You might even like it more than The Hatchet."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Wet, wild, and adventurous. Thats the words i would use to describe this book.

This book is very good because it is very exciting. It shows how a teenage boy survives in the wilderness with a psychologist. This book is an adventure book. Before you read The River you should read the first two books. The first two books are Hatchet and Brian's Winter. In The River Brian goes back to the wilderness to teach Derek (psychologist) how to survive in the wilderness. Things go well until a lighting bolt hits Derek. He gets knocked out. One quote that Brian told Derek is, \\" I won't let you die.\\" At this point Brian is very scared because he doesn't want Derek to die. Derek is feeling that he can't save Derek. Even though he told Derek that he wouldn't let him die he still felt worried. One of my favorite quotes that Brian had said was \\" I can't give up\\". This is a good quote because Brian knows he can save Derek."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Well I thought that The River by Gary Paulson was a very interesting book. 15 year old boy Brian Robenson is faced with yet again another challenge.

He is faced with a greater burden and has to take care of someone he hasn't known that long.When he finds out his radio connection with police and other nature specialists is lost, he has to find a way down the river to the nearest trading post.

Well in The River Brain is asked to go back to the wilderness and face the horrible experience that he has faced in the past. The government comes and asks Brain to go in the wilderness with one of there doctors to see his thoughts and emotions. They want to make a survival book about him because he is the only person that knows the real thing. He eventually accepts the invitation because they have the whole thing planed and mapped out so Brain feels safe. He finds out that it was a very bad decision.I liked the book a lot it was good in describing the situation and the characters were very realistic and they weren't stupid characters. I think that Gary Paulsen could have thought about a better way to put these two books together. The story was put together well but could have been better and the length of the book was a good length I didn't feel like falling asleep when I was reading this story. The plot was good it was something that could be a real situation. The ending in the book also could have been better. Most people would be able to understand the stories language it was very easily to understand and there were no words that I didn't understand.

After surviving a summer in the forest, and a plane crash, Derek, a psychologist and a survival instructor asked him to do it again. They want to learn how he did it so they could teach others.

The Necktie Lake was there site, near the Necktie River.After a few good days at the lake, disaster struck. Lighting hit Derek and the radio. Derek was in a coma and would die without water so Brian made a choice to take him to help. He took the map and made a route down the Necktie River to Brannock Trading Post. The journey than began.I think this book is just as good as Hatchet. I liked the unexpected turn in the book when lightning struck. Just before it happened, they were saying how everything was going so good. They had everything they needed, shelter and fire, but than everything had to go wrong. I also liked the way Brian thought.

It's about a boy named Brian who is about 15 years old and a scientist named Derek who is in his 30's go out into the wilderness so Brian can show him how to survive, since he did it about a year before when his plane crashed in the Canadian wilderness. They have to live out there for 3 weeks. After 3 days a lightening storm hits and Derek is struck by lightning and goes into a coma, so Brian has to build a raft and go for help at the trading post before it's too late for Derek.The best part in the book was when Brian finished the raft and finally heads down the river to get help. Brian has to stay awake the whole time until he gets to the trading post because he has to steer the raft. At one point he loses track of the raft and loses it along with Derek because he got knocked off the raft.The theme of this story is survival because Brian has to survive and keep Derek alive too.This was a great book to read. I like how suddenly things turn bad for Brian when Derek goes into a coma. He has to keep himself and Derek alive and get help"},{"Title":"The River","review":"Nick Wrightmod2The RiverThe River is about Brian Robeson (from the Hatchet) going back into the wilderness. This time he goes with Derek Holtzer, a government psychologist, so Derek can learn how he survived and show astronauts and military survival techniques. During a storm Derek his put into a coma and Brian must find a way to get him to safety.My favorite part in this book is when the storm comes. Brian wakes up in the middle of the night and hears the thunder and lightening. He remembers the tornado but said there is no way he could go through such a bad storm twice in one life. When he reawakens all he can see is lightening. Brian told Derek to just stay low and don't get hit. Derek couldn't hear him and went into his bag. The lightening jumped of the tree, hit Derek's radio, which was there only way of communication with the real world and it was ruined, and hits Derek. Brian wakes the next day to find Derek in a coma.I think this is a good book for anyone. It teaches two main things. One is think about your decisions because they can come back to haunt you. Like when Brian told Derek to put all the stuff back in the plane he didn't have the gear when he needed it. Second, it teaches that when you need to take a risk to get a great reward you sometimes have to take it. Like Brian had to take the risk of bringing Derek on a raft one hundred miles down a river to a trading post.

I enjoy being with Brian as he thinks and acts in the survival environment. This book didn't have as many episodes or scenes with different animals and threats as the first book. In other words - not as many problems to solve and Brian didn't learn or grow as much as he did in the first book. So, not a lot happens here but I still liked it.The book is shorter than standard novels. The narrator Peter Coyote was excellent.OTHER BOOKS:The author wrote many books, but the Hatchet series consists of:5 stars. Hatchet (read first)5 stars. Brian's Winter (read second or third but I prefer second)3 stars. The River (read second or third)4 stars. Brian's Return3 stars. Brian's HuntDATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 2 hrs and 31 mins.

He's read every book Gary Paulsen has written that is fitting for a young person his age, and he truly enjoyed this series of books.

Brian had suffered after reentry into world of civilization after his forest ordeal, so it was with great reluctance that he agreed to accompany Derek--his mother's boyfriend--on a \\"nostalgia\\" trip back into the forest. Scorning Derek's survival gear as superfluous Brian gradually winds up giving the man an ultimatum--thus reversing the usual adult-teen roles.River craft is new for Brian but he has no one to guide him once Derek becomes unconscious. Prey to his own imagination and eventual exhaustion-induced hallucination, Brian experiencesmilk paranoia as the harsh reality of his lonely status undermines his normally creative cerebral functions. Suddenly he realizes that he is not up to the survival challenges, for he has taken on the additional responsibility of an injured adult.

A suspenseful story fraught with the perils of negotiating a wild river, this book entertains and captures the reader's interest.

It is the sequel to \\"Hatchet\\" which is one of his books that I have read and really liked. The plot of this book is that Brian had previosly found a way to survive for over 50 days in the wilderness and someone wanted to make a documentary on him. He was asked if he could do it again. So they both went out into the wilderness and started their project. They worked through tough times together and faced animals, weather, and other obstacles. Derek was struck by lightning, fell into a coma, and Brian had to react. You will have to read the rest to find out what happens. I have only read a few of his books but I thought that this one wasn't quite as good. It is much like his others that I have read, which are all about survival, except this one seemed that it was missing something and wasn't brought to its full potential. I felt like he didnt describe everything as well and that there wasnt really enough to the whole story. Overall it really is a good book, it just falls short of the caliber of \\"Hatchet\\"."},{"Title":"The River","review":"This book is the sequel to Paulsen's Newbery Medal-winning The Hatchet which I reviewed a few months ago. In this book, some men who run a government survival school want Brian to go back to the Canadian wilderness and show them how he survived. Derek Holtzer, the psychologist running the program, believes that the teaching will be much more successful if he's gone through the real thing.After much talking with Brian's family, it's agreed that the young boy can go. When they reach the last leg of their journey, Brian puts his foot down: if Derek really wants to learn how to survive then the tents, food, guns, sleeping bags...everything must stay behind. If any of those items come along they will be used, and Derek won't be learning how to survive.Derek knows that Brian is right and agrees to the plan, only bringing along communication gear. They don't even have time to set up camp properly when a rip-snorting storm blows through the lake area. Derek is struck by lightning; the communications are knocked out. The only thing Brian can do in an effort to save Derek's life is to build a raft and travel by river to a small trading post.Brian is an exceptional character, and I enjoyed reading about him again. The problem with this book is that the premise is over within the span of five heartbeats. Zap! The lightning strikes. Bam! Derek is gravely injured. Pow! Brian builds the raft. Zowie! They're on the river. Oof! They're at the trading post. There's just not enough meat on the bone in which to sink your teeth.Fortunately, this isn't the last book that Paulsen has written about Brian, so when I need a survival fix, I'll look up the other books in the series. This is a young character who has definitely gotten under my skin!"},{"Title":"The River","review":"I have decided to review all books I have purchased with my new Kindle, and this is the first one. I read Hatchet in school, but it is not necessary to do so if you want to read this book. I would reccomend doing so, but Paulsen wrote this book so well that you know what happened in the first book. It gets a 5 star from me. Definitely reccomend it."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Having read other books by Gary Paulsen like Tracker, Woodsong, Dogsong, The Monument, The Island, Night John,and the Hatchet series,ect, I realized that The River is not one of Paulsen's best work. The River seemed a little unrealistic and it had a very basic polt, Brian has to go back to the Woods, something goes wrong, he takes a trip down a river to a trading station and gets rescued. Its all very predictable. The part that seems un realistic is the part where Derek gets struck by lightning and Brian happens not to have been hit, and the radio happens to break. Also building a raft can be harder than Paulson makes it sound.But to all Gary Paulsen fans, don't stop reading Gary Paulsen books just because this book has lowish ratings. Hatchet is the most wellknown book by Gary Paulsen and many who have read Hatchet haven't read many of the other great books by Gary Paulsen. I remeber a few years ago when I was in fourth grade, The River was the second Gary Paulsen book I read, But I still decided to keep reading books by him. I read Night John when I was in fifth grade adn it still is my favorite book by Gary Paulson now. You may have noticed that I'm not Ralf Kiehl, I'm his daughter, a 13 year old kid, but I still really like to read Gary Paulson."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The River by Gary Paulson is one of my favorite books.

In this book Brian Robeson is asked by the government to go back and do the same thing he did in Hatchet. They wanted to have Brian go out in the middle of the forest with Derek Holtzer. Derek was a psychologist that was going to go with Brian and take notes on what he did to survive. Then Derek was going to re-teach these methods to people.Of course when Brian got asked this he was a little skeptical if he wanted to go or not. His mom didn't really want him to go because she thought it would be dangerous. They had planned to bring pretty much everything besides the kitchen sink. His mom approved on letting Brian go on this adventure.They set off to the lake that they had picked out. It was a big lake with a river flowing out of it. Brian was a little nervous of being in a plane again. The last time he was in a plane it crashed and he was stranded. This time he would just get dropped off in the woods. When Brian and Derek got to the lake Brian realized something. He realized that it just wouldn't be the same. If they had just about everything they needed it just wouldn't be the same. Brian told Derek that they needed to leave everything. Derek agreed with Brian. The only thing they kept was a radio for emergencies.As soon as the plane left they set off around the lake searching for things to eat, make fire with, and a nice shelter. They found a nice shelter that was near the lake. It was an old tree that had grown into a hill and it left an overhang. They thought it would be perfect. The first night there they didn't have a fire. They got ate alive by mosquitos. Brian asked himself why he was living through this hell again. Then he thought of all the people he would be helping by doing this. The second day they found a great amount of food, and got a fire going. That night the sky was clear but Brian could hear off in the distance some rumbling. He realized it was going to rain.While they were sleeping a huge CRACK woke Brian and Derek up! It was right on top of them. The lightning was striking all around them. Derek reached up to get the radio and at that instant he was stuck by lightning. It sent him into an instant coma.Brian is thinking of what he is going to do. The radio was burned out because the lightning hit that too. The day before Derek had checked in on the radio and they said that they would only check in once a week. They had 6 more days to wait before anyone would even know that they were in trouble.Brian then decides to make a raft and go take Derek down the river. The raft is made out of big logs that the beavers had cut perfectly for him.Brian had to make it down the river in 2, or 3 days before Derek would get dehydrated. There are many obstacles on the way. If you want to see if they make it down the river with Derek still alive you will have to read this book and find out.\\"That's exactly it. We have trouble. That's what this is all about. You want to learn, but if you have all that backup, it's just more games. It's not real. You wouldn't have that if the situation were real, would you?-This is a quote from Brian. He is talking to Derek about leaving all the stuff on the plane. He is saying that if they had all of it the trip would be pointless and they wouldn't learn anything.CharactersBrian- Brian is a smart athletic boy. He is about 15 years old. He has great common sense, and can react fast in critical situations.Derek- Derek is a psychologist. He is in about his young 30's. He is not very athletic and he doesn't have the greatest common sense ever.Pilot- The pilot is a young kid about in his 20's. When he is flying the plane it soothed Brian because he realized that he wouldn't have a heart attack like what happened in Hatchet.Mom- Brian's mom is a nice woman who cares a lot for Brian. She doesn't really want to see Brian go on this adventure.I think Gary Paulsen did a great job writing this book. I love reading his books about Brian being in the wilderness. They are all well written and they all go together with each other. I think this is my favorite book of his I have read yet.If you like reading books about the wilderness and adventure this is the perfect book for you. I would suggest reading Hatchet before you read this book.I felt The River was a very good book. Gary Paulsen did an excellent job at writing it. I love reading all of his books. So far this one is my favorite. It is a great adventure that I would suggest anyone to read."},{"Title":"The River","review":"In this sequel to Gary Paulsen's The Hatchet Brian finds himself faced with a new challenge. Instead of he himself surviving, he must get someone else to safety. Derek Holtzer asks Brian to do it again, to survive so that he can teach others to do it, but then he is struck by lightning, disabling him and forcing Brian to get him to safety before it's top late. The only option is the river that leads out to safety, as he is yet faced with another challenge.I thought that this book was an easy read, and it was fantastically crafted, just like any other Paulsen work. He brings fourth a style which is felt because of his experiences in the wilderness, and makes you go through all of the ups and downs that the character experiences. It was definitely a thrill ride from start to finish, with a good strong plot and lots of interesting details of survival. Overall I'd say that this book is a worthy sequel to Hatchet and a must for any Paulsen fan."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The River is the follow up to the popular book Hatchet. In this book, government officials ask Brian to relive his wilderness adventure so that they can learn his survival techniques. Brian is hesitant about going back to the place that he was so glad to get out of. However, he agrees to go so that others can learn what he did. A official from the government comes with him to take notes on what Brian did, and everthing seems to be going well. Unfortunatly, good fortune does not last forever. During a storm one night, the government official is hit with lightning and left in a comna. Knowing that the man will not survive very long, Brian decides to build a raft and float the man down the river to help. This story is about Brian's journey down river and the struggles he has to face. I only gave it three stars due to the fact that the story can easily be read in one sitting and lacks body. It seems that Gary Paulsin does not know when to stop writing about Brian, and this story proves that.

The situation is different this go round, and Brian and Derek begin an adventure that will change their lives. I liked the book because of the adventure Paulsen created throughout it.

This time Brian is not alone because Derek is with him. When Brian and Derek got to the lake at night, the mosquitoes attacked them like rain attacks the roof of my house. This reminds me of the times when I go to camp and get attacked by mosquitoes. When this happens, I feel miserable just like Brian did. Then I walk around itching, scratching and feeling like I want to die. When Derek was shocked by lightning, Brian had to decide to stay there or take Derek down the river to get help. Brian had to float down the river. This reminds me of when I had to do forty jumps in the air at tennis practice. I didn't want to do it, but I had to, just like Brian had to go down the river. It is very hard to do forty jumps because it hurts your back. I knew I had to do it to stay in the clinic just like Brian knew he had to go down the river. Brian had alot of fear when he fell off the raft. I have that same fear about roller coasters. Nobody made me go on them, but I am still afraid of them. I can imagine how it must feel to be afraid and then actually to have to go ahead and do it. The River is a great novel. Everyone who likes adventure should read this book. I like Brian because he had the courage to follow through with things. He doesn't whine about things; he just does what he has to do. We sometimes slack off and whine about things. When we do, we should think of Brian"},{"Title":"The River","review":"This book continues the saga of Brian and his survival adventures. When you think that Brian can't be challenged by anything more than he was the first time in Hatchet, he finds himself stuck the wilderness again but responsible for another person, not just himself. This arouses new feelings of responsibility, fear, and resentment. But of course, Brian overcomes these obstacles and saves the day once again. It is quite short in comparison to its predecessor, but it is still very exciting. The pace is as fast as the river they have to flow down, but then he keeps hitting obstacles that makes the reader \\"tense\\" and worry that they won't make it. It is not as satisfying as Hatchet, but still good and Brian's character is consistent with how the reader thought he would be, if they got another chance to check in on his development. It is a good book for Boys and girls. Good suspense!"},{"Title":"The River","review":"This book is pretty kewl. It is filled with action and leaves you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are reading it.

In this book a government official named Derek comes to his house to ask him to do it all over again... just without the crashing part! So he agrees and they go out there and the guy is struck by lightning and is in a coma, and Brian knows the only way to save him is to build a raft to go down river to the trading post so he can get medical attention. The rest you will have to find out by yourself!!!"},{"Title":"The River","review":"I think that this book was one of the best book's ever in the whole collection of Hatchet and Brian's winter I sugest that you buy the book or even the collection of Hatchet and Brian's winter because it's worth buying it and it is a good book and collection for kid's and adult's. It is worth the money I guerent it because i started Hathet two days ago and now im on Brian's Hunt and I realy think that the book is the best. I also think that the auther Gary Paulsen is a god to the book world and that most of his story's they just look realy real and if he's looking at this now I say thank you for writeing all the books he has writeing.By Nick Doyon (Biddeford,Maine)"},{"Title":"The River","review":"This book, &quot;The River&quot;, by Gary Paulsen, is the very interesting sequel to &quot;Hatchet&quot;. In &quot;The River&quot;, the hero, Brian Robeson, is asked to &quot;do it again&quot;- survive in the forests far away from civilization, so the government can learn how Brian was able to survive. There's only one difference- a psychologist working for the government named Derek is coming with Brian.

Now, Brian must bring Derek to a doctor at the trading post, because their transmitter is dead... ...and Derek might be too if Brian doesn't get Derek there in time...I've enjoyed this book because of the danger and adventure, and I recommend this book to whoever likes danger and adventure."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Once again Gary Paulsen writes another thrilling and exciting wilderness adventure.

This is a story filled with excitment and wonder and is extremely hard to put down. Anyone will enjoy reading this captivating tale of survival and will want to share it with everyone they know."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The River was a great book, an attention getter. Gary Paulsen brings to life his main character Brian, a teenager, and takes you on a wilderness survival adventure set in modern times. I read the book after my 10 year old son received it as a Christmas gift, he is adhd and it is very difficult for him to read a whole book. I encouraged him to read the adventure and he loved it. He read the entire book and then asked for additional publications by Gary Paulsen. The author has a great ability to capture the imagination and take it to new heighths."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The first book that I read by Gary Paulsen was Hatchet. I liked that book very much, so when more books came out in the series, I got them. Brian's Winter is good, but could have been better. The River is pathetic. It is a survival story that has the people out for less than a week in an area with a lot of wild berries and fish. Give me a break! Not only that, but almost everything that can go wrong does go wrong. This is not the kind of book that I like reading."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The RiverThe river is a wild extravaganza, that Brian volunteers his self to explore and teach FBI agents the ways of the wild. Along the way Brian is filled with mi8shaps, and wrong direction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Hatchet, Brian Winter, or Brian Return. The river is an action packed slash suspenseful wild river ride."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Two years have gone by since Brian Robeson survived in the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet, and now two men come knocking at Brian's door. They come in to tell Brian that the government wants him to try to survive in the wilderness again. The government is going to send Brian with a government psychologist, Derek Holtzer, to take notes. Derek will take notes so that when he returns he can teach survival skills in the wilderness to the Army, Boy Scouts, and anyone else who wants to know. After a long discussion with his mom, he decides that he needs to do it because he is the only one who knows how. Derek has never been camping in his life and is not much of an outdoorsman. Brian loves the outdoors but is not very talkative, which may make it hard for Derek to take notes.So they take a plane to a lake deep in the Canadian wilderness, with a river going through it, surrounded by tall trees. After a few days a big lightning storm hits. Derek gets hit by lightning right next to Brian. \\"Derek, can you hear anything I'm saying?\\" said Brian frantically. Derek was lifeless and appeared to be dead. It took Brian a while, but he finally figured out that Derek was in a coma. Brian determined Derek only had about six days to live. So he decides to make a raft and paddle 119 miles down the river to Brannock Trading Post. The rest of the story is Brian's adventurous race against time.The book is not as good as the Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings stories, but it is a great fictional quick read. Once you get into Brian riding down the river, you will not be able to put the book down. I like how Gary Paulsen uses objects to symbolize different things, like how the lightning symbolizes death. All of his books are non-stop action, including this book, which I really enjoyed. This book is similar to Huckleberry Finn, but The River is more of a non-stop adventure. I would recommend that you read Hatchet before you read this book. So if you like Gary Paulsen and his action-packed books, then The River is the book for you."},{"Title":"The River","review":"RickyLanguage ArtsMrs. ReidSeptember 29, 2005The RiverThe River by Paulsen is one of my favorite books.

But reading the sequel, the river, was another. I was surprised that gary paulsen was going to write a sequel but he did. I tell ya, I know that it was wrong, but in the book, I laughed. I laughed my ass off. Here the kid is, after surviving the wilderness, only to go right back to where he got stranded. Only this time he has company. I don't know. Maybe I just have sick humor. But out of the constant trials and tribulations that brian faced, I was laughing all the way. Call it poetic irony. But that doesn't detour this from the fact that this is a swell read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The River","review":"The River was a headache inducing book! I do not recommend this book to anyone because it doesn't have that Gary Paulsen feel to it. This book lacks every thing and I don't know how Gary wrote this book when he usually writes great, award-winning, and action-packed books. The problems with it are that it was extremely time consuming, it has a boring plot, a bad theme, and it is predictable.There was not much action in the book and all that really happened was that Brian went down a river to get home. Brian went into the woods to show a government official how he survived in the wilderness. The government official or Derek brought lots of supplies to help them survive but Brian refused to bring any of it but the radio. The radio proved to have no use after Derek and the radio got struck by lightning and Derek fell into a coma. Then this is where the boring going down a river thing started.This book has absolutely nothing close to a theme whatsoever. This is because the only thing that happened was Brian built a raft to go down a river to get home. Also there was no action to the book except when Derek comes knocking at Brian's front door in the beginning. This book could have been filled with much more action and I have proof from the way Gary wrote Hatchet. I think that one piece of exciting action could have been if there was a waterfall. Brian thought there was going to be a water fall but it was just rapids.As I said before, this is a do not read book. I will never recommend this book to any one and I hope no one will ever read it. I know people will and I feel bad for them wasting their time on this book. That is my review for The River by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Hatchet.

The hatchet is about Brian getting stranded out in the wilderness for fifty-four days. Both books were realistic fiction. The main idea the writer tries to get across is if you're in a bad situation don't make a bad choice.I think anyone can read this book. It is not to hard and not to easy. One of the bad parts was when they were talking at the table. They did not use enough detail. One of the strong points was when Derek was struck by lightning. I knew exactly what was going on.

This book had alot of cliff hangers.This book left you waiting to read on for Example: Brain fell off the raft and had to chance it and every turn he could not find it. I did not like how that the Author Gary Paulson did not include alot of wild life. They were only in the wildreness and they did not even include any animals. If I was Gary Paulson I would of made them foght off a bear of some other kind of wild animal. The other part that I would change is let them ride of two more miles.

Two years ago, Brian Robeson was stranded alone in the wild when his plane crashed. He survived for about fifty days with only a small hatchet. In this book, the government wants Brian to show them what he did to survive in the wild. The government wants to use those skills and teach the military and other government branches the same survival skills that he used. At first, he seems relecuctant to go but later decides to show the government what he did because he knows that his skills could save lives. This time, Derek Holtzer, a psychologist, will accompany him to record all his daily activities. They go a few days with no trouble at all until a storm hits. Derek is hit by a lightning bolt that puts him in a coma and knocks out the radio. Brian must decide if he will stay and wait for help or build a raft and try to ride the river for over a hundred miles to a trading post. They have a map but that may be inaccurate. I thought this book was very good. The only things I didn1t like about it were that the first 25 pages were pretty slow and this book is only a hundred and thirty pages long making it a pretty short read. This book is filled with action making you not want to put the book down once you pick it up. Gary Paulsen does an excellent job in describing what it takes to survive out in the wilderness. I recommend that you read The Hatchet first to get a feel for Brian's personality. I gave this book four and a half stars out of five because I think Gary Paulsen could have made this book longer."},{"Title":"The River","review":"As wondering at my new opened library I found out that there was a sequal to the great book the Hachet. I really enjoyed the book Hachet and wanted to read the next book. I read The River's review and really wanted to read it. I borrowed it from the library and read it for a long time.The characters in the book is Brian, a fifteen year old boy who survived at the wilds for 54 days only with a hachet before. Also there is a physician named Derek that wants to do some coverage on how Brian survived with only a hachet. They go back to the wilds with only a couple of things. One day they are struck with lightening Derek goes in a coma. Brian has to save him and looking through Derek's map he see's a trading post 100 miles away. Brian must save him by traveling through a river.I would recommend this book to everybody of all ages. It was really a good book that deserved an award like Hachet. It was a really good sequal and really great to just relax and read. The River also has a sequal called Brian's Winter. Read all three great books."},{"Title":"The River","review":"I really liked the book, The River because its a good adventure book. I also liked the suspense when something happens. For example, when a bad storm comes and Derek gets hit by lighting. Paulson tells u what happened through Brian's feelings and the way he sees things. Another reason I liked this book is the great detail. Paulson creates a pictures in your head of what is happening. It feels like you're right there felling and going through the same stuf they are. There is one spot that is slow and not really interesting but thats the only part.The best part in the book is when Derek and Brian go down the water rapids. Brian tries to control the raft but he can't. He ends up running into a rock and falling off. Brian gets pushed around and finally gets to shore but can't find the raft.The two story elements that were vivid to me were the conflicts and the setting. The conflicts in the book were really intense. Brian had to face a lot if character vs. self and character vs. nature conflicts. The setting details in the book were great. You feel like you were there watching the lighting and hearing the thunder."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Brian Robeson was a true survivor.

You should read this book because it is an interesting story about a 15-year old city boy named Brian that has to go back to the wilderness and try to survive. In the book,&quot;Hatchet&quot; Brian crashes in the wilderness on the way to see his father. The pilot dies and he is left alone to survive. Now in the book,&quot;The River&quot; the goverment is asking him to go back and do it again to teach people how to survive if they are in a crisis that Brian had when he crashed. Brian agrees and Derek,one of the people from the goverment, goes with him. The story turns into an exciting adventure when Brian not only has to save himself but also another person. This is a great book that Gary Paulsen wrote. Read this book and i'm sure that you will like it as much as i did."},{"Title":"The River","review":"This is one of Gary Paulsen's best books he's ever written! This is a great story.One day Brian gets encountered by a guy named Derek, who asks him to go back to the woods to live the way he did before. Derek wants to expiriment with him. So Brian agrees and off they go to the woods. By accident, one night, Derek gets struck by lighting and dozes off into a coma. Brian must save him.

But fortuanatly, he was recued at the end of summer. Now a young govorment psychologist named Derek Holtzer persuades him to go into the woods again so Derek can learn his survival techniques. Brian and his mother agreed, so soon enough, he was heading toword the woods next to a lake similar to the one he had been at two years ago. For the first few days everything was going fine, but later, during a terrible storm, Derek is struck by lightning and falls into a coma, while the radio is dead.Brian soon learns that Derek will die of thirst unless Brian can get him medical help 100 miles down the river. Brian builds a raft to try carry Derek and him across the river, but will Brian be able to save Derek in time? Read the book to find out. Overall, I think the book was pretty good, but not exactly great. The reason it's not terrific because it's a bit boring and I'm not that into survival stories anyway. But remember, that's my opinion. I think the book would be great for children around the age 9 who like danger and survival stories because the book is about how Brian shows how he survives to the wilderness and the reading level is meant is for these students. If you like &quot;The River&quot; you can read &quot;Hatchet&quot; or &quot;Brian's Winter&quot;, a companion to both of these books.

He was proud to be at home where he could enjoy luxuries that we take for granted like a roof over our head and good food to eat. Yet, he is asked to take the challenge again by Derek Holtzer, a psychologist, in the hopes of helping others (soldiers, pilots, etc.) make their way after being stranded. At first Brian was skeptical, yet somewhere in his mind, he knew that he had to do it. He even missed the wilderness! With the permission of his parents, Brian and Derek set off on a new adventure of survival to a new area of wilderness. During the trip on the bush plane, Brian was convinced that something was just not right. They were taking too many supplies. So, he convinced Derek to leave all of the supplies behind save for the radio and the briefcase with a map and notebooks. Luckily, Brian and Derek found shelter, food and made fire rather quickly. However, their luck changes with a bolt of lightning! With Derek in a coma, Brian makes and navigates a raft down the river from Necktie Lake to the safety of Brannock Trading Post. The River is a great book about survival and adaptation to the bad luck life sometimes presents. The book descriptively depicts the location and the power and drive that people call on to accomplish certain tasks. This book would be great for students in 4th grade and beyond. Teachers could use this book when studying habitat, Canada, maps, survival techniques, geography, etc. and can be integrated in to all subject areas especially Math, Social Studies, Language Arts, Science, and Visual Arts. Overall, it is a fun book to read as well as a great follow-up story to The Hatchet, also by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"The River","review":"I think that this book is a very good and action packed book.I normally hate reading.

I think that if The River was the third book in the series it would make more sense. If the book were in that order I wouldnt have been confused all the time. The book it self was ok though. It had a lot of adventure in it. I kept wanting to read more."},{"Title":"The River","review":"This was my favorite book during the summer. The book I read was The River by Gary Paulsen. He is one of my favorite authors. I think it only had about 100 pages, but it kept my attention. If I were to rate it I would give it 3 out of 5, whitch is pretty good.Two years ago, Brian Robinson was lost and stranded in the wilderness for fifty days with nothing but a smalll hatchet (small ax). He survived. Now the goverment wants hem to do it again-to go back into the wilderness so theat the military can learn the survival techniques that keep him alive. This time he wont be alone, Derek Holtzer, a goverment psychologist, will accompay him. But during a storm, Derek is hit by a bolt of lightming and falls into a coma. Their radio transmitter is dead. Brians onlu hope is to build a raft and try o transport Derek 100 miles down river to a traiding post-if the map he has is accurate.This is a very, very short book as I already mentioned in the 1st paragraph above. There is a good illustration, the picture of Brian on the raft and Derek on the floor of the raft, they are going down the steep and active rapid. There arnt many characters in the book so you wont get confused because there are only two main characters.I recomend this book to anybody who has read the Hatchet(the prequel to The River. It is very easy to read with a big faunt. Anybody who likes survival situation should read this, or any other book writtern by Gary Paulsen. These are the shortest chapters as well. Each chapter is only five pages.You would enjoy this book a lot more if you read Hatchet. So you know his personality better. If you read Hatchet and Brians Wineter what Ive done, is the best way to understand the book and what he has gone through, and how he huntes. Another interesting fact is that Brian Robinson has the same name as me (the auther who has just written theis butiful book review). I change my mind I give this book a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The river was way too short. I believe this is the worst book of the series. Don't get me wrong it was a pretty good book but no where near as good as the other three. Some parts of the book were to predictable like when Derrick gets struck by lightning or how brian told Derrick to leave the food, right there you could tell something was going to go wrong. The book ended to quickly and didn't explain much. Overall the book was pretty good but not what i expected."},{"Title":"The River","review":"This book was fantastic! Brian Robeson was stranded in the wilderness for 54 days and barely survived with a hatchet. Two years later, the government wants him to go on a similar adventure with a psychologist, Derek Holtzer. The reason being is because they want to find out how Brain survived this adventure so the government can teach astronauts and the military these same techniques. When a terrible storm comes and lightning strikes Derek and the radio transmitter leaving Derek in a coma, Brian is now again on his own. He is left with nothing. Not even the hatchet. The only way to survive is to build a raft and transport Derek a hundred miles down a river to a trading post where he can find help. That is, if the map is accurate."},{"Title":"The River","review":"Brian struggles with a storm and Derick goes into a coma! It's hard to find food, and there is a raging river. Read this novel, to learn what happens in the end. The River is about thirteen year old Brian Robeson who had to re-enact his survival in the Canadian woods, all over again. Derick is another character in the novel. They are dropped off at a lake where Brian refuses to bring a raft, or other survival gear. They find a shelter during a storm. Derick has his radio and he gets hit by lightning, which leaves him in a coma. Brian tries to use the radio to contact someone for help. The next day he builds a raft and Derick and Brian go down the river for some help. I did not like the book. I think Paulsen really didn't describe the setting much, only the shelter. Also the plot was boring and it was not suspenseful. It was kind of short and it ended abruptly. I would recommend that Paulsen develop the ending more."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The River is an exciting sequel to Hatchet. So if you want to read The River you better read Hatchet first. Otherwise you won't understand some parts of the story in The River. The story began with three instructors from the Navy Survival School suddenly knocked on Brian's door impatiently and asked him to survive in the woods again. They wanted him to train the navy to survive in the woods like what he did in &quot;HATCHET&quot;. This book is about the adventure Brian had with Derek, a team member of the Navy, and how they survived in a thunderstorm.This story is interesting but not that realistic. I doubt if any mother would let a child take the risk of going into the woods alone on purpose. In both Hatchet and The River Brian survived with luck. I think the author really wants his readers to learn that in any adverse environment, including in every daily life, the essential survival skills are intelligence, courage and strength."},{"Title":"The River","review":"I just loved this book! I was a great idea to make Brian go back like that. I loved that part. The best thing I like about your books is how descriptive you are. Like in Hatchet where Brian had to dive into the plane to get the survival pack and how he saw the dead pilot. How you described every detail is amazing."},{"Title":"The River","review":"This was a well-written and excellent story.

It starts off where the govrnment knocks on his door and askes for him. They want him to train the navy into what he survived in &quot;HATCHET&quot; This book is about the adventure he has with a team member of the navy and how they survive on a thunder storm. I think that you must read HATCHET before reading the River. Also, Hatchet was more sadder for me than the River."},{"Title":"The River","review":"It is a great book if you love the outdoors!!

See how he battles it out with suspence, courage, and trying to stay alive in Hatchet."},{"Title":"The River","review":"The book was ok. It wasn't the way I expected. I think the book should of been longer. Brian went on a raft and made it home safe, it was too short. I read Brian's winter thow and that is a excellent book, but Hatchet is the best of them all. I couldn't even put Hatchet down because it was so interesting, but The River on the other hand I could put it down because it was boring and you kind of knew what would happen if you read Hatchet."},{"Title":"The River","review":"I think this is a very good book by Paulsen.

But under a storm Brians companion Derek gets hit by the lightning and falls into a coma. Now Brian must save Derk by building a raft and travel down a river.The book is pretty slow, it's not until after about a hundred pages that their journey begins down the river.

Brian still has his trademark hatchet. The River is a great book. It is especially interesting for anyone who likes adventure and survival in the wilderness. I learned a lot about specific survival skills because I &quot;watched&quot; Brian do things such as making a bow and arrows to get food or to protect himself. I was amazed by his combination of luck and hard work and ingenuity.

The River is a book that has to do with survival; Brian Robeson was alone with Mother Nature itself for fifty-four days with a small hatchet from his mother. Luckily Brian overcame the wilderness and survived. The U.S Government has contacted Brian to help teach the military and astronauts to survive the way he did. The only problem is he has to go back and face the wilderness again like he did once before. Derek Holtzer a government psychologist will join Derek and take notes for survival skills during the trip.The Government provides Brian and Derek with equipment for the trip. Brain knowing his instincts and survival skills threw all the equipment away except for the radio for emergency uses. Derek agreeing with Brian is struck by lightning one night as well as the radio Brian was holding. Brian healthy and up the following morning is troubled when he finds Derek in a coma and doesn't know what to do since the radio fried up during the storm. Brian doesn't have his hatchet beside him now, he's alone and he has to find help fast.Hatchet one of the greatest books of all time has found a rival in my opinion. The River being adventurous and also being the sequel of Hatchet has had many controversies between my sister and me. I believe this book is on my top five greatest books ever read for me because the book delivers tips and strategies for surviving in the wild while keeping a story line thorough to make it interesting. My emotions were highly remarkable; I would go from relaxing and taking time off to read a book to reading vigorously without missing a single word. I give this book 5 out of 5 stars because the suspense of the book is so deep and intense you fall in to the book and feel as if you're experiencing every moment with Brian and Derek.

The River is about a teenager named Brian who has to go back to the wilderness.

He is about 15 years old, and is just getting used to being home after being stranded in the Canadian Wilderness Area. Three men come to his home and ask him to do it again. He decides he will do it to save peoples lives. One man, Derrick, who is with the wilderness survival center, goes with him to the wilderness. The plane leaves and the two only have a radio to call if there is trouble. Trouble comes in the form of lightning, and strands Brian with Derrick in a coma, and the radio is dead. He decides the river is his only hope to civilization...The book overall was good, but There were one or two things I didn't like, such as Gary Paulsen doesn't explain the camping site very well. He just says that it has a fort, and a fire pit, and the usual camping site stuff. He should have described into detail the fort, and the fire pit, and all the rest of it. Another thing I didn't like was the fact that he introduced the two problems at once. It isn't very realistic that Derrick was holding the radio during his sleep, and the lightning bolt just happened to hit right as the two were sleeping. One thing I did like was the non stop action the whole time after the introduction of the problem. Brian is constantly chasing a raft, or pulling on the raft. I really liked the action of this book.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes wilderness survival, or action books, or who just like to try to figure out how to overcome a problem.

He got evreything till he got there. They didn't let him take it because they said it would be too much like a camping trip. All they let him take was a walkie talkie.I think Brian is smart because he found fire rocks to start the fire with, but Derek is pretty dumd because he said I have to take notes on how you work.

He is responsible for another person who has been struck by lightening and is in a coma. There is less focus on how painful and consuming hunger can be. More focus on making critical decisions. How to get the injured man back to civilization, building a raft, learning how to navigate on the river. There are periods where Brian is exhausted because he is trying to get to the trading post as fast as possible. He falls asleep, dreams and hallucinates for portions of this excursion. Still a good story. We will look for the next one in this series."},{"Title":"The River","review":"After reading Hatchet with my class this year, they showed a great interest in learning more about the character of Brian Robeson. This prompted me to read The River with my class as well. Gary Paulsen does an excellent job sharing the trials and triumphs Brian encounters when he is asked to go back to the wilderness to show government psychologist Derek Holtzer how he survived. Brian is convinced of two things: going back in the wilderness is insane and he has no choice about going back in the wilderness if it may help someone else in the future.Once they arrive, Brian feels that this time everything is too staged and too perfect until Derek ends up being struck by lightening which results in him being in a coma. Brian now has to think on his feet not only for his survival, but for that of Derek's as well. Paulsen captures the reader with his story and details and makes you feel like you are right along side Brian in his quest to survive!The character of Brian Robeson is one that middle school students can identify with and the lessons Brian learns and teaches the readers throughout his stories are timeless."},{"Title":"The River","review":"This is the follow up to Hatchet and has new adventures for Brian to work through.

It needs to move faster for me?"},{"Title":"Technological Bluff","review":"This is a pretty good book for Ellul, with a few of his most common failings. I'll start with those. Written much later in his life (mid-1980s I believe) Ellul is much older, and discernably more crotchety. He complains of \\"music that is just noise\\" and that \\"kids wear their stupid headphones too much!\\" So sometimes the eloquence of his discourse is interrupted by personal opinion, and here it really hurts some very fine threads he weaves. I am always amazed at how Ellul can start to think on one thing that everyone knows about, describe it, pick at it for a while: then assess it in a startlingly objective way. To me it always comes off not as superhuman intelligence, but as a very passionate desire for understanding. Uh oh, I haven't finished complaining and I got myself all turned around.Anyway, the other problem is that you won't understand a lot of the examples he uses if you're not French. I don't know what Minitel is, and I have no insight/longing for insight on the French Government's various boards and committees. I just want those good world-encompassing ideas. Of which there are many here, but it takes patience through some of the more obscure stuff.Books that should DEFINITELY come before this in your readings:Technological SocietyPropaganda(after those) Conversations with Patrick Troude-ChastenetFinally, a thing that might prove good about this book (if you think so): in it Ellul disavows some of his earlier ideas. I have used it as somewhat of a guide for what not to read, since this book from his later life has statements like \\"In the Political Illusion, I was totally wrong when I said...\\" and so forth. Was he wrong? If he thinks so, then maybe it's not worth studying... but that's up to you!"},{"Title":"A Strange Death: A Story Originating in Espionage, Betrayal, and Vengeance in a Village in Old Palestine","review":"This book was a huge disappointment to me. Like many other Israelis I grew up with the story of \\"Nili\\" (there was a wonderful children's book about the secret organization that we all were assigned to read at school in the seventies). When I heard that a new book had been published about Nili, one that promised to uncover mysteries about the organization, I ran to order it.What a flop. This book reads like a combination of a not-funny \\"Toujours Provence\\" and a very confusing \\"A Thousand and One Nights.\\"The book is divided between two subjects. On the one hand, are the author's memories of his life in Zichron in the seventies. The memories are neither interesting nor illustrative. I've been to Zichron a number of times and yet I had a hard time garnering any kind of mental image of the place based on Halkin's book. It's just a collection of disjointed impressions with very little meat and no connecting threads.More irritating are the significant sections of the book devoted to Nili. In the first place, there are a lot of people mentioned; and it's like a shtetl story - \\"the aunt of the sister of the brother-in-law\\" - practically impossible to wade through the people mentioned without a card index. A couple of genealogical tables would have been hugely helpful.Second, the many anecdotes do not really connect to each other. Some are pertinent to the story and some aren't. I knew the history of the case pretty well before starting the book and I had the hardest time \\"connecting the dots.\\" The author doesn't really resolve any important mysteries, in my opinion--he just confused the hapless reader. I cannot imagine being able to make any sense of the situation had I not already known so much about the case. Halkin never really takes on the main characters in the Nili story. They remain shadowed behind mountains of meaningless gossip. So many important questions could have been debated at length and are never really touched. I did not leave the book with a better understanding of the period or the characters involved.The bottom line is that I am uncertain what the author really wanted to tell us in this book and I have the feeling that he is just as confused. It's not a finished book and not an edited book. It's also not a book you should buy."},{"Title":"A Strange Death: A Story Originating in Espionage, Betrayal, and Vengeance in a Village in Old Palestine","review":"This story is not about the rhetorical question stated in the title as it would relate to a person, but is more as it relates to a time and era. The town of Zichron Ya'acov (memory of jacob) was named for Edmond de Rothschild who wanted to help settle pre-WWI Palestine with jewish farmers from Eastern Europe. They would grow their own food and be self-sufficient towns, but land would be personal property and not communal (like on a kibbutz).During WWI a group of settlers in the town decided to help the British in the fight against the Turkish (Ottoman) Empire. They were known as NILI and are very much a part of Israeli history and lore, as Nathan Hale is to americans. The mystery of the story is that of four woman who celebrated when the NILI were taken by the Turks, they all had strange deaths, and maybe more than one of them was murdered.Halkin's tale is more about the birth of Israel and the trials and deaths suffered under both the Turks and the British Mandate. It relates, on a first person basis, how Jews and Arabs viewed each other prior to WWII and how tensions grew as more and more Jews poored into Palestine in the 1930s. Lastly the story is about how little towns like Zichron have been turned into tourist meccas that have no relationship to the original towns. They're like 42nd Street after it's been cleaned up by Disney."},{"Title":"A Strange Death: A Story Originating in Espionage, Betrayal, and Vengeance in a Village in Old Palestine","review":"I have to start off by saying that I live near Zichron so it was interesting reading about the places that I see all the time. I also enjoyed the structure of the book in that it skipped between the present and the past. Technically, Halkin is an excellent writer as shown by his many translations of leading Israeli authors from Hebrew to English."},{"Title":"A Strange Death: A Story Originating in Espionage, Betrayal, and Vengeance in a Village in Old Palestine","review":"An interesting book. And from the author...Jun. 23, 2005 13:19Essay: Why bother writing books? (JERUSALEM POST)By HILLEL HALKINI've just come back from a book tour in America. It's called a \\"book tour,\\" it turns out, because of all the airplane flights and hotel rooms that have to be booked for it.Not that it didn't have its moments. In a Barnes & Noble's in Manhattan I read from a new book of mine for a turnout that filled every seat. A big part of my audience was rounded up for the occasion by my 91-year-old mother-in-law, who was proud of the poster with her son-in-law's picture in the window.Before I had left at the evening's end this had already been removed, in confirmation of Andy Warhol's well-known prediction that in the future everyone will be famous for at least 15 minutes.Elsewhere, the crowds were not as large. In Chicago, where I was scheduled at a university bookstore in the middle of final exam week, I appeared before an audience of 10, which included a cousin of my wife's, an old high-school friend, and the store's manager. Two people bought books - a reasonable percentage that almost covered the taxi fares.And then there was the night I arrived at my New York hotel after a grueling flight from Los Angeles. At the front desk was a note from my publishing house. I had half-an-hour, it said, to get to a broadcasting studio where I had been slotted into a Jewish talk show. I rushed, sweaty and unshaven, to the address given me, where I found myself in a recording studio in a West Side apartment, in the room next to which two little children lay fast asleep on the floor. My host, the father of five such progeny, informed me that on a good night he had half-a-million listeners.After we had chatted over the air about my book, he took telephone calls. The one caller to pick up the phone was someone anxious to know my opinion on disengagement.Before I returned to Israel we held a post-mortem at the publisher's.\\"You know,\\" I said, \\"this was pointless. We wasted my time and your money. What did we do this for?\\"My publicist looked at my editor. My editor looked at my publicist. I had the impression that no author had ever asked them such a question before.\\"We didn't want to disappoint you,\\" my editor said.SO now I knew: Book tours are designed for authors who love flying from city to city to entertain small groups of people who have been unable to obtain theater tickets or bridge club invitations for the evening. It would be cruel to disappoint them.What's for sure is that low-budget book tours don't sell books. But then, what does? Not good reviews. (I can vouch for that, because my books have had plenty of them.) Not the Internet either, which is useful for buying books that you've already heard about, but not for discovering ones you haven't.And certainly not bookstores, 80% of which belong to big chains that wouldn't display a new book prominently, even if it were a lost volume of the Bible, without a sizable payment from its publisher. In the absence of such kickbacks, the most a book can hope for is to stand on a shelf with hundreds of others, its pinched spine facing outward like a condemned man before the firing squad.What sells books is money. Lots of it. The more a publishing house spends on promotion, the more it stands to make in return. The problem is that there's an element of risk involved, and nowadays, when editors and their bosses are hired and fired by the managers of the conglomerates they work for as quickly as baseball managers by major-league owners, risks are not something that many of them want to take.It works like this. Suppose Arnold Hopeful has written a novel and gotten a modest $25,000 advance for it. Suppose, too, that it's judged to be good but no blockbuster, and that Hopeful's publisher, Doomed Books, might sell 20,000 copies and earn $250,000 if it put $50,000 into promotion. But then again, it might not - and if it doesn't its directors know that at the end of the year an accountant from General Business or Amalgamated Investments is going to come around and demand to know why $50,000 were thrown away on a bummer.This accountant, who may never have read a book in his life, will be less interested in Hopeful's literary talents than in the editor-in-chief of Doomed Books' scalp - which is why said editor will let Hopeful's novel fend for itself while relying on reviews and word-of-mouth to sell the 2,500 copies needed to recoup the initial investment. Better to break even and be asked no questions than to try to make money and jeopardize one's job.ON THE other hand, suppose Doomed Books has gone and paid a $500,000 advance to the young superstar Nathan Flashpan, who has submitted a manuscript no better than Hopeful's. If our editor-in-chief wishes to avoid the ax, he may pour a million dollars into publicizing Flashpan's book in the hope of selling 100,000 copies and earning the advance back. In this sense, most publishing today is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If a publisher feels a book must do well and spends accordingly, it probably will do well. If not, its prospects are slim.The overwhelming majority of books published are the second kind. They face, if not the firing squad, Siberia. The same abundantly stocked stores such as Borders or Barnes & Noble's that seem so wonderfully inviting to book buyers are depressingly grim places for authors. Over 600 volumes are reputedly published in America every day, most of which never make it into the bookstores at all, but even those that do are up against hopeless odds. If they're not lucky enough to be displayed in the windows or on the front tables they have about as much chance of being picked out for adoption as a stray dog at the pound.Why anyone continues to write books at all under such conditions is a good question. Presumably, it's just a habit we can't break. Indeed, it might be best at this point to declare a 100-year moratorium on all book writing so that readers can be given the opportunity to catch up with what's already on the shelves.Meanwhile, I beg you all to buy my new book. It's .The remainder of this sentence has been deleted by the editors of this newspaper, to whom Mr. Halkin did not pay a kickback."},{"Title":"Woman's mysteries, ancient and modern;: A psychological interpretation of the feminine principle as portrayed in myth, story, and dreams","review":"Admittedly the map is not the territory, but one does need a map first, and Harding's classic book fills that need very well.

The original version of &quot;Inside MAD&quot; was released in 1955 and followed &quot;The MAD Reader&quot; and &quot;MAD Strikes Back!&quot; All of these volumes featured reformatted material that originally appeared in the twenty-three issue run of the &quot;MAD&quot; comic book (are you old enough to remember when &quot;MAD&quot; was a color comic book rather than a black &amp; white magazine?). The material was originally written by &quot;MAD&quot; creator Harvey Kurtzman and featured the core group of early &quot;MAD&quot; artists that included Wally Wood, Jack Davis, and Bill Elder. Continuing the practice of having well-known personalities contribute introductions to the &quot;MAD&quot; books (Bob and Ray did the foreward for &quot;MAD Strikes Back!&quot;), comedian Stan Freberg was enlisted to write something similar and came up with a backward (which appears, of course, at the end of the volume).Among the classic &quot;MAD&quot; parodies reproduced in this volume are &quot;Mickey Rodent,&quot; &quot;Howdy Dooit,&quot; &quot;Smilin' Melvin,&quot; &quot;Mark Trade,&quot; &quot;The Katchandhammer Kids,&quot; &quot;Bat Boy and Rubin,&quot; and &quot;Shermlock Shomes&quot; (figure out how old you are by your ability to figure out what these are parodies off just from the titles). Throughout the book there are ad parodies of &quot;Canadian Specific,&quot; &quot;Puntiac,&quot; and &quot;Beer Belongs,&quot; along with parts of the &quot;Puzzle Page.&quot; Be aware that not all of the original material is reproduced faithfully here: &quot;Slow Motion!&quot; originally appeared in a much longer form in &quot;MAD&quot; #21 and now has a different opening pattern. Of course, if you have a chance to check out these \\"MAD\\" comics in one of the full-page color reproductions, that would be the preferred avenue of appreciation.

After two days of not being able to put the book down, I feel this incredible urge to tell everyone I know about it. A coworker saw me reading it in the employee lounge, and asked if it was &quot;too manly&quot; for such a spiritually enlightened woman such as herself. Quite the opposite, in fact! &quot;Channeling Biker Bob&quot; shows an inspirational balance of male and female relationship, through colorful imagery and a gripping plot. Colyer's use of everyday issues such as doing dishes, mowing the lawn, and taking care of children creates a powerful setting for a revolution in the way we own our anger, and express ourselves with total honesty in our relationships.Yes, there are some minor editing mistakes, and the typeface is at times difficult to deal with, but the content comes through strongly enough that I can overlook these flaws.I am inspired to share this book with my girlfriends who complain of not being excited by their wonderfully gentle and caring male companions, with all those &quot;nice guys&quot; I dated over the years and had to break up with because they apologized too often and it drove me crazy, with all those powerful men who are already in touch with that wild, dangerous side of themselves but who would do well to understand the way that affects the women they know, and especially with my father, who taught me the silent treatment all too well.Cheers to Nik Colyer for writing such a fine book! I look forward to reading more from him, and especially Biker Bob."},{"Title":"Channeling Biker Bob: Heart of a Warrior","review":"This is one of the few books that explores masculine reality with compassion and understanding without resorting to criticizing women. Rather it seeks to bridge the gap between men and women, honoring the differing approaches to life that men and women have and seeing that both are complements in the grand scheme of humanity. More than that, it points the way for men to take pride in being men - to show that masculine energy is strong and vital and needed in the world. It deals with the warrior/protector archetype, why women need men to be men, and why men need to be men, and male drive and anger and why this is frightening to women. And it does it all in the context of a good story. A good read, hard to put down."},{"Title":"Channeling Biker Bob: Heart of a Warrior","review":"Have just read Channeling Biker Bob and couldn't put it down. Here Nik Colyer has hit the nail right on the head when it comes to men reclaiming their maleness. I have encountered many a Stewart Chance along life's way. It is frustrating and infuriating when men will not commit or stand up for how they feel or even tell you what it is they are thinking. This book covers the whole gamit of emotions that can be evoked as a result of holding back. Every man [and woman] who cares about their relationship with their partner, should read this book. Women will understand their men better as a result and men will understand what drives women crazy when they clam up and give them the silent treatment or just cop out and be a whimp by not saying what it is that's bothering them. The bonus is - the author cleverly weaves a great story into the subject. One can easily adapt to their own situation. Nik Colyer further adds to the book by keeping the reader on the edge, craving more, never knowing what's around the next corner. A very exciting read, great suspense, a great laugh at times and a great job of putting men/women relationships back into the proper perspective. Anyone who identifies with bikers/bikes will really appreciate this book!"},{"Title":"Channeling Biker Bob: Heart of a Warrior","review":"This novel is the &quot;first part of a four part series,&quot; it says on the title page, and is all about a California man, Stewart Chance, who is dominated by his shrewish wife, Renee, who has lost all respect for him because he has turned into a wimp. She thinks he is a wimp because he does all the chores around the house without grumbling--washes the dishes, feeds the kids, makes the beds, does the laundry--while she curses at him and dashes off to work. He works also, as a computer nerd. In the office, a tyrannical boss dominates him. He never swears, and apologizes for everything, including things that are not his fault. Even his two teenaged kids lack respect for him, and yet expect him to intervene in their squabbles. He is a responsible wimp.Then, he has a dream about bikers and a character named Bob, and things begin to change for him. Harley Davidson motorcycles enjoy a dominant place in the story, which I was happy to see. I used to own a 1946 kick-start &quot;Hawg&quot; with a suicide clutch and a tank shift. Sometimes I wish I still had it, old as I am.The story is well written, and the plot is interesting. It is reminiscent of Ayn Rand's &quot;Fountainhead,&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; in that the author has an agenda which in some instances dominates the story with long passages dedicated to his philosophy, which is all about the war of the sexes, the feminization of American society--or, if you will, the emasculation of American men by the feminist movement. The author spends a lot of time and dialogue explicating and defending his hypothesis that some men are just &quot;too nice,&quot; and that they need to find their &quot;inner warrior&quot; and defend themselves against harpy wives.For my part, I see the situation in more simplistic terms. I think that there are naturally predators and victims in both sexes--carnivores and grazers, warriors and farmers--and to try to change a grazer into a warrior by sending him into the woods to scream and vent his rage or join a support group of similarly afflicted males, is probably an exercise in futility. When a wimpy male marries a controlling female, both get what they deserve. But this is Colyer's book, not mine.The story is also evocative of Carlos Castaneda's Don Juan series, with its reliance on supernatural events and personalities. And, like both Castaneda and Rand, Colyer seems to have attracted an enthusiastic group of admirers who identify strongly with his hypothesis.My only real criticism of the book is that it needed a better job of editing, designing and marketing. In other words, the publisher has failed in his main obligations. In the editing, words are repeatedly obviously missing. Misspellings are few, but like many small publishers today, the end product shows lack of attention to detail. In design, the typeface chosen for the text is a sans serif, which is always a poor choice for long body copy. A Roman typeface is demonstrably much better for readability. And in the marketing department, the book's sales rank tells the whole story--although the book is just out, and that could change. I hope it does. It is well written, and deserves to sell well.Joseph H.

The 1970's was perhaps the most eclectic and trendy decade in American history with a new fad coming along every few months to capture the imagination of Americans. Archie comics marched right along in time to all the changes the 1970's brought from protests to disco. This volume collects 17 Archie stories that will make readers year for the days of pet rocks and CB radios. Shirley Jones, Mrs. Partridge herself introduces this volume.In \\"Protest\\" from 1970, Archie is on the warpath and wants to get a sit-in protest staged with the rest of the gang. The only trouble is that Archie can't seem to find a cause to protest but merely wants to protest because the rest of the country is. Too bad for Arch that everyone if Riverdale seems relatively happy.\\"Bubble Trouble\\" features \\"The Archies\\" band in action. You can almost hear them singing \\"Sugar Sugar\\". When an editor of a music magazine calls their music \\"bubblegum music\\" Archie is not happy and goes to see the editor to voice his displeasure. You wonder how much fun the writer had with this story since the Archies WERE about as bubblegum as you could get.In \\"No Fuel like and old Fuel\\" the gang finds themselves paralyzed by the energy crisis of the mid-1970's. When Archie cannot get any gas to take Betty & Veronica on a picnic, he and Jughead cleverly make do by attaching a sail from Mr. Lodge's boat to sail to the park. But what happens when it's time to leave and there is no wind?\\"You Came a Long Way Baby\\" finds Archie, or rather Betty and Veronica tackling the subject of Women's liberation in this tale from 1975. Of all people, Miss, I mean Ms. Grundy leads the way!In \\"Bi-centennial Banter\\" the boys are working on their Bi-Centennial pageant when the girls, who had been excluded from the festivities, strongly display how many women played important roles in the fight for independence as well.\\"Over and Out\\" highlights one of the great fads of the 1970's the CB radio craze. We all remember that don't we? Arch and Veronica are staying in touch with oh-so-cute little handle names, not knowing that everyone is listening into their conversations.\\"Video Vexation\\" features another great fad and one that has actually survived and grown to this very day...the video game fad. The boys are so into playing \\"Pong\\" that they begin to lose interest in the girls...until the girls turn out to be better players...\\"Costume Caper\\" Pop culture comes home full tilt. While not mentioning it by name, a costume party features several people dressed in Star Wars costumes. Arch wins when he accidentally dresses up as \\"C3PO\\"As with the other Archie Americana books there are also cover galleries featuring some of the classic covers from the 1970's. If you lived during this era like I did, you'll be certain to get a lot of laughs at looking back at some of the ridiculous fads and fashions of the wonderful decade of the 1970's.Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series : Best of the Seventies","review":"The 'Archie Americana' series continues on with this book highlighting the best stories from the 1970's. This book seems to take an intersting focus featuring stories with a heavy 1970's specific pop-culture bent that gives this book an almost time-capsule'ish feel capturing the trends/fashions/slang and even politics of this most colorful of contemporary decades. For example, we get references to 'Star Wars,' in an amusing Halloween costume contest story, disco dancing (of course) and even a delightfully quaint story on the rising popularity of videogaming (Pong) and a bit of gender wars as the girls attempt to unseat the boys from the throne of videogame dominance. While this book may seem different in that the general storylines seem to deviate from the standard Archie-esque plotlines (love triangles, archie-reggie rivalry, etc.) it's interesting to note a shift in tone as this comic series attempts to keep intact a teen audience shifting their attentions away from comics to more electronic forms of entertainment media."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series : Best of the Seventies","review":"Reading comic bookss was my faavorite way to pass the time when I grew up in the Seventies,,and byy far myyy favorite was Archie...Star Wars!Disco!The Bicentenniiall!The Fonnz!!See Archie annd his friiennds deal with theese and manyy other seventies iconns!See howw Betty annd Archie get townnspeople to take pride in Riverdale in\\"\\"\\"Loyyyalville,USA..Laughh until you cryy at \\"\\"The Late Archie Andrews!The memmories willl get so thick you'lll hawant to read the stories over and over again!I know I Have!YYou'll see comic book covers from that greeatt decade...An absoolute must for the Archie faann,the book is printed on stiff,high=qualityyy paper that will outlast anycomic book!Thhee ccolorsss seemm a lot more vibrant thannn theyy did in the comis...Tis is aannn excellent wayyy to preserve the memmoriies!"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series : Best of the Seventies","review":"It's another wholesome dose of all-American Archiemania... This is another excellent entry in the decade-based \\"Archie Americana\\" series, reprinting a big batch of classic stories featuring Mr. Andrews and his pals in Riverdale. In terms of content, this book is one of the most steeped in popular cultural references -- social protests, pet rocks, disco, CB radios, Star Wars, Pong and numerous other 'Seventies milestones are fondly remembered in a gauzy cartoon haze. It's a groovy look back, packed with references that may puzzle young'uns, but will delight those who lived through it all. The downside is that in the rush to document all the fads of the era, the book barely has time to feature any of the typical \\"Archie\\" themes, such as the Betty-Archie-Veronica love triangle, Jughead's food mania or Big Moose's jealous protection of Midge, his girlfriend.Hopefully, following the lead of the '40s and '50s editions, they'll find room for a Volume Two of this decade, and can select a few non-topical tales, pick out the best stories they can find and just linger on the artwork and storytelling, which were still pretty good at the time. In the meantime, \\"Archie\\" fans will delight in this book, and will be eager and hungry for more.

No one ever said this would be easy, and I am by no means equipped to do it properly even yet. Let me be honest: Christianity seems unalterably silly to me, the more so as I read more about it. The only thing that seems likely to rescue it for me, as an intellectual pursuit, is if I read some modern thinkers who were born into the Western scientific inheritance after the Protestant Reformation had a chance to shake itself out, and who completely absorb those teachings into their religious writings. I have a couple pointers to works that might fit this bill (The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza and The Philosophy of Spinoza), but in the meantime I can't help reading all of this with a smirk.McGiffert does his very best to treat these great thinkers seriously and concisely. We move briskly from the medival background to the Reformation -- namely Augustine -- through Luther and Calvin and Zwingli and Luther's student Philip Melanchthon. From there we get all manner of new Christians: we get Anabaptists and Socinians, Puritans and Pietists and evangelicals. They loathed each other. They viewed Christ differently. They viewed the relation between civil and spiritual government differently. Some took the Bible more literaly, some more symbolically. Some -- most -- of them viewed man as bottomlessly depraved, salvageable only by divine intervention. One sect's optimism forced its opponents to adopt an even more reactionary position. And so the whole mess spun out of control. (Well, that's one way to frame it. Another way is that the ambiguities in the Bible and in the life of Jesus, combined with new print technologies and wider literacy, led naturally to a flowering of divergent ideas. This is the kind of flowering where people kill one another. Death flowers.)One outcome of all of this was Rationalism -- making peace with the scientific and mathematical changes being wrought all around them and trying to justify Christianity on the basis of objectively obvious axioms. These didn't work out. One proof (described on p. 227) is based on the rightness of Christian ethics: since the outcome of Christianity is right living, clearly Christianity is right and true. Naturally one has to then argue that no other system of ethics could possibly produce right outcomes. The only way one can really cling to such a belief is by ignoring the non-Christian world altogether. This the British, among others, did.Maybe Christianity is totally incompatible with argument. This would conflict with a few hundred years during which Christians did feverishly try to make their religion mesh with reason, but why not? Late in the game, then, we get books with titles like Dodwell's: Christianity Not Founded on Argument: And the True Principle of Gospel-Evidence Assigned, counseling us that \\"Religion will not admit of the least alliance with reason,\\" that \\"The only power to bring us to religious faith is the Holy Spirit,\\" and that we should \\"trust ... in the Lord with all [our] heart[s], and lean not unto [our] own understanding.\\" This has a certain kind of honesty, but it sounds suspiciously like the terrified ravings of someone who's been backed into a corner: not only is he not scared, he's happy to be in the corner. He cannot explain why standards of argument that apply everywhere else do not apply to his own favored religion, so he pretends that he's not obliged to argue.Protestant Thought Before Kant is sort of the dual of Diarmaid MacCulloch's sweeping epic, \\"The Reformation.\\" Where MacCulloch was expansive and detailed, McGiffert is tightly focused and content to paint arcs. Where MacCulloch methodically covers the history with only enough theology to fill in some gaping holes, McGiffert's book is a little gem of theology with virtually no history surrounding it. The Thirty Years' War merits only a peep from McGiffert, whereas the first half or two-thirds of MacCulloch's book teased us toward the War's final convulsion.McGiffert could use more history; its absence means that he has to fall back to metaphysical handwaving. He tells us that liberalism, with its new feelings of optimism about man's place in the world and his ultimate redemption, emerged from some vague \\"modern spirit\\" (p. 176) or \\"general spirit of the modern age\\" (p. 187). As someone who respects historical materialism of the Guns, Germs, and Steel vein, this just won't do. But I can't blame McGiffert for cutting out almost all history: he wanted to pack all of Reformation theology into a couple hundred pages. I'll cut the guy some slack."},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"what more can be said, other than that this book iscaptivating!"},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"A magnificently written, evocative description of one of baseball's greatest games."},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"This is the only baseball book that I have read in every decade of my life, from the first. I'm 54, and I first read this book in 1959, with awe and rapture. It captures the flavor and the intensity of the experience of baseball before television as no other pages do and, as it happens, it tells the story of one of the transcendent moments of real baseball history. When Willie Mays was given an honorary degree at Yale this year, they specifically cited &quot;the catch&quot; fifty years ago as his most distinct single moment of on-field performance, for all that he was never less than a captivating performer. Hano's book is one to read and reread, with ever-renewed pleasure."},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"This book captures what it is to be a fan better than anything else I've ever read. I often read this book in the Spring, to cleanse my mental palate of a long dreary Winter of football, basketball, the off-season noise of player contracts, and all else that is life without baseball actually on the field and in the stands. This book always does the trick. I once lost my copy (probably loaned it to someone who never returned it) and had to live without it for years until I found another used copy. Those were hard times. Now it's readily available and I can give it as a gift. Glory, glory, glory!I know, this doesn't actually tell you about the book, but I'm too thrilled to bother with all that now. Just get it.

My ONLY disappointment with the book is that it ends so abruptly. The last out is made. He looks around for the lady in the red hat. She's gone and he mentions the fact that he never got a look at the face of the Cleveland fan and basically, that's it. Book over. I was hoping he would end the book with his getting home and speaking to his wife about the game, the way the book opened.My other disappointment was in the afterword. I was pleasantly surprised that Mr. Hano is still living. He ran down the list of where are they now from the '54 Giants, which I enjoyed. I kept waiting for any other recollections he might have had about that game, the way baseball was then compared to now, etc. And I was also hoping he would mention what happened to his wife; if she's still living or not.

This book, like Daniel Okrent's Nine Innings (which came decades later), makes you feel as if you are there, in the seats, watching the game. Hano's book is much simpler and in some ways more enjoyable than Okrent's, because Hano is there as a fan, whereas Okrent is there as an observer. Hano is a very good writer, and that is no little part of enjoying this book: the observations, words, and phrases come at the reader as smoothly as a fastball. Hano also understands baseball and relays that understanding to the reader in the most casual yet most exciting ways. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"After Willie's unbelievable catch, I was born over a decade later. As a result, I never visited the Polo Grounds.

After I read the book, I was able to contact Arnold. I wanted to interview him. I thought he would be too busy for me. He returned my call promptly! A week later, he agreed to do an interview. I was thrilled, I didn't want to go to sleep that night! I never performed an official interview before. This would be with an old-time baseball fan in NYC! One friday afternoon, we discussed the book in detail. Yes, we talked about Willie's catch, however, he emphasized to me he wrote the book as a fan. We discussed minute details such as: conversations with his wife the night before, bleacher fans in the Polo Grounds, Giant reserve player Joey Amalfitano taking batting practice swings that day, Dusty Rhodes pitch-hit HR to win the game, the Indian players during batting practice, intricacies of the Polo Grounds, the state of the game today, and his memories growing up with 3 ballclubs in the same city.Speaking of living in the moment, Arnold was a pleasure to speak with.This is not just another baseball book written in the 50's!

An incredible baseball book written from a fan's perspective that not only covers the details of the game, but also the emotions that go along with it."},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"\\"A Day in the Bleachers\\" is a richly detailed account of the First Game of the 1954 World Series twixt the New York Giants and Cleveland Indians. The game was played on September 28th at the hallowed Polo Grounds on 155th Street and Eight Avenue in New York on the Manhattan side of the Harlem River. Yankee Stadium and the Bronx were on the other shore. (When this reviewer was in the 6th grade, a helpful ball park cop explained the local geography to him).To state that ADB is \\"detailed\\" is a substantial understatement. Author Hano's account is virtually encyclopedic. He must have had a photographic memory. There was no room in the crowded bleachers to take voluminous notes and if one spends too much time taking notes, there is no time to watch the game! And intently watch Hano did. Following are selected subjects of his poignant observations and descriptions:> The pre game ticket line as hopeful fans patiently cue up to purchase bleacher seats. > The team pennants flying atop the old ball yard. (In those days, both Al and NL flags were arrayed according to league standings). > The \\"whooshing\\" sound the Giants fans made if the Indians failed to score in the top of an inning. > An aging Bob Feller-at the end of his Indians' career-painfully doing pre-game pushups. > Giants third sacker Hank Thompson snagging a Jim Hegan bounder and nipping the Indians catcher at first base.There is more: Hano artfully describes the variances in swings by Giants right fielder Don Mueller: \\"Mandrake the Magician\\" had a short wrist snap swing and one with arms fully extended. We are mindfully informed that Giants shortstop Al Dark saved the game by keeping a ground ball to deep shortstop from rolling to the outfield. The Indians Larry Doby never scored what would have been the winning run. How many noticed? Hano even turns the purchase of a beer can into a nice vignette.This reviewer cannot resist carping at some factual glitches: No one called the Cardinals veteran second sacker by his given name, \\"Al\\". It was always \\"Red\\" Schoendienst! The hero of Game 1, the late James Lamar \\"Dusty\\" Rhodes of Matthews, Alabama actually played with the Giants in San Francisco for 54 games in 1959. He was not \\"left behind\\", though he was optioned to the minors (Phoenix or Tucson) in 1958. And the author is way off base in inaccurately dragging in General George Patton's famous rain prayer during the Battle of the Bulge. That story had no place in the text.Should ADB be reprinted, it would be nice to update the lives of a few more of the players on either team. And a Box Score would be a fitting augmentation.The bottom line is that \\"A Day in the Bleachers\\" is a wonderful baseball treat. For fans \\"of a certain age\\", such as this reviewer's, is it virtually required reading. It contains far more tidbits and morsels than described here. It is fun to read and only a churl would object to the occasional digressions and over-analyses. They simply are not making any more stories like this. Sadly, writers who remember the golden age of baseball as described herein are fading from the scene. Let's enjoy while we still can.On the subject of tidbits and morsels, the author includes this one from those halcyon days:\\"Say Hey Willie; Say Hey Willie Mays;Say Hey Willie; How do you make them plays?Say Hey Willie; Runnin' outta your hat;Say Hey Willie; Whatcha mean by that\\"?"},{"Title":"A day in the bleachers","review":"I read this as a kid and twice as an adult, now in my 50s.Wonderful simple reporting and writing approach, brings back the era when going to the park was the greatest pleasure.Curiously, his description of Willie Mays taking fielding practice is as dramatic and timeless as his description of The Catch....Tremendous book..."},{"Title":"Prim, Proper...Pregnant (Harlequin Romance)","review":"My husband and I, parents of twin girls, had a good laugh over this bookAs soon as the auto crash happened and it was revealed that one of the twin brothers died and the other one had amnesia, I thought, \\"Oh, no, she won't go there\\". But she did. The \\"twist\\" in this book could be seen within the first few pages.It's obvious the author did no research at all on identical twins. She thinks that their DNA is \\"damn near the same\\". Anyone who has had high school biology knows that the DNA of monozygotic twins is EXACTLY the same! And the error cannot be attributed to advances in scientific knowledge since the book was written in 2002 as it was common knowledge at that time.But, despite their absolutely identical DNA, there are many, many differences in appearance, not just personality. Their voices can be different, the shapes of their faces, noses, texture of hair, etc. There are ALWAYS differences, sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle. Quite often one twin is smaller than the other. And the older a twin gets, the more he/she looks different from the other twin due to environmental factors. Strangers and acquaintances may have trouble telling them apart, but those who love them ALWAYS know who is who as soon as they see them or hear them. To suggest that a mother wouldn't know her own child, but a business partner WOULD recognize him is absolutely ludicrous.The writing wasn't bad -- perhaps this author has gotten better in the last 12 years at planning her plots and researching for her books.."},{"Title":"Prim, Proper...Pregnant (Harlequin Romance)","review":"I enjoyed this story a lot-the plot is different from the run-of-the -mill romance; the characters were believable and endearing, and the ending was satisfying.

The family in the novel mirrors many a family I knew as a kid-the cold, reserved world of \\"proper\\" Catholicism where what the neighbors might think was often the arbiter of taste and behavior above all other considerations, the lack of emotional engagement, and so on came through as real and genuine attributes to a specific way of life many will know. And Shea does a good job effectively presenting the spiritual and emotional anguish and pain such a prim, proper, straight-laced existence can engender among its inhabitants.So, there is a lot to like about this book. However, I felt a bit disappointed with the book in the end. I think the failure to name and identify the narrator as a person was a mistake as I never had a real sense of her as a complete person and, frankly, felt a bit of the cold detachment towards her that her parents and so much of her family was depicted as displaying. Which is not the way it ought to be. One wants to embrace and fully empathize with this poor woman, but that isn't quite possible. And that's too bad, for, in the end, this error of execution leaves the reader with a sort of cognitive and emotional dissonance that obscures the enjoyment of the novel to a significant degree.But, that's just me. I can see from previous reviews that such is not the case for many readers, and maybe I'm the exception. However, quite a few folks have dissed the book and I think they may have very well felt as I do-it's hard to really like a book where you can't feel a real connection to the main protagonist-especially when you year for that connection.But that's still clearly a minority viewpoint. I think most readers will in the end like the book quite a lot."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"I didn't dislike this book, but it did not rank among the best books I have ever read. I can certainly relate to the Catholic themes, and much of the book was humerous. However, it really didn't have the &quot;moving&quot; qualities that I was expecting and hoping for. It worked for me as a book to pass the time and to get some laughs here and there. I felt for the characters, but at the same time I really wished that they would just make up their minds about life. So, if you are looking for an enjoyable book to read in your spare time, go for this. If you're looking to read the worlds greatest novel, skip this one."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"One of the great joys of books is the ability to revisit an old favorite. I took that opportunity recently and reread \\"Selling the Lite of Heaven,\\" the debut novel by Suzanne Strempek Shea. The unnamed narrator is a thirty-something Polish Catholic from Palmer, MA, who \\"has been left for God.\\" Her fiance, Eddie Balicki, who she first met in Church, decided to leave her and become a priest. Her task now is to sell her engagement ring. Described as having \\"The Lite of Heaven,\\" her ad in the local Pennysaver will run until the ring is sold. The novel interweaves the story of her romance with Eddie with the tale of her attempts to sell the ring.I first read this novel over 15 years ago when it was new. Even then, it was somewhat frozen in time. Now, it reads like historical fiction, painting a portrait of life before the internet and cell phones. The narrator works at a photo processing place where photos are guaranteed within 24 hours and everything is on film. In so many ways, it was a different world, and rereading it brought me back to that place of my youth.This novel is incredibly Catholic. It was perhaps my first introduction to Catholic fiction, all the more remarkable because it was published by a mainstream publisher. Those who have grown up Catholic in an immigrant community will definitely see themselves in these pages.\\"Selling the Lite of Heaven\\" is a delightful read with an engaging premise. If it were written today, it would be a vastly different story, but as it is, it is full of charm, a vignette of a by-gone era, and a wonderful escape."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"I love this book.

A good book doesn't always need a big ending but one must have an effective and believable ending to go with the rest of the story."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"This is a lamentably sad story of a young woman who had to grow up fast after meeting the man of her dreams and, after several months, Eddie bought her a fancy diamond engagement ring. Called the \\"lite of Heaven\\" because of the brightness it encompassed, it is left behind when he is given a miraculous sign that he is chosen for the priesthood.This sets her on a comtemplative flashback to her first proposal, when she was only fourteen Andy, her first beau, gave her a gold-tone LOVE ring for Christmas. \\"Our house was all decorated for Christmas. The tree lights were...glowing mutedly through a swath of fiberglass angel hair.\\" A small manager scene on top of the TV was illuminated with a small orange bulb. \\"The plastic candelabra were plugged in and placed in the front windowsill.\\" The box from Andy was wrapped in Christmas paper. Her mother took her to return the ring; \\"someday, I would have a history about which people could only wonder and speculate.\\"Nothing jelled with Buddy Kent. Her teen years had been dullsville but she had steady employment at the photo shop and had no desire to attend college. \\"I stayed in my town and in my little life and everything was going along pretty much the same until Eddie\\" returned from the big city. \\"He had eyes that looked like new pennies -- golden copper, without the picture of Lincoln, and maybe just a little more sparkling.\\" He'd been smart enough to win a scholarship to Holy Cross where he graduated and moved to Boston.At her church, she \\"watched a nun water the poinsettia plants near the communion rail.\\" She learned that Eddie had been an altar boy since the first grade and had volunteered to serve at every mass. \\"At Christmas, he hinted for gifts by clipping newspaper ads for a local religious supply store and leaving it on the breakfast table.\\" For the year I had him in my life, I had dreamed ... about walking slowly down the aisle toward him, looking lovingly right at him, holding at waist level a fresh bunch of flowers.\\"But that did not take place, except in her dreams. Since he had insisted that she keep the expensive ring, she finally put an ad in the paper to sell it for $5,000. Most of the book is taken up with weird characters who claimed to be interested in buying the ring, like Sharlene and Bill out looking for a bargain. Some browsers' intents were made known with names like Richard, Joseph, Randy, Andy (fifteen years later looking for a ring to give to Cindy at Valentine's) and Maria, who paid the $5,000 in twenty dollar bills.Instead of marriage, she had found liberation, hiring a low-flying plane and she tossed the bag containing the money: \\"he has gone back to God and I will leave him there.\\" She is at long last a liberated woman, having been given a 'goal' while looking at the same statue of Saint Mary (which had told Eddie to become a priest): \\"to give you a new life.\\"This is Ms. Shea's first novel. She went on to write others, including LILY OF THE VALLEY, BECOMING FIOLA, and AROUND AGAIN. It was a nice little Christmas story, somewhat different from the norm, but that's life."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"This book made you laugh and cry sometimes on the same page.

Good work Ms. Strempek-Shea!!"},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"I've had my eye on this book for the past four years now, and finally I got the chance to read it with my local book club. I must say that this book was a pleasant surprise. It is light, sweet and endearingly funny -- with much more depth than I expected.Selling the Lite of Heaven tells the story of a woman who has waited patiently for love. The only daughter of Polish immigrant parents, the narrator of this story wasn't allowed to date until she turned 18. Well, that time came and went, and still no prospects in sight. She spends all her time as a developer at the Fast Foto, going to church and living under the same roof as her parents, enduring the strict eye of her mother, despite her 32 years. But then there's Eddie Balicki... They fall in love, become engaged, and her prayers are answered -- until he breaks off their engagement to become a priest.The chapters alternate between the past -- detailing the narrator's childhood, the citizens of her small-town Polish community, and meeting and falling in love with Eddie -- and the present, where she meets with customers who want to buy the engagement ring she has advertised in the Pennysaver. This story is so sweet, honest and heartfelt -- I could relate on many levels, especially trying to find someone to love, only to be disappointed in the end. I am looking forward to my book club discussion as well as reading more books by Suzanne. Kudos!"},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"This is a literary masterpiece. It's hard to imagine that anyperson could live with a dominating mother and never rebel when herheart is broken. I was hooked on the realism of the author's description when the mother went into panic about the deposits that were already made for the reception and wedding. The deposits were more important than the anguish that her only daughter would suffer when her groom cancels the marriage to become a priest. A lot of mother's are like that and we still love them. Read the book and you'll understand why.This book is not for the casual reader who wants to simply enjoy a funny story in a Polish-American-Catholic setting. It is a gripping story that demands your constant attention to details. It makes you think and challenges your imagination.

I would never donate it to the library (although I just might buy an extra copy to donate). In fact, I've never lent it to anybody because I just don't want to lose it. I was raised Catholic (in a family where church attendance was required, including every holy day), so I really related to the dutiful main character. She was brought up to be nice; just as I was. She was raised to stay close by her parents, just as I was. She believed that she would find happiness by finding the polite, virtuous man that any Catholic mother and father would approve of. Deep down, I used to believe that as well. Finally, she needed to learn that she has a right to her own life, on her own terms, a prospect that many people raised in a similar environment find especially frightening. Selling the Lite of Heaven is inspirational for anyone who has grappled with these issues. I loved the ending of this book. If you relate at all to what I've written, and you're looking for an inspirational read, buy it."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"At the time I read this novel, it struck me so clearly how all our lives can be intertwined. The narrator's descriptions of the early days of their romance made me tingle--especially when she is in his apartment during the ice storm!

I appreciated her struggle between shyness and family duty, between wanting to come into her own and being afraid of what that might mean."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"My first journey with Shea, and I found this book to beabsolutely wonderful. The story was for the most part very sad, theway she builds her life around the ring and how she needs to find this &quot;inanimate&quot; object the &quot;right&quot; home, is quite depressing yet at the same time understandable. We've all held onto things too long. Great book overall, the most heartwrenching aspect would be, her being left for God. Who on earth could compete? You want to hate her ex-fiancee, but you just can't, cause ultimately he is doing the admirable thing. In a nut shell - quite sweet and sad, but Shea could do with a few less run-on sentences."},{"Title":"Selling the Lite of Heaven","review":"I have just read this book for the second time and have found it to be as charming a story as I did the first time around. It is the very simple story of a very unassuming daughter of Polish immigrants. The mundanity of her life is what makes the book so appealing. Having been raised by the most unbelievably cold and emotionless parents to lead a life totally devoid of any expectations, the heroine has finally found love and, she believes, a future that will be new, exciting and full of love. But no, ... she is left at the alter by a man who chooses to become a priest rather than marry her. The book tells both her love story and her attempt to sell her engagement ring - The Lite of Heaven. Its an unusual book, a simple book but totally charming and a fascinating insight into the Polish-American experience mixed with a great deal of Catholic guilt."},{"Title":"Appalachian Galapagos","review":"There are those writers who, having found what works, rewrite the same novel for the rest of their careers. David Whitman and Weston Ochse are not those writers. With the success of &quot;Scary Rednecks and Other Inbred Horrors&quot;, the duo decided to team up once again for this much anticipated sequel. This collection is simply brillant. It's frightening and yet causes aching belly laughs, it makes you want to look away in horror and repulsion, but you simply cannot. The characters are warm, loyal, stupid, funny and surprisingly insightful. The depth and talent in these stories cannot be overlooked. If you buy this book you are not only guaranteed a good read but also a wild ride along the river of humanity."},{"Title":"Appalachian Galapagos","review":"These two maniacs read some of this book at the Horrorfind Convention in 2002 and had the audience on the floor in hysterics.

Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Pico Iyer has a keen eye and great facility with words, and therefore his books always make for great reading. \\"Falling off the map,\\" is a book that describes at lenght about some lonely places in the world. He has an uncanny knack of painting a vivid portrait that instally transports you to these places.Iyer defines lonley places as those places that are not the topic of conversation at any international dinner tables. These places are \\"shy,defensive,curious places: places that do not know how they are supposed to behave.\\" And Iyer convices us in that in this ever-shrinking world such placs still exist: Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam and others.The minute I finished reading the book, I wanted to go these lonely and interesting places that Iyer talks about in this book. But, that was just a passing thought, and then harsh reality intruded and I started to fret about creature comforts, food, transportion etc.Visiting these places is not for the faint-hearted with weak stomachs.If you can brave these places like Iyer did, you are a lucky person, but if you are like the masses that like to sit in the comfort of a lazybody of the living room and indulge in arm-chair travelling then this is a must-read book. That is precisely what I did. I derived great vicarious pleasure by reading this book.But, alas Iyer made his expedition to these lonely places over a decade ago, and since then things have changed in some of these lonely places, and they are fast becoming the new destination for regular travellers. There is some hope for me in this changing travelling trend ...perhaps, I can get to visit these places in my lifetime."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"This author write a cut above the norm. Where the uninititated might see only the author's felicity with language, those seeking insight into places they've never been or even a place they might like to go, will appreciate this book immensely. For thoughtful individuals who may never leave their own locale, throughout, one will find respect for the subtle interplay between the integrity of local places and the two-edged sword of globalization, sweeping the one world in which we are increasingly, if still nascently living."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"\\"Falling Off the Map\\" is a collection of the impressions of a journalist who visits locations isolated by location, politics or culture. North Korea, Iceland, Cuba, Argentina, Bhutan, Vietnam, Paraguay and Australia are the places written in this collection of musings.If there is a theme to the writings other than just travel to distant places, it is that these places seem so isolated for one reason or another. North Korea is run by a humorless dictator. Argentina surrenders its middle-class and democracy for the typical populism of the rest of South America. 15 years before the current disintegration of Iceland we see a soulless place whose inhabitants desperately seek meaning in discos, promiscuous sex and exhibitionism. Other than Australia, the rest of the places in here seem to be on the decline that has become generalized in the world. Though written in 1993, this book seems current given a world that no longer looks forward to next year but to several generations before the current problems can be eliminated.One of the things this book is not is educational or encyclopedic. We really only see the observations and interactions of the author with very little historicity or context. In a sense this writing is the equivalent of modern art - causing deep feeling or emotion but wondering what the hell was that I was just looking at."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Most of the essays in this book were written between 1988 and 1992 -- a period that came at the end of a small renaissance in the art of travel writing, until the bores writing about Tuscany and the South of France suffocated it. Tim Cahill, Bruce Chatwin, Ian Buruma, and Paul Theroux were at their height -- as well as Iyer himself with his VIDEO NIGHT IN KATHMANDU. I revelled in their writings, glorying in dangerous places I would never actually visit for fear of tropical diseases, violent bands of guerrillas or outlaws, dictatorial governments, and -- primarily -- lack of funds.Pico Iyer is a writer who skates on the surface of things touristic. He has few sustained discussions with locals who can provide some light on the strangeness reflected back at him by these surfaces. And he does not appear to have done his homework: To visit Iceland, for example, without reference to the sagas of the 13th Century is almost to miss the point. The hardiness of a people raised on the example of Gisli Sursson (Gisla Saga) or Grettir Asmundarson (Grettir's Saga) is to really grasp the Juchi Idea (of self-reliance) he discusses in conjunction with his essay or North Korea.Although he can be a tad lazy, Iyer has the gift of gab. I still remember a one-page essay he wrote ages ago for, I believe, NEWSWEEK, on the decline of the comma in writing. If he were alive today, Oscar Wilde would approve of Iyer's work. Perhaps Iyer's wit in describing these surfaces is a sign of greatness that I just fall short of fully appreciating.I remember a travel book by Graham Greene (THE LAWLESS ROADS) in which the author breaks his only set of glasses during one particularly vile stretch of terrain and suddenly launches into a vicious attack on Mexico, cursing it for the pain it put him through to research his novel THE POWER AND THE GLORY. I never get the feeling that Iyer expresses anything deeper and amusement or mild inconvenience; and I really wonder what he feels about these places he visits. We may never know, because he wears his mask well."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"This review would have been 5 stars but the Paraguay chapter could have been a bit more accurate. I have lived off and on since 1990 in Asuncion. His view was pretty much the typical \\"...look it over a few days, talk to a few locals, and move on to the next site.\\" The is pretty typical of mediocre surface writing and I certainly do not put this work in that category. Iyer's style is superb!! Love the book. Just bought the book today here in Buenos Aires and read it cover to cover in 2 sittings.Once again, great style."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Once upon a time I found in my hand a book of unusual caliber: journeys of discovery to some of the world's lonely places. Pouring out at me was a poetic and compressed potpourri of verbiage. Too intense at times...but I was compelled to read on. Pico Iyer, an Indian-born English writer of great wit, could sometimes overwhelm. But instead of three great descriptive scenes per sentence, I often wish he would employ three great descriptive sentences per scene.As a reader being invited along for the voyage, I much prefer that I be slow-fed the beautiful phrases and illustrations of the surrounding wonders, instead of coming away feeling like I had been rapidly dragged through a drive-till-you-drop extravaganza. Examples: \\"a winding road slices through the snowcaps, past Incan ruins, all the way to the Chilean border...\\" might better be describes with a paragraph on those snowcaps and ruins and other items along the winding road. Iyer can be a dizzying and maddeningly busy travel guide. It's not all that disorienting, however; just allow yourself time to head-wrap his terminology. At Argentina's Iguazu Falls: \\"...rainbows arc across the crashing falls, blades of grass gleam emerald under dripping water... toucans flood the trees, fat lizards sunbathe amidst roots and branches... serpents slither over catwalks... condors circle the blue with blackness...\\" There are times, of course, when Iyer wants you to fill in the blanks [re the magical pleasures of Patagonia: \\"around them all, stretching everywhere, miles and miles of nothingness.\\"].For the most part, however, I thoroughly enjoy Iyer's descriptions. I suppose we all should spend a few minutes in meditation upon each sentence, like the savoring the last spoonful of ice cream on a dreamy, hot day. Almost every other sentence has this delightful machine-gun fire poetry embedded in it. More often than not, Iyer throws us these scenarios of jumbled cultures and upside-down place settings as if it was all an autistic nightmare of how-can-this-be worldscapes. Does he make some of it up or is the realm of the very observant traveller actually filled with \\"...inside their little (Indian) houses, Welsh women, speaking Spanish, serve traditional teas in semi-Wedgwood pots, with Cadbury's milk Tray cups...\\"? Shades of Garrison Keillor! It pleases the literate palate to have such things flow across the waiting mind. Theroux's dialogue from his Patagonia Express book was more breezy and open, more suitable to these southern plains, perhaps; but somehow Iyer presses us to find the unexpected where we least think of looking. Everywhere he goes, Iyer seems to find a distopic globalization of the world, and he thinks it is wonderful and grand in a quirky way.He introduces Cuba with the funny-bone hilarity of overly friendly police interrogations, to go on to his reminiscences of this carnival-riven, sad, yet beautiful frozen-in-time place. [\\"Cuba catches my heart, then makes me count the cost of that enchantment...\\"]. To Iceland... \\"the epidemic oddness of the place... even civilization seems to offer no purchase for the mind here...(yet) the oldest living language in Europe...(and) nature adores a vacuum here...\\". Onward to the hidden mountain region of Bhutan ... \\"the secret land of archers... the world's remotest kingdom... last Shangri-la... roads measured in number of curves per mile... Vomit Express local buses... skies of guiltless blue... dragons... skull-necklaced idols... prayer wheels and rainbowed streamers. In 1991's Vietnam, Iyer meets up with people who are \\"exceptionally attractive, cultured, hospitable... but shy of tourists, not knowing what to make of us:; where surprise is a growth industry, the country is \\"developing at the speed of a Polaroid\\", and armadillos on the menu and cobras slaughtered at your table. Yet he found the country to be one of the most gentle and peaceful places anywhere, with customs officers \\"inspecting foreigners for smiles\\". It was easy to see, Iyer tells us, that \\"lamps were burning even inside the people\\". University towns \\"move to a bicycle rhythm\\" and the riders \\"carried themselves like ancient porcelain\\". Iyer follows up with a Paraguay of post-civil war decadence. Mennonites stroll across streets where traffic lights do not work, and murderous tyrants are remembered in mammoth mausoleums. With money sellers being a national pastime (\\"men in ties counting stacks of money slightly larger than the GNP of Peru...\\"), Paraguay is the refuge of South America (Uruguay is the resort), and everything pays tribute to former dictator Francisco Solano Lopez. A dark corrupt country, with Madam Tussaud figures that were alive. A retirement home for retiring criminals who gradually turned a promising paradise into a cemetery. The country's economy is a flash list of absurdities and contradictions, says Iyer. International witchcraft councils are hosted here annually. Asuncion seems to be a mini-Korea of citizenry where posh hotels have no dial-up phones but taxis are Mercedes. A land of languid illegality where old women are but nineteen or twenty and where legalized crime seems to pay dividends. [In spite of this, one of the best things I remember myself about this country is that one of its poverty regions eventually gave the USA a Christian evangelical who overcame his setbacks and tours as a classical solo harpist.]For a conclusion to the Lost Places of the World, Iyer visits Australia, where the light is like nothing else on earth, he says, the only presiding authority. A young old land of \\"weird paradoxes and sunny ironists, a British California caught between a world it has abandoned and one it has yet to colonize. I have read much and learned much about outback Australia and Iyer can still feed the imagination on it. Terra Australis Incognita, the land of anomalies, the last place on earth, an Alcatraz on epic scale, suffering from \\"the tyranny of distance\\". Yet the fatal shore became the lucky country. Their practice of lackadaisical laid-back subcultures paints the Australian country as a \\"museum as radical documentary\\". Yet it is the vast Outback that is the real Australia, as Iyer correctly points out. Just list the variety to be seen there and you know what he means: blanched trees (which shed bark but keep leaves) twisted at odd angles, diorama-bright landscapes of shocked blue and thick red, emptiness and flatness, mute and implacable but lovely in its lonely way, jackeroos above water in golden, gauzy early light, pelicans and snakebirds, lotus birds in mango trees, blue-winged kookaburras and sulphur-crested cockatoos, sunbathing crocodiles, magpies and corellas in the face of a full moon. The \\"great America on the other side of the sphere\\", a lonely, lonely (but intriguing) place.I quote extensively from this book because it is so inevitably quotable. Iyer has frequent quaint turns of phrases, making this deliciously readable. And if travel reading is food for the mind, this is a banquet."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"This book describes the author's visits to 8 countries: North Korea, Argentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam, Paraguay, and Australia. The trips took place from 1987 to 1992.I really struggled through this book. The author's writing is flowery and embellished. I love adjectives and adverbs just as much as anyone, but there's a limit. Sometimes excessive verbiage takes away from the writing instead of adding to it.The travels that he describes are very disjointed and abstract. For example, the chapter on Cuba (which was about 20 pages long) is a compilation of experiences from visits during 1987-1992. After reading the chapter, I really didn't learn much about Cuba. He recounted a few unrelated stories and cited various other writer's impressions.This is no travel log. For the most part, the author's travels were not off the beaten path; he stayed in major cities.I do NOT recommend this book. I did not like the author's writing style; at times it made for a very difficult and unintelligible read. If you want to learn anything useful about these 8 countries, choose a different book."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"This guy either makes up things as he goes along or doesn't actually go along! For instance, he said garden fences and TV antenna are banned in Canberra Australia, which is nonsense. In fact, fences are erected at the time houses are built, so everyone has them, and most roofs also sport TV antennas. Plus, he describes Australian houses as &quot;semi-detached,&quot; when they are almost all just like your average suburban American house. Not major points, but he certainly lost all credibility with me. In fact, I seriously doubt that he's actually been here. Read Bill Bryson's book if you want to learn about Australia."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Pico Iyer's prose caught my eye in his Time Magazine columns where he did a good job showing us how recognizable the exotic has become. This collection, his first in book form, again reiterates that the most difficult aspect of long distance travel is not any longer how to get there, how to dodge danger or how to find your way back but how to avoid to bump into the same features you left 10,000 miles and 6 timezones earlier. Showing through many examples, sometimes hilarious and sometimes profoundly sad how globalisation regurgitates the same marketing ideas dressed in different flags it really makes its point that the era of the curious gentleman(woman) traveler looking for exotic shores has been overtaken by the vastly less romantic quest to escape the onslaught of canned icons in any neck of the woods.The book also does a nice job of illuminating the paradoxical quest of the overfed and understimulated prestigious first world traveler trying to find hidden corners where there is still some sort of exploration possible and where not all laws of our structured civilization apply only to be greeted by the not so happy natives who are dying to know how to join the West or in the least purchase its most potent logos."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"I have to admit I'm a sucker for all travel narratives. I have a serious travel jones myself, and since I'm not in a position to jet all over the world right now, I have to armchair travel. Pico Iyer was recommended highly to me by a fellow armchair traveler so I set about this book with some high expectations.The downside of this book is that he's writing about a number of places I'm likely not to visit-North Korea, Cuba, Paraguay-but after a few chapters my disappointment at reading about \\"lonely places\\" that will remain unvisited by me gradually fell away as Iyer's style became more comfortable for me.He refers to classic travel writers frequently, and if you haven't read these authors, some of the references lose their impact, but Iyer's observations are so detailed, so full of atmosphere, that you don't necessarily get a picture of the country he's visiting, but a total feeling that's larger than the individual portraits he presents. I get the feeling he genuinely loves the people and the places he's visited and doesn't see them as part of some journalistic assignment he has to get through."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"The easiest read of the three books of Iyer's that I have read. Five of his eight destinations were places about which I had never read anything other than a description in the almanac. What makes Iyer's writing so appealing to me is that he accepts with equanimity the poor conditions that other top travel writers, such as Paul Theroux, devote such energy to bemoaning. Even if it weren't so well written, I would recommend this book for the originality of its material."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Pico Iyer has a poetic style, Tim Cahill is compassionate, and P.J. O'Rourke is down and dirty. But all three have written excellent travel essays, sometimes on the same places. My recommendation is to read \\"Falling Off the Map\\", and Iyer's earlier book, \\"Video Night in Kathmandu\\", and then read \\"Holidays in Hell\\" by O'Rourke and any book by Cahill for other takes on the same turf. Overall, you'll get a very well-rounded picture of some lands that you might never want to visit, but which are fascinating in their own, dysfunctional, way."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Pico's short book is full of sharp and witty humor conjugated with intelligent insightful observations. He combines day-to-day anecdotes, personal interactions and socio-political prose with amazing dexterity. The background information provided for each lonely country visited by Pico is pretty amazing.I have traveled to some of these lonely places and can almost relive my travel experiences after reading his book (though he traveled almost a decade before I did). With every passing chapter, I could observe a progressive improvement in Pico's writing style. Essays from Argentina, Paraguay and Bhutan are very interesting. He comes into his own with the concluding essay on Australia."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Since the stories in this book are mostly over twenty years old, they tend to be more like an historical or anthropological examination of these places that Iyer visited in the late 1980s. The two vignettes from North Korea and Cuba are the most worth reading because not that much has changed in these places since the stories were written.The other stories, especially on Australia and Argentina are like ancient history. So much has happened in both places over the last twenty years that the writings seems to be from a time capsule of alternate history.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Much better than I thought it would. I really gained insight on the people of these places as well as the places themselves. I now would want to visit some of them. Others never---which is the point."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"What can you say about essayist Pico Iyer, whose humor truly shines through in this collection of eight expeditions to places never visited? North Korea. Iceland. Bhutan. Paraguay, to name a few. All of Iyer's anecdotes are interesting, detailed and often down-right funny. Iyer treks to those places you know exist but are likely never to see for yourself; those places in the news but not in the travel plans; those non-vacation spots for the occidental tourist. And he describes all of them in a way both funny and profound. For instance, he says of Reykjavik, Iceland: It &quot;might almost be a small child's toy, as clean and perfect as a ship inside a bottle. ... Reykjavik is one place where it really is worth climbing the steeple of the highest church to see the city, mute and motionless, laid out against the silver sea.&quot; Pages later, he says: &quot;In summer when I visited, people were complaining of a heat wave when the temperature hit a chilly 54 degrees.&quot; In short, the book is worthy of a gander. It'll make you laugh, think, and want to travel - just not necessarily to the places he describes:)"},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"In \\"Falling Off the Map\\", Pico Iyer's tales of wanderlust transport the reader to North Korea, Argentina, Cuba, Iceland, Bhutan, Vietnam, Paraguay and Australia, all of which are Lonely Places outside the world's mainstream either by choice, geography or circumstance. I was a bit surprised that no country on the African continent was included, as I have to believe that some backwaters of one or another decayed, European, colonial empire have acquired independence to become, well, backwaters by other names. Perhaps Pico hasn't looked at an atlas lately, or he didn't find the prospect of the Dark Continent's climate particularly appealing.Because Vietnam monopolized so much of America's collective consciousness in the 60's and 70's, the chapter dedicated to that country was, to me, the most informative and intriguing - and I didn't even serve there, or anywhere near it, during my years with the U.S. Navy. Though ostensibly a communist state, Iyer is careful to note that Vietnam's lingering animosity is with the Chinese, not the U.S., even though it was the latter that bombed, defoliated and napalmed the country for years. Americans, and their $, are most welcome. I've decided that I owe it to myself to visit the place, just to see the patch of real estate that we made such a fuss over.The author's observations of all the Lonely Places are recorded as viewed through lenses of keen perception and dry humor. He was, after all, born British. In \\"Falling Off the Map\\", Iyer has accomplished what I think most travel writers set out to do, i.e., convince their readers to see for themselves what will otherwise remain simply as mental images conjured from a page. Though I will likely never visit all, or even a minority, of these quirky locales, I really wish I could."},{"Title":"Falling Off the Map: Some Lonely Places of The World","review":"Iyer has always written lyrically and insightfully, and he's especially good at picking up on the idiosyncracies of people and places as well as cross-cultural influences and the effects of the world's increasing globalization (or lack of in some cases). But this book's so called theme of the loneliness of some destinations rings hollow, in some cases they appear to be adapting themselves to the changing world quite well. Vietnam and Australia for example, two of the destinations he writes about, seem to be making every effort to make themselves both more hospitable to travelers and more familiar to the outside world. Other destinations, while certainly identifiable as lonely places, do not yield their charms easily to the reader, even under Iyer's elegant prose. All in all, Iyer's failure to convincinly link thru the disparate chapters the theme of the lonlieness of certain geographical locations does not result in a book that is greater than the sum of its parts, the book stands better as a series of essays, (and was probably written that way in the first place). THat said however, I'm still a fan of Iyer's prose as well as his ability to meld easily into whatever place he is visiting. Unlike many other travel writers who often make themselves part of the story or even the whole story, Iyer never stands out as the ugly American and is able to view the destination with a somewhat detached though always humorous and unique outlook. But I think his work was better in Video Night in Khatamandu, a book with themes that rang truer than this one. While any book by Iyer is a treat for his diehard fans (like me), this one will have limited broader appeal. But I guess his stuff is a niche market anyway!

Denise Inge is a leading Traherne scholar, and she offers us the best selection from Traherne's writings available today. It even includes pieces from the Lambeth Manuscripts (The Kingdom of God) which were discovered as recently as 1997.In her introduction, Denise provides invaluable background information: Traherne's Biography, a Discovery of Works, a Literary Critique, Sources & Influences, and an Historical Context. Here is a great description of Traherne from her introduction: \\"He speaks of a world most of us only remember as if it were his present and his future. And that is more than part of his charm; it is his constant vision. Another world is his origin and his destination. Another world behind, in, under, above, beneath this one from which we are separted by the merest veil and yet to which we are invited by the faintest piercing birdsong and the greatest human act alike.\\" She offers some important insights about Traherne's love for learning: \\"What strikes me again and again as I consider Traherne's vast array of sources and influences is his voracious appetite for learning and a conviction that every discovery could lead one further into truth. There is in him no fear of science or of exploration.\\"The book consists of five groupings of selections, each with an insightful introduction:Section I: Selections from the Centuries of Meditations.Section II: Selected Poems and Thanksgivings (including selections from the Dobell Manuscript, the Burney Manuscript, the Thanksgivings, and the Ceremonial Law.)Section III: Selections from Christian Ethicks.Section IV: Selections from the Select Meditations and Commentaries of Heaven.Section V: Selections from the Lambeth Manuscript.Denise's selections from the Lambeth Manuscript are the first pieces from Traherne's The Kingdom of God to ever appear in print. This new manuscript shows Traherne building on many of the themes he introduced in Centuries of Meditation. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Thomas Traherne: Poetry and Prose (Golden Age of Spiritual Writing)","review":"The Age of Discovery is over. In 2010 there are no new continents and few new islands left to be explored, the poles have been reached and Everest has been scaled. Few opportunities remain for those hungering for the Thrill of the New. Not, however, in the world of scholarship. The world's libraries - even the most obscure ones - have been pretty well combed through, it's true. But every once in a while something Old and Lost comes to light, and revolution can rock an entire field of human learning.One excellent example is Thomas Traherne (1636-1674). An obscure 17th century Anglican priest, he had long been dismissed as a second-rate poet and a slightly goopy (perhaps even heretical) writer of spiritual devotions. Then, in a story right out of a Dan Brown novel, several lost manuscripts were discovered in the late 20th century - one of them literally rescued from a burning rubbish bin! These finds put Traherne back on the map, and turned that map completely upside down. The mediocre poet and devotional writer is now recognized as one of the three or four most creative and profound theologians ever to write in the English language.New editions, introductions and studies are coming fast, now. One of the best brief introductions is Thomas Traherne: Poetry and Prose, edited by Denise Inge (one of the world's leading Traherne scholars) and published by SPCK as part of its Golden Age of Spiritual Writing series. Ms. Inge provides a brief but informative introduction to Traherne's life, writings and thought, followed by extensive selections from his works. She wisely leads off with excerpts from his previously known writings (like the Centuries of Meditations and the Poems), followed by samples from the newly-discovered works (Christian Ethicks, for example, and The Kingdom of God). This enables the reader to see how the new discoveries make possible a much fuller and deeper picture of Traherne the theologian.Pick up a copy of this little (116 page) book and you'll be introduced to a most congenial Christian thinker. In an era when many theologians pictured humanity as hopelessly depraved and steeped in sin, Traherne taught a joyful, positive view of human nature. Deeply learned in ancient theology and philosophy, he was also unusually open to the scientific discoveries of his age - discoveries that many other Christians saw as a threat to Biblical Truth. Most of all, he was passionately in love with a God whom he saw as absolute Beauty and absolute Graciousness, a God who shines in and through every aspect of creation.I recommend that you make his acquaintance at your earliest opportunity."},{"Title":"The Seed of a Nation: Rediscovering America","review":"This is an amazing snapshot into an important time of America's history.

I have recommended this book to friends and to my graduate students.

The authors provide poignant narratives that show Penn's enormous contributions to the founding of a new government of freedom based on covenant, implying that Penn should be studied as enthusiastically as Washington, Jefferson, Adams and other early American leaders. The Seed of a Nation also explains why democracy will only work well when practiced by a public that understand the primacy of covenant relationships based on personal integrity, genuine faith, and generous trust. What I especially liked when I read this book is that the authors cut through the boring dogma of religion and academic soliloquy to get to the heart of matters, focusing on how Penn actually treated others, especially native Americans, and how he formed bonds of friendship that still illuminate how political leaders ought to be leading in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Seed of a Nation: Rediscovering America","review":"I am finishing Seed of a Nation and I found it to be very easy to read. I love to read but sometimes authors make it easy to put down. Field's did not make it easy to put down but he did make it uneasy to read with his well documented reporting of English/American and Indian relations.This book is probably most helpful in studying the history of relations between Whites and Indians even more so than studying William Penn. Infact, I think the authors emotional journey through Indian relations actually made this book less about William Penn and more about Indian affairs.This is a very worthy read but it is more than just learning about William Penn. I recommend it but warn, it will challenge you to examine the purity and morality of America's founding as we learned it in school."},{"Title":"The Seed of a Nation: Rediscovering America","review":"The Seed of a Nation is a great book if you desire a fuller perspective of the founding of America.

His insights into the human condition are par excellance and his life is an amazing treasure trove of material. He writes with elagance and style that makes him instantly likeable. However, around page 300 you begin to get tired of his endless litany of people who turned against him. From the Israeli company that didn't do his play the way he wanted it done, to the critics who loved him and then dismissed him to a humble yet determined tirade against Isaac Bashevis Singer as the crown jackass of the Yiddish writers; you begin to wonder if Weisel has any friends who haven't terribly insulted him at one time or the other. He states that he will not write about those he grew up with in anything but the most glowing pictures but it seems as if he is comparing his contemporaries to these Jewish martyrs and constantly finding them wanting. Still Weisel is a great writer and you can buy his tendency to complain about everyone around him. You just won't want to befriend him, for fear that you'll be a target in his next memoir"},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"Elie Wiesel may be best known as the author of \\"Night\\", his harrowing and sparse account of his time spent in the concentration camps. His literary works have focused around the events that shaped Holocaust survivors and the questions those survivors had about their faith afterwards. His life's work is heavily imbued by those events early in his life, his novels vast testaments to making sure the world never forgets the atrocities man inflicted upon man.Yet there are many sides to this amazing man, which can often be forgotten when one dwells solely on his literary works. The first volume of Wiesel's memoirs, \\"All Rivers Run to the Sea\\", is a brilliant introduction and elucidation of the author. He relates quickly his early childhood and his time in the camps, but moves onto and focuses on his path after those events. As he forges a career as a journalist, meeting statesmen and celebrities, he finds himself and what causes he is willing to fight for. As a stateless person, his life is often difficult as he arouses suspicion, and he struggles constantly to make ends meet. Reading about his personal adventures, the reader sees how he is passionate, full of empathy, timid and captivating, a brilliant man with many stories to tell.For anyone who has read Wiesel's writings, the style of \\"All Rivers Run to the Sea\\" will be just as familiar: while it is divided into sections, his reminiscenses are as tangential as his fictional stories. Learning about his real-life adventures, readers can easily see how Wiesel has woven his experiences into all of his fictional works. The praises and accolades he has received are more than well deserved, for as long as he writes, his people will have a testimony to their past and to their faith."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"This is an autobiographical account of Elie Wiesels experiences of, and involvement in, some of the most important events in our history : the holocaust and the birth of modern Israel.

He is also a skilled wordsmith, being a professional journalist, and is therefore capable of expressing his thoughts and feelings in a manner which generates empathy. I was deeply moved by this book"},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"This spectacular memoir of Elie Wiesel, the great author and voice of conscience, begins with his boyhood in the small Transylvanian village of Sighet.A pious child, with a great thirst for Jewish knowledge, a student of Torah and Talmud, and fascinated with the Kabbalah. Elie is swept into the Nazi ghetto and then death cams where he loses his parents and his beautiful little blond sister Tzipora, all of whom perished in the Nazi furnaces.He writes in memory of his losses:\\"If only I could recapture my father's wisdom, my little sister's innocent grace. If only I could recapture the rage of the resistance fighter, the suffering of the mystic dreamer, the solitude of the orphan in a sealed cattle car, the death of each and every one of them. If only I could step out of myself and merge with them\\".Wiesel writes of the prophecy told to his mother by the Wizhnitz Rabbi that her son would become a gadol b'Israel (a great man in Israel) but that she would not live to see it.Wiesel records some of the horrors he witnessed in the death camps such as live children being thrown into furnaces by the Nazis, and laments the inaction by the Allies to do anything about the extermination they knew was taking place of the Jews- saving Jews was not a priority for the Allies either.He mentions that most of the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis were intellectuals- not surprising in light of the fact hat most Jews who have thrown themselves into the campaign of hate against their fellow Jews in Israel.He writes about the liberation of the death camps by the Allies after the war, and how one of the youngest child survivors of Buchenwald was eight year old Israel Meir Lau, later to be the Chief Ashkenazic Rabbi of Israel. In his section of his travels around the world as a young man during the early 1950s he writes of his great compassion at the plight of poverty-stricken children in India.Wiesel records his life in a youth home for Jewish refugees in Paris and the fate of displaced Jews after World War II, his life as a journalist for Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronot for whom he covered the Eichmann trial, civil rights struggles, the Six Day War, the 1968 Student insurrections in France, and other world events.He has always been greatly interested in philosophy and parapsychology and writes of his discussions with such great leaders as Golda Meir and DavidBen-Gurion, as well as the greatest thinkers of the day. He writes of his great love for Israel and it's people for which he has been attacked by the hate-filled bigots of the International Left. He also took a strong stand for persecuted Soviet Jewry during the 1960s and 1970s. Elie Wiesel also writes of his great compassion for humanity as a whole, such as his pain at seeing the suffering of destitute children during his travels in India. But unlike certain Jews of the Left, he does not see a contradiction between this and his great love of Israel and the Jewish people- Ahavat Israel.He writes with great compassion, passion, anger, sadness and hope.In a plea for the plight of his own people today, especially the youth and children of Israel today targeted by terror and forces of genocide (such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Ahmadinejad regime- as well as all who are sympathetic to these anti-Jewish elements) he penned an open letter to President Bush stating: \\"Please remember that the maps on Arafat's uniform and in Palestinian children's textbooks show a Palestine encompassing not only all of the West Bank but all of Israel, while Palestinian leaders loudly proclaim that 'Palestine extends from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, from Rosh Hanikra (in the North) to Rafah (in Gaza). Please remember Danielle Shefi, a little girl in Israel. Danielle was five. When the murderers came, she hid under her bed. Palestinian gunmen found and killed her anyway. Think of all the other victims of terror in the Holy Land. With rare exceptions, the targets were young people, children and families. Please remember that Israel--having lost too many sons and daughters, mothers and fathers--desperately wants peace.

It was a really good book, yet there were some parts I didn't care for. I enjoyed the beginning chapter Childhood because it told many interesting things about a Jewish boy's childhood, which we don't normally hear in books about the holocaust. Usually books tell the reader items only about the holocaust and not about the suffering they indured before the war. This I really enjoyed about the book. I also loved the chapter Darkness. I thought this chapter told a very good story about the holocaust, the kind that keeps you rivited and anxious to read on. Yet, I didn't care so much for the chapters all about his travels he took. They just seemed to have no point to me. Maybe it's because that's not what I was expecting out of the book. Like the first two chapter or so they told all about he holocaust and what the Jews went through, which I expected to read about, yet when I got to the traveling chapters, they appeared boring. I didn't care about him traveling to India or Paris or New York. They had no importance to the book. I guess the only importance it could have had is to show that he did survive the holocaust and was able to go on with his life and accomplish all the things he had dreamed about."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"All Rivers Run to the Sea presents a mediocre read-it did not totally satisfy me, but I did not regret reading the book. Elie Wiesel's life certainly proves exciting and worthy of an autobiography; however, I did not particularly enjoy his approach to the subject. Wiesel has served as a journalist in Israel, France, and New York, giving him ample experiences to detail. He also has met famous people including Ben-Gurion, Golda Meir, and Yitzhak Rabin. Wiesel's emotional and evocative chapter entitled &quot;Darkness&quot; dealing with the Holocaust will bring tears to any reader's eyes. Even Wiesel's interspersed commentary on his struggle for faith after the Holocaust fits together with the narration like a puzzle. However, Wiesel's general disregard for chronological order disoriented me and caused strains of the narration to seem fragmented. He would describe an experience with a certain person, then jump twenty years into the future with another anecdote concerning that person. Also, I felt that he delved too deep into describing worldwide historical events rather than his personal experiences. When a sentence establishing general background would suffice, Wiesel sometimes mirrors a history book, saying things such as &quot;Spring 1958. The war in Algeria was at its height, gaining destructive momentum on both sides...At the UN France was on the defensive. Israel was among its few supporters&quot; (Wiesel 561). Perhaps these criticisms stem from a personal style preference of mine. Yet, despite them, Wiesel still made me empathize with the Jewish people and during certain passages also captivated me."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"JJL I thought that overall this was a good book yet the topic of the book was not what i expected. I thought it was going to be more about Weisel's life in the concentration camps and what he went through during the Holocaust. This was not the case at all. This book focused more on his travels and all the people he met in his lifetime. Also, he centers very deeply on religion, some of which was over my head. I would have enjoyed if more if there was not such religion and deep Hebrew language. Weisel's story might be interesting to Jewish people and they might relate to it better. It was a pretty well-written book but it did not touch me as much as it might have someone that experienced these things. One thing i did learn is that journalists and writers do not make much money. Don't get me wrong. There were several other parts of the book that touched me such as his close encounters with death and his love relationships. However, i believe he had some family problems as a child because of his relationships with his parents and peers. He was very attached to his mother but did not know his father that well. Also, his relationships with peers at school was unreal. I could not believe that he would give away valuable possesions just to make freinds. Again, I believe that this was a pretty good book, but if given the choice i might choose a different book that I could relate to more easily."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"In Elie Wiesel's beautiful book, Memoirs: All Rivers Run to the Sea, he again accomplishes what he has accomplished most perfectly in all of his previous works--translating the personal into the universal. Wiesel is also a master storyteller and he does his job flawlessly in this poignant and unforgettable book, relating his memoirs in a frame, both beginning and ending All Rivers Run to the Sea with a dream.He beings with a dream about his father, and the haunting words, &quot;Last night I saw my father in a dream.&quot; Of course, this is no ordinary dream, but a dream that reveals volumes about Wiesel's life and its ever-present themes. Imprisoned at both Buchenwald and Auschwitz, Wiesel, who shared the darkest moments of his life with his father, saw the man he never really knew die of starvation and dysentery, while his mother and youngest sister, the beautiful little Tzipora, were murdered in the ovens of Auschwitz.In the second dream, Wiesel brings his memoirs to a close as he describes his joyous wedding day in the Old City of Jerusalem. Although a happy groom, Wiesel is by no means a traditional one. Retreating into a silent reverie, he tries somehow to include his parents and baby sister in the wedding festivities, thus rounding out the family circle he loved so much.Between these two sad and haunting dreams, Wiesel, who often employs frames in relating a tale, tells us the story of the early years of his life.Born in Sighet, Romania on 30 September 1928 to Shlomo and Sarah Feig Wiesel, Elie Wiesel lived the early years of his life happily, in the center of Jewish culture. Although his family was quite traditional, it was in Sighet that Wiesel began experimenting with more mystical lines of thought. Possessed with a passion for learning, he studied both Hebrew and Yiddish as well as delving into the ancient texts of the Jewish faith.It was on 19 March 1944 that this idyllic boyhood with an intensely spiritual family came to an abrupt end. An unspeakable darkness fell upon Sighet's entire Jewish community as all of the nearly 15,000 residents were arrested and deported to Auschwitz, Poland.Wiesel is chilling as he relates the horror and uncertainty of traveling in the cattle cars, of the painful separation of loving families and the violation and exploitation of human beings by...other human beings.It was only after the liberation of the camps in 1945, that Wiesel discovered that his two older sisters, Hilda and Batya had survived. Although overjoyed at their reunion, the loss of his younger sister is something so painful, so beyond Wiesel's imagination, that even today, he cannot speak of it.For a full ten years, Wiesel remained silent regarding his experiences in the death camps, wondering why he had survived while so many others had perished. He said, &quot;In those years, it was very difficult to talk about the subject. I grew up in a mystical atmosphere, believing in silence, so I tried to use what I learned to purify the words, to purify language.&quot;Relocated to France, Wiesel studied at the Sorbonne where he learned French, philosophy, literature and psychology while working at a variety of odd jobs. Eventually, he chose journalism as his career and he tells of his travels to Jerusalem, New York and many other places.Although a dark and somber book, All Rivers Run to the Sea is not without its lighter moments. One of these occurs in New York after Wiesel was struck by a taxi, hospitalized and cornered by a somewhat overly-zealous attorney. As Wiesel lay in the hospital, immobilized, his French travel documents expired and he became a United States citizen.Although it is Wiesel's own father who haunts his sleeping dreams, it is another Being who troubles his waking thoughts, a Being Weisel, through the teachings of his faith, calls God.Evident in the quote taken from Ecclesiastes Wiesel chose as the subtitle of his memoirs, is the question that haunts his daily life: How could God, during the Holocaust, remain silent and watch the senseless death of six million human beings? Human beings, He, Himself, created?Although Wiesel's observations have been brilliant, he has, by his own admission, failed to reach an answer. Like the Hebrew sage who wrote Ecclesiastes, Wiesel observes that, &quot;All rivers run to the sea, yet the sea is never full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.&quot;Like the author of Ecclesiastes, Wiesel, in this book, makes a wide investigation of life, leading the reader from the happiness of his boyhood to the misery of his youth to the honors of his mature life (including the 1986 Nobel Peace Prize). And, like the author of Ecclesiastes, Wiesel finds no satisfying answer. For him, the joys of life are forever tinged with sadness; the specter of death is never far away.In All Rivers Run to the Sea, Elie Wiesel makes full use of the piety and wisdom of Hasidism and his memoirs read like a novel of the highest order. Intended for those who have made, or want to make, their own investigation of life and its mysteries, most especially that of humanity's incomprehensible inhumanity, this is a superb tale of unvarnished truthfulness, humility and awareness.Wiesel, in beautiful language that mingles sadness and joy, horror and triumph, writes for those of us who dare to look into the darkest moments of life, searching for a little light, a ray of the faintest hope. He writes, not so we know, but that we may hunger for more.An incredible human being whose tragedy became the impetus for a life filled with the profoundest meaning, Wiesel, like Martin Buber before him, is ready to &quot;hurtle down deep pathways, wander through invisible cemeteries, both seeking and fleeing solitude and receiving stories already told and those...yet to be told.&quot;All Rivers Run to the Sea is more than just a supremely important book; it is one of the most important books in the literature of humankind."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"I liked this book, but not for most of the reasons I read in other people's reviews. I believe they have overvalued it because of what the author has undergone, because he's written other, more stunning books, and because Wiesel is almost a monument in himself.Having heard of his Holocaust speeches and read his famous early concentration camp account, _Night_, I was unprepared for the naivete and gentle self-mockery that pervade this book. Yes, it talks about his roots, his tussles with religion, his adventures and misadventures as a journalist and friend/antagonist of the great.But what a surprise to see his repeated references to all the pretty faces that caught his eye and how badly he usually fared in approaching them: &quot;I indulged in some serious flirting, by which I mean that I talked to them of things too serious to achieve the desired result.&quot; &quot;I thought about all the girls in Versailles and all the unknown women in trains who didn't know how much I loved them, and about all the sins I lacked the courage to commit.&quot; &quot;I knew if I lowered my guard I would be hit by one of those thunderbolts I never knew how to handle. So of course I lowered my guard.&quot; &quot;I spoke to her of destiny, and of Dante for good measure. She told me not to be a fool.&quot;It may strike some readers almost as monotonous, but I found Wiesel's willingness to speak of things all men experience, yet never include in their autobiographies, refreshing. The other reviews stress the IMPORTANCE, almost PONDEROUSNESS, of this book, yet that's not what I'm left with at all. Wiesel is also amazingly open and childlike. For instance, recovering from injuries suffered in a massive car accident, he writes:&quot;Confined to bed and condemned to immobility, one dreams, one thinks about and sees the world in a whole new way. A simple painkiller is worth more than a dozen wondrous poems. I was more grateful to the nurse who came to turn me onto my back or stomach than I would have been to the most ravishing of creatures granting me her all. The most astonishing world news affected me less than the doctor's smile.&quot;This book shows the very human side of a &quot;mere&quot; journalist who in his time has become almost an institution."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"How many people in this world, as they go about living out their lives, will ever come to an understanding of the human cost that was exacted in the Holocaust? Sure, there will always be the auto-pilot responses in which people quote the six-million figure while shaking their heads, but often their knowledge does not go beyond this point. In the pages of &quot;All Rivers Run to the Sea,&quot; Elie Wiesel is willing to lay bare his soul in order to create understanding as a living, yet still wounded, witness of the Holocaust. Without this premise, perhaps this would be just another autobiography of a globe-trotting journalist, and the intrigue of international diplomacy. But it is much, much more than that. Indirectly, Wiesel shows himself as a man who is never able to be completely happy, completely alive...completely whole. When the Jewish people in his village were rounded up, shipped off, imprisoned, starved, and killed, a part of himself dies as well. Thus, there are constant flashbacks in the book to his parents who did not survive. As Elie experiences the events of life, and the decades pass on, the reality of what occurred to his family and so many others haunts his dreams and his writings. By and by, the reader is able to see that the human cost of the Holocaust is as close as their own mother and father. This is the subtle power of these memoirs."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"I received this book as a gift from my father a few years ago. I've just recently graduated from high school and found the time to read this book. I have always been interested in the atrocities of the holocaust, myself being Jewish; and after reading Wiesel's &quot;Night&quot; I've wanted to know more. I am reading Wiesel's memoirs right now and I can't say how much he is inspiring me to follow whims and dreams that I might have. I have a friend who is attending Boston University, and will have Prof. Wiesel for a Humanities professor. I have been so touched by Wiesel's words that I am forcing my friend to allow me to sit in on one of his classes. I will do anything just to meet, or even see the man who has suffered and survived so much."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"I found this a very compelling read, lasting over several readings. It's true the author did not stick tightly to chronological order, but anyone who has read his fiction knows his style tends to be very esoteric and rather free-floating (I personally do not care for his fiction, which I admit I do find to go over my head). However, as a reader, I certainly got a feel for emotions he felt throughout different experiences in his life. I found the last scene describing his emotions before and during his wedding to be really profound. It's true that there is a lot of Jewish content in this book, which may cause some of his analogies etc. to be less accessible to someone from a different background. However, for someone who wants to read a first-hand Holocaust experience without very strong graphic details, I do recommend it. (As a side note, just last week I actually attended a speech by Mr. Wiesel, and he is really a personable, funny, self-effacing and sweet man, not the really sad and somber person you might expect from his writings. I was surprised by this, pleasantly so!)"},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"Usually, I do not read much in the biography/autobiorgaphy category, but M. Wiesel's work is excellent. In surviving horrors which still have no words, he has also been present &amp; known some of the most interesting figures of the latter 20th century. I appreciate that M. Wiesel continues to question himself and motivations throughout his life. His thoughts on writing and the use of space/silence is wonderful to include within the memoirs-- especially as a companion to a first-time reader of his other works."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"I would strongly recommend that all readers on Amazon read the review whose title caption is ' Remember'. It is far more extensive and far better than the small remarks I am about to post.Elie Weisel is the one human being who more than any other has helped the world understand the horror of the Shoah , the Holocaust the Nazi destruction of one - third of the Jewish people six million human beings.For this he should always have a place in the historical consciousness of both the Jewish people and mankind.His memoir is at times very moving .For those who know his other work and his masterpiece ' Night' there will be much familiar here, though here the story is enriched by greater detail.I find myself whenever I am reading Weisel unable to really judge in abstract or purely literary terms. His significance as a human being, as a witness as one who has spoken to me in my own life is so great that my feeling is closer to reverence than anything else.I read this book with the idea that any additional detail about his life and work, any additional understanding of his thought about Man's relation to G-d would be worthwhile. I read this work as I will read all his future works as an admiring student of a great teacher.May he be blessed by many more years of great creative work."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"I read the book All Rivers Run to the Sea, by Elie Wiesel. This book is about his amazing journey all throughout the Holocaust. Elie was split apart from his family and had to experience the worst pain that you could imagine all on his own. I think this book is very depressing but it also makes you think about how glad and grateful you should be for having a family who loves and cares for you.Elie Wiesel is a very skilled writer and he easily makes you picture in your mind what he is writing about. I think that this book would be well suited for people who are either twelve or older. It is also well suited for people who enjoy reading about the Holocaust and all the people who experienced it. This book is more of a bibliography rather than a fairy tale so you have to be willing to read a lot. This book is also very long and at some parts it gets a little confusing but at other times it is really hard to put the book down. I do not think that this would be a very good book for teachers to have their students read in class because of the length. I think that they should use one of Wiesel other great books on the Holocaust.I really enjoyed this book and the style of Elie's writing. He described every thing very well and he kept my attention throughout the whole book. I hope that others get the chance to read this book and learn as much as I did about the Holocaust. This is a very good book and is well suited for young adults and people who are older as well. It teaches you a lot and makes you think about your life. This was a very good book and I hope others will read this book and get as much out of it as I did."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"This is one of the times when I think we should be able to go higher than 5 stars. Elie Wiesel's All Rivers Run to the Sea gave us a more in-depth look to the concentration camp survivor. He really gives us a rich experience in weaving together the threads of his past, from his days in school to the horror in the concentration camps, right up to his days of being a journalist, and ending with him as a groom. You really get a feel for the type of person he is as well - a wonderful, compassionate, and intelligent man. If you've read Night already, you're definitely going to want to check this out."},{"Title":"All Rivers Run to the Sea: Memoirs","review":"I was assigned to write a report about Elie Wiesel for English class. In this class, we had to read a book by the author and get information about their background, etc. I went to the library to find &quot;Night Trilogy&quot; but it was out, so I got the other books by Elie and read the covers and decided this would be a nice book to start with and follow it with &quot;The Generation After&quot;. I must say I was hooked. After reading &quot;Night&quot;, this book gives you even more insight into his life and makes his other works even more touching. A definite must read."},{"Title":"Wonderful Wire Works: An Easy Decorative Craft","review":"Although a few of the projects in this book look like they would come out well, I found most of them tacky, amateurish, and frankly, not very well-designed. I have several books on wire crafts, and this is by far the worst. I think that it is important to have good technique--for example, making round loops, avoiding leaving plier marks in the wire--and I found that in general, the projects were very poorly executed. In particular with regard to the more delicate projects, the person who made these left so many scratches and nicks on the wire that you could see the copper coming through the silver coating. Honestly, I would be embarassed to give some of the items in the photos as gifts because of the poor crafts(wo)manship. Other projects were just lame and seemed very flimsy. The cover project--wire-wrapped flatware--looks really cool and was ultimately the reason I bought the book. I haven't done the project, but I worry about whether it would survive normal use and washing. A much better book that has a variety of projects and will inspire creative thinking is Barbara McGuire's \\"Wire in Design.\\" Read the reviews and see what I mean."},{"Title":"Wonderful Wire Works: An Easy Decorative Craft","review":"I looked at his book and had to have it. The pictures are delicious and the writer makes everything seem so simple and straightforward. I plan to make the salt and pepper shakers, the bead and wire wine glasses and some of the jewelry as soon as I can get the materials. The materials issue is my one complaint about the book. Many projects require &quot;cabochons,&quot; which seem to be very hard to find. However, they are sold at stained glass supply houses as &quot;jewels.&quot; They are also sold in millimeters, not inches (which is how the size is given in the instructions). I wish that she had included supply sources as an appendix.

His protagonist is one Johnny Harlow, a Grand Prix champion who, as we meet him at the opening of the story, has just survived an horrific crash that has killed a fellow driver and crippled his girlfriend at trackside. In fact, as the story develops, it appears that Harlow has lost his edge and is trying to find his nerve in a bottle of Scotch.As with any Alistair MacLean story, nothing and nobody are quite who they seem to be. The reader soon learns that the members of Harlow's Coronado Racing Team are enmeshed in a mysterious plot, and one being played for deadly keeps. The disgraced Harlow turns out to have unexpected skills, and unexpected allies in the form of a journalist and a young teenager, as he tries to get to the bottom of the mystery. The climax of the movie is an exciting, vivid, life-or-death car chase between a Ferrari and an Aston Martin on a precipitious mountain road along the Mediterranean.MacLean's storyline is exotic and exciting, if a little too trite at the wrap-up. His dialogue is up to its usual snappy standards. \\"The Way To Dusty Death\\" does require a willing suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader, as top-flight drivers display the talents and motivations of characters in a James Bond movie. The reader is kindly advised to sit back and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"The Way to Dusty Death","review":"&quot;The Way to Dusty Death&quot; -- the title comes from a Shakespearean line -- is a revenge story set in the world of high speed auto racing. The protagonist, Johnny Harlan, is a gifted race car driver who appears to have fallen under the spell of alcohol after a devastating wreck that kills his best friend and fellow driver, along with maiming his girlfriend. But in actuality, Harlan's alcoholism is a facade to allow him to investigate the circumstances behind the accident.There's plenty of car chases, sneaking around, and other staples of the adventure novel. Still, the book gets only three stars because it's curiously unthrilling compared to other books by Alistair MacLean. While this one is okay, you would do better to look for any of the following:&quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; &quot;The Golden Gate&quot; &quot;The Black Shrike&quot; &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;"},{"Title":"The Way to Dusty Death","review":"Warning: Spoilers!!!!I love Alistair Maclean but some of his later efforts just don't measure up to his earlier tales. This story, set on the Grand Prix racing circuit, sounds promising but falls flat. To begin with, Mr Maclean is out of his element. When he's writing about the sea, or war, subjects he had experience with, he's very exciting. I get the feeling this book was not researched well and that Maclean was really struggling whenever he wrote about the racing. The protagonist-I can't really call him a hero-is John Harlow, and he's not very appealing. He's just as mean and cold as any of the killers he's after-he drops a man who claims he can't swim off a boat (turns out the guy can swim but Harlow didn't know that) and he prevents another man from trying to save him. He beats in a woman's face because she doesn't tell him where her handbag is. He runs two men off a cliff and watches them burn up in their car. He's too ruthless. His girlfriend, Mary, is a cipher. Maclean didn't have a lot of sex and romance in his books, but one thing he usually had was interesting heroines who were not just damsels in distress. They got some character development and usually managed to save the hero at least once or twice in the course of the story. Mary is just background-a kind of macguffin to move Harlow from point A to point B. I gave it three stars because it still has some of the qualities that made Maclean great-a lot of suspense and a riveting car chase at the end, but it's one of those take-it-or-leave-it books."},{"Title":"The Way to Dusty Death","review":"This is MacLean at his most cynical. We have the anti-hero, Johnny Harlow (not Harlan like an idiot reviewer wrote earlier), the stupid \\"femme fatale\\" and the fool youngster. MacLean was a fine writer in his day and he came close to recapturing that earlier style in this book. But he falls short because the protagonist has no heart. That's the difference. Keith Mallory, John Talbot, Johnny Bentall, John Carter & Johnny Nichols had heart. This guy didn't. He was just a cold-blooded killer like the protagonists in subsequent books. The saving grace of this book is that it has one of the most exciting car chase scenes I've experienced since the chase scene from the movie, \\"Bullit.\\" Though Bruno Wildermann was somewhat likeable and sympathetic in \\"Circus,\\" he was still a cold killer. Read old MacLean."},{"Title":"The Way to Dusty Death","review":"It took me two nightshifts to get through the book. In reading hours I would estimate it to be approximately 4 hours.

This book deals with his impressions of Spain while he was ambassador. His rather narrow mind saw vice in the very faces of Catholic priests.

Both men and women were equal before the law and the women of ancient Egypt had many rights before the law that were not granted again in the western world till the late 19th century.This book discusses male attitudes towards women, as has survived in ancient manuscripts, women in society and law, health and childbirth (where you can be disgusted by the medical remedies), dress and adornment, household duties and women of power such as the four Queens Regent of Egypt and the power and history of the Divine Wives of Amun.For anyone who is interested in the lives of women in ancient Egypt this book is well researched and informative and makes an interesting read."},{"Title":"Stylebook: A Usage Guide for Writers and Editors","review":"I was first introduced to this reference when I was in college as a journalism major.

Normally, I finish books in a day or so, but this one was so boring, it took nearly a week. I had to force myself to finish it so I could move on to something good. I found the characters, including heroine Claire Gulliver, incredibly dull. The dialogue was painfully stiff and unnatural. With so many characters on the tour to England, I was amazed at the lack of variation in speaking style. The mystery here is pretty dull too and I found the resolution unsatisfying. I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan and enjoy cozies, period mysteries and contemporary mysteries, but wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they're suffering from insomnia."},{"Title":"Tea is for Terror (A Claire Gulliver Mystery)","review":"This was an easy read. An enjoyable way to pass the time.What I liked: The main character, Claire, is a former librarian, and owns a book store. I always enjoy reading about people who like books as much as I do. She is a novice traveler, in Europe for the first time. She is seeing everything fresh and that gives it an appealing perspective.What I didn't like: The first half of the book moves slowly. It is more about character development than moving the action forward. Occasional chapters were inserted that told a bit from the bad guys point of view, or from the intelligence agencies view. These were a little confusing and broke up the flow of the story."},{"Title":"Tea is for Terror (A Claire Gulliver Mystery)","review":"I am still slogging along in this dreadful story(84%).

The funniest misuse was the word \\"thong\\" when the author was obviously referring to a \\"throng\\" at the airport.

The handful of major characters in this book feel like they have stepped out of normal life, from the ambitious tough old bird Lucy Springer to the protagonist, the genuinely nice and somewhat shy Claire Gulliver. It's only fair to take them to jolly old England, of course, where most of what greets us is people getting to know another as the clues steadily accumulate. If this book has a weakness, it is in the latter half, when the pacing falls offbeat and never quite regains the upper hand, but in all, a mystery read that compares to the biggest of the major publishing houses."},{"Title":"Tea is for Terror (A Claire Gulliver Mystery)","review":"First this is a series you should read in publication order as one villain does reoccur in some of the books.The main character Claire is delightful and I found these books a fun mystery to read.

I'm not a mean person, but I do believe when others purchase a product they should get their money's worth. Not here. There may be potential with this series but the author really, really needs to sharpen her pencil, edit, create proper transitions between paragraphs and topic changes and learn to use a dictionary!

You will learn about the strict disipline and schedule in their daily life. You will also learn how they celebrated holidays, like Christmas.I read this chapter to my family on every Christmas Eve. You learn this and more through a young little mischievious girl who went to live there whe she was very young, because her mother could not take care of her anymore. At the begging of the book, after she was nursed back to health by her care giver she was taken to school, but to young to attend yet, so she was playing house and needed som butter to cook with so she went around and got a yellow crayon from every student and melted on the stove. this is just one of the stories. This book also has what kind of craft projects they did and how they went about doing them. I being the daughter of the author, Esther A. Hulings Gilbert, love to read this book, to see how mischievious my moter was when she was young. This indeed is a wonderful book about the Sharkers way of life, for it came right from the journals she kept as she was growing up."},{"Title":"The life and times of Elizabeth I","review":"Elizabeth is the subject of scores of biographies and this isn't one of the better ones.

In The Life and Times of Elizabeth the 1st, by Neville Williams an abundant amount of information is given about Elizabeth's life before and during her reign as Queen of England. Before Elizabeth became Queen she suffered through a rough childhood without a mother, being called horrible names by people and being imprisoned by her own sister. During her reign as Queen, Elizabeth had to deal with life in court, religious matters and being courted often by suitors, yet choosing to rule on her own. This book also has many illustrations, which helps you in your understanding of the book.I felt this book had a lot of useful information about Queen Elizabeth's life. I also found it a very intriguing read. This book relates to the book To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. In To Kill A Mockingbird Atticus shows courage. He shows courage when he took Tom Robinsons case and tried to save him even though he knew in doing so he knew it could possibly hurt him and his family. Like Atticus Elizabeth also showed courage. She showed courage when she chose to rule England on her own even though she was being pressured to marry. There is so much to learn about this incredible monarch and what she went through throughout her life. I would recommend this book for ages 12 and up."},{"Title":"Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball","review":"I've always been a fan of Vicki Lawrence and purchased her autobiography knowing I would enjoyit. And I did. It's great to read about how Vicki broke into show business, being discovered at the age of seventeen by superstar Carol Burnett. As a result, Vicki was thrusted into the limelight when she became a regular on Burnett's new variety series in 1967. Vicki writes about her struggles to complete college while being on a hit show and being torn over wanting to quit overher parent's objections. Miss Lawrence also writes about her strained relationship with hermother, who often faked suicide to meet her demands. Vicki also takes us through her successes as a Number One pop artist and gives us behind-the-scene tales of portraying &quot;Mama&quot; on thelong-running &quot;Mama's Family&quot; television series. I've read the book twice now and am going for athird. I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball","review":"Vicki by Vicki Lawrence is a great book!

Somewhat by accident, I started reading autobiographies of 70's pop culture icons I grew up with, one of which was Carol Burnett. Her story is just amazing, how she grew up with her grandmother in a little one-room welfare apartment while her parents were basically incapacitated alcoholics, and how she made it to UCLA, and then to NYC. Anyway that led to the Vicki book which was also interesting to read for a glimpse inside the world of showbiz. But between Vicki, her Columbia-grad co-writer and Simon & Schuster, they turned out some really bad writing in this book, which I can't understand. I thought the reason to have a co-writer was to edit and professionalize the copy. I didn't think I was going to make it through the whole book because of it but I managed. Anyway, I appreciated reading about her visits to the servicemen in Vietnam and felt bad about her mother's poor mental health. And I'm glad we have some good comedy TV...I'm sure we don't even realize how much good the levity and laughter do for us. I hope to read about Tim Conway & Harvey Korman as well."},{"Title":"Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball","review":"I just received an autographed copy of &quot;Vicki!&quot; for Christmas, and I read it in 7 hours. I couldn't put it down! Lawrence has incredible wit and humor in her writing, and frequently makes the reader laugh unexpectedly. It's amazing what a truly adventurous life she has lead! The only negative thing is seeing how horribly she was treated by her cruel sister, mother, first husband, and certain business affiliates. Lawrence not once appeared to be &quot;mean-spirited&quot; to anyone. Instead, she rightfully justified wrongs that were done to her. Otherwise, &quot;Vicki!&quot; is a joy to read, and has more pictures than any other autobiography I have read. From &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; to &quot;Mama's Family&quot; to &quot;Win, Lose, or Draw&quot; to &quot;Vicki!&quot;, this book is sure to entertain you for hours on end. I already can't wait for my next reading . . . and take it from me, it *does* make a great gift!"},{"Title":"Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball","review":"I have always Vicki Lawrence since I was watching the Carol Burnett reruns as a child. I enjoy all the cast members. According to the Booklist review, what a wonderful country for somebody like Vicki to write an autobiography then they don't know too much about her. She was a key player on the Carol Burnett Show for several years. I like her honesty and candidness about her relationship with Carol. She is also very protective about her relationship with other cast members like Harvey Korman, Tim Conway, and Lyle Waggoner. Her relationship with her family is a lot less to be desired though. Her mother pushed her into entering contests despite her lack of interest. Vicki succeeded far beyond her wildest imagination. Carol Burnett was her guardian angel through it all. I am giving the book 4 stars because I would have liked her to elaborate on those years as Mama Harper, her most infamous creation. There is a reason that show lasted 130 episodes and was successful in syndication where network television got it all wrong. I wish they would bring back syndicated comedies like they did in the 1980s. Audiences like myself miss situation comedy just as we miss music videos on MTV. The book was written 1994 after her talk show was cancelled. I have to say that her talk show was more like Rosie or Ellen before they came along. Her pictures showed a good time on the set but not behind the scenes. Vicki, the talk show, would have been successful if the production company had let Vicki handle it her way. Maybe it's because she is a woman that she got screwed around from the business. Her first chapter is that I thought Show Business was supposed to be fun but I think over the years, her personality had to adjust to fit the cruel side of this business. Despite all that, she is in a long term marriage with Al Schultz and the mother of 2 wonderful children like Courtney and Garrett. I don't know what the production company like Group W was thinking when they mistreated Vicki Lawrence. She enjoyed her time as a talk show hostess. Vicki has played many roles over her years, Carol Burnett's sidekick, Mama Harper, Game Show Hostess, and Talk Show Hostess. I feel terrible that a great injustice was done to her. The Vicki show should have lasted longer. She was clearly better than Ellen and Rosie put together. Ellen's show is more like the Vicki show once was except that Vicki is a television legend. She's been around the block a few times. She's funny naturally and sweet too. Maybe she's too sweet for own good, maybe that's the business thought they screw around with her. Anyway, I am glad that Vicki has mended her relationships with Carol Burnett in this book. Carol and Vicki are more like sisters with their conflicts over the years but still remained friends. So Vicki criticizes the business. She has ever right to because if she did not. It would be like saying smooth sailing from her Carol Burnett days to the Vicki talk show. I knew that once Mama's Family was out from under the network control. They would succeed and they did. Mama's Family was the number one sitcom in syndication. It even beat other more popular shows like Tonight Show in the New Orleans market. I only wished she talked about the years on Mama's Family. I am sure that Vicki will write a sequel to her autobiography one day. I am waiting for her to get her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. She has been nominated for Emmys as an actress, talk show hostess, and game show hostess. Once more, she is one of the most likable people in the business today. She is still doing Mama Harper too. We just can't get enough of both."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"This book, excellent for self-study and for use as a textbook, covers a subject that has had enormous impact in science and technology. One can say with confidence that neural networks will increase in importance in the decades ahead, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. The book is a comprehensive overview, and does take some time to read and digest, but it is worth the effort, as there are many applications of neural networks and the author is detailed in his discussion.In the first part of the book, the author introduces neural networks and modeling brain functions. A good overview of the modeling of neural networks and knowledge representation is given, along with a discussion of how they are used in artificial intelligence. Ideas from computational learning are introduced, as well as the important concept of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The VC dimension is defined in this book in terms of the maximum number of training examples that a machine can learn without errors. The author shows it to be a useful parameter, and allows one to avoid the difficult problem of finding an exact formula for the growth function of a hypothesis space.In the next part of the book, the author discusses learning machines that have a teacher. The single-layer perceptron is introduced and shown to have an error-correction learning algorithm that is convergent. There is a fine discussion of optimization techniques and Bayes classifiers in this part. The least-mean-square algorithm is generalized to the back-propagation algorithm in order to train multi-layer perceptrons along with a discussion on how to optimize its performance using heuristics. The author gives a detailed discussion of the limitations of back-propagation learning. In addition, the radial-basis function networks are introduced. Supervised learning is viewed as an ill-posed hypersurface reconstruction problem, which is then solved using regularization methods. Support vector machines are introduced as neural networks that arise from statistical learning theory considerations via the VC dimension. A summary is given of the differences between the different approaches in neural network learning machines. Committee machines, based on the divide and conquer algorithm, are also treated. Here the strategy is to divide the learning process into a number of experts, with the expectation that the collective efforts of these experts will more efficiently arrive at the solution.The next part of the book introduces unsupervised learning machines. The ability of machines to discover useful information, such as patterns or features, in the input data is taken as an acid test for real intelligence. Hebbian learning via principal components analysis is discussed, along with competitive learning via self-organizing maps. The author uses computer simulations to illustrate the behavior of systems of neurons. Vector quantization is brought in as another supervised learning technique to fine tune the quality of the classifiers. Most interestingly, information-theoretic models are discussed with mutual information techniques used effectively as unsupervised learning algorithms. Some elementary but interesting examples of single neurons under the influence of noise are discussed in detail. The topic of Boltzmann machines is discussed also, and the physicists will find the treatment particularly fascinating, as it takes ideas from statistical mechanics and applies them to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Other more general statistical machines, such as Helmholtz machines, and mean-field theoretic approaches are discussed also. Reinforcement learning, using dynamic programming techniques is treated in detail.The book ends with a treatment of nonlinear dynamical techniques to study the behavior of neural networks. The discussion makes use of many examples and computer experiments, and there are some good exercises at the end of the chapters for further analysis. Dynamical systems employing short-term memory and feedforward are discussed along with a treatment of stability in nonlinear dynamical systems. Feedback mechanisms are used to obtain input-output mapping. The definition of chaos is very weak, as it only employs the positivity of a Lyapunov exponent, but this is suitable for the purposes in the book.The applications of neural networks are vast and space prevents here a comprehensive list. I have found them an excellent tool to study load balancing algorithms in distributed computing and networks, modeling of mobile communications, options pricing, and computational biology. There are also dozens of companies that specialize solely in neural network algorithms. No doubt as new learning algorithms are discovered and computers become faster, neural networks will play a major role in creating independent, autonomous, intelligent machines. This book will give the reader a solid understanding of how neural networks fit into the computational learning paradigm."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"Extremely concise, extremely complete. Every new page has a new concept or method. In the first chapter, I knew more than I did after reading two other books I bought on the subject.I would suggest, however, not to use this as an introduction. It's a bit more rigorous mathematically than some others, so use it if you understand the concepts first. It will shine new insight onto the concepts you already know, but it will probably fail at teaching them to you from the ground up.I suggest this for the experienced Artificial Intelligence experimenter.And for the love of god, use Perl for your test programs! Writing C++ classes for artificial intelligence is wholly impractical!"},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"About theory, the book is good, but; it needs more practical or numerical examples, in order to get the information understandable.There are too many concepts and ideas that without a good example, it is very hard to assimilate.Also the computer oriented experiments in matlab, do not use theneural network tool box, so it is not possible to get the gap to convert knowledge into computer code.If these two recommendations are improved in a next edition, the book will become and excellent one.thanks,"},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"I used this as a textbook for a Neural Networks course I did in the second year of my undergraduate program in Mathematics and Computing.My mathematical background till that point of time comprised Linear Algebra and upper level Calculus. This being rather 'limited' mathematical exposure, I found the book quite difficult to follow. It becomes harder when you are expected to convert the mathematical equations into working programs (without using tool-boxes or libraries, i.e.). The end-of-chapter exercises are pretty hard, and try to go beyond what the text talks about, most undergraduates may not be able be able to appreciate that. I think this is an excellent reference book for those who are pretty comfortable with Math. For undergraduates doing a first course in Neural Networks, I strongly recommend Timothy Masters' \\"Practical Neural Network recipes in C++\\". The math there is manageable, and yes, it comes with working code to make your life easier."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"I found this book to be an excellent &quot;research&quot; reference.

All the algorithms are introduced by clear and rigorous mathematical theory. I think it's well suited for teachers and undergraduates."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"This book is a recommended book for NN course. Many classmates regret to buy it initially as they find the book very unapproachable. I share the same view until one of my lecturers has painstakingly explained the concepts behind back-propagation and regularization. This book is one of the few where you can find the steps involved in implementing Optimal Brain Surgery. (Table 4.6). This book may discourage beginner."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"This is one of the most comprehensive texts on one of the most important topics in current computer science. Though it is a graduate level text and is exorbitantly expensive, this book covers what you need to know. This book does assume a fairly sophisticated mathematical background, but those willing to bone-up on their math can understand this book quite well. If you are looking for a book to explain neural networks in detail, look no further than here."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"If you are going to start learning neural networks, this is probably the best book with which to begin. It does a good job in how it progresses through the subject. It spends two chapters introducing the subject in a very complete fashion, then five chapters more on the subject of supervised learning with neural networks, and five more chapters on unsupervised learning. The final three chapters gets off into the subject of non-linear dynamical systems.Although the book is very complete, it is also mathematically rigorous. To really understand it from cover to cover you would need to know - both conceptually and practically - calculus, linear algebra, adaptive signal processing, and dynamical systems, since this book assumes you already know these subjects and makes heavy use of their properties. Fortunately, to get a good basic understanding of what neural networks are and what they can accomplish, you won't need to understand the entire book. I found chapters 1-7 to be fairly accessible and self-contained. It is only once you get past the subject of supervised learning in chapter eight that the mathematics and the book get particularly difficult. Another problem with the book is that it abruptly goes from a forest to a trees viewpoint of neural networks. It will be working along in a very theoretical manner for some number of pages, when suddenly, out of nowhere, it will mention something practical or show an example that clarifies a great deal. Therefore you will need to read the book carefully.My personal recommendation is that you go through the first seven chapters of this book to get a good viewpoint of the theoretical basics of neural networks and supervised learning, and then read Jeff Heaton's \\"Introduction to Neural Networks with Java\\" to get a good practical viewpoint on the subject. Then, if you need to return to the book for the more advanced chapters, you will be better prepared. It would also be best to use this book in conjunction with taking a course on the subject. I think it would be very rough going to try to understand this book via self-study alone."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"I really like this book. It covers a lot of different material and does an excellent job of laying the foundations of the subject. The mathematical descriptions are a little hard to follow since they are terse but perusing them is well worth the effort. The book is a gem.

Easily one of the most valuable books on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"This is the first book for everyone interested in the subject. A well-written and well-illutrated encyclopedia of Neural projects, including all the fundamental questions at the forefront of research in Neural Networks.

It is written in a very clear fashion and is very complete. The math requirement is not that advanced and thus is appropriate for a relatively wide audience. The book's style has a combination of engineering and statistics. So students and professionals from either area should find it useful. Further, the book does not just cover neural networks, it has other topics such as Kalman Filtering, information theory, and statistical mechanics! I bought the book over ten years ago and it remains one of my favorites in machine learning / data mining."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"Haykin is pretty well established in his area and he definitely produces high quality work. the book is quite complete. What I particularly like about this book is that it connects neural networks to other machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines, Boltzmann machines, independent component analysis etc. Another plus of this book is the presentation of algorithms. Haykin gives very detailed description of the algorithms presented. Even if you might not want to understand all the mathematical details you will be able to implement them."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"An excellent entry level text on the subject. The author covers most aspects of neural networks, although not quite as in depth as I had hoped in some areas. Suitable for use as a textbook if you are taking a class on the subject, or as a self study book. Gets a bit too preachy and defensive about the practicality of neural networks. The author obviously cut his teeth in NN's during the 60/70's. IMO anyone who already bought the book doesnt need convincing that neural networks work. I recommend at least a working knowledge of calculus and statistical analysis."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"I Like this book...it even has PCA analysis theeory in it...very nice, practical and sound."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"I imagine this is a great book if you have a background in engineering. I took an engineering course with this book as the course text. Because I did not have the background, I struggled with the text and the problem sets."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"Haykin's book is probably the most comprehensive compendium of traditional neural network theory currently available. I say \\"traditional\\" because historically neural networks developed within the field of computer science, only loosely inspired by actual neuroscience. Feedforward networks, backpropagation, self-organizing maps, PCA, and hierarchical machines fit into this traditional lineage. A second branch of neural networks, inspired more heavily by biology, have sought to model brain function and structure. Within this camp are network models such as adaptive resonance theory (ART), BCS/FCS, integrate-and-fire models, and a variety of others. Though this second branch of neural network theory has applications in pattern recognition, image processing, clustering, etc., Haykin barely mentions it. In other words, Haykin presents the material that computer scientists and engineers want to see, but skimps on the more biological side of the field. That being said, the material covered in Haykin is very well-presented, with clear mathematical notation and typesetting throughout. The book is accessible to graduates and advanced undergraduates. It should be on the shelf of every serious researcher, though workers in the biological sciences may want supplementary material. Computer scientists, mathematicians, and other engineers will not be disappointed at all."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"While I did not read this reference entirely, I found it a useful complement to other references on artificial neural networks, in providing formal analysis on particular neural networks. The first chapter provides an excellent, albeit somewhat technical, introduction to artificial neural networks, and the reader with a background in physics, mathematics or engineering, may actually find this book, in conjunction with a workbook an excellent starting point for learning about neural networks."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"Considering all the other clearly written and mathematically complete books on neural network theory you should not waste your time with this one. For feedforward nets try bishop's book, which, though mathematically more difficult, gives real insight into the complex behavior of these types of nets. Rock on."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"Read the other reviewers below for more details and various viewpoints. Here I'm assuming that you will hire a reputable consultant or tutor to either translate the book into ordinary English more or less or to teach you the mathematics behind it. Neural networks are important for everybody to understand because this is one of the important directions that computers and robotics are taking: learning things. As you move into this book, you'll discover that there are important categories that such learning machines fall into: learning with a teacher (that is, with some examples for the machine to learn from) or without a teacher (with no such examples), also called supervised versus unsupervised learning. There's also learning without or with feedback (including subtypes of feedforward networks with short-term memory, associative memory, and recurrent networks which use input-output mapping or relationships). Even high school and college students who wonder why they have to learn statistics and probability may be astonished to discover that some of the most effective learning machines involve statistics and probability. They fall into various categories such as maximum entropy (literally maximizing the entropy), maximum likelihood (again, the idea of maximizing likelihood as used in everyday language is a rough approximation, though the mathematical one is much more precise), minimizing the energy (Hopfield networks), minimizing mean square error (literally minimizing squares of statistical errors, though there is more to it), etc. In the last category mentioned fall (mostly) Kalman filter-predictors, which I worked on at the Defense Department in the 1980s. I'm currently more interested in the use of maximum entropy methods combined with the others, since my field of logic-based probability (LBP) is closely related to maximum entropy. See some of my other reviews for discussion of various of these topics, including statistics and probability. Haykin and Prentice Hall have done a very good job with this difficult and encyclopedic material."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"This book could be good for Electrical Engineers or Physicists interested in the field, but I really would not recommend it to researchers with background in Computer Science. The notations and everything are makes reading and following naturally harder for us."},{"Title":"Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation","review":"I was expecting to see a book in good to very good condition. It turned out to be a used, chinese edition, with cutouts on pages. Looks unprofessional. The pages feel like they'll tear anytime."},{"Title":"Optimizing ColdFusion 5","review":"Great Book! I have been using ColdFusion for 3 years, and read many ColdFusion books. Every book I've come across simply tells you &quot;how&quot; to do stuff. I can only learn how to do a &lt;CFOUTPUT&gt; so many times. However, Optimizing ColdFusion takes a different approach - it takes what I already know, and shows me how to do it well. This is the first CF book I have read that covers the core development obstacles that we as ColdFusion developers and designers struggle with on a daily basis. Not only does this book analyze trouble areas, but it also shows how to improve upon application design, coding, and even some troubleshooting. I also liked that this book brushed on the Fusebox methodology, and discussed how Spectra impacted enterprise ColdFusion development. The information is this book seems to define the distinction between ColdFusion developers and ColdFusion gurus. I would definitely recommend this book to other ColdFusion users."},{"Title":"Optimizing ColdFusion 5","review":"Although there is some good basic level information in this book, it is not for the person trying to learn how to program Cold Fusion, but how to make your Cold Fusion programming better. The book has great examples and how tos of everything from setting up the Cold Fusion Administrator to writing better SQL statements. I particularly found the SQL statement information very helpful. The author (Chris Cortes) goes beyond writing simple SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE statements. He gets into far more complex SQL like writing SELECT statements within a SELECT statement, and writing your SQL so that you optimize the speed of your queries. He also provides good examples of the new query of a query functionality that CF 5.0 offers. Cortes also offers great information on the proper usage of various CF tags and functions, not just telling you how to use them, but when it is best to use them. Overall, this is the best CF book I have read. However, make sure you know a little something about CF before buying this book."},{"Title":"Optimizing ColdFusion 5","review":"Great Book!

This led me to buy a copy of his book to learn more about one of the nutrients I am taking. Everything about this book was a very pleasant surprise. I never thought that a health book could be so interesting. I've now read it twice, but I still pick it up and read a few pages just for fun. This book is full of interesting information about our bodies, diseases and aging. It makes science understandable. This is a very good book!"},{"Title":"100 & Healthy: Living Longer with Phytomedicines from the Republic of Georgia","review":"After reading this book,I became intrigued with the authors research. I remember seeing the commercials for a yogurt company years ago about people living for mamy years and being productive into their late 80's. I investigated where I can purchase some of these wonderful herbs.I am 67 years old and have a chronic back problem, I started using Rhododendron Caucasicum and am now enjoying a pain free existemce.This book was written in a very clear and understanding manner.
