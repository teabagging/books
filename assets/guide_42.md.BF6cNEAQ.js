But things are looking up for its western province where Charles Gould, native-born but of English ancestry, opens a silver mine with the backing of an American magnate and a British railroad company. Conrad's interest is the tension between the European residents of Sulaco, who think that their financial interests are bringing stability and prosperity to a dysfunctional state, and the Costaguanan peasants who think that foreigners are plundering their land. After reading NOSTROMO, I'm pretty confident now that Conrad was a colonialist and a racist, as some critics have long charged, but I think he was a nuanced one.Initially, we get only allusions to Nostromo, an Italian immigrant who distinguishes himself as the leader of the port's longshoremen and by his readiness to undertake difficult tasks for the Europeans. Everyone calls him the \\"indispensable man\\" and he becomes a Costaguanan national myth, but he remains an enigma for much of the novel. Eventually Nostromo's story, his thirst for recognition and wealth, takes over and and relegates the political drama to the background.Unfortunately, I found NOSTROMO tedious. Conrad called this 400-page depiction of a whole society his \\"largest canvas\\", and he gets so involved in world-building that there's no dramatic push. Only about halfway through do we start to see a glimmer of a plot. If your only previous experience with Conrad (as I think is the case with many potential readers) is HEART OF DARKNESS, where the action flows as steadily as the Congo River that is the work's setting, then you may well be frustrated by the slow pace of this novel. Also, Conrad's peculiar English (he didn't speak the language regularly until the age of 20) is intriguing at shorter spans but here just contributes to the burdensome nature of getting through this book. I appreciate a number of elements of Conrad's art, but I find it hard to recommend this.I read the Wordsworth Classics edition of this book. It features a decent introduction and footnotes by scholar Robert Hampson, as well as a glossary of the foreign-language terms sprinkled throughout the text. Unfortunately, the quality of Wordsworth Classics publications leaves much to be desired and after a single reading the binding and paper were beginning to fall apart."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"I gave up on this book the first time I tried it and am doing better this time.It feels like a very contempoary story as it charts the progress of a silver mine in a Central American corrupt republic which envies the English owners but dare not kill the goose that lays the golden (silver ?) eggs.A story of our time."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"The book was wonderful - couldn't put it down.

Nevertheless, it is of high literary quality-- complex, interesting, definitely with the distinct voice and style of this author."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Joseph Conrad had a few things in common with 'Our Man', Nostromo, one of the compelling characters of his little morality tale resonating with metaphorical reverberations that just expand in circles to infinity. He became an orphan at a relatively early age, and went to sea at the age of 14. English was like, the 5th language he learned, and yet, his talent as a writer and story teller and poser of complex unanswerable questions places him among the most gifted in the tradition of world literature.Like 12:34 \\"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\\"The earliest civilizations may have evolved to brew beer--but it is true that the stability and longevity of a civilization owes itself to the harmony and balance of it's capitalization. Some primate anthropologists once dumped a truckload of bananas in a clearing in the forest, and the social order of the Apes broke down completely. Instead of the ragged system of social checks and balances, the Alpha male climbed up on top of the pile and took possession of the bananas, his close associates then handed out the bananas according to the status of the other members of the social order. Those with the least status were teased and tormented. The Alpha male was particularly generous to the young females he courted. All it took to upset millions of years of complex primate social evolution was a truckload of bananas.Guano, of course, is also a valuable commodity, for fertilizer, it stains many a rocky outcrop white, and of course, Costaguana seems to have an inverted meaning from Costa Rico. However, Rico it may be, because of the silver mine, but no form of lasting social order ever seems to prevail. Trying to find the right balance between the production of silver, attracting foreign investment, and establishing social and economic progress is difficult when you are surrounded by competing brutes who all want the goose that laid the silver eggs for themselves. The present owner of the goose might just blow it all up to kingdom come. And the one man who might be counted upon to prevail in such chaos, comes to realize his own value, his own significance, is not really set as high as he had anticipated by whom he has served both faithfully, and heroically. What is 'treasure', after all? What is the quality of high value? In the end, the love that Nostromo finds seems more valuable than gold, forget the cache of silver. And yet, accidents can happen. All roads lead to the graveyard. Nobody takes it with them. So, what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, if he loses his soul?Conrad, once again, has found a situation, and a story that asks fundamental questions about the nature of 'value', and competition, and collaboration, and self interest, and what it takes to find balance and harmony among competing forces. He invests fully realized figures with character. His style is unusual, and somewhat fragmented in it's modular structure, yet there are times when he paints long flowing pictures that almost seem to spring to life. There is a certain magic in what he seems to be able to accomplish. He is a spellbinder, an effortless master of the psychology of piquing interest and attaching it to the storyteller's tellingI first read the novel more than 30 years ago, but re-read it recently, and was even more impressed on my second reading, with both his skill and the depth of his story. Conrad has always been one of my favorite authors, and Nostromo is one of his greatest achievements. He was a pioneer of the 'modern' novel, and his interest in verisimilitude, in asking difficult questions trump any hope for happy endings--Conrad has a dark view of human nature, and Nostromo, the novel, is an exercise in showing what it takes to corrupt the treasure of a good human nature. In the case of Nostromo, it was simply not being revered by men for whom he had risked everything. Conrad seems to be continually asking: where CAN you lay up your treasures where dust and moths will not corrupt?"},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Set in the fictional South American country of Sulaco, Nostromo is, on the surface, the story of a revolution and counterrevolution. Deeper, it is a dark novel of descent of one man from hero to thief and the destructive influence of excess of personality. Each personality is a contrast to every other, providing the sort of rich cast of characters that marks the greatest of novels. Certainly, this is one of Conrad's finest and a triumph of 20th century fiction."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"\\"Nostromo\\" takes too long to get started, never really gels into anything worthwhile, and sputters out like a Roman candle in mud. Other than that, I guess I liked it.Near the western coast of the Latin American country of Costaguana is a vast silver mine owned by one Charles Gould, an English expatriate who enjoys near-kingly powers over the nearby port town of Sulaco. When revolution threatens Gould's empire, \\"Don Carlos\\" gets his doughty employee Nostromo to spirit away his silver reserves. That help comes at a price, though, to Gould, to Nostromo, and all who covet the silver.Many call \\"Nostromo\\" Conrad's masterpiece, saying it challenges readers to accept a bleak vision of a world where all are damned by greed or apathy. I agree it's challenging; it took me long enough to read through it. But it doesn't instill the same kind of awe in me Conrad classics like \\"Lord Jim\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness\\" did.I think the problem lies in part with a plot that is all over the place, starting with a lengthy inventory of the topography around Sulaco, then an opening episode which occurs about 30% into the story, which Conrad presents at length before rewinding the plot spool to the actual beginning. Time shifts are Conrad's thing, he uses them effectively in \\"Lord Jim\\" and they are one of his principal contributions to the post-modern literary vocabulary. But as he does this over and over, the mind swims for no good reason, looking in vain for some chronology to sink its teeth into.The other problem is the message of the book. Judging from its many champions, \\"Nostromo\\" is about the evils of colonialism. But I wonder how much of that mindset is being imported from the less ambiguous \\"Heart Of Darkness.\\"We do see how the mine is being used to enrich a distant North American tycoon, and one of our earliest images of Nostromo shows him pulling local peasantry out of their humble huts to work at the mine. But are the peasants really being exploited any more than if they were working a mine in Kentucky? They think enough of Gould to rally around him when his empire is threatened, and one of the few non-European characters we hear from calls him \\"a just man.\\" The revolution Gould and his cronies snuff out is a bloody farce, and the people of Costaguana, nearly mute in Conrad's narrative, seem to deserve no better than they get.\\"Stratagems, providing they did not fail, were honorable; the easy massacre of an unsuspecting enemy evoked no feelings but those of gladness, pride, and admiration,\\" Conrad writes by way of explaining the endless parade of revolutions that rowel Costaguana. (The country's name is about the only tinge of humor in the book.)Conrad does score better in presenting the human condition as a thing of wretched glory, of transitory pleasures and interludes of seeming value trickling restlessly toward pointlessness. If he was a rock band, Conrad would have been Pink Floyd. He's always lifting the veils of appearances to expose people's base selves.Even love is phony: \\"She was incapable of sustained emotion. She was sincere in what she said, but she slept placidly at night...For her soul was light and tender with a pagan sincerity in its impulses.\\"There's also Dr. Monygham, a sardonic character who sees through everything with his bitter, gimlet eye. His relationship with Nostromo is the closest the book gets to a synthesis of ideas, of the value of living entirely through thought or action. But like everything else in \\"Nostromo,\\" this never quite gels.I admire Conrad, and see in \\"Nostromo\\" a book that advanced the conception of the novel, with its wide scope, multiple story arcs, time shifts, and resolute presentation of happiness as an illusion. But those same strengths keep the book from being as comprehensible or enjoyable as it could be."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Revolution is a fertile ground for nascent ideologies, and neology is perhaps the richest algar on which emerging heroes feed upon. Costaguena is a territory existing only in the unparalleled imagination of Conrad, whose mind was perpetually stimulated by an abstract, unknown, and merely projected world. Nostromo is his instrument of oscillation; ultimately a pendulum caught in the momentum of change, he falls into the precipice that separates the glory of selfhood and the danger of vanity.From the beginning, Conrad sheds equally heavy recognition on a string of characters. Charles Gould an European capitalist trapped in his father's tragic political enmeshment, Decoud an uprooted native who dies proving his credential, and Antonio Avellanos an audacious aristocrat who carries the torch of her generation are have the protagonist make-up. But following the Greek formula, Nostromo is the true hero who fumbles into falsity because of his one d&eacute;faut: hubris. The enormous vanity develops into his temptress, and in a way, Nostromo makes the conscious choice to let his incorruptible pride corrupts his morale.The fatality of Nostromo, very much like many of Conrad's protagonists, marks the inability of men, in the utmost bleakness of mental solitude, to reconcile to the goodness of nature."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Back when &quot;Nostromo&quot; first came out, the Times Literary Supplement said that the book could stand some serious editing in its first two hundred pages. Others said Conrad managed to turn a short story into a novel. I agree on both counts. In the unabridged audio version, even with as fine a reader as Frank Muller, I had to wait till tape 8 or 9 (of 11) to begin to get into some really interesting plot, dialogue, and character development. The conversation between Nostromo and the doctor -- for me the high point of the book, pereceptive and pointed -- was about tape 10. Then the book returned to its rather unimaginative self till it limped to its end. Perhaps a cautionary tale for our century, written at its beginning, about the dangers of obscene wealth and thoughtless loyalty, the book has been superseded by many superior and more engaging tales of its kind (like Steinbeck's &quot;Winter of our Discontent&quot;).

But the book has an odd typeface that is used throughout the entire text -- the old monospaced \\"typewriter\\" look. It's an odd choice by the publisher. Combine this typeface with the large page size (8.5 by 11) and it feels like you're reading a lengthy term paper from the fifties rather than a novel. Most of the time we seldom notice the typeface that's used for the \\"body text\\" of a book, but in this edition, you can't help it -- and it detracts from the experience considerably.

Why? For one the subject matter indicts capitalism, imperialism, materialism, merchantalism, any and all &quot;isms&quot; possible. But on the other hand, the author misses the opportunity to set straight the issues raised by Europeans in a foreign south american country operating a silver mine, employing local indians, and profiting greatly. The key character, Nostromo, is in all ways compromised by silver and its promise of wealth for the rest of his life. Leaving human nature aside and its frailities, Europeans made possible the development of the mine. Wealth was created in the employment of locals paid in local wages. The exploitation issues arguably causing a revolution misses the point. The revolution occured because of the lack of democracy and political will. The most basic point however is this. Wealth and its accumulation as argued by the Enlightenment philosphers of the 18th is not a bad thing. It is to be applauded as the engine and reward for creativity. It is curious how so many authors of the 29th century convolute the benefits of freedom and capitalism. Everyone should prepare for this novel by reading Adam Smith."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo is one of Conrad's finest works and is also one of the few which is set upon land. It was published in 1904 and concerns primarily the corrupting influence of money or in this case silver. The novel is set in the fictional South American country of Costaguana. We learn of a local legend in the province of Sulaco about the disappearance of two thieving \`gringos' who haunt the mountains due to their greed. We meet Charles Gould, who controls a silver mine and is trying to save it from the corrupt government. It is a time of political unrest and the dictator Ribiera flees. In this atmosphere, Gould becomes obsessed with saving the silver from the mine and emplys Decoud and Dr Monygham to aid him. They turn to Nostromo, a popular hero of sorts, who sails with the Decoud to hide the treasure but disaster strikes and they collide with an enemy boat. They arrive on an island and Decoud remains to protect it. However, he goes insane alone on the island and shoots himself before drowning, tied to a great quantity of silver. As the novel progresses we focus on Nostromo's unwise romance with his friend Viola's daughters. It contains very perceptive portraits of both heroes and anti-heroes and of the guilt that punishes the selfish, the greedy and the foolish. Many consider it to be Conrad's most important novel.Not a walk in the park but, you will be happy you took the time to read.It reminds me of the time I had my first sailboat I named it \\"Earls Pride\\" and me da bought me a fine looking mesh ball cap that said the same over the bill, I still have the hat and I do not think any amount of time will pass that will bring the hat back into fashion, its just plain ugly. Tacky and ugly and you will have to pull it off of my cold dead head if ever want to posses the...thing.My friend Deemont called me one time and wanted to know if I would take his new girlfriend and himself sailing, I said yeah. So we met at Eagle Creek Reservoir and the wind was so strong that I judged it not safe for all of us to sail together for my craft was small, 13 ft. stem to stern. So we discussed the situation and Deemont laughed and told me how he met his new gal. The story goes she worked for a phone soliciting company and one of her employees called him and he used profanity and hung up on her, well her boss was appalled and call Deemont back to set him straight and well...he asked her out and that's how they met. I don't recall her name but I do know she was wearing Daisy Duke style shorts, she drew the long straw (turned out to be the short straw as fate would have it) and we went for a sail. I only raised the Jib sail since the winds were so severe, well we probably made it 100 yards from the docks, the wind shifted we turtled the \\"Earls Pride\\" (rolled it over mast down) well we gathered all our stuff and I coached her on the entire routine of righting a turtled sailboat, but then the wind would catch us and back over we would go. On and on this continued, occasionally we would right the craft and sail for a while (at which time I figured out from my keen powers of observation she had no underclothes under her daisy dukes) finally we just headed for shore drug the boat up on the beach where Deemont stood laughing.He had driven down to the next boat launch to find us, and helped us walk it along the shore back to the dock and later confessed to me that he was not so much concerned about our drowning but whether she was keeping her dukes in place and me the same. I don't know why especially since Nostromo took place on dry land but everytime I read this novel I think of this little adventure on Eagle Ocean."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"I do realize novels were written in a different style at the time Conrad wrote Nostromo, but after struggling for a couple months through the first 100 pages of what is essentially background material, I just decided it wasn't worth it.

But the corruptive power of the silver is too much for even the previously trustworthy Nostromo in Conrad's pessimistic tale of Central American colonialism.Now I love Heart of Darkness (read Orrin's review), my beloved Grandfather gave me Lord Jim (read Orrin's review) when I was a kid and I was even pleasantly surprised by The Secret Agent (read Orrin's review), but I have never been able to get in to Nostromo, despite numerous attempts. I get the whole metaphor deal, the silver represents all of the wealth that colonists have torn out of the Third World and Nostromo (&quot;our man&quot;) is corrupted by this shipments, just as the West has been corrupted by Imperialism. Yeah, yeah, yeah... I guess the first problem is that I think that's a crock of hooey and colonialism was the best thing that ever happened to these places, but I also really just find the novel to be lifeless.I believe that both David Lean and John Huston died while trying to adapt the story for the movies, perhaps one of these masters could have sold me on the story. As is, I just didn't like it.GRADE: D+"},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"In his apt introduction, Martin Seymour-Smith opines that Nostromo is the best Latin American novel written in the English language. While these sorts of contentions are always difficult to evaluate in terms of accuracy, it would be safe to say that if one were to make such a ranking then Nostromo would have to be considered.For a reader who has followed the history of European commerce and presence in Latin America, it will be surprising to hear that Nostromo was written in 1904. The complexity of the situation in Costaguana will be all too familiar-- as will the loveliness and resources of that troubled region. The characters in Nostromo cling to the hope of rescue from the more developed countries. At the same time, it is increasingly apparent that the values from the old world have no real place in the new. The frustration and hopelessness of ever sucessfully affecting change put paid to even the best motivations. There is a bitterness here that feels very modern, denying any golden age of European contact.Nostromo is moving and complex. The mix of personal and global stories blend mostly seamlessly. It realizes the promise in less-developed Conrad novels (Victory, for example) and is the fullest of all Conrad reading experiences. It is not, however, a hopeful book and any optimism it exhibits is well-guarded. Readers are advised to spend some patience allowing Conrad to build the picture of Costaguana in the intial part of the book. The patience will pay off later on, and there will be more than enough character driven action later to compensate for the history lesson.In addition to the introduction by Seymour-Smith, the Penguin edition comes with explanatory notes and a handy glossary of terms."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Below this review there is a short review by someone named 'cmerrel', who very generously gives the ending away and answers the critical question of what happens to Nostromo.

Please stay away from that particular review."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Another thick complex Conrad adventure has a great vivid setting and his usual playful narrative style that exposes the same story at different times through several different points of view, all which clash over the big silver mine in the center of everything, which seems to control every action in the plot. The most riveting aspects of the tale (outside the revolution and the tortured bonds between the characters) happen but briefly on the water. Comparisons to Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness are inevitable though this one stands out on its own, provided the over detailed writing doesn't off put the casual reader. Once again, as with every Conrad piece, you have to read carefully, and be on the look out for abrupt changes in time, place and thought, which he purposely intertwines to expose a larger picture: a rather effective way to unleash the English language, considering that it wasn't Conrad's original native tongue. Title character Nostromo stands out as the key tormented romantic \\"hero\\" but the rest of the abundant cast each have their dramatic moments near and around, and before and after him as well. JC weaves all their lives into the same colorful pattern. The silver mine by the time all is finished has power over each of them, a very hypnotic and manipulative symbol of greed and loss. Don Martin Decoud, next to Nostromo himself, makes an impression as the story's most heartbreaking character. He becomes the most tragic person in the book."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo is a novel much like War and Peace. Often seen as Conrad's greatest work, it contains clear - one might say appalling - insight into the human condition in the century that was just beginning. Conrad's father had served time in Siberia-like exile with his young family in tow, for participating in revolutionary, patriotic Polish politics. The experience had shortened his parents' lives and left Conrad an orphan at an early age, giving the writer a personal preview of what the new century was going to be like for so many others.The novelist's modern insight was not only on the political and social front but also into man's sense of identity. With Godot-like despair, Decoud, the character closest to Conrad in Nostromo, &quot;beheld the universe as a succession of incomprehensible images.&quot; Stranded by himself for several days he becomes suicidal, realizing that &quot;in our activity alone do we find the sustaining illusion of an independent existence as against the whole scheme of things of which we form a helpless part.&quot; At the same time it is beautifully written and is a gripping adventure - so can work on many different levels. Anyone who reads novels should read this classic.Revolution is a fertile ground for nascent ideologies, and neology is perhaps the richest algar on which emerging heroes feed upon. Costaguena is a territory existing only in the unparalleled imagination of Conrad, whose mind was perpetually stimulated by an abstract, unknown, and merely projected world.

If you are reading it as an assignment, you don't have that choice, but either way, don't give up on the book. The first 126 or so pages can be hard and difficult to follow, but when a character named Decoud comes in, the whole plot, the characters and the thrust of the book come together. Seemingly little things and small characters in the first 100 pages take on epic proportion for the remaining pages. Once Decoud is in the story, it takes off, to a surprising and unexpected conclusion. How we react to that conclusion tells us, the reader, how we view ourselves and the world around us. Good book.The story takes place in a Latin American country torn by revolution and counterrevolution. It is not about war and revolution, however. It is about the people who live through those revolutions, what kind of lives they have, what kind of lives they seek, what kind of lives have meaning for them.It is about the corruptibility and incorruptibility of man, even good men. Every man has his price, even in pursuit of good causes. What do we value, what do we care for, to what extent would even the best of us use others to further our own ends, interests, ambitions and values.Follow Nostromo's venture as he found out about the good and bad in his country,the people he trusted and cared about. It is a good and fascinating story. But it does take some time, 100 or so pages, to get there.A memorable thought from the book, from Donna Gould at the end of Chapter 11, Part III, The Lighthouse: \\"For Life to be large and full, it must contain the care of the past and of the future in every passing moment of the present. Our daily work must be done to the glory of the dead, and for the good of those that come after...\\"The question becomes: \\"What part of the past is worth honoring; what part of the future is worth having?\\""},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Joseph Conrad is one of my favourite writers - so often his philosophies, his points of view become my own. Why is it then that this novel was such hard going for me? I have just finished the novel - I had tried at least twice previously and failed to get to the end - an unusual occurrence for me. Perhaps, because it was Conrad I wouldn't go on as I lost concentration, failed to have any sense of direction. Perhaps I had to put it aside to attack it again with renewed vigour at a later time. Another author I might have put aside altogether.Certainly the start of 'Nostromo' is very slow - and for much of it - where is Nostromo; that man with so many names? Perhaps the languid mood of the story - despite the underlying threats - created the feeling Conrad wanted for this tropical colonial setting with all those immigrant peoples (again, I think - as I have noted before - Conrad misses the indigenous locals, almost as if they don't exist).Gradually themes emerged for me - lines of thought that gave me a sense of direction. And Conrad is such a master at weaving these together - threads of time, threads of location, threads of the unfolding (and closing) of lives. But the novel is very bleak, with hardly a positive outcome anywhere. The best we see is dogged resolve. Can life be so bad? Can even the best of us be corrupted by a hoard of silver, so corrupted as to lose the greatest reward that was available? Conrad, does take the breath away with surprising but ever-so-logical sequences of events.I'm glad I completed 'Nostromo' and suspect I will read it again - perhaps with outcomes already in mind, it may go better for me. But if I was to recommend a Conrad novel to a Conrad novice it wouldn't be 'Nostromo'.other recommendations:Joseph Conrad - 'Chance'Joseph Conrad - 'Victory'Joseph Conrad - 'Lord Jim'Ivan Turgenev - 'Torrents of Spring'"},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Joseph Conrad's most famous work is of course \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" but fans and scholars generally consider Nostromo his masterpiece. One can certainly make a great case for it, as it expands many of the better-known short works strengths to novelistic scale. Like them, it is on the most obvious level an epic adventure and can be enjoyed for this alone. However, again like them and far more importantly, it is deeply symbolic, and its grand display of Conrad's bleakly tragic vision has much to say about human nature, existence, and a range of other topics. That said, it would be selling Conrad's genius rather short to simply say the book adapts his short work to a larger scale. It in fact shows his remarkable diversity, largely forsaking the sea-centered stories that dominated his early work for an intricately detailed and realistically presented fictional world. The novel also furthers Conrad's ongoing technical innovations, making it an important and influential example of very early Modernism. Finally, as always with Conrad, the prose is mesmerizing. This is quite simply Conrad's grandest and very possibly his greatest creation - one of the twentieth century's best novels and essential for anyone who likes his other work.The adventure aspect is certainly obvious, and greater length lets Conrad work in even more than usual. There is plenty to grab even casual readers' interest: revolutions with numerous battles, political crises, several love stories, family drama, business conflicts, suicide, intercontinental capitalistic and political scheming - even buried treasure. The complex, sweeping story has numerous exciting subplots that eventually come together in a stunning conclusion, making the book seem longer than it is in the best possible way. Nostromo has a sweeping, epic feel not really present elsewhere in Conrad and is in this sense among others a tremendous accomplishment. Conrad is known as a hard writer to get into, but these factors certainly bring wide appeal.Far more important of course is the overall fictional panorama, specifically the deftly drawn setting. Conrad is often unfairly pigeonholed as a \\"sea\\" and/or \\"adventure\\" writer, but his fictional Latin American country of Costaguana is one of literature's most painstakingly and believably depicted fictional locations. He knows just what to convey about everything from landscape to speech and goes to great pains to establish a suitable background: historical, social, political, etc. This is greatly helped by many real details worked in from his world travel and voluminous reading. The country seems truly real in a way fictional locales rarely are; we become deeply engrossed in the country and everything concerning it, leading to great suspense and emotional pull. This is indeed so well done that Nostromo seems like a historical novel in the best sense without being historical - a truly notable accomplishment.Similarly, this certainly has Conrad's most vividly drawn character cast. The characters are truly diverse: young and old, rich and poor, male and female, etc. Conrad clearly had great knowledge of humanity in nearly all aspects - including much first-hand experience - and used it for the good of his work. The characters are shown from multiple angles, creating complex and very lifelike inner and outer portraits; Conrad is well known for psychological insight, and this has some of his best examples. No characters are exalted, though Nostromo first seems to be; they are fully and frailly human with hidden and often selfish motives that are sometimes contradictory, as people's can be. Some novelists try to make characters consistent in order to seem conventionally real, but Conrad knows better; humans are rarely rational or noble, and he rarely shows them as such. Few characters here are conventionally likable, and several are downright despicable, though not always in straight-forward ways. Conrad's depictions are nuanced and subtle, at once artistic and realistic. Several characters are absolutely unforgettable - not least of course the in many ways admirable but tragically flawed Nostromo -, and characterization generally is one of the book's great strengths. This is another area where the novel stands above other Conrad, much less his standard reputation; characterization is not considered his forte, but this shows him on par with true masters in that important regard.The good character dearth brings up another key point - the dark vision. Few writers - nay, few human beings - have been as thoroughly pessimistic as Conrad, and his works are generally bleak, but this blackness is truly remarkable. There is enough lying, hypocrisy, false motives, backstabbing, and other disgusting actions to convert many to misanthropy. In a large sense the plot essentially dramatizes these unenviable traits as distributed throughout various characters in conflict with each other. Conrad at times seems on the verge of allowing some kind of hope, as when the mine is saved, the revolution is successful, etc. Perhaps more notably, Nostromo for a long time seems the kind of truly heroic character that prior works indicated Conrad would never write. However, it soon becomes clear that he is at least as base, vain, and selfish as anyone but far better at hiding it - indeed, at shamelessly promoting a contrary image. This arguably makes him perhaps the most loathsome of all, yet there is no denying his greatness in many respects. His tragic end in many ways epitomizes poetic justice, yet he is arguably more sinned against than sinning; he is a truly tragic hero, and his immense downfall moves us whatever we think of him.The novel also notably continues the narrative experiments Conrad began in earnest with Lord Jim. It uses third-person narration instead of the first-person layers he had used to great effect yet is even more complex. The narrative is far from linear, told in a series of non-chronological flashbacks from various points of view that first seem unrelated but eventually coalesce into a profoundly meaningful whole that is a true artistic feat. This technique, along with the intense psychological focus, was extremely influential, but Modernist writers arguably took it too far; one would have to look very hard indeed for an equal achievement. Of course, as with much of Conrad - and as with later writers to a far greater extent -, this is not easy reading. Nostromo is notoriously hard for casuals, but I advise anyone having difficulty to stick with the book; it all makes sense in the end and is worth any struggle. The method will make many want to read the whole over again, and the book indeed rewards rereading as few do. For instance, much can be gleaned by reading the story chronologically rather than as printed. Nostromo's greatness thus stretches almost to perpetuity.Finally, as always with Conrad, the incredible prose is a major attraction. That English was not his native language is simply incredible; he is nothing less than one of the language's top stylists. His description is strong and his display of various psychological states near-unequaled. Conrad's vocabulary is impressively extensive - especially for a non-native - and sometimes eccentric, but he has an amazing knack for selecting just the right word to convey whatever thought or feeling he has in mind. He is perhaps at his best with tropes, which truly says much; his figurative language is simply unforgettable, and he handles symbolism as only the greatest writers can. Vivid and memorable, his prose kindles a spark in the mind that will not soon die out.All told, Nostromo is essential to Conrad fans and anyone who appreciates grandly tragic literature and sweeping prose. Those who have read little or no Conrad should begin with the more accessible and shorter early works or a less all-encompassing novel like The Secret Agent, but those who make it here are in for a true masterwork.As for this edition, it has an excellent introduction by noted writer Dorothy Van Ghent that is very helpful in dealing with what is often a difficult book. This is not enough to make it worth seeking out, but anyone who comes across it will get a quality version."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"There is a point in Nostromo where everything has gone so terribly wrong for everyone that you stop feeling sorry for them. This is not a bad thing. This novel is a lesson of when tragedy becomes pathetic and you find yourself laughing at the situations of someone even worse off than yourself.This is a bleak and bitter story of corruption and revolutionaries and the greed and self-interest involved in creating society. Conrad here displays the sorrow of what happens when people of differing faiths (religious, political, social and intellectual) fall out of touch and stop believing in anything. Here's what happens when greed devours itself and there is nothing left to strive for beyond complete self-obsession.Another one of the 'greatest books I've ever read' . . ."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"This magnificent novel is proof of the importance of character-development in literature. As I have said several times in these reviews, the main reason why a book of fiction becomes a classic is that it can be interpreted from different -even opposite- points of view.Plus, you have a wonderful tale of political intrigue, adventures in the sea, romance, decadence and violence, set in a fictional South American, exotic nation with a lush subtropical landscape, and you are in for a treat. And Conrad is simply excellent at crafting sentences that you will remember.The plot: Costaguana is in the middle of political upheaval. Sulaco, the Western province, is rich and relatively peaceful, thanks to the asset represented by the San Tom&eacute; Mines, rich in silver. When the town is in danger of being seized by corrupt rebel forces, the need arises to save the most recent lot of silver. Nostromo, an Italian of great prestige and courage who works at the docks, is charged with the responsibility to save the silver. He will be assisted by Decoud, an expatriate who has come back in search of the woman he loves, but who has become entangled in politics. The chapters about their escape aboard a small boat, in the darkest night, are impressive. From then on, everything will be adventure, intrigue and violence. The tension builds up excitingly, and at the end, what has to happen happens.The magical side of this novel is that Conrad creates a whole country, with its history, geography, society. As I said before, the development of the characters is excellent. We get to know the Gould house just as well as the inhabitants (and you can't help desiring to have met Mrs. Gould); we know the story of Dr. Monygham (for me, the real hero of the novel), of Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos and his daughter, of Decoud, of Giorgio Viola. Curiously enough, the most enigmatic person is Nostromo himself (and certainly not the most likable): all we know is that he's arrogant, brave, smart and insufferably vain. But don't worry, he'll get what he deserves. By the moment it happens, you will have enjoyed a tropical tale of epic proportions, full of well-rounded, complete personalities competing for power, money, love or honour. The novel is rich with revealing passages, among them, besides the escape in the dark: Nostromo and the Doctor's dialogue as a high point in the tension of the book; Nostromo's awakening after returning to land, surely the most beautifully written chapter; and the final confrontation. Great book."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo is a novel that stands comparison with War and Peace. Widely seen as Conrad's greatest work, it contains amazing - one might say appalling - insight into the human condition in the century that was just beginning. Conrad's father had served time in Siberia-like exile with his young family in tow, for participating in revolutionary, patriotic Polish politics. The experience had shortened his parents' lives and left Conrad an orphan at an early age, giving the writer a personal preview of what the new century was going to be like for so many others. The novelist's modern insight was not only on the political and social front but also into man's sense of identity. With Godot-like despair, Decoud, the character closest to Conrad in Nostromo, &quot;beheld the universe as a succession of incomprehensible images.&quot; Stranded by himself for several days he becomes suicidal, realizing that &quot;in our activity alone do we find the sustaining illusion of an independent existence as against the whole scheme of things of which we form a helpless part.&quot; At the same time it is beautifully written and is a gripping adventure - so can work on many different levels. Anyone who reads novels should read this classic."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"This is a bitter and brutal book. Conrad is not an easy read, but this book is probably one of his most accessable and my own personal favorite. Written in 1904 its prophetic content amazes with the accuracy of its narrative. It focuses on the absurd country of Costaguana, a small Central or South American nation constantly changing governments through bloody revolutions and constantly being plundered by foreign interests (The United States, England and France). and how these interlopers assist the revolutions and help to slaughter the citizens so they can exert even more control over the nations through puppet dictators that are overthrown by more agreeable puppet dictators, and on and on and on, ad infinitum. No single character has a happy outcome, no one seems to ever experience joy as greed and power-hunger and passion and lust and paranoia corrupt every one in their own unique ways. Mandatory reading for anyone wishing to understand Central American dictator! ! ships and how life in countries like Guatemala or Nicaragua got to be so helpless and cruel. A masterpiece."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"\\"Nostromo\\" is arguably Conrad's best novel. The book is about silver, which in and of itself is trivial, but Conrad uses this simple theme to connect his most well-developed, meticulously written novel set in the imaginary town of Sulaco, a mining town and port in the imaginary South American country of Costaguana. And as expected, Conrad's silver has an affect on the people of Costaguana that is anything but trivial.Sulaco is physically isolated from the surrounding countries; on one side by a bay that is difficult to navigate and on the other by a mountain range whose pinnacle is the \\"Mighty Higuerota\\". Within this context Conrad is able to instill the physical isolation of Sulaco into the persona of his characters. By doing this Conrad creates a greater sense of identity, loneliness and despair in his characters, much moreso than in his other novels. Conrad relates the physical settings to the thoughts of his characters throughout the novel and it creates a very dark picture of the human condition - Conrad's specialty.Conrad carefully develops the story through many characters in the first half of the novel, each of which help to build a picture of Sulaco and Costaguana; its political instability and corruption, the imperial interests in its resources, the bleak existence of the native people, its complete lack of moral decency. While Conrad develops the story there is one character who is seemingly above all of the corruption of Sulaco and he is Giovanni Battista Fidanza (a.k.a. \\"Nostromo\\"), who is an Italian expatriate working as a longshoreman in Sulaco. Throughout the first half of the novel the reader hears about Nostromo's heroic and selfless acts that make him a favorite among the people and seemingly apart from the insidious atmosphere of Sulaco. And just when the reader believes that Nostromo's honor cannot be comprised, silver takes front stage. It is at this point in the novel that the reader is fully introduced to Nostromo's character through the events that follow, all of which form a suspenseful climax that connects the characters and events that were so carefully planned in the first half of the novel.Another interesting aspect of the novel is the story's narration. The primary narrator is Captain Mitchell, Nostromo's employer. It is Captain Mitchell who recounts many of the events that lead up to, but not including, what ultimately led to Nostromo's fate. However, Conrad uses a universal narrator that fills in the gaps so to speak, who provides the true insight into Nostromo's thoughts, character, and the terrible secret that guided his actions through the end of the story. Conrad was one clever writer.\\"Nostromo\\" is a unique and brilliant novel - I highly recommend it! Also, the Everyman's Library edition is well worth the purchase for such a great work of literature."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"I found Nostromo sslow going at first, but this is a reflection on me, not Conrad. But the book ends in a powerful way, and I found at the end I was greatly impressed. I think Colombia is the nearest thing to Conrad's fictional country, and one is amazed that Conrad could make the place seem so authentic, especially since I understand he never spent any time to amount to anything ashore in South America.

He took up British nationality in 1886 at the age of 29, andsettled there permanently. All of his writing was in English. He wasa masterful writer of sea stories and other tales, including &quot;TheNigger of the Narcissus&quot; (1897), &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;(1899), &quot;Lord Jim&quot; (1900), and &quot;Nostromo&quot; (1904).He died in 1924, at the age of 67.Of &quot;Nostromo&quot; hesays that he wrote it following publication of his book,&quot;Typhoon,&quot; a volume of short stories, after which he thoughtthat he had nothing else to write about. Then, he heard the story ofa man who stole an entire boatload of silver ingots during arevolution in a South American country, and some time later, from anAmerican seaman who had sailed aboard a schooner operated by that veryman, he heard more details, which resulted in his writing&quot;Nostromo.&quot;The story is a convoluted tale of love,revolutionary intrigue, and human passions in the small (fictional)South American country of Costaguana, the town of Sulaco and of asilver mine there owned by a man of English extraction--a thirdgeneration Costaguanarean named Charles Gould--and a large cast ofother interesting characters, both European and native.The manknown as Nostromo (which means &quot;Bos'n&quot;, or Boatswain) was anItalian seaman who jumped ship in Sulaco, and was taken under the wingof an Englishman, the local representative of a European steamshipcompany (the O.S.N.), Captain Mitchell, who made him &quot;Capataz deCargadores&quot; (captain of the stevedores) where he achieved thereputation of being both incorruptible and invincible--a man oflegendary competence and prowess. Nostromo's real name was Giovanni&quot;Gian'&quot; Battista Fidanza.Conrad writes the story froma variety of viewpoints--the diary of a journalist, the recollectionsof various of the characters in which each divulges some of their ownsecrets, resulting in a sort of &quot;God's eye view&quot;, in whichthe reader is privy to facts the total of which are unknown to anysingle character, and other devices such as the author's relatingcommon &quot;historical&quot; knowledge from an unspecifiedsource.One of Conrad's devices, which I found appealing, was theuse of marginal signals leading to an appendix in the back of the bookwhen foreign phrases are used, explaining their meaning. It is alwaysfrustrating to read a story, which uses foreign language phrases orwords without explaining their meaning, when one is unfamiliar withthat language.This is a good story by a masterful story teller.I enjoyed every word of it.Joseph Pierre"},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"Nostromo is one of the greatest novels of the early modernist period of the twentieth century. It is a landmark in English fiction. Joseph Conrad(1857-1924 considered it as his masterpiece in a oeuvre comprising such classics as \\"Lord Jim\\"; \\"The Secret Agent\\"; \\"Almayer's Folly\\"; \\"Victory\\" and such novellas as the immortal \\"The Heart of Darkness.\\" Conrad's world is characterized by:a. Materialism and greedb. The isolation of individuals in an uncaring universec. A comsos devoid of God.Nostromo is set in the lush exotic mythical South American nation of Costaguana. The book discusses the Civil war of General Barrios against General Montero. We witness the independence movement in the port city of Sulaco which eventually becomes a wealthy republic free of control by Costaguana.The book is memorable for the well drawn characters:Nostromo-He is a sailor from Genoa Italy who was orphaned and abused as a child. The name of this strong and brave man means \\"boatswain\\" but can also mean \\"our man.\\" He is the leader of the mine workers at the San Tomas mine. He steals a huge load of silver from the mine hiding it on one of the three Isabel islands. He becomes involved in a love triangle with the daughter of old Viola. He is killed by Viola who mistakenly thinks he is Ramirez the hated lover of his younger daughter Giselle. Nostromo was engaged to Linda the oldest Viola daughter but was smitten with the lovely Giselle. Nostromo like most of the major characters is tainted by his lustful worship of silver.Charles Gould-He is the rich English educated native of Sulaco who is theowner of the St. Tomas mine. His wife Emilia is a saint-like woman. He is greedy for gain coming under the influence of the bumptious Holroyd. Holyrod is an American businessman who practices the Protestant religon but whose real gold is money!Martin Decoud-The wealthy native of Constaguana is the editor of the anti-government newspaper in Sulaco. He joins with Nostromo in a plot to hide the silver from the mine. He is in love with the aristocratic Antonia Avellanos. Her father Don John Avellanos who is a respected leader in Sulaco's tight aristocratic community.Decoud fears execution but instead commits suicide feeling abandoned and alone on a deserted stretch of beach alone in the universe/.The major symbols of the book:San Tomas Mine representing greed and the lure of materialistic accumulation.Costaguana standing as a microcosm of the evil world we all inhabitThe Lighthouse-It is operated by old Viola and is a symbol of light and love in a dark world.The book is far from an easy read! Conrad utilizes multiple narrators. Conrad tells the story through flashbacks and non-chronological plot development. The novelist also uses a complex political plot which some readers may find hard to unravel. Conrad writes in a poetic evocative style which is wordy. This is not a novel for one who is just beginning to become acquainted with the classics! Nostromo is divided into three long sections: 1. the Silver of the Mine. 2. The Isabels. 3. The Lighthouse. As the blurb on the back cover of the Penguin edition notes, \\"Nostromo is..a masterpiece of tension, adventure and mystery.' Joseph Conrad is a great writer and this book deserves careful reading. Excellent !"},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"\`Nostromo' was one of Conrad's most political and least personal stories. It is probably not one of his best, but it offers a lot of issues for discussion and disagreement.JC's first hand experience in South and Central America was limited and dated. Therefore he had to build on knowledge acquired from books. He used travel reports and memories of independence wars and dictatorships and revolutions. I am by no means an expert on South American history, but from what I remember of Latino writers like Garcia Marques or Asturias, Conrad sounds fairly authentic in a generic way. (I would be interested in differing opinions here.)His political world in the international dimension was firmly based on 3 antis: anti- Russian, -German and -American. While the first two are natural for a Pole of the time and not so relevant for this novel (but very much for some of his others), his anti-American stance is of a less automatic nature and needs a closer look.Conrad's basic stance was pro-capitalist. He sided with the innovator, the risk taker, the builder, the entrepreneur, as opposed to the profiteer. He also had a sympathetic regard for the working man, but was not free of condescension.He was not free of racial prejudices of the time either. There is a Jewish trader in the story who could have jumped out of a Stuermer article a few decades later. His \`good guys', the Blancos, don't just have this name as a party colour, it has a racial meaning as well.The bad guys happen to be mostly the Indio military and politicians and the \`friends of blacks' ie the liberated former black slaves.JC's travels exposed him to colonialism of different varieties. He saw mainly the more established English and Dutch versions, which he treated with critical irony, but without heavy polemics. He met and hated the newcomers from Belgium in Heart of Darkness. At the time of JC's writing, the US was just about to assert itself. JC disliked what he saw. He was a conservative man. The Americans upset things: Panama, Cuba, Philippines...The story is set in a fictional country in Latin America: Costaguana and its occidental province Sulaco. Topography suggests it is certainly Columbia/Panama.Protagonists in the plot are: the American financier with larger interests and a belief in manifest destiny; the railway company that is confronted and disturbed by \`conservative' landholders' interests; the shipping line that serves the harbor of Sulaco; the silver mine, whose manager has English roots and wife; the Italian hotelier with the revolutionary (Garibaldinian) resume and his family; and our man who gave his name: Nostromo, an Italian adventurer and mercenary, more a useful foreman for whoever needs him than a leader in his own right. His real name is not Nostromo, that is what the bosses call him. Another example of the caste system of the place.There is also an old local politico, ex-diplomat and historian, whom JC claims as his source of the alleged non-fiction, even a dozen years later in an author's note for a collected edition. Maybe he is trying to find an excuse for the not so convincing narrator?There are some more people. There is a medico, a priest, a journalist... And the old man's beautiful daughter... The latter two provide a love story.One should know that Nostromo is by no means the real hero; he is more an anti-hero, an object of sarcasm and zoological curiosity. The real hero is the good capitalist with his heroic wife, Charles and Emily Gould. The problem with favoring entrepreneurship, but disliking colonialism was of course that they went together like horse and carriage. Conrad was aware of that contradiction. He lets the journalist voice the misgivings about development based on imperialist money. Gould (the silver miner, another pun) is the hero, but he is also the one who needs the support from the foreign devils.The country is constantly shaken and stirred by revolutions and coup d'etats, which are not good for stability, wealth and progress. Resources might be waiting for exploration, but exploitation would need a firm hand. The US is stretching its tentacles into the continent. Empire needs control and that may require regime change. It will in any case require the bribing of officials. The silver mine has roused the greed of all kinds of bad guys.The canal does not yet exist, people travel from one ocean to the other over land. Sulaco, the main location of the action, is located on the Pacific coast. But there seems to be a sea connection too, which is a little puzzling, and is maybe only explainable by poetic license. (JC can't possibly mean the route around the cape, at least not for regular traffic.)The story is told in typically Conradian jumps back and forth, by an anonymous omniscient narrator, who will let himself be distracted by his own thinking. It doesn't make the story unclear though, as long as you are willing to try and remember the characters, which are far fewer than the average Tolstoyan list of protagonists.Had Conrad been popular in the 1930s, Sinclair Lewis would surely have remembered to let his US Nazis in \`It Can't Happen Here' burn Nostromo, like other anti-American books, or anything else that looked vaguely suspicious.I wonder if Graham Greene had Nostromo in mind when he called his spy satire \`Our Man in Havana'."},{"Title":"Nostromo: A Tale of the Seaboard (Collected Works of Joseph Conrad)","review":"A Conrad fan since reading The Secret Sharer in 8th grade, I consider this to be Conrad's best work.

No it's not because as the reader you don't know what's important to the story, because even trivial things are described for pages and pages. I think the author wrote this story more for himself than an intended audience. It's an old man's last sentimental extrapolation. Oh, and the main protagonist, Nostromo---he's missing in action.

Like many previous reviewers, I'm an avid fantasy baseball manager. I was looking for something to help me before and during my drafts, and after sifting through the reviews of the various books out there, I settled on BP 2006.I'll forego regurgitating the positives the book offers -- which are many -- since those have been discussed at length below. What I found extremely disappointing (perhaps having never bought one of these books, my own naivete's at fault) is the utter lack of any position-by-position ranking lists. Sure, the book does a great job with breaking down players' stats and providing projections for both veterans and up and coming prospects alike. But any book that describes itself in bold letters on the cover as \\"The Fantasy Baseball Bible\\" should coalesce that analysis and provide fantasy baseball managers with positional rankings (e.g. a list of the top 50 outfielders, starting pitchers, etc.) based on that wealth of raw data and in-depth analysis. The book fails to do this.While I'm less disturbed by the typos that others have mentioned, I did find some of the commentary irritating. If the writers paid as much attention to editorial quality and \\"big board\\"-style rankings as they do in their attempts at cuteness, the book would be a lot less unwieldy. E.g., the commentary for Joe Borchard (p. 104) includes the following inanity: \\"Likely scenarios include his becoming a Ham Fighter, or opening up an ice cream parlor with Dermal Brown and George Lombard.\\" With comments such as that, it's little wonder that the book weighs in at 554 over-sized pages.Separately (although less critial, in my opinion), the book cries out for a glossary of the various acronyms that're employed throughout....in a system as involved as PECOTA, having a handy reference for all these terms makes sense.In short, for fantasy baseball managers, this book is not the \\"one stop shopping\\" panacea that many of us crave."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"If you play fantasy baseball, dream of working in baseball someday, or just love to root for your hometown squad, you need to get this book. I bought the '05 edition just for kicks, and didnt put it down until my '06 edition arrived."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"This is a horrible example of sophmoric \\"witty\\" commentary paired with the idiocy of stat-based evaluation. If irrelevant asides were not enough, they are mostly wrong as regards players from the team I follow closely, the Oakland A's. Take the notes on Houston Street (\\"never will be in the Lidge/Rivera class\\"), Zito (\\"overrated\\"), minor leaguer Travis Buck (stupid comments on his name, totally inappropriate), Ander Ethier (overmatached in the big leagues). Where their prognastications are reasonable, a simple extrapolation from previous years (anyone could do it in their head) would suffice, not some pseudo sophisticated computer program. I hate this book."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"This is a page turner. The stats that are introduced tend to support the hueristic beliefs that a true baseball fan already has. As a Phillies fan and a former fantasy league member who drafted teams based on what is now known as a Sabermetrics, I was pleased to see how my former beliefs (I had some good teams in the 80s and 90s before I quit) could be validated by recent research.Folks,I love this book."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"I'm a huge fan of BP, both online and the annual book. BP 2006 is the best available resource for baseball analysis, if only for the normalized stat lines and the fantastic PECOTA system. If you are interested in studying baseball, particularly the area of individual player evaluation, this is the book for you - it is literally unmatched in the marketplace. Fantasy baseball owners will appreciate the player stat trends and 2006 projections, but you won't find much advice beyond that for winning your roto league.That said, the editing and production this year are frustratingly bad. It's not just typo problems. Many sentences are missing verbs or have vague meanings, and entire sections are really tough to read. Some parts are weighed down with so much data it distracts the reader from the analysis. For example, there's a section in the Philadelphia chapter that comments on the Phillies' inability to develop players through their farm system, along with data to prove the point. I swear to you now that after three readings I still don't understand what that data (table 2, page 346) is supposed to show. It's literally 143 numbers that appear to be randomly ordered in an 11x13 table. At first glance I couldn't detect a trend, and the prose failed to describe the table at all. The first sentence of the description reads: \\"Players shown by organization that developed them;organization is credited with developing a major league player if they originally drafted or signed him, unless they released him before he first played in Double-A or Triple-A;Regular season = 100 games for position players; \\"w/Club\\" totals reflect the Games/IP/Seasons played with the parent club that developed the player\\" Yes, there is no period at the end of that \\"sentence.\\" Look, some number bending is par for the course with a book like this, but if you are expecting the type of production you see on the website, you'll likely be disappointed. I like the numbers, but in order to be useful they need to be organized properly and explained. I don't want to spend my free time sifting through a core dump. That's what's so boggling - the daily stuff from these guys/gals is so darn interesting, and the past annuals have been such a joy to read.Even the player comments, which normally range from solid to sublime, are spotty this time around. I imagine that if I were writing player comments for a book like this, I'd start by studying the player, analyzing his statistical trends and similar players, and jotting down short notes as I went along. Well, that's how a lot of the player comments read to me - like they're bullet points masquerading as sentences. There are some good moments, but the quality is unusually inconsistent.I'm giving this 3 stars, which is a tribute to the extremely valuable statistical data in this book. But next year I hope the authors start earlier or spend more time on formatting and comipiling the information in the book."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"The arrival of the new BP annual means one thing: baseball season is here once again! As usual, I tore through my new BP annual, eager to devour their essays and projections. The essays are top-notch, the stats are numerous and interesting, and overall the book was fantastic.A few essays weren't up to snuff, however. The White Sox piece barely dealt at all with the team itself, and considering that they won the World Series I found that surprising.The main problem with the book is the ridiculous number of typos and grammatical mistakes. The more I encountered, the more I wondered how rushed this was. And then I began to wonder if there was a correlation between the number of typos and the quality of the analysis. I am a big fan of BP, and subscribe to their website, and I don't recall ever being subjected to this number of mistakes in a month of articles.This is from the opening paragraph of the Cardinals essay: \\"For all the talk about Oakland's lack of resources, the Cardinals haven't had a significantly better they've done a much better job...\\"There must be at least 50 such mistakes in this book. While the overall impression of the book was positive, the carelessness in the editing is an issue."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"This is a terrific book for every baseball stat geek out there. Every player in both leagues, and a huge sampling of minor league players, is included. On top of just statistics, there is insight to each team, a paragraph on each player, and a few \\"by the numbers\\" chapters at the end.The book's greatest strength is also a weakness though. As in past years, the writers offer several new statistics in which the goal is try and take the guess work out how a player will produce. While these statistics can be fascinating, they also can be confusing. The hard part about understanding new statisics is you have no base line to compare it to. What is good? What is bad? The book tries, but struggles to explain this.As stated in other reviews, this isn't really a fantasy baseball book. The statistics aren't geared toward dollar amounts or what round to draft players in. In my opinion, this is great because it's what makes this book not just another fantasy book. If your looking for a book to carry with you to draft day then buy a magazine. This doesn't mean this book shouldn't be used as a supplement when you are studying for a fantasy draft. The authors spend a great amount of time, using countless peripheral statistics, to develop their player projections. Having owned the book for the past few years these projections are more accurate then what you might find in fantasy baseball magazines.I keep my copy of Baseball Prospectus on my coffee table for the whole baseball season. It's nice to pick it up for quick reference while making an interesting read at the same time. After reading this book your knowledge of baseball and its players will impress even the most astute stat geeks."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"Love Baseball prospectus 2006. Great info and stats. I personally like the humor the authors do in there player Analysis. Makes it fun to read, not just a dry paragraph about numbers. Best part about the book is it is for real baseball fans and roto geeks. Both will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"Baseball Prospectus puts out a quality annual every year. The annual is a whopping 554 pages long (big pages at that), so for most fans, it may not be until the All-Star break before they finish it.As usual, there is excellent coverage of all the teams. I especially like it when they go in-depth on a specific topic, rather than preview the teams' 2005 season. Some good tidbits can always be found on the sections on the individual players.If you are interested in player projections for fantasy league purposes, they have a great system (PECOTA) that is well thought out, well researched and is multi-dimensional. They don't just list what they think the players' stats will be, but they have projections on the likelihood that the player will Breakout, Improve & Collapse. This is useful information for the late-round draft picks or the $1 auction pick-ups.Overall, this is a must-have for all baseball fans, especially for the nice price on Amazon."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"I love this book, and every year, it gets better and better. It could come out earlier, and that would be great. This year, the essays in the back of the book are really outstanding, and I'd like to see more of them in future editions.The price has remained low for the book, but the quality of the printed pages has gone down some. That might be because the book was so heavy in the past, and they wanted to make it lighter. Heavier paper would be an improvement.Highlights of the book are the injury accounting formula, the limitations of statistical analysis article, and the team chapters on the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland As, and San Francisco Giants. They've also added a line for each player about the most similar players, which is really interesting, and kind of brings a focus to each player.The proofreading could be improved. There are many instances of typos, extra words, strange punctuation, but it doesn't detract from the book significantly."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"This is the one book you need before draft day! Oh, and if you're just a major league baseball fan, especially one that knows that there is a lot more to find in the statistics than meets the eye, this book is for you. If your eyes glaze over when you try to decipher statistics, this book makes it easy to understand all you really need to know....oh, and love the snark!"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"As in past years, the group at BP have created a work that should prove valuable both to fantasy baseball players, as well as anyone interested in reading about how their team and others should fare this season. And while I found it lacking in a couple of areas, I would still consider it an essential purchase for the 2006 season.As usual, the most enjoyable part of the book is the player comments. It's always surprising how much information the BP gang can cram into a few sentences, and they manage to do so without making the comments dry and boring. While they may sometimes seem more than a little smug, they also exhibit some pretty great humor, and I've found myself laughing at these comments on many occasions. The team pages are also excellent, providing a great synopsis of the 2005 season and a preview of '06, with little in the way of wasted words or filler. It's nice to read a publication that credits its audience with having at least some sense of baseball knowledge, which I can't say is the case in many mainstream publications.Since this is a BP publication, the stats are obviously critical, and they've again done an excellent job of presenting their usuals (VORP, etc.) while also trying to investigate better ways to measure traditionally difficult areas like the value of speed. And while I know that the SABR crowd might not be happy about it, I think it's important that they've finally decided to include RBI for each player. I know that it's not the most meaningful stat, given that so much of it depends on other factors. However, it's criticalfor most fantasy leaguers, which is a demographic towards which this publication is aimed. I admit that RBIs aren't my favorite, either, but I think their inclusion is justifiable.Another new item that I find fun are the player comps. For each player, the writers give 3 \\"comparable\\" players based on their analysis. You may not necessarily agree with their comps, but they're definitely enjoyable, and they give you the chance to think things like, \\"Come on, Halladay is better than Gubicza ever was!\\"As for the faults, they're pretty minor. The first is one that seems to be a problem with every edition of this book - the poor editing, which includes both spelling and grammatical errors. A few mistakes are to be expected, but there are many throughout the book. There are no horrible, book-long errors like putting stats on the wrong line, but these little typos and poor grammar are quite noticable. The second complaint I have - and I might be in the minority here - is that I believe there should be more essays. I know that it's tough to work on the book, their web site, and essays for this book at the same time, but I would have appreciated some more 5-7 page contributions from these excellent writers.I'd recommend this to any fan, regardless of whether or not they're heavily into stats. The player comments alone are worth the price of this book, which is incredibly low for the information contained within. If you're looking for a combination of good writing and an excellent stats-based approach, it's difficult to beat this effort from the gang at BP."},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2006: The BP Team of Experts on Baseball Talent","review":"Simply, the best annual publication about major league baseball.

Its staff has tripled, and they're all superb and constantly challenge themselves. This is the fruit of what Bill James seeded.

It wasn't.This book gave a very basic primer on encryption. If you have ever used PGP, you understand most of the concepts covered in the first two chapters. I guess if you are not a network administrator or other computer professional, this would be good for covering the basics without jargon.

I enjoyed it until the ending.My problem with it is that it leaves several important plot details unanswered at the end!We don't find out what happens to the secret box of information or if Val Darrant marrieshis girlfriend or what happens to his evil mother. A sequel was needed.Some of it is very incredulous but that is typical for the author.Val Darrant, as usual for L'Amour, is an excellent shooter, very well built, lucky, macho,and of course is a great Indian fighter and cow puncher. The usual stereotype for all thebooks by L'Amour I have read ( many of them.)Just once, once, I would like a hero who is inept at something, who is not the best shotis not a rough tough guy. Who loses sometimes. Somebody real and ordinary.Darrant happens to be very learned. He even wants to read serious philosophy, as if those bookswould be found out west in the middle of nowhere! in 1880!I do not agree that this is one of his best. Bendigo Schafter is the best I have read."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Bill read this years ago, when he got me my kindle, he bought this book to read it again. Enjoyed it just as much."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm a big fan of the late Louis L'Amour. INMO one of America's great authors and the only author to be awarded the Congressional medal and the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Reagan. I've bought and read 24 of his westerns, 3 short story collections, his sci fi book Haunted Mesa, Walking Drum, The Last of the Breed, The Lonesome Gods and his first book of poems. Almost all 5 stars. An incredibly talented author.Reilly's Luck is about a 4 year old boy named Val Darrant growing up and becoming a respectable man. We see his evil, manipulating, murderous mother named Myra who does everything including prostitution and multiple murders in order to advance herself in society and make lots of money. That all she cares about and had no use for he husband, son or boy friend. She treats everyone like dirt. She tells Van her boyfriend she doesn't want her 4 year old son and to get rid of it. Its 40 below zero out and she orders Van to get rid of her son Val. Van has pity on the kid and likes Val and does not leave him to die in the cold but takes Val to the only one ( Will Reilly) he can think of that might take care of Val.Will Reilly is a professional gambler with good upbringing, manners, intelligence and is good with a gun. He makes some good investments. Val and Will Reilly go to Europe where Reilly meets a beautiful woman and falls in love but she is hounded by a low life, gambling Prince Pavel. The Price tries to bull whip Will Reilly but Reilly gets the whip and slashes and scars the prince's face with his own whip. The Prince plans vengeance and hires men to kill Reilly. Myra the evil mother plots to kill her ex boyfriend Van so there will be one less person that knows her sorted past. Also Val's now rich but evil mother must find the box sent to Val from Van that shows her killings and her sorted prostitution past. Maybe have her son killed too.Val also makes good investments ( in 1/3 of a ranch and property the railroad later wants that's worth millions)and passes the bar exam and is a licenced attorney and can practice law if he wants to.Lots of action in this great book. Its a page burner. I read the 229 page book in 2 days.The reader develops deep empathy with poor little Val Darrant and Van who would not let Val die. Also Will Reilly is shown as a real hero and a wonderful person. Lots of fighting, gunfighting, and murder. Several real evil persons are shown. Two outlaws turn out to be good. Also Billy the Kid is a minor character in the book as well as wild Bill Kickok who helped both Val and Reilly.I won't ruin the story telling the sad fate of Reilly or the great ending. Reilly's Luck is a great Western and a thoughtful look at a man trying to bring up a young boy right and teach him what he would need in life. Also shows the ultimate evil that can be in a beautiful woman with no soul, lust in some men's hearts leading to their downfall and what evil men will do to their fellow men for power and money. A great story and one of L'Amour's best.

In between there is a lot of filler to do with an indian raid that goes sour, a scene in which Reilly pins an antagonist's hand to a table with a knife and then reads Tennyson's Ulysses to him. This is not to torture the man, you understand, but to better him. This Reilly ought to have his pretentious head blown clean off. THEN you are supposed to sit still for Reilly and his adopted son touring europe, where Reilly keeps himself in shape by \\"fencing, shooting, wrestling, etc.\\" I suppose this is historically accurate, since this would be some nineteenth century type's backward idea of how to stay in shape. You know, like \\"I warn you, my good man, I am in perfect physical condition.

It is a little unusual for Louis L'Amour to give the title to someone other than the main character, but it works really well in this book. The real character is a young boy who was born into a terrible situation. Things looked hopeless for him when he was abandoned by his cold and heartless mother. Good fortune smiled upon him when he found his new care taker to be a gambling man with savvy and character. Will Reilly raised him right and taught him the secrets he would need to be a successful man. After a terrible killing, Val finds himself wanting revenge. Slowly and surely it will come in it's own time. When it does, it finds that a hopeless boy has grown into a good man who is well capable of settling all of the issues at hand. Facing a cold hearted mother after all those years would be enough to upset anyone, but you'll have to read the book to find out how he handles it."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"While I could accept much of what is in here for the west I must admit, like other reviewers, there were elements in this which really annoyed me. It was mostly a good read but I felt there were too many plot elements in it which made it more like a Barbara Taylor Bradford rather than a Louis L'amour. For a start Val Darrant always seemed to make money no matter what he did, including going to university back East - he just succeeded and there was little to explain what or why he was doing - it simply seemed like a plot filler. As did the falling in love with the girl, Boston. Who really appeared out of nowhere and disappeared back into nowhere, virtually.The basic story is that Val Darrant is dumped by his mother's boyfriend - but instead of leaving him in the snow to freeze to death, he is given to a local gambler whom he trusts - Reilly, of Reilly's luck. Reilly likes him and teaches him everything he knows, but 11 years later Reilly is gunned down in a cowardly planned killing. Val gets out of town, but later kills two of the men responsible. Now Val's mother has found out who he is and plans to kill her son whom she hasn't seen for 20 years. She is now rich and powerful and Val probably knows secrets about her he shouldn't.I read this in an afternoon and enjoyed it despite holes in the plot so big you could drive a thousand head of cattle through it - it was still an enjoyably good read."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I actually avoided reading this book for quite a while because I didn't like the name! But as it turned out later the book is easily one of L'amour's best westerns. It is one of those rare books which has a fine balance of adventure, action, romance and sentiment. Very, very enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This story starts off with a young boy, Val Darrant, being abandoned by his mother. Val ends up being cared for by Will Reilly who is a gambler and travels a lot. The first quarter of the book is about adventures that Will and Val have. They have to deal with outlaws, they fight off Indians, and they travel to Europe. All along the way Will is constantly teaching Val important lessons of life. Will starts teaching Val, at four years old, how to shuffle cards. Val is encouraged to study men and observe what is happening. It seems like on almost every page Will teaches Val about something, how to fight, how to think, how to be kind to people, but also the need to be careful about trusting people.Unfortunately Will is ambushed by three men and killed while Val is still a teenager. But Val has learned many important lessons from Will. The next part of the book is about Val growing up. He has some money and is able to invest the money in a couple ventures. He has some adventures along the way. Val kills one of Will's murderers. He goes back East to get an education.The story then jumps forward a couple years, and the last part of the book pulls together many of the threads. Val finally meets his mother, who is again trying to have him killed. Val kills the last two of Will's murderers. And Val financially destroys the man who hired the murderers.This book has some many of the classic western themes, like gambling, fighting, love, and so on. There is lots of different types of fighting, for example with knifes, with fists, and with guns. There is both a tragic love interest, and a successful love interest.One of the reasons this is such a powerful story is it is a story about Will's legacy. Up until Val, Will had just been drifting through life, but after raising Val for ten years, Will has made a difference. Will's contributions to the world last beyond his death.This is one of Louis L'Amour's best. If you like a good western, this is good one to start with."},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"With walking drum, best non sacket family book;.a classic timeless story to be enjoyed by all great storylamour book"},{"Title":"Reilly's Luck (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It had some twists that I wasn't expecting.

Marshall covers all the major aspects of Christian theology (incarnation, the church, spiritual gifts, etc.) from a point of view of the Spirit. Her main thesis is that humans are active participants in the life of God through the power of the Spirit. She fleshes this out in very meaningful and rich ways. My critiques of the book would be some subtle gender bias and some unsubstantiated claims. For example, she says near the beginning of the book that Christians don't talk about the Spirit enough and that our theology is \\"insufficiently Trinitarian,\\" but so is hers, because she never once mentions \\"Father\\" in the book. But overall, Marshall is a very well-versed and well-read theologian, and her book is worth the time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"Joining the Dance: A Theology of the Spirit","review":"Joining the Dance: A Theology of the Spirit by Dr. Molly T. Marshall is a book written for the scholar, the student, the seeker, congregational study or any group or individual who desires to understand that often overlooked, but integral, portion of our Triune faith; the Holy Spirit. Dr. Marshall, President and Professor of Theology and Spiritual Formation at Central Baptist Theological Seminary in Shawnee, Kansas, offers all of her readers a hospitable place in which they can explore and appreciate a renewing view of the gifts of hope, breath, sustenance, rhythm, wisdom, nourishment, openness, redemption, connectedness and grace offered by the Holy Spirit.Entering into the arena of pneumatology, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, Dr. Marshall acknowledges, is not an easy undertaking. We have filled our thoughts with misconceptions and misinterpretations of the purpose and attributes of the Holy Spirit. We are, as Christians, Dr. Marshall states, \\"insufficiently Trinitarian\\" because \\"the relational grounding for a robust theology of the Spirit is lacking\\". Dr. Marshall willingly leads her readers into a deeper understanding of the life- rhythm of the Holy Spirit, that breath of the Triune God that resides within us all. But, in order to make this journey with Dr. Marshall as guide, the reader must be willing to relinquish limited interpretations, and open the heart and mind to the pervasiveness and expansiveness that is the Holy Spirit."},{"Title":"Joining the Dance: A Theology of the Spirit","review":"Since I hope to soon have the privilege of hearing Prof Molly Marshall, I look forward to her CD of lectures on this fitting title! When I glanced thru her descriptive Chap. headings I was captivated by what she promised in her organized sequencial progress toward the goal as any good Professor/Writer.She had me neatly hooked by \\"Recovering the Spirit; Vivifying All Creation; Gathering a People; Empowering the Christ; Chap 6, Transforming Unfinished Presence!\\" I caught onto her interesting style of writing with stories in first chapter of her classes in Systematic Theology! That itself is a huge challenge for any seminary professor. No doubt after a few years, she is surely prepared to become Presiding Professor of Central Baptist Seminary!\\"The purpose of this book is to reconfigure the sphere and character of the Spirit's action in order to provide a more holistic pneumatology.\\" What a play on words: \\"holistic and pneuma.\\" (Greek for spirit!) I wonder how long she spent writing that sentence?Professor Marshall brings us gently into an understanding of \\"perichoresis.\\" With her keen insights and simple description:\\"That relationship of mutuality in which persons draw their identity from being related to others. It is an ecstatic dance in which the Trinitarian persons literally 'stand outside themselves' as they evoke a life of their divine counterparts.\\" Up steps her neatly worded footnote *30!As most every chapter she begins chapter 1 with 55 footnotes! In my 2nd favorite chapter 6, she quotes Prof Walter Brueggemann as observing the recurring theme of God's face, present but hidden, shows Israel's ambivalence about knowing by \\"seeing.\\" Not only has Prof Marshall adequately done her homework, it seems she has made habits of some prominent theologians: \\"Never having too much research!\\" She listed 17 pages of Bibliography, with much emphasis upon Profs John A.T. Robinson, Dale Moody, Wayne Oates, Frank Stagg, Sallie McFague, J. Moltmann, Pannenberg, Marcus Borg,adding Walter Brueggemann and Elizabeth Johnson! What an awesome listing of distinguished, notable, respectable sources!I give my tributes to this lady's thoroughly documented and divinely inspired writing!

Detail, detail and more detail of every nook and cranny of square- riggers and early steamers. I was looking more for a dictionary for bluewater crusing. If this is the case, you would be better off buying the &quot; Yachtman's Ten Language Dictionary&quot;For the historian this is packed from front to back with reproduced illistrations from its original publication in 1885. Many of my French and German speaking friends were quite impressed with the detail. There are only diagrams and the respective words translated into German or French. The bad thing about this dictionary is that if a word is not shown on the illistrated diagram and you do not know what the term is referring to, you will never know what it is. Overall it is an entertaining book for the modern day cruiser but it is not a necessity on a crusing vessel.

I purchased it while looking for Acallam Bec, a variant of the same story (although I am beginning to doubt it exists in English).I recommend Tales of the Elders for scholars or serious celtophiles. I found the footnotes and references very helpful. It is a translation, not a dramatization, so if you are looking for entertainment this is probably not what you want."},{"Title":"Tales of the Elders of Ireland (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is a translation of important sources on the Fenians from the 12th Century. It adopts a format of dialog and story telling between the survivors of the Fenians and St. Patrick.I found the translation a bit plodding but translating Middle Irish into Modern English is a very difficult task and therefore I have chosen not to deduct stars for that. I do not believe that it is possible to retain a lexically correct translation which also preserves the mood of the original due in part to syntactic differences between the languages.At the same time, this is a great collection of stories which can be mined deeply for insights into Celtic social order, ideology, culture, etc. It's an incredibly important work and the translation is adequate for most purposes.I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Tales of the Elders of Ireland (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"great little book filled with wonderful stories, a must read for any one studying Celtic folklore or history."},{"Title":"Tales of the Elders of Ireland (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"I can't agree with the rather lukewarm assessment of the other reviews. This is a great book. The translation is workmanlike--you can find better translations of the poems in good anthologies of Irish poetry--but perfectly good; as one reviewer noted, medieval Irish is awfully hard to translate. The poems get into incredibly complicated patterns of rhythm, internal rhyme, vowel harmony, alliteration, and so on. Some of the ones here are masterpieces, but you have to learn some Gaelic to get it.So, what is left is an amazing story. I think everyone interested in the human condition and the human spirit should read and consider it. Someone, early in Irish history, saw the full glory of the old hard pagan times, but saw that Christianity was inevitable and necessary (in his mind, at least) to tame the violent and bloody but beautiful and noble world of Finn and the Fianna. So this book is a novel in which Cailte, the last surviving Fianna member, tells St. Patrick of the old days. It manages a sustained tone of tragic loss but hope for the new age which I have not found elsewhere in literature. Many of the poems and stories of grief for particular individuals' tragic deaths are played as laments for the whole lost past. The new peaceful world supersedes it, but the old glories--as Robinson Jeffers said of one of the stories--\\"shine terribly against the dark magnificence of things.\\""},{"Title":"Pembroke: A Novel","review":"Set in the New England, this story revolves around Mr. Barnabas Thayer and his future bride Miss Charlotte Barnard.

Well written and shows insight into the various lives of couples.I was a little surprised to find the story a little depressing but I was still intrigued to keep on reading and to find out happens to everyone involved in this small town. At times I just wanted to shake Barnabas and tell him to stop being stubborn and prideful.

Then, somehow, he is betrayed, apparently by the woman he loves, and falls into drunkenness and flabby disgrace. Then he gets better, and does some more defeating.OK, the story is a bit choppy. Fine. I'm just here for Corben's classic comic artwork, so familiar to long-time readers of Heavy Metal and many other venues for illustrated fiction. The art is a good as ever, with Corben's sleek and (often) mighty figures, blobby clouds, and shambling bad guys. I just don't see any better comic artwork out there - lots that different, sometimes very different, and also good, just nothing I'd say is unambiguously better.//wiredweird(PS: The paperback ISBN is 096238416X, a number that Amazon has assigned to the hardcover version of this book.)"},{"Title":"Mokume Gane","review":"Covers a number of topics that are only briefly alluded to in Midgett's book. Dr Ferguson also uses a different process than the ones covered in Midgett's book. He includes a detailed schematic of the kiln and press apparatus. Using this process, he is able to combine a number of materials not readily available to people just using the common processes.Short and concise, for the most part. The section of pagination is worth the cost of the book itself. Covers a lot of material that is usually not all available in one place. The color plates in the appendices really show the range and variation possible."},{"Title":"Mokume Gane","review":"The book covers the process of creating mokume-gane from start to finish in a clear, informative manner. Having never used this technique before, I used this book as a guide and was very successful the first time. In addition to information on fusion/diffusion, forging, patterning and patination, the photographs of finished pieces and samples are helpful in displaying the effects of various materials, patterns and finishing techniques (some quite surprising). Details about different material combinations and their working properties are also included. I have no experience with other books on this topic to compare to, but for now this book seems to be the only one I will need to continue using this technique. My only criticism is that the chapter order could have a better arrangement."},{"Title":"Mokume Gane","review":"Ferguson presents a clear, thorough introduction to the Japanese art and craft of layered metals - mokume gane. This book starts with a short introduction to the technique's history, including its confused introduction to the West. Some might find this history section too brief to be very satisfying, but this books value comes from the sections that follow.Those include a detailed but approachable description of the fusion process, addressing metallurgical questions down to the microscopic and atomic level. Given that background of theory, Ferguson goes on to described the metals used in mokume gane and the process of forming the billets. He also presents detailed notes on how different metals behave together and how they can be finished. Although hobbyist techniques get some mention, many of these approaches require a large industrial shop. (Even the hardiest do-it-yourselfer shouldn't feel bad about buying blanks from Reactive Metals or other sources.)Then the real fun begins - cutting into the layers to expose mokume's unmistakable pattern and working the material into a finished piece. The gallery section at the end provides all the inspiration you could hope for. Some of the work shown, including many pieces by the author, are breathtaking, but within reach of a modestly-equipped artisan. If you want to know how mokume is fabricated and used artistically today, in the West, you must have this book.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"Mokume Gane","review":"the book was great, excellent content and very well written.

In preparation for getting in the Christmas mood, I listened to a few of them, found myself wishing I hadn't bought the CD. Why? Most of the songs are quite simply not repeatable. Yes, some are pleasant, but others are downright annoying. I don't know about you, but one time around with the twangy mountain-man rendition of \\"Christmas Time's A-Coming\\" was quite enough for my sanity. Thank You. I also didn't care for the stories. I found \\"Twas the Night Before Christmas\\" (a parody of the original about a puritanical Baptist family), obviously meant to be funny, didn't even provoke a chuckle, and was at times downright creepy.Some songs, such as: \\"The Christmas Song\\" by Sarah Jessica Parker, \\"December Waltz,\\" by Pat Donohue, and \\"Count Your Blessings\\" by John McDonough were decent. Some songs were great: \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" by Diana Krall being one of them. But others were quite banal. Nothing made me stand up and shout: \\"Wow! That's a great tune, I'm glad I bought this CD!\\"Overall, I think your better off buying a ten-pack of Christmas cd's at your local super store and culling the songs you like, it'd probably cost the same, and you'd get more music that you might enjoy. 3 Stars.

Some are jazzed-up and made-up to fit the bouncing cool cat rhythm of the book. The illustrations are bold and the array of cats depicted display the wide true range of feline personality. Which is what the book's about, really: feline personality, which all cat lovers know is wide and varied. They're nosy, cozy, lovey and rotten, aloof and adoring and the many wonderful opposing forces that make cats fabulous, and this book depicts that in a fun way. Best of all, this is a book that loves and revels in word play.

There is so much respect to Shari, Mrs. Smith's family, friends, people that were involved, and to the readers that we are able to walk into a new way to believe in and have faith in the Lord. Mrs. Smith's faith is beautiful -- the way she would pray so that she could sit through a grueling period of time facing such devastation - she'd simply ask God to help her get through it with grace -- and, by Mrs. Smith's portrayal of her own faith - it helped grow mine. Why? Because the Lord is very interested in the details of our lives -- Mrs. Smith &amp; her family's tragedy is an example of the Lord using what satan meant for evil for good. Shari is in heaven - the best place to be -- and, Mrs. Smith and her family's going through the ordeal they went through, coming out of the other side in tact and in faith have undoubtedly increased the Kingdom -- the Smith family has awesome hearts - thank you, Mrs. Smith for your faithfulness to Him and for growing my own faith.

She was 2 days away from her high school graduation, popular, young, and beautiful with her whole life ahead of her. I cannot begin to imagine the 14 hours of terror that she must have endured at the hands of Larry Gene Bell before he so viciously murdered her. Shari's courage in her last hours truly amazes me. I know that I could not possibly have faced death with the courage that she did. I think of Shari often and wish so much that this horrible crime had not happened to her and that she would have somehow gotten away from this madman and been able to be reunited with her family and been able to live her life. I also think of the Helmick family and their loss. Though this book is truly heartbreaking it is also inspirational.

It mentioned something about Egyptian medicine, etc. It did not talk about anything about the Asian medicine, as we all know, the Chinese have been practicing their kind of medicine many many years ago.At last, it talked about the German scientists used humans for live experiments. I suppose that that is what the western students have been educated about. The authors did not say anything about the evil Japanese &quot;scientists&quot; who used Chinese to do their grueling live in-human experiments.

Washington called him the &quot;Poet Laureate of the Negro Race&quot;. Dunbar, the son of ex-slaves, grew up in Dayton, OH, where he was friendly with the Wright Brothers. He had a successful high school career--founding editor of the school paper and elected class president of the predominantly white school--but upon graduation, he was forced to work as an elevator operator. His second book of poetry was praised by William Dean Howells and by age 24, he was one of the most renowned Black literary figures in America.Dunbar wrote in two different styles. On the one hand, he wrote straightforward classic verse that was filled with racial pride:THE COLORED SOLDIERSIF the muse were mine to tempt it And my feeble voice were strong, If my tongue were trained to measures, I would sing a stirring song. I would sing a song heroic Of those noble sons of Ham, Of the gallant colored soldiers Who fought for Uncle Sam!In the early days you scorned them, And with many a flip and flout Said &quot;These battles are the white man's, And the whites will fight them out.&quot; Up the hills you fought and faltered, In the vales you strove and bled, While your ears still heard the thunder Of the foes' advancing tread.Then distress fell on the nation, And the flag was drooping low; Should the dust pollute your banner? No! the nation shouted, No! So when War, in savage triumph, Spread abroad his funeral pall-- Then you called the co]ored soldiers, And they answered to your call.And like hounds unleashed and eager For the life blood of the prey, Sprung they forth and bore them bravely In the thickest of the fray. And where'er the fight was hottest, Where the bullets fastest fell, There they pressed unblanched and fearless At the very mouth of hell.Ah, they rallied to the standard To uphold it by their might; None were stronger in the labors, None were braver in the fight. From the blazing breach of Wagner To the plains of Olustee, They were foremost in the fight Of the battles of the free.And at Pillow! God have mercy On the deeds committed there, An the souls of those poor victims Sent to Thee without a prayer. Let the fulness of Thy pity O'er the hot wrought spirits sway Of the gallant colored soldiers Who fell fighting on that day!Yes, the Blacks enjoy their freedom, And they won it dearly,too; For the life blood of their thousands Did the southern fields bedew. In the darkness of their bondage, In the depths of slavery's night, Their muskets flashed the dawning, And they fought their way to lightThey were comrades then and brothers, Are they more or less to-day? They were good to stop a bullet And to front the fearful fray. They were citizens and soldiers, When rebellion raised its head; And the traits that made them worthy,-- Ah! those virtues are not dead.They have shared your nightly vigils, They have shared your daily toil; And their blood with yours commingling Has enriched the Southern soil. They have met as fierce a foeman, And have been as brave and true.And their deeds shall find a record In the registry of Fame; For their blood has cleansed completely Every blot of Slavery's shame.So all honor and all glory To those noble sons of Ham-- The gallant colored soldiers Who fought for Uncle Sam!WE WEAR THE MASKWe wear the mask that grins and lies, It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,-- This debt we pay to human guile; With torn and bleeding hearts we smile, And mouth with myriad subtleties.Why should the world be over-wise, In counting all our tears and sighs? Nay, let them only see us, while We wear the mask.We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries To thee from tortured souls arise.

Chillun, let us pray!Inevitably, in a Reconstruction America that was both nostalgic and regionalist, his dialect poems were wildly popular &amp; tended to overshadow his more serious verse. As a result, he has always been a figure of some controversy in Black America; alternately dismissed for popularizing a derogatory stereotype of Blacks and hailed as a great literary figure. Dunbar captures this dichotomy in his own poem, The Poet:The PoetHe sang of life, serenely sweet, With , now ant then, a deeper note. From some high peak, nigh yet remote, He voiced the world's absorbing beat.He sang of love when earth was young, And Love, itself, was in his lays. But ah, the world, it turned to praise A jingle in a broken tongue.Given the perspective of 100 years, it seems to me that he deserves to be read by all Americans.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"Dunbar's poetry is so good that it should be almost impossible to ruin a collection of his poems, yet somehow they've done it.Start with the table of contents and the index of first lines. The page numbers are apparently from an earlier edition of the book where the poems started on page 3. In the present edition, the poems begin on page 23, so the page numbers given start out 20 pages off. But each page contains a few extra lines, so that when you try to find the poem Sympathy (\\"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!\\") on page 102 and you think \\"well, let's add 20\\" and look on page 122, no, wrong again. It's on page 112. So if you need to find a certain poem, go to the page number they give you, read the name of a poem that is actually on that page, look that poem up in the index, and compare the page number given in the index with the page it is actually on. That will tell you approximately how many pages away your poem is. As another example, you will find We Wear The Mask on page 85, not page 71. (On the principle that even a stopped clock is right twice a day, the poems that appear on pages 184 to 186 actually are correct. Poems from page 187 on are on lower page numbers than the number given, until they are 4 pages off by the end of the book.)Typography? It appears to have been typed. With a typewriter. Remember typewriters? The titles of the poems are in capital letters, probably because typewriters didn't have boldface type. This compounds the pagination problem, because the titles do not stand out from the text. Sometimes the title of the poem is at the bottom of one page and the poem at the top of the next page.And they didn't bother to put the title of the book on the spine, so good luck finding it on a bookshelf.The phrase \\"High Quality\\" appears twice on the cover of this book. That's false advertising."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"I have looked for this book of poems for a long time.

Not only does he relate to us with southern, comical, light hearted characters, but he also explores the heart and the intimacy fit for a Queen.

I am so glad it has been preserved, but better yet, I am glad I was able to read some of his work."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"I bought this because I like the poetry, and I like Dunbar.This was especially good, from \\"Ione\\":Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,But, having come, asserts his right;He will not be repressed nor hidden.But by all that wonderful in this world, it was a struggle to read this poetry because the formatting and layout has been done so poorly. At times it was a struggle to read the poetry because the line breaks were so awkward. Page numbers are added INTO THE BODY OF THE POETRY ITSELF, smashed into the first word of a line. There are mistakes in the poetry due to either a poor OCR being used or because the editor wasn't paying attention.That makes me sad and mad; sad, because this poet has some truly wonderful things to say, and mad because I just expect a higher level of professionalism to be paid to our American authors and the words they've written.Truly, I'd give the author much higher marks, but I have to downgrade this edition as nearly unusable and quite unprofessional."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"The poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar are classic and classy in nature.

I rated the book on the basis of its content, which is complete. The presentation does not do justice to the work inside, thus a four-star rating. Were the book beautifully bound, and the paper of better quality -- then it would have been five stars for me. But buy the book, anyway. The content is exquisite and a true representation of the African peoples living in America, and, how they communicated with one another, done with humor and love."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar","review":"I am soooo... happy that you have this book.

Should we concentrate on evangelism and reaching the unregenerate souls? Or should we try to reform every institution to conform to God's standard? What John Barber's book does is show us that it is not an \\"either/or\\" situation. The two elements work together. Reforming culture helps us to evangelize. And evangelizing helps us to reform culture. Interwoven in both endeavors is God's sovereignty and the fact that God is working all things to His glory. Earth Restored is not another book on why America is great because the godly Founding Fathers wanted it that way, so we should strive to bring the country back to its former state. This book is about what the Bible says we as Christians should do in, for, and through the culture around us. It also gives a detailed look at the components of a biblical worldview, very important in having a godly perspective. Mr. Barber's style is very conversational. I enjoyed his personal stories and learned a lot from his wise, clear analysis of theological principles. The practical applications of these principles to a few contemporary issues was just what I needed to help me apply God's Word to the stories I hear in the news each day. It is a well-thought-out and well-written piece of work. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those struggling to understand what God really says about the Christian's role in culture and politics."},{"Title":"Blood Secret","review":"Teenager Jerry hasn't been the same since her irresponsible mother disappeared years ago. What began as a conscious decision to stop speaking has become a way of life: \\"She could bury the longing for her mother in this silence.... So many years had passed now and with every year she buried the longing deeper, the memory of her voice deeper into the good dirt of the silence.\\" Shuttled from foster home to children's home, unable to be reached by well-meaning social workers and priests, Jerry may finally have a chance for a real family with her great-great aunt Constanza, an accomplished baker in Albuquerque, New Mexico.As Jerry comes to know Constanza and explore her adobe house, she begins to suspect that other secrets, other voices, are buried there. When she opens a trunk in the basement, she hears children's voices...and finds herself transported to fourteenth-century Spain, seeing the world through the eyes of Miriam, the daughter of a family of lace makers. As Jerry explores the trunk's secrets, she uncovers answers to many of her questions. Why does Aunt Constanza light candles on Friday evenings? Why does she throw a piece of dough in the fire before baking her delicious bread? Why do both Jerry and Constanza rub their heads when they are anxious?Jerry discovers a historical root for almost all her questions, and also learns that she is not the first one in her family to bury her sorrows in silence. As she learns more about her family's rich and troubled heritage, she finds herself questioning everything: her traditions, her name, even her Catholic faith. She also finally, gradually, discovers her long-buried voice again.With BLOOD SECRET, Kathryn Lasky has constructed a compelling story that stretches across centuries. Lasky successfully creates two convincing, evocative settings: the present-day Southwest and Inquisition-era Spain. As the narrative reaches back in time, the family relationships can be a little confusing, so the extensive family tree at the back of the book is extremely useful. Although the historical passages sometimes read like a history lesson, they are effectively integrated with the modern-day setting, and dedicated readers will probably appreciate this opportunity to learn more about a little-known, sometimes gruesome period in history.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"Blood Secret","review":"This is a multi-layered story. The top layer is that of Jerry, the 14-year old girl who stopped speaking when her mother abandoned her. The secondary layer is that of historical Spanish Jews and the persecution they went through - indeed that followed them wherever they went.It's strange to have two such powerful kind of topics - child abandonment and religious persecution - go together so well.But through finding the history of her ancestors - the mystical way this comes about seems natural when one reads the story - Jerry finds herself and her voice. And though not all is well - historical wrongs can never be righted - the knowledge of the truth gives a sense of completion to both plots.The character of Jerry is very well drawn - from her unwilling desire to be fashionable and accepted to her uncanny critique of Shakespeare. Her aunt - the other main character in the story, is a bit more than a supporting role, as she is as changed by Jerry as Jerry is by her.All in all, a very good book.(*)>"},{"Title":"Blood Secret","review":"Jerry hasn't spoken since her mother disappeared. The 14-year-old has been labeled with \\"elective mutism\\", and has been bounced from children's homes to foster families until she is finally placed with her great-aunt in New Mexico. After exploring the old family relics in her aunt's basement, the strange objects there seem to call to her. Upon handling them, she somehow relives her family's past history and uncovers family secrets going back to the Spanish Inquisition. She finds out that she is from a long line of secret Jews, which explains why her aunt lights candles and prepares a special meal on Friday evenings without mixing milk and meat. By uncovering these secrets Jerry also finds her voice and begins to speak again.While Lasky creates an interesting and likeable character in Jerry, there is some confusion about how Jerry is able to discover the stories of her ancestors. Is it a dream? Does she travel back in time? Do ghosts or spirits tell her? Or, do the stories just magically come to her? Additionally, while the family tree in the back of the book is helpful, the six different narratives from the past are difficult to follow and it is hard to figure out how they relate to each other and to Jerry. Several other novels tell the story of the Secret Jews (Secrets in the House of Delgado by Gloria Miklowitz and The Cross by Day, Mezuzzah by Night by Deborah Siegel, for example), however Lasky's story attempts to bring the history to the present day. Ages 12 and up. Reviewed by Rachel Kamin"},{"Title":"Blood Secret","review":"I found \\"Blood Secret\\" to be a disappointment after enjoying Ms. Lasky's contributions to the Royal Diaries series. The time in history about which the story speaks is a very fascinating, yet turbulent one. Turbulent like the writing itself. Their was no reason to skip around so much, and no solid explanation as to why the main character, Jerry, is able to witness all these things by touching inanimate objects.Although the Jerry's plight of trying to connect with her heritage left me discontented, the book has piqued my interest in the Spanish Inquistion and all that it touched."},{"Title":"Blood Secret","review":"This is a really great book that tells about the Spanish Inquisition.

She learns of her family history from artifacts she finds in a old trunk in the cellar, starting with the 1391 riots against the Jews in Seville. This book traces the history of her ancestors before the Inquisition in Spain through its continuance in the Americas, a period of 600 years. It captures the lives of young people in these eras and cross relates them to the present day. It is accurate, insightful and compassionate. I found it a perfect book for readers as young as 10 and up to adults.

Jerry's story takes an interesting turn as she discovers the existence of a trunk full of artifacts in her aunt's cellar. Jerry finds herself drawn to the trunk and its contents and as she delves into the items, she is transported into the world of her ancestors,Jews living in Spain during the time of the Spanish Inquisition. Their stories become part of Jerry's story and her own eventual dealing with her past. While the book's premise is a bit far-fetched, the stories themselves are believable enough and Lasky does an admirable job of pulling you into the story and caring about the events. I learned a good deal about the persecution of the Jews during this time period but I never felt like I was being taught a lesson. Lasky is a good author and this is one of her best.

Mr. Cole hits the very center of the issue and he does not fear in doing so. Being a real man is being like Jesus Christ. I was surprised to see that the book was first published in 1982 and that I only got to read a copy only now after 18 years. Yet I have never been so impacted by a book so much that it moves me to change. I am a Bible believing Christian and yet I would place this book immediately after the Bible as a practical manual on how to live daily as a real God-fearing man. It sets Biblical principles against the current ideas and lifestyles of men and addresses each issue clearly to allow the reader to have a better if not the best option to be renewed and revitalized. It's not a new book, but the truths explained in it are timeless and powerful."},{"Title":"Maximized Manhood","review":"This is my second reading of Maximized Manhood, and although it is over twenty years old, it still speaks with a clarion voice to men that manhood and Christlikeness are synonymous. Subtitle A Guide Top Family Survival, Cole rightly discerns that the role of the man, which is under attack from political and cultural left, must conform to his biblical antecedents if the family is going to survive in the future. This book is really apolitical, as Cole does not specially identify the leftist institutions that seek to destroy or redefine the American family and the biblical role of the male, outside of commenting on and condemning the rising tide of feminism and pornography.Speaking as a man to men, Cole rejects the insipidism of much evangelical thought and practice. He rightly discerns that nowhere in the Scripture are men invited to repent of their sins and accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior; rather, the Bible commands men to repent. The idea of giving an invitation for men to accept Jesus as their Lord and Savior is foreign to the New Testament. Cole also attacks the psychologicalization of the Christian faith. The idea of sin has been supplanted by of having problems. Cole points out that if you only have a problem you can get sympathy for it or understating for it, or professional help. Sins, on the other hand, have to be repented, confessed and forsaken.Yes, the book is somewhat dated. Illustrations often refer to a culture that is over twenty years old. Even the revised version still reflects that old culture. But do not let this get in your way. Cole is a master of setting forth biblical truth in succinct phrases or coleisms such as: You can pitch personality, but you must build character; The greatest thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother; Some things in life are more important than life itself; The Kingdom of God is built on truth, not human sentiment. The list goes on and on.Is this a great book? Probably not. Will this book change your life? Yes, if you read it and apply its principles. It may not be a great book but Dr. Cole was a great man.

This volume contains \\"The Book of The Law,\\" clarifications about the religion of \\"Thelema,\\" & Masonic / Templar connections to the organization of the OTO.Anyone researching religion, occultism, \\"Secret Societies,\\" Crowley, Thelema, Masonry, Anthropology or Sociology should definitely put this one on their wish list.This is not the most exciting book you will ever read, but it IS crammed with information, in an easy to ingest format. Also, purchasing this book is like buying several for the price of one!"},{"Title":"The Equinox: The Review of Scientific Illuminism, Vol. 3, No. 10","review":"If you think you might be interested in the OTO and you want to know what the order is about I suggest this is the best place to start. It gives the history and evolution of the Ordo Templi Orientis and several papers explaining its goals for the future as well.This book also contains many of the important books of Thelema and the OTO. It contains The Book of the Law, Liber Oz (The Rights of Mankind), The Law of Liberty, The Manifesto of the OTO, The Gnostic Mass and many other papers to introduce you to the OTO. Some of the material included also introduces the reader to books of the A.'.A.'. (The Order created by Crowley) because both orders are involved with the Equinox publications.After reading this book the reader should have a pretty good idea if they want to get more in-depth into the works of Crowley, the OTO, or the A.'.A.'. This book is a good place to start, and scratch the surface of a deep and rich system. Much further study is required to fully understand the system, but after reading this book at least you should know if you want to know more.The OTO is growing and had many wonderful members. If you like what you read here you might want to contact one of the local OTO branches near you for more suggestions on reading material, or even to become a member. One of the main goals of Thelemites is to find and do your true will (whatever that might happen to be). No one at the OTO is going to make anyone go against their true will (THELEMA means will). One of the other main concepts of Thelemites is AGAPE (Agape means love) and the experience I have had with OTO members have been friendly, loving, and kind. These are of course only my opinions and experiences with Thelema and the OTO and I do not speak for the OTO. Others may have very different opinions that are just as valid. If what you read in The Equinox Volume 3 Number 10 interests you --- you might want to have your own experiences and further develop your own opinions. Personally I don't see any down side to finding your true will and knowing why you are here on this planet. Only you can find out what your true will is, and no one at the OTO is going to try to tell you what your true will is. The OTO can possibly refer you to methods that have helped others find their true will, and there is a good chance that they may work for you as well."},{"Title":"The Equinox: The Review of Scientific Illuminism, Vol. 3, No. 10","review":"Good content, wasn't so keen on the legal documents between the OTO & Motta (?)But the original content was excellent"},{"Title":"The Equinox: The Review of Scientific Illuminism, Vol. 3, No. 10","review":"93!ALL THINGS THELEMIC OR OCCULT ESOTERIC WHAT EVER YOU MAY CALL IT THIS GIVES ALOT OF INFO INTO THE HEART OF THINGS MAGICKAL. 1THING UNCLE AL CAN CAUSE ALOT OF ADEPTS TO GO ASTRAY , HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS WERE AN ARE FAR VASTER THAN U CAN IMAGINE ALTHOUGH QWE AL HAVE THIS DIVINE SPARK .UNLES YOU IGNITE ITA D SEND THE SEPENT KUNDALINI UP TO THE AJNA WITH BOTH PINGALA AND IDA .

I can tell you Thelema is easily one of the fastest growing religions in the world, along with Islam. People are getting fed up with Christianity. It has run its course with its mass implementation in the 90s, preceeded by the mass Satan phobia of the 80s.The O.T.O. numbers over 4,000 members in the U.S. alone, and is active all around the world. Its country of origin, England, is a pretty strong Thelema following. Aleister Crowley is a mainstream celebrity in England, hugely popular.This book clarifies the O.T.O. and what it is about. Other books on the subject of Thelema have little to do with the O.T.O. itself. The O.T.O. is like the official body of Thelema. Most Thelemites aren't members of the O.T.O. This is not a big deal. Wheras in Christianity if you are not a member of any church it is an issue both ways. Weiser books are a sign of quality. Legal matters of the O.T.O. are covered here as well. Recommended for those Thelemites seriously pursuing the O.T.O. or like me already members wanted to learn more about it."},{"Title":"The Equinox: The Review of Scientific Illuminism, Vol. 3, No. 10","review":"Possibly the best book I have ever read.

I just found it on a shelf and revisited it. Boy, this has a rather small sampling of poets--just 14. But what is here is very good. The collection begins with (chronologically) William Shakespeare and ends with T. S. Eliot.Some examples. . . . From Shakespeare's Cymbeline, \\"Hark, hark! The Lark.\\" The cadence is wonderful--\\"Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gateAnd Phoebus' gins ariseHis steeds to water at those springsOn chalic'd flowers that lies;And winking Mary-buds beginTo ope their golden eyes.With every thing that pretty is,My sweet lady arise:Arise, arise!\\"George Herbert's \\"Bitter-Sweet.\\" A few lines. . . .\\"I will complain, yet praise;I will bewail, approve:And all my sour-sweet daysI will lament, and love.\\"William Blake's lines from \\"Motto to the Songs of Innocence and of Experience\\":\\"The good are attracted by Men's perceptions,And think not for themselves.Till experience teaches them to catchAnd to cage Fairies and Elves.\\"And so on.

Peter Baugh also gives practical advices on how to use filters, especially Watercolor filters. Watercolors is something I need to practice more on."},{"Title":"Tennis for Humans: A Simple Blueprint for Winning","review":"This is an excellent book. It is to the point, well written and humorous. It is not a book of stroke technique but rather a book about strategies and techniques that will help you win, assuming you have basic stroke techniques mastered. It provides a plethora of useful tips that can be used in every match you play. Sections on singles, doubles and mixed doubles emphasize different approaches and strategies to be more effective with the strokes you already have. For players who already have good strokes but don't anticipate well, don't volley for winners, double-fault on big points, etc. this will be a very useful book. I am a 4.0 all court player and found it quite helpful."},{"Title":"Last Kiss","review":"Last Kiss Memories Last Forever....Great read. Well thought out story, characters, also their relationships to one another. I enjoyed learning about Sharon Wells, also her family and friends. I feel the author did a great job creating an interesting fictional love story, being inspired by the old song, Last Kiss. If you are a \\"Beatles\\" fan you might be interested how the character Paula Carr was given her name. I encourage you to get this book and find out for your self the unexpected twist this story provides.I personally enjoy the end. Sometimes, the end of the story as a whole is forgotten, you get to the end of the plot and that is where the story ends, or the end is dragged out. In this book the story as a whole is ended, and does not drag out. The book is great just get it and see for yourself!"},{"Title":"Last Kiss","review":"Absolutely beautiful love story! Last Kiss is well written; it captivates your emotions until the very last page. The characters are so well defined that I felt I had a personal relationship with each of them. No matter what walk of life you come from there is a character to relate with. This story is about love, loss and miracles.The ending is spectacular! I had nonstop chills as I made my way through the last few chapters.I highly recommend Last Kiss to both young and old, male or female. There is something for everyone!"},{"Title":"Last Kiss","review":"Last Kiss: Memories Last Forever... by Marilyn Smith-Porter is the remarkable and inspirational albeit fictitious depiction of the 1962 ballad-love song, \\"Last Kiss.\\" Readers will follow Georgie Core through his psychological struggle of losing Sharon before ever being able to tell her his true feelings for her and the struggle of knowing his best friend will be there countering his every 'what-if' that could have been his and Sharon's fate.

Easy and fun to read!"},{"Title":"The Bone Collector","review":"This is an especially suspenseful thriller made more so by the personal angst of the main character, Lincoln Rhyme. A quadriplegic, forensic ex-detective for the New York City Police Department, Rhyme is brought out of retirement by the police department to assist them in the apprehension of an apparently psychopathic killer who is loose on the streets of New York.The forays into bits of arcane New York history, as well as the sleuthing done almost entirely through the application of forensics and deductive reasoning, make for a very interesting read. While at times it seems that no one could be as uncannily accurate as Rhyme in deciphering the meaning of the physical evidence, this contrivance does serve to move the plot along. With the story line so engrossing and the crime scenes horrific, as well as ingenious, it is the kind of book that is hard to put down, because you simply cannot wait to see what happens. The surprise ending is the icing on the cake.Assisting Rhyme with his work is Police Officer Sachs who, while not as compelling a character as Rhyme, is essential to the story. It is her character who does the 'heavy lifting' so to speak. Highly intelligent and resourceful, with an innate appreciation of the importance of physical evidence, she inspects and preserves the crime scenes, as well as gathers the physical evidence from which Rhyme ultimately weaves his magic. She also serves as somewhat of a Deus Ex Machina in that she saves the day in more ways than one.Sachs is a wonderful foil for Rhyme in that she runs hot to his cold. She is driven by her desire to help others, as well as by her own personal demons, while he is ever the calm, cool, collected clinician, whose desire to preserve a crime scene may supercede the milk of human kindness latent within his emotionally atrophied soul. The personal connection that Rhyme ultimately develops with Officer Sachs is one that leaves you hoping that they will be teamed up again in yet another novel."},{"Title":"Streetwise Landlording & Property Management: Insider's Advice on How to Own Real Estate and Manage It Profitably (Adams Streetwise Series)","review":"The title claims the book is a \\"how to\\".

It is thorough and well organized according to topic. It is not flashy and bright coloured like many other books available on the subject and it looks and feels much like a text book. Don't let that scare you off though. It is very well laid out in my opinion and it is written for the average person - easy to read language, organized according to topic, and offers a lot of advice and direction. What I like most is the direct approach to how to deal with people - the tenants and all of the other professionals that you will encounter getting into and operating this type of businesss (lawyers, realtors, sellers, investors, etc.). Well worth the money you pay for it.

While it also addresses managing larger complexes such as apartment housing, the overall advice is very good. I've worked in property management and find that few people who decide to buy and rent property have done their homework. This book helps depict the reality of what it means to own and rent property. It isn't as simple as putting a tenant in and collecting the rent. The author makes some very good points about the delicate between landlord and tenant.

Based on the title of this one, I expected some heavy hitting information about Property Management and Landlording. Instead, what I got was a general overview of all of the topics in the table of contents, but no really good in depth material about any of it.I also didn't like the fact that the first several chapters are about how to decide if you're cut out for this business.

This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense.

I am looking for a deal now and think that many tips and the advice the author has in this volume is relable and written well. I have had similar tenant situations and was reminded of how important it is to listen to complaints before over reacting to the crys of the tenant. Just the other day I had a tenant complain of rodents in her unit and as the tenant complained and complained I realized that all she wanted was to be let out of her lease early. The fictious mice she complained about was really a ploy for me to know she was ready to move. I've had hundreds of similar situations where tenants have tried to manipulate me.

Milgrom's translation and commentary on the first sixteen chapters of Leviticus (Anchor Bible vol. 3) is perhaps the finest modern commentary on those chapters and this work deserves it place alongside Milgrom's initial volume. No doubt Bible scholars will find his work fascinating but even if you are not a scholar but simply a person like myself who wants to understand Leviticus better, Milgrom's commentary can shed new light on what is for many modern readers a very difficult book.Some cautions before proceeding with the review: if you reject the modern theory that the first books of the Bible are composed from several sources commonly labeled \\"J\\", \\"E\\", \\"P\\", \\"H\\", and \\"D\\", then you likely will find Milgrom's work objectionable because one of the main theses of Milgrom's work is that chapters 17-27 reflect chiefly the source referred to as \\"H\\" for the \\"Holiness\\" source while chapters 1-16 are composed chiefly of writings from \\"P\\", the \\"Priestly\\" source. Secondly, although Milgrom's translation of the entire book of Leviticus is set out at the beginning of his commentary in this volume and his discussion of each chapter is preceded by his translation of that chapter, nevertheless, in the commentary portion, isolated Hebrew words and phrases are transliterated into English letters which occasionally Milgrom does not immediately translate into English. Unfortunately, Anchor does not set out the transliteration system so unless you are already familiar with it, you have to noodle it out yourself or look up the passage. Moreover, Milgrom frequently employs specialized grammatical terms that will baffle the average reader. Nevertheless, if you are willing to work hard trying to understand the work, you will reap huge benefits even if you are not a modern Bible scholar.In his first volume, Milgrom argued that Leviticus transforms the ancient sacrificial system by banishing demons and identifying man's choices as the major source of impurity. Man's sin generates impurity that pollutes the Tabernacle and the more serious the sin, the more polluted the Tabernacle. Sacrifices, chiefly the chattat or purification offering (erroneously translated as \\"sin offering\\" by others), would purge the Tabernacle of impurity but only if motivated by the offeror's sincere remorse. If the pollution goes unchecked, G*d will abandon the Tabernacle and the people.In this volume, Milgrom argues that the impurity system in chapters 1-16 has been expanded. Whereas in chapters 1-16, holiness centered on the Tabernacle and the priesthood, in these chapters, the concept of holiness is expanded to encompass the land and the \\"lay\\" Israelite. The land of Canaan now functions like the Tabernacle in the wilderness. Sin pollutes the land and pollution unchecked results in exile. Just as the Canaanites were vomited from the land because of their immorality, so too Israel risks expulsion from the land if the people do not heed G*d's commands. Similarly, in these chapters, not only are the priests required to maintain their holiness, the average Israelite as well is called to strive toward it. The means of maintaining or achieving holiness are the same - obedience to the commandments. Holiness is wedded to \\"life\\" and the commandments are the means to obtaining holiness and life. The core of Milgrom's argument is found in chapter 19, in which ritual and ethical laws are fused so that through obedience to the commandments Israel can transform itself into \\"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\\" (Exodus 19:6) The commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself, Milgrom argues, is the literary apex of the structure of Leviticus while the following command to love the stranger as oneself is the ethical summit of the Torah.Just as in his first volume, Milgrom painstakingly comments on every verse, drawing upon and discussing extensively ancient, medieval and modern writers. His verse by verse commentary on each chapter is followed by essays that explain in more detail his thoughts. Milgrom writes extensively on such topics as the meaning of \\"holiness\\", the significance of the \\"resident alien\\", Leviticus' battle with ancestor worship and gods of the underworld and even such modern topics as homosexuality.No review can capture the breadth and depth of Milgrom's work but even if you cannot afford this book, you should try to borrow it if only to read some of his essays. Good luck reading a challenging and thought provoking book!"},{"Title":"Leviticus 17-22: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Bible)","review":"An earlier of version of my reviewJust as Leviticus 17-22 builds and expands upon the themes contained in Leviticus 1-16, so too Milgrom's commentary on Leviticus 17-22 continues to build upon many of the themes and insights he laid out in his earlier commentary on Lev. 1-16.

Secondly, although Milgrom's translation of the entire book of Leviticus is set out at the beginning of his commentary in this volume and his discussion of each chapter is preceded by his translation of that chapter, nevertheless, in the commentary portion, isolated Hebrew words and phrases are transliterated into English letters which occasionally Milgrom does not immediately translate into English. Unfortunately, Anchor does not set out the transliteration system so unless you are already familiar with it, you have to noodle it out yourself or look up the passage. Moreover, Milgrom frequently employs specialized grammatical terms that will baffle the average reader. Nevertheless, if you are willing to work hard trying to understand the work, you will reap huge benefits even if you are not a modern Bible scholar.In his first volume, Milgrom argued that Leviticus transforms the ancient sacrificial system by banishing demons and identifying man's choices as the major source of impurity. Man's sin generates impurity that pollutes the Tabernacle and the more serious the sin, the more polluted the Tabernacle. Sacrifices, chiefly the chattat or purification offering (erroneously translated as \\"sin offering\\" by others), would purge the Tabernacle of impurity but only if motivated by the offeror's sincere remorse. If the pollution goes unchecked, G*d will abandon the Tabernacle and the people.In this volume, Milgrom argues that the impurity system in chapters 1-16 has been expanded. Whereas in chapters 1-16, holiness centered on the Tabernacle and the priesthood, in these chapters, the concept of holiness is expanded to encompass the land and the \\"lay\\" Israelite. The land of Canaan now functions like the Tabernacle in the wilderness. Sin pollutes the land and pollution unchecked results in exile. Just as the Canaanites were vomited from the land because of their immorality, so too Israel risks expulsion from the land if the people do not heed G*d's commands. Similarly, in these chapters, not only are the priests required to maintain their holiness, the average Israelite as well is called to strive toward it. The means of maintaining or achieving holiness are the same - obedience to the commandments. Holiness is wedded to \\"life\\" and the commandments are the means to obtaining holiness and life. The core of Milgrom's argument is found in chapter 19, in which ritual and ethical laws are fused so that through obedience to the commandments Israel can transform itself into \\"a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.\\" (Exodus 19:6) The commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself, Milgrom argues, is the literary apex of the structure of Leviticus while the following command to love the stranger as oneself is the ethical summit of the Torah.Just as in his first volume, Milgrom painstakingly comments on every verse, drawing upon and discussing extensively ancient, medieval and modern writers. His verse by verse commentary on each chapter is followed by essays that explain in more detail his thoughts. Milgrom writes extensively on such topics as the meaning of \\"holiness\\", the significance of the \\"resident alien\\", Leviticus' battle with ancestor worship and gods of the underworld and even such modern topics as homosexuality.No review can capture the breadth and depth of Milgrom's work but even if you cannot afford this book, you should try to borrow it if only to read some of his essays. Good luck reading a challenging and thought provoking book!"},{"Title":"Leviticus 17-22: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Bible)","review":"Any attempt to explain to the 21st century this ancient text is a monumental undertaking. While it is possible to get lost in the detail, the scholarship here shines through so that the text can be useful for us - today."},{"Title":"Leviticus 17-22: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Bible)","review":"Along with his academic erudition, Milgrom also has a lot of common sense. He takes what may appear to be a fairly liberal stance in following the Wellhousian J E P H D source theory, but don't judge him on these criteria. Underneath he is quite conservative and has a deep reverence for scripture. He has a rather fervent insistence that P (Priestly source, chiefly Leviticus 1 - 16) is quite early, containing largely traditions from Shiloh along with somewhat later traditions: \\"...P's Tabernacle presumes a central but not a single sanctuary, which one is it: the precentralized (Hezekian) Jerusalem Temple or the regional Temple of Shiloh? The answer is -- both.\\" [quote from Leviticus 1 - 16, p. 34]. Milgrom states clearly that the redactor of P is H (Holiness Source, chiefly Leviticus 17 - 27). Leviticus 17 - 22 is about the first half of H. Milgrom asserts that H is substantially later than P, though it is preexilic in the main. One of his key arguments is that Ezekiel borrows from H in at least nine specific instances, Leviticus 26 is borrowed by the prophet in exile [see Milgrom Leviticus 17 - 22, p. 1362].I love the way in which Milgrom acknowledges and utilizes the work of his students, naming them and giving specific credit where credit is due. In turn Milgrom acknowledges his sources and inspiration, scholars such as Yehezkel Kaufmann and N. H. Snaith. The superb bibliography in volume 1 suffices also for vol. 2 (17 - 22).There are many treasures to be mined in Leviticus 17 - 22, including the vast Introduction (pp. 1319 - 1443). This is basically the Introduction to H. The overview of Prophets and Archaeology Regarding Idolatry in the Eighth-Seventh Century is very straightforward and easy to read, and a must to any serious Bible student. The idolatry he is chiefly concerned with is that which was common in Judea and Jerusalem in the 7th Century BC. He draws a sharp distinction between idolatry associated with the Temple and idolatry practiced privately by ordinary people (as did Kaufmann), pp. 1382 - 1391).The page numbering simply continues on from Leviticus 1 - 16, so the first page of Leviticus 17 - 22 is p. 1267.The treatment on holiness is major in Leviticus 17 - 22, as was the treatment on purity in the first volume.I heartily recommend this commentary. With some hard work there are major jewels to be discovered."},{"Title":"Leviticus 17-22: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (Anchor Bible)","review":"Milgrom's work is important for any advanced study of Leviticus.

In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of 'Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This book tells the story of an actress, Maryna Zalezowska, a character Sontag tells us is loosely based on the career of Helena Modjeska, a famous turn-of-the-century Polish actress. The basic story is of her acting life in Poland and subsequent move to the \`promised land' of America, where she sets up a commune with fellow artists and friends, and continues her acting triumphs.Throughout the book Sontag blurs fact and fiction. Real-life characters, such as the American actor Edwin Booth, interact with the fictional characters. Similarly, we hear of Sarah Bernhardt, described as Zalezowka's greatest rival, and of key moments in American history. Sontag is clearly trying to retell the American myth in fiction, and this is certainly not the first time a writer has used the method of using both real and fictional characters - Cervantes's Don Quijote is an early example. However, with this book, Sontag fails to convince on either the fictional side or the depiction of the reality of emerging America. Character description is poor and it is extremely difficult to engage with the heroine. This is partly because there is so little context - we get no sense of her struggle with her adopted country, and no picture of any of the minor characters, with the possible exception of her husband, Bogdan. This is a shame, because the other characters are potentially extremely interesting. One commits suicide - we have little idea why. We don't really find out what any of the Poles think about their new land, or their new neighbours. At the end of the book they simply go back to Poland. Again, it's not clear why, or whether they feel they have succeeded or failed in their artistic endeavour. Similarly, Sontag seems to have little of interest to say about the new land. America is seen as the place where \`everything is new', where \`money is important' and where you can \`create your own future'. No major insights there! There are things to enjoy and appreciate in the book - the descriptions of theatrical life being particularly interesting - but these are are few and far between.Sontag is an extremely self-conscious narrator, constantly reminding the reader that she is there, commenting on the story she is telling. This prevents her from losing herself in the story, and the reader from doing the same. This is partly a problem of the novel of ideas. Yet plenty of other authors have managed to bring a novel of ideas alive, Milan Kundera being a good example. Sadly, as in her other fictional work, the reader of In America feels the presence of the theorist/philosopher too strongly to be able to enjoy the book as a work of fiction, and is left feeling frustrated."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Electing to read IN AMERICA beacuse of its awards I found this bloated novel to be a bit heavy on author intrusiveness. As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I read this book because it won the National Book Award for fiction this year, and I am trying to read all such winners so I figured I should read this year's winner. (I have now read 39 winners and that leaves 15 unread.) This book starts very oddly and people who quit reading if they are not caught up by a book by page 25 will probably quit reading this. They shouldn't. It would have helped me if I had read the back of the title page, which tells whence Susan Sontag drew her inspiration, and how this book relates to the factual setting of the period. I found this book once the central character and her group decided to come to America very interesting reading, and consistently holding my attention. Extra tidbits which interested me were the stray references to events and people referred to in the story: e.g.: Mayne Reid? Do you know who he was? I looked him up in a reference work. Ditto as to the novel and play East Lynne. This is a historical novel where the factual historical references are accurate so far as I can tell, not like some historical novels. I remember how bothered I was by Sir Walter Scott's Kenilworth, which had no chronolgical consistency to it that I could see. (The story is laid in the period 1574 and 1575, but Amy Robsart actually died in 1560; Shakespeare appears in the book, but was not even born before Amy Robsart died.) Give this book a chance, I say."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Susan Sontag won the National Book award for \`In America'yesterday. Having just finished this book I wonder why? It is a goodbook, but not a great one.Another reviewer here attacked \`InAmerica' because it did not have much plot. That reviewer might becomplaining that long passages of the book are letters and excerptsfrom a diary laid out in chronological order. It is true this is nota fast-moving page-turner, but plot is not why one usually readsSontag. Rather the insight that is typical of Sontag's book-lengthessays is what you would expect to find in her novel.If there isanything insightful here it must in the in the interplay between thethree major characters in the novel. They are the famous Polishactress Maryna, her husband Bogdan, and her bachelor friend Rysard.The opening scene of the novel is so far fetched as to be not evenbelievable. We are at a cocktail party in Poland. An unnamednarrator, who does not speak of world of Polish, relates what ishappening. Yet she claims to understand the events that transpirearound her. That is ridiculous and annoying.From this oddbeginning the novel picks up speed and becomes more interesting.Maryna surmises that she cannot remain at the pinnacle of Polishtheater forever. She wonders, \`The public is fickle. My public wantsto love a newer, younger face.' This is her reason she wants to quitPoland and move to America. She gathers together her retinue afriend who is a painter, a doctor, and other hangers-on andretreats to the mountains. There most of her circle decides to moveto the New World and establish a commune.The commune is establishedin Anaheim, California. At that time (19th century) the countrysidewas mostly empty having been recently settled by German immigrants.The farm that Maryna and her friends establish is called a \`commune'by some other book reviewers. But to me it seems that Maryna was ableto convince her friends to move with her largely by the weight of herpersonality. I did not find that she said \`let's establish acommunistic commune'. Yet that is exactly what her neighbors did inSouthern California. There were several patterned on the Brook Farmand the writings of Fourier. These were true communistic ventureswhose plight and origins are described by Edmund Wilson in \`To theFinland Station'.Maryna is pursued across Poland and then inAmerica by her writer friend Rysard. He writes articles on the Polishactress and on his own journey to America for Polish newspapers.Rysard seeks the love of Maryna. (It appears they were loversbefore.) Maryna's husband for reasons that I never learned evenencourages them to travel to San Francisco together. Would you sendyou wife off with someone who was seeking her affection?Maryna leftthe commune she had established and moved to San Francisco to seek toreenter the theatre. Her main motive appears that the commune wasrunning out of cash, but she also wants to prove that she can succeedin the English-speaking American theater. The commune falls apartwhen the \`expatriate intellectuals' as they callthemselves prove inept at making a living growing grapes. Therewere also domestic difficulties such as perennial fights between oneof the married couples there. Each commune dweller drifted away forhis or her own reason.Maryna says \`Every marriage, every communityis a failed utopia. Utopia is not a kind of place but a kind of time, those all too brief moments when one would not wish to be anywhere else.'Anyway, as other reviewers have already pointed out, Maryna returns to the theatre and triumphs. This return did not seem so triumphant as it was written by Sontag at the onset. It appeared more happenstance. But later descriptions of Maryna on-stage and the resultant accolades make the reader more convinced that Maryna deserves to be called a great actress.The character Rysard might be Susan Sontag's alter ego. Rysard, the writer, says that he cannot stand people, but the love of people is required in order to be a writer. Rysard makes several other comments on the craft of writing that perhaps come from the opinions of Susan Sontag."},{"Title":"In America","review":"What a disappointing bore!

Astoundingly irritating!"},{"Title":"In America","review":"\\"In America\\" is a strange, beautiful and difficult book among Susan Sontag's oeuvre. Better known by her non-fiction, this one is a quasi-departure from her milieu. Likewise her previous fictional effort, \\"The Volcano Lover\\", this is a historical novel, loosely based on true events. But, Sontag is an artist, therefore, her work is more than simply retelling a real story.As she tells in a brief introduction, this work is inspired by the life of Poland's most celebrated actress and her immigration to America. \\"Inspired by... no less and no more.\\" With these words, we learn that Sontag has appropriated of the characters and made them her own. This is certainly one of the most intriguing aspects of \\"In America\\" - how an artist recreates life the way it pleases her fiction. This theme is very suitable since it is a novel about an artist (the protagonist) who has to reinvent herself in order to survive when her dreams of a utopian society go astray.The character is Maryna Zalezowska, Poland's most celebrated actress of her time, who has conquered hearts and minds with her art. Tired of this life, she immigrates to America, taking with her, her husband, son, lover and some friends. America appears to her as a dream, as something that could never go wrong, a place where money meets dream and they are happily married.After Maryna's idealist community doesn't work out, she has to recreate herself, and return to the stage. Once a celebrated actor, now like a newcomer she has to prove her talent. The approach of art - especially theater - is different in the States from Europe. But she is a smart woman capable of giving audiences what they want - even if that means corrupting herself somehow sometimes.It feels like Sontag is telling us this is the art of being an American. The art of reinventing one's self whenever and however it is needed. Maryna is the intersection of both worlds - the Old and the New one. Love has a role in her life, as well, but smaller than art. Maryna lives and dies for the theater - in other words, for her art.While Sontag is very known by her essays on culture, politics and so on, her novels are distinctive for dealing these subjects inserted in a fictional account. Despite being written a decade ago, \\"In America\\" is tremendously up to date. This is a story about what makes one country, and what immigrants find in their new country. America is receptive to Maryna once she is able to give what her audience wants. What do they want? That is a very tricky question. Love, for once. But they are also delighted with death. But above all, they want to be more than Europeans. Noble titles, as a character says, are very impressive to Americans - and who cares if they are real.As a post-modern novel, the opening and closing chapters, are quite interesting. Both of them are a first person account of Sontag herself entering in Maryna's world and departing from it. However difficult they are for a reader - they are a single paragraph twenty-page long - these sequences in \\"In America\\" are beautiful and meaningful. The strange feeling they give us is certainly related to Maryna's own strangeness of a foreigner in a country in the making."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I expected to like this novel; Sontag has a wonderful reputation and the storyline had potential.

Certainly her characterization of the white race as the cancer of history seens like a grandiose bit of breast-beating. But hey, there's no point in beating up on her new novel for a statement she made nearly 25 years ago. &quot;In America&quot; is by no means a perfect work of fiction--to call it a novel of ideas is in fact the highest compliment AND the lowest blow you could aim at it. Yet it's packed with strange and cerebral wonders that only Sontag could dream up. And the protagonist is a truly memorable, realistically erratic diva, who cuts a dramatic (in every sense of the word) swathe across late Victorian America."},{"Title":"In America","review":"The best feature of Sontag's novel was the narative style which did not fail to change from Chapter to Chapter. Sometimes it was in an omniscient voice, and other times in the character's own first person narative, in writing and speech, which brought us into the minds and thoughts of the various fascinating Poles in the story. The plot of the story is ineresting in itself to a certain degree, but the idea of leaving Europe and forging a new life in America must have been re-done many times over esp. in the original immigrant literature. The irony of how the Europeans went to America to leave what they were used to behind, to escape the fetters, but seem to pursue the exact same fetters in America is present in Sontag's novel. It also brings out the other ironic element of wanting to do something different and unexpected, but falling into the mold in wanting to form an utopian community which was fashionable at the time. I enjoyed the flow of the storyline and the characterisation of Ryszard as the writer and Maryna as an actress, artists who without art will lose their self, and their use. The first Chapter of the book also leaves one wondering -- was that the author as a persona -- Sontag imagining her characters into play? As a writer would? To see their world, enter it, and develop it? Or was it a neutral observer preparing is for Maryna's plan to leave for America? Sontag's novel of immigration, America, Europe, art, religion and relationships is thought-provoking and a fascinating study.

Boasting some of the most gorgeous prose ever committed to print, it is bursting with heartfelt yearning and promise for the future as it traces the path taken by the celebrated stage actress Maryna and her community of friends, who embittered by their history of colonisation by the Russians, chose to leave Poland in the late 19th century to build a utopian commune in America. Their grand agrarian experiment to rediscover the vitality of simple living and return to basics fails. Due to lack of experience or otherwise, Maryna's commune comprising scholars, writers, painters and their families, breaks up and some of them return to their former lives in Poland. Maryna herself, after a brief period of self imposed exile returns to active professional life and quickly establishes herself as a celebrity once again but this time in her newly adopted country. &quot;In America&quot; raises a whole cache of fascinating ideas. It contrasts the inherent cynicism and corruption of old world values with the innocence, optimism but also shallowness of new world morality. Sontag's ambitious novel starts off promisingly, using an unnamed female narrator who then mysteriously disappears, never to show up again. The narrative then segues seamlessly into a penetrating and fascinating peek into the Polish soul. Using a blend of shifting perspectives, the experience is both insightful and mesmerising. But when the utopian commune breaks up, some of the magic in Sontag's writing also evaporates. Certainly I found the final 100 pages or so a little pedestrian. The use of a jumble of literary formats including letters, poems, rotating confessions, etc also gives a slightly disjointed and unstructured feel to the book. The concluding section featuring a soliloquy by Edwin Booth emerges from nowhere to close the book ! Talk of abrupt endings. However, the high points were so absorbing I was too far away in seventh heaven to notice or mind. &quot;In America&quot; is an outstanding literary achievement. It may not make easy reading but it'll repay your effort many times over. Don't miss it !"},{"Title":"In America","review":"I read this book as my first Sontag excursion. I picked it because it won the National Book Award. I was incredibly disappointed in the book. True enough, Sontag is an excellent writer and an expressive one as well. However, in this book, she seems to have been carried away by a desire to show the reader, just how many different writing styles she seems to perceive herself to have mastered. She slips into perhaps six different styles of writing in the book, ranging from the epistolary, to the stream of consciousness to the plain prose. The book is more an experiment in stylized writing techniques and the plot and story are just plain droll. I found myself wishing I was at the end, by the time I got to the half way point. While it is unusual for the NBA to give their award to such a mediocre piece of literature, it would be my recommendation to any would be reader that they NOT WASTE THEIR TIME reading THIS BOOK. It is not worth the investment. I would have rather reread the plays by Shakespeare and others that she constantly references in her book, just so the reader understands she has a complete knowledge of classic thesbian literature. I will not bother to read any of her other works, nor any future ones either."},{"Title":"In America","review":"After the intruiging, if slightly awkward, opening chapter in which Sontag insinuates herself into the narrative, this high brow soap opera begins to skirt terrain already charted by the likes of the far less gifted Isabel Allende in, say, &quot;Daughter of Fortune&quot; or &quot;The Infinite Plan&quot;, though it never abandons its philosophy in favor of melodramtic plot twists, as did those unfortunate books. Indeed, there's far more substance and interest here in Sontag's dissection of cultural displacement, artistic integrity and sexual mores than there is in the fairly listless plot, which always seems to be moving forward without ever gaining steam. Even the most dramatic of events (the collapse of the Anaheim compound, for instance) is rendered with such clear-eyed dispassion that it can be hard to care about these characters or their various fates. That said, this novel is so wrought with provocative ideas, the prose is so elegant, that only the most shallow of readers will fail to be drawn into the world (or, rather, worlds) which Sontag has beautifully delineated: the Old World vs. the New, the material world vs. the interior (artistic) world. If this book fails to reach the narrative and intellectual heights of &quot;The Volcano Lover&quot;, it offers enough rewards of its own to make it worthwhile reading. And every new Sontag book is a welcome addition to the shelves, whatevers its flaws."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This odd novel is like a charming house surrounded by an imposing edifice. While I found the idea of the first chapter very appealing - we observe the author considering her characters and gradually entering their lives - the lack of paragraphs and sustained distance were frustrating. I kept turning to the blurbs on the back to give me faith that the book would achieve motion. When it finally did, it felt like a railroad train developing steam and then chugging right along. The stories of New York and Anaheim at the turn of the century were wonderful, as were the carefully researched tales of trouping in America. Maryna, both a diva and marvelously complex woman, was grand enough to carry the novel and most of the major characters on her back. The novel's coda, unfortunately, was as dense and forbidding as the opening. While I enjoyed reading Edwin Booth's reflections on a life in Shakespeare and was fascinated by the fate of the Booths, more of my attention was commanded by Sontag than either Booth or Marina. Perhaps that brought the act of imagination full circle with the author once again facing her creation, but I missed the livelier environs of the heart of the book, when Marina was stealing the spotlight and creating the illusion of something larger than life."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In this novel, a Polish theater star travels to America with her troop of blindly smitten friends and family in the late 19th century to live off the land and hide from the spotlight. When her plan for self-sufficiency on the farm fails, she challenges the American theater stage.The beautiful Polish actress, Madame Zalenska, whose self-centeredness is nauseating, does offer a level of sharp wit and intelligence that at times makes her likeable or at least respectable. There are rare glimpses of Sontag's tendency for profound insight throughout the novel in terms of her ability to recognize and document the subtle delicacies of human relationships. Kernels of Sontag's views on American culture, sexuality, race, and art are present in the novel but in the context of the shallow story they appear out of place.The novel contains far too many boring lists of Madame Zalenska's numerous performances and far too many hyperbolic descriptions of Zalenska's seemingly superhuman acting ability and feminine charm.Zalenska's brief venture into the role of a farm wife in Santa Ana, California was the most interesting part of the novel as it offered some respite from the \\"star quality\\" of Zalenska that had become tiring early in the novel.The novel ended abruptly coinciding with the introduction of a character who had been merely mentioned prior. The ending robbed the reader of hope for some last minute character development or growth on the part of Madame Zalenska that could have added import and resolution to the novel as a whole."},{"Title":"In America","review":"If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!"},{"Title":"In America","review":"I was hoping for a long more than this from Sontag and the National Book Award committee. The story is somewhat of a cliche and the characters -- while noble in a sense -- are somewhat dull and overly introspective. This was a chore to finish."},{"Title":"In America","review":"A truly entertaining book that kept me captivated. I enjoyed Sontag's use of different writing styles to convey the many characters through the story."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In 1876 Poland's leading actress, Helena Modrzejewska, along with family and friends, including journalist and novelist Henryk Sienkiewicz (\\"Quo Vadis\\"), emigrated to southern California to establish a utopian community. Like most such communities, it failed, and so, with a newly Americanized name, Helena Modjeska launched a second career as her adopted country's leading Shakespearean actress, touring coast to coast with such celebrity actors as Edwin Booth.These are the skeletal historical facts on which Sontag bases her second novel: Helena Modjeska becomes Maryna Zalenska, Henryk Sienkiewicz becomes Ryszard Kierul, although Booth gets to keep his name. This local slice of Anaheim history was rediscovered by Sontag and stuck with her; the novel's genesis is re-imagined in the opening Chapter \\"Zero,\\" one of the most brilliant examples of metafiction ever published. A twentieth-century writer is walking through a winter storm in Warsaw when she happens by a party inside a hotel--a scene, of course, that takes place wholly in her mind. She listens in on their conversations and realizes that the celebrants are planning to leave for America; although theirs is not the story she had planned to write (\\"having tried to conjure up a hotel dining room from the same era in Sarajevo\\"), she \\"decided to follow them out into the world.\\"\\"Into the world\\" means \\"into America,\\" and, for an immigrant, Sontag's Zalenska is a bit too perfect, too confident, too understanding--in spite of her affairs and her failings. She's almost a nineteenth-century romantic fantasy figure of imported aristocracy. Sontag sets this feminine ideal against the starry-eyed, comic naivety of the actual and imagined eccentrics who surrounded Modjeska/Zalenska, including a closeted husband with an eye for the local youth and an endearingly irritable voice teacher.The real-life Polish immigrants left behind a rather generous body of texts--journalism, diaries, letters, memoirs--that Sontag made liberal use of when composing her novel, and \\"In America\\" similarly alternates among these various genres during the course of the narrative. The incorporation of scattered passages from the original texts without setting them off from her own writing led to charges of plagiarism against Sontag, although all the excerpts, while obscure, are in the public domain, and one would be hard-pressed to say she tried to hide their use.Such perceived impropriety would have been forgiven, in any case, if Sontag's experiment had resulted in a more cohesive work, but the book occasionally has the whiff of being the product of a writing seminar. The final result is a novel whose chapters fluctuate from postmodern brilliance to family scrapbook. Nevertheless, I still found the story of the Modjeskas/Zalenskas almost consistently fascinating enough to excuse the relatively minor shortcomings of the methods Sontag used to re-imagine their tale."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Once the gassy raconteuse of Chapter Zero has been endured (this device may have been charming in brief, but does not remain engaging for more than a few pages), there is a brief, disorienting feeling of freedom as the unknown frontier of the novel is broached. Unfortunately, this exuberance dissipates immediately.Not that there isn't a terrific novel hidden In America somewhere.I can't help but wonder why Sontag chose to tell much of the novel from her female protagonist's perspective, since her male narrators are so consistently vividly imagined and effective, and her female characters are not. A scene in steerage and an excerpt from Maryna's husband's diary are much more provocative than Maryna's musing... since the actress-protagonist is a motivating force and an object of adoration, there really isn't much for her to do besides inspire and wonder. Interestingly enough, this imbalance, this failure of imagination when portraying male and female perspectives, is also evident in The Volcano Lover (a much more fully realized book).Perhaps the questions Sontag asked herself in writing this book were never satisfactorily answered for (asked by?) the author... or perhaps the book means to evoke the aridity of both failed dreams and success, as well as the narcissism of the theater and the heavy blankness of the American gaze.Regardless, this is not generally a diverting reading experience, nor is it particularly engaging as a novel of ideas."},{"Title":"In America","review":"The designation of &quot;National Book Award Winner&quot; has lost all credibility. What were the criteria for winning? My book club has been meeting for over 14 years and we unanimously voted this book as the worst book we have ever read."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Is *In America* a historical biography, autobiography, psychic recall or prophecy? Whatever it may be, it is fascinating narrative-poetry, and only worth of the highest praise."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This National Book Award Winner is the story of a famous Polish actress who emigrates to the United States in 1875, with her husband, child, and an entourage of friends and would-be-lovers to start a new and idyllic life for themselves on a commune farm located near the German settlement of Anaheim, CA. They are artists, writers, actors, and nobility who fail at farming in the hot, dry climate they chose to cultivate. Maryna Lezowska (real life Helena Modrzejewska) changed her name to Marina Zalenska (real life Helena Modjeska) returned to acting and began a triumphant career in America. Called the \`Countess' as a publicity ploy because of her marriage to a Polish count, Marina became famous across this country and astounded audience after audience with performances of Portia and Lady Macbeth, two among many roles she portrayed. I was amazed by her memory. She performed one arduous role after another, a different play every night of the week, but the heroines sounded so similar: How could she remember which one she was doing? What a repertoire! As Sontag's story unfolds we are treated to America and Americans through the eyes of a brilliant woman of the 19th century. At the end we enjoy a visit from an alcoholic Edwin Booth as he soliloquizes re his life, a famous actor-father, Shakespeare, and the brother who killed Lincoln. We see America embrace theater; a thorough, insightful, picture of America in a bygone era. I found this journalistic, historical novel ... very boring for the most part. Certainly not a page-turner. Another disappointment of works picked to receive an award."},{"Title":"In America","review":"i have not read other sontag works and was really looking forward to this novel by way of introduction. however, other than the highly creative and stunning &quot;chapter zero&quot; there was little to this book. the storyline seemed boring if not trite, and i did not find the writing style particularly interesting either. maryna had my attention off and on, but she and many of the other characters seemed flat to me, alternating between not-quite-alive to over-alive. short of RAVE reviews for some other piece of writing by her, i won't be sampling her other works any time soon."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I finished reading In America a bit more than a week ago, but it still lingers in my mind. I read the novel with quickness and fascination from beginning to end. Those who have panned it may not recognize (or value) its uniqueness. It blends the form of the script with the form of the novel. For example, it ends with a fascinating soliloquy by Edwin Booth, who goes on for pages as Maryna has before him. It's about the self-obsessed, intriguing, grand lives of great performers more than it is about \\"coming to America\\" or \\"setting up a utopia doomed for failure.\\" It's about self-obsession and not being able to stand the reflection of yourself that you see in others who are like you... It doesn't hold together in a linear way. It's more like Morrison than Frazier or the like. It's inventive in form and style, and I found it fascinating."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In 1876, a group of Polish immigrants flee the Russian authorities that control their native land. They establish a commune in Southern California. The person behind the journey is Poland's leading actress, Maryna Zalewska who has given up the stage to be with her husband and son IN AMERICA. She persuades several individuals and families to join her on her quest for freedom.However, political and social freedom does not necessarily mean economic freedom. The commune fails, leaving its bankrupt members wary and disillusioned with their taste of freedom. Maryna, not one to sit around and mope, returns to the stage where she becomes the &quot;American&quot; rival to Sara Bernhardt. She wonders about her future IN AMERICA and the dreams that died with the collapse of the commune. With novels like THE VOLCANO LOVER and IN AMERICA, Susan Sontag has become the novelist of choice for historiographers and anyone who enjoys a well-researched period piece. The story line is filled with the abject lessons of American history that is not covered in American classroom settings. Maryna is an intriguing character and her ability to adapt to circumstances is admirable. She fails to gain reader empathy because nothing really disturbs her except her own ennui. Fans who enjoy a well-written historical novel will find Ms. Sontag's tale enchanting and entertaining.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"In America","review":"Reading this book is like having someone snatch a particularly juicy feast out from under your nose before you've had the chance to enjoy it properly. &quot;In America&quot; is a rich tale to savor, but slices of it are underdone and it comes to such an abrupt end that the reader is left wondering what happened to the final course.Starting the novel with an awkward Zero chapter--meant, I think, to better explain the characters--Susan Sontag tells of Maryna Zalezowska, the leading Polish actress of the 1870s, who comes to California to open a utopian commune near Anaheim. The commune quickly fails, and Zalezowska begins the task of reinventing herself as an American actress. She does this brilliantly, and begins a new career traveling across the United States in a private train car performing everything from Shakespeare to the 19th century's favorite sob-fest, &quot;East Lynne.&quot;The sections on how an actress of that age learned and prepared roles, and the insight into nuts-and-bolts workings of 19th century American theater are marvelous, as are the stunning monologue chapters expressing the three main characters' internal and external struggles (the book ends with a devastating monologue by Edwin Booth that is one terrific piece of writing). On the other hand some of the characters are barely sketched and &quot;In America&quot; simply ends. There's no resolution, no sense that the last page of the book should be the last page-in fact, you'll probably turn that page expecting a concluding chapter. And you'll feel cheated.There's something mean about allowing readers such access to characters' minds and emotions and then chopping the narrative when there is obviously so much to come. Is it that Sontag can't sustain the narrative? The novel reads that way.It is hard to know how many stars to give &quot;In America.&quot; I found much of it fascinating, but felt slighted by the lack of resolution. Yes, even though I know that the real-life model for Maryna, Helena Modjeska, had a long and successful career before retiring to the remote Southern California canyon that still bears her name, I feel robbed of the chance to follow her there, guided by Sontag's masterly hand."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Award winning literature should provoke thoughtful questions. Susan Sontag's &quot;In America&quot; prompted my bookclub to ask: 1) Where the heck was her editor? 2) Was it simply Susan Sontag's turn to win the National Book Award? 3) If &quot;In America&quot; was penned by an unknown author, would it have even been published? 4) Did the guy who was quoted on the back cover actually read the book? Would he please tell us where the &quot;hilarious&quot; parts are? 5) Why did the chapters that were 1 paragraph yet 17+ pages long irritate us so? 6) Does a single interesting premise like &quot;Immigrating to a new country allows you to reinvent yourself&quot; merit 387 tedious pages? and finally 7) Why the heck did our bookclub pick this book?"},{"Title":"In America","review":"I share the same sentiment that others have expressed: Why did this book receive the National Book Award? From its disconnected beginning, to its rambling stream of consciousness ending, the book lacks cohesiveness, character development, and theme. Even the plot is trite and fails to captivate. One senses that Sontag was rushed in the writing -- perhaps hoping to fulfill a contract? Although she bothers to take some time in the beginning to explore Maryna's desire to retreat to America, her family background, and initial delvings into the theatre; Sontag literally whisks the reader through the middle of the book to its conclusion -- dabbling at Maryna's theatre excursions in San Francisco and her touring trip with her husband. More frustrating is Sontag's constant fluxing of writing style -- from hypothetical letters, to experimental conversation in which she addresses multiple people (upon Maryna's brief return to Poland), to the gibberish of a soliloquy delivered by Edwin Booth.Ultimately, the book fails to achieve a unified theme. Sontag hints at the destruction of a utopian society, at the strange interworkings of a marriage of convenience, at an actress's chameleonic personality, at the &quot;plight&quot; of the privileged immigrant. However, none of these themes is explored in depth, nor does any one seem to be the author's driving motivation behind the book. Similarly, none of the characters' behavior offers convincing explanation; and therefore, not a single character won my sympathy or understanding.For a captivating book on immigration to the West, as well as the profound, analytical exploration of two very different people in a marriage, I highly recommend Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose instead. In America is a weak, languishing similitude of that great book, at best."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I have enjoyed the depth of Susan Sontag's lucid, witty essays in the New Yorker magazine, and recently we saw her on Cspan Book -TV. A caller asked what would be the best introduction to her writings, and she suggested her novel \\"In America.\\"This book was surprisingly disappointing to me. I kept waiting to get swept up into it, but came to the last page with only a sense of duty for finishing. The characters are drawn well enough ,the time frame (post-Civil War America) is interesting, but the book failed to engage me somehow. Sontag has an affinity for the movies and for actors;she has created as the lead character a Polish actress who finds stellar success on the American stage.I will continue to enjoy Sontag's essays but doubt I will read another of her novels."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Generally, the reviews of In America here are dazzylingly unfair. Certainly, reading this novel is not like sitting down and watching TV, or even reading the Sunday New York Times. The novel demands that the reader read changes of style, tone, shift in narrative focus, change from letters to first person narrative back to third person narrative, to a sort of interior monologue. What is wrong with this, if it is done with control, as Songtag does, except for the fact it demands that readers fail to be lazy? So, this is not a novel for the easily frazzled. It demands faith from the reader, but rewards the reader for this trust with a deep investigation of what it means to be an American and human."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This book is the first I have read by Susan Sontag. But I thought, National Book Award, it must be excellent. I was disappointed, however, when I had to force my way through the quasi-historical prelude to Chapter One. Relieved to make it to the first chapter, at least by now the characters are making sense. I literally force myself to finish this book. None of the characters are appealing, form Maryna, the actress, to her husband, Bogdon, or her lover, Ryszard, all Polish immigrants. Surely the most self-involved of all is Maryna, her main topic of interest being herself and her effect on other people. The plot and sub-plots all revolve around this woman. She dominates the entire landscape of everyone's thoughts. Why? &quot;Frankly, my dear, to borrow a phrase, I don't give a damn.&quot; All the historical detail in the world cannot save this book. I also purchased THE VOLCANO LOVER, but after this experience, I think I'll pass both books on to those obsessed with 18th century verbage. Historical is one thing, mind-numbing is another."},{"Title":"In America","review":"In America intends to be an \\"important\\" act of \\"literature.\\" It is not. It is not even a good read. In the whole story of Maryna Zalezowska, a Polish actress who emigrates to America with a horde of friends and admirers, fails to found a commune farm, and returns to success on the stage, the only remotely memorable moments are snapshots of local color that are almost digressions from the story itself.The account of two of the characters' sea passage across the Atlantic, focusing on the contrast between their first-class accommodations and those in steerage, actually is touching. There are descriptions of 19th century New York, early Anaheim, and Comstock Lode silver mining towns that might make a die-hard jingoist shed a tear, not because they are flattering of America, but just because they portray her painted large in all the false glory of the gilded age. The last chapter, a long, rambling, almost humorous monologue by Edwin Booth as he half-heartedly tries to seduce the protagonist by telling her how pathetic a person he is, is worth reading (or maybe that was only my impression because it was the end of the book).But these highlights are actually digressions from the story itself. The real story, revolves around Maryna, who is terribly uninteresting. She possesses a self-centeredness that enables her to do whatever she wants and entrain those around her in her wake, but when one looks closer to see what aspects of her character this self-centeredness might stem from, there is nothing. No innate charisma beyond being a beautiful woman, no grand ideas other than those lifted wholesale from 19th century French social theorists, no traits of human mobility, as if a present-day purveyor of postmodern literature could condescend to believe in such a thing. By authorial fiat, Maryna is the center of her world, but she lacks the attributes that might enable her to be the center of the reader's.Since Maryna must be the focal point of the book, on several times another character's subplot is developed just to the point of becoming interesting, only to be promptly aborted. One couple in the commune, Julian and Wanda, have latent marital problems that America brings into much clearer focus. Wanda makes a suicide attempt, and then the characters are shipped back to Poland and mostly forgotten about. Maryna begins an affair with her persistent admirer Ryszard. It turns stale and ends. We discover Maryna's husband Bogdan is sexually attracted to the Mexican farmhands in Anaheim, but this goes nowhere as it is immaterial to Maryna's career, and by extension the book. Basically, the whole novel revolves around an innately uninteresting person, and all other characters must become even more completely two-dimensional to avoid supplanting her.In America contains nothing worth caring about. It contains a few digressions that aren't enslaved to Maryna's story, and in these digressions, Sontag shows she is capable of writing a much better book. However, she did not do so."},{"Title":"In America","review":"The plot of \\"In America\\", Susan Sontag's National Book Award-winning novel, is adumbrated in her introductory note, where she describes the real historical life that inspired the fictional work. In Sontag's words, the novel was \\"inspired by the emigration to America in 1876 of Helena Modrzejewska, Poland's most celebrated actress, accompanied by her husband, Count Karol Chlapowski, her fifteen-year-old son Rudolf, and the young journalist and future author of \`Quo Vadis' Henryk Sienkiewicz, and a few friends; their brief sojourn in Anaheim, California; and Modrzejewska's subsequent triumphant career on the American stage under the name of Helen Modjeska.\\" While Sontag strongly emphasizes that the characters and actions depicted in her novel are purely invented (and there is no reason to believe the contrary), the plot largely follows the biography that inspired it.\\"In America\\" begins in a post-modernist fashion, the book's \\"Chapter Zero\\" being the first person narrative of a contemporary authorial voice who finds herself coming out of the cold winter of an unidentified Eastern European city, shivering, into a party in the private dining room of a hotel more than a hundred years earlier. There is seemingly a disjunction of time and place. The narrator does not understand the language the people are speaking, \\"but somehow, I didn't question how, their words reached me as sense.\\" From this point, the authorial voice, the imagination, begins naming the people in the room-in effect, begins creating the characters that will populate the tale to follow-and begins probing the animated conversation she overhears, the snippets of enigmatic dialogue that will gradually accrete into the novel. As the narrator suggests at the end of this Chapter Zero, in words resonant of a theme by Virginia Woolf, \\"each of us carries a room within ourselves, waiting to be furnished and peopled, and if you listen closely, you may need to silence everything in your own room, you can hear the sounds of that other room inside your head.\\" Thus, in typical Sontag fashion, the novel itself begins with a self-conscious intrusion of theory and authorial presence.From this interesting and auspicious beginning, \\"In America\\" seamlessly glides into the narrative proper, the story of Maryna Zalezowska, a much beloved Polish actress who, together with her husband Bogdan, her son Piotr, her paramour Ryszard, and an entourage of friends and followers, emigrates to America in 1876. Landing in New York, the group spends a brief period living in Hoboken, visiting the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia and exploring New York City before embarking on a voyage to the West. After a brief sojourn in San Francisco, they move down the coast to Southern California, where they establish a small settlement in Anaheim. Maryna, the leader of her band of ardent disciples, sees their vineyard and farm in Anaheim as a kind of acting out of Fourieristic ideals, a little Brook Farm of Polish emigrants in the Wild West. Life is hard, however, and the utopian dream soon becomes a dystopic unraveling as Maryna goes back to San Francisco, has a brief affair with Ryzsard and returns to the theater. Her husband, Bogan, remains at the Anaheim settlement until it can be sold and then rejoins Maryna in San Francisco, where she has become an overnight theatrical sensation, her Polish stardom now burning brightly in America.From this point, the novel becomes almost exclusively the story of Maryna. She changes her name to Marina Zalenska, travels to Virginia City and, eventually, New York City (and even, briefly, London), and attracts fans and admirers wherever she goes. Her life becomes a self-centered, exhaustive tour of America, performing with her own repertory company and making stage appearances with the Edwin Booth, the most renowned actor of the time. Pushing the narrative's other characters into the shadows, Marina Zalenska makes America her own, \\"In America\\" being not so much the story of what it was like for a group of Eastern Europeans to emigrate to America, but, rather, the story of Marina Zalenska's personal triumph in America.Susan Sontag is a brilliant writer, her prose supple and lithe. Reading this book is effortless. Sontag also uses a range of stylistic devices-journal entries, letters, theatrical dialogue, monologue-which make \\"In America\\" a fascinating literary construction. However, the quality of the writing does not redeem the listless tenor of the tale or the shallowness of the characters and ideas which Sontag propogates. At one point, Maryna says, \\"an actor doesn't need to have an essence. Perhaps it would be a hindrance for an actor to have an essence. An actor needs only a mask.\\" Unfortunately, Maryna's view of acting seemingly permeates this novel, the view of the character becoming the practice of the author: the characters and the ideas of \\"In America\\" are not essential, but only superficial. Like the post-modernist beginnings of Chapter Zero, the reader only gets a shallow tale, a tale that glides on a sparkling smooth surface with trivial and uninteresting characters; while the writing is easy, the story fails to hold the reader's interest and, hence, the reading becomes difficult and soporific. \\"In America\\" is perhaps worth reading, but it is not deserving of the National Book Award."},{"Title":"In America","review":"You can't ignore the self-consciousness of the author in this book, but in away she deals with this and does away with it in the prologue. The mystery of this book is the borderline between Sontag's consciousness and the protagonists. What it is really about is the violation and domination of the minds of others. Not only is the protagonist an actress as a character but a historical person acting out her consciousness through Sontag's mind. Rather than some mystical conjuring act this is an active method of recreating ideals. The feminine ideal is an endless performer: one who is constantly made-up and at the same time natural. It is this contradiction which is explored in the protagonist's life. Sontag is testing the merge of actor (ficional being) and actual person. The performer is inevitably lost, but paradoxically in this novel the performer is pushed back on stage. Is this where she naturally belongs? This is what you should ask going into In America. It is about ideas concerning identity and its conclusions are highly sophisticated."},{"Title":"In America","review":"This was a fascinating book. Written in Susan Sontag's unique writing style it is a many layered work. It entails a woman's search for her own itentity, the idealism of commune life, the nature of love and much more. We start off with a group of Polish idealists starting up a commune in California with no idea of what they are doing and end up seeing a picture of the theater life in America at the end of the 19th. century. Only a writer with skill like Susan Sontag could pull off a transition like this so smoothly. The only objection I have is the ending---the book simply ends. There are no obvious loose ends hanging, but the story definately lacks a conclusion."},{"Title":"In America","review":"I wish I had come to Amazon.com and read all the negative reviews before I wasted $... on this junk. I read the rave reviews on the back of the book and foolishly bought it. It is a rambling collection of pages about a period of history in which I have no interest (the 1800's) and the writing in very choppy and boring. The back of the book gave no clue as to the time period or the nationality of the characters. The &quot;coming to America&quot; stories are my least favorite. I never, ever throw books in the trash-I usually give them to charity or to the library. I threw this one away. I want this book off the street, so no other poor soul would make the same mistake I did and read this drivel."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers on this site, I started reading In America expecting not to like it. That's what happens to me with most novels by American Intellectuals. By the end of chapter zero, I was sure I would enjoy hating this book. Only an American Intellectual could listen to a discussion in Polish, without having spent a minute studying the language, and understand the essence of the conversation. But then came the rest of the book, which was a journey through time and interesting places. For me Sontag's California and Poland were the stars of the novel. I especially enjoyed Sontag's pictures of Zakopane in the days before it was taken over by tourists. Sontag's writing reminded me of I.B. Singer. The characters were not as strong, but the flow of the book had that old county feel. So, if you raise you sights a little lower and forget that Sontag is an American great and that this novel won awards, you might actually enjoy it as a light autumn read."},{"Title":"In America","review":"Sontag had fun recreating all this history and I enjoyed reading it, to a point. What was that long monologue by Edwin Booth - a character who did not appear in the book until nearly the end - doing as a conclusion to a book that was about Maryna? I skipped it. Why not conclude as she began with the conceit of the writer being drawn in by the characters, at the end drawing away and telling the reader how their lives went on?"},{"Title":"In America","review":"It was great experience to read this book.

Although Reeves clearly comes from a western, white, upper class perspective (the only real criticism I have of some of his theories), he understands and clearly, simply explains the faults of our present political systems, in a way that is easy to understand. Even though this book was written in 1945, as WWII was ending and the UN was being formed, his criticisms of the international system and his discussions of the great powers of the world and their policies are eerily reminiscent of present day international affairs. I am upset that it is out of print, and think it should be required reading for anyone interested in peace studies, or in any part of the world other than their own."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Peace","review":"It left a lasting memory, when I read this book in the early 1950s.

Reves said metaphorically, in matters of world peace and international relations we are still looking at the world as though we were living in the Ptolemaic age, where the sun rotated around the earth. All of our attempts to create peace have been futile, be it treaties, international leagues, socialism, capitalism, morality or religion. \\"The failure of Christianity as a civilizing force of society is an incalculable tragedy...Two thousand years is time enough to judge the efficacy of a method.\\" No wonder we failed: Religion, morality and the rest of them are not the problem. Instead, he said, the real culprit was nationalism. \\"Nation\\" has always eclipsed \\"God\\". Are we not praying to God to bring us victory, even though our enemies pray to the same god for the same benefit?Instead, the only way to create peace on the face of this Earth is global governance and binding international law. Every nation has simply to surrender some of its sovereignty to a global authority and thereby support a lawful human society. In order to create permanent peace and to abolish war forever, we have to establish a world government and he recommended a gradual progress, starting with a limited number of fundamentals and to progress from there. Contrariwise, the League of Nations or the newly formed United Nations were on the wrong track.It did not subtract from the impact of the book that he gave few specifics about the structure or function of a possible world government. His was an early text, which he wrote during WW II and it was not until after it was published that a few months later the Hiroshima bomb exploded. When at the end of that devastating war Albert Einstein was asked for his opinion about the future, he simply asked the journalists to read \\"The Anatomy of Peace\\" by Emery Reves. It is lucid, cogent and gives you serious doubts about the world we are living in. It is no less relevant today than it was then."},{"Title":"The Doubtful Marriage : Best Of Betty Neels (Best of Betty Neels)","review":"If you're looking for sweet, old-fashioned romances, the kind that make you feel good and that bring a smile to your face, Betty Neels is a sure bet. Yes, the plots are fairly predictable -- the hero is almost always a wealthy and well-respected doctor, and the heroine is almost always an average-looking woman who is down on her luck -- but more \\"modern\\" (read: less sweet, more snarky) novels also tend to have a predictable underlying theme, and Mrs. Neels came up with different circumstances and a twist or two in every novel. There's some humor in every book, once in a while a laugh-out-loud moment, and no loose ends left dangling. Mrs. Neels' stories are suitable reading for your grandmother or your daughter, so if you're looking for a \\"bodice-ripper\\", look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Pegasus Project","review":"What most of the other reveiwers don't seem to understand is that Leisure Books is an imprint of Dorchester Publishing, a group more known for romance novels than taut military thrillers. And this book is more romance novel than military thriller. There are some interesting and inventive ideas in there, but the execution is problematic at best. (Frankly, I gather some of the reviewers don't have a clue about the military.) But if you take it for what it's worth -- breezy escapism -- it isn't too bad.Those interested in a similar idea should track down a book called _A Game of Titans_, which is sadly out of print."},{"Title":"The Pegasus Project","review":"what bugged me most about this book was michelaard's anachronistic tendency to fall back on sheer biggotry and prejudice as excuses to drive his mundane plot. these days you'd expect more sophistication, but apparently he doesn't care. while certainly a potential page turner, pegasus will outrage intelligent readers with its stereotypical characters and offensive use of racially-oriented descriptions.i mean, do you still fall for good vs. evil when it comes to geopolitics?"},{"Title":"The Pegasus Project","review":"The auther developed a wealth of characters that was explored.

The author seems to have found a thesaurus and was bound to use it. The flight sequences are horrible, the characters are impossible to like, and the plot lines are idiotic. We have a C-141 as an AWACS plane (not done, basic research would have shown this), and this plane, after being shot down, has the crew picked up by unknown helicopters that somehow manage to beat out F-16s to the scene of the shootdown. There are implausabilities in the actions of carrier groups (one that will take two weeks to transit a couple thousand miles), and it is just an exercise in what the author could throw onto paper. Do NOT buy this book. If you want good military fiction, look for Proud Legions, an excellent book, with realistic details and very readable. Pass on Pegasus Project."},{"Title":"The Pegasus Project","review":"This book was excellent. The book was well written with many new inventions in it that I find very interesting.

Michelaard does both. More than that, he writes with zest and stretches the mind with a massive vocabulary. This book focuses on a plausible, top-secret (&quot;burn before reading!&quot;) project planned by a group of ex-KGB and other fanatics to create a new and fearsome equatorial nation which will preserve communist ideals and foster terrorism. Michelaard is at his best in air combat narrative. A must book for military buffs and readers who like elegant prose."},{"Title":"The Romantic Poets","review":"I think poetry needs to be listened to...not just read. The trick is finding an audio Cassette or audio CD that does justice to the music of the poem. Since the Romantic poets wrote some of the most wonderful poetry in the English language, many people will want to have such an audio product. I do recommend this CD without reservation. Why four versus five stars? One of the most interesting parts of the CD collection are the autobiographical materials that precede the poems; neither John Keats nor William Blake received \\"that historical treatment\\" in this audio product. This is a minor complaint. Also, some of the readers are better than others. Jeremy Northam version of Coleridge's THE EOLIAN HARP is wonderful, perhaps worth the price of the CD alone."},{"Title":"The Romantic Poets","review":"\\"Tyger! Tyger! burning brightIn the forests of the night,What immortal hand or eyeCould frame thy fearful symmetry?\\"William BlakeRemember Eng. Lit. class when it was announced that assigned reading would be the works of the Romantic Poets? That usually elicited a chorus of groans (I confess, myself included). What a difference it would have made if my introduction to this poetry had been in the voices of the marvelous British actors featured on this audio edition! Familiar words and phrases take on new meaning when delivered by these talented performers. Listeners may find additional insights into an author's intent revealed in the deep, rich tones of Derek Jacobi or the lyrical delivery of Prunella Scales.Highbridge has gathered an ensemble cast to bring the words of the world's most famous writers to life. Performers, in addition to Jacobi and Scales, are Jeremy Northam, Nicol Williamson, Stella Gonet, Haydn Gwynne, Douglas Hodge, David Horovitch, Alex Jennings, Nathaniel Parker, Diana Quick, and Sian Thomas. Each voice is perfectly matched to the verses rendered.Among the poets whose works are performed are William Blake, a visionary British artist and writer,who illustrated all of his own writings. In addition to \\"Songs of Experience\\" from which the famous lines quoted above are taken, we hear Blake's compelling \\"Songs of Innocence.\\"The handsome Lord Byron is represented by his satirical \\"Don Juan plus others, while \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" remembers Samuel Taylor Coleridge. A collection would be incomplete without \\"On A Grecian Urn\\" and \\"Ode To A Nightingale\\" by John Keats and Shelley's \\"To A Skylark.\\" Remember \\"I wandered lonely as a cloud\\" (from \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" by William Wordsworth with Coleridge)? It, too, is included along with many others - over 12 hours of beautiful poetry.\\"The Romantic Poets\\" is an audio book to be treasured and heard over and over again - enjoy!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Romantic Poets","review":"Unfortunately, I cannot write a totally positive review of this collection of poetry. But the fault does not lie with the fine recording itself, nor with the talented British actors selected to read these poems. The fault lies rather with the poets Byron and Shelley. You may admire their poetry, and know absolutely nothing about their lives--and that is perhaps the way it should be.I've never particularly cared for Byron's verse but much of Shelley's poetry I have always admired, and loved. Unfortunately, on this recording, for Shelley, Byron, Wordsworth, and Coleridge, we don't just hear their poetry, we must endure talk about the various events of their lives. For Wordsworth and Coleridge, this is fine. But for Byron and Shelley, this amounts to not much more than a running account of their wantonness and irresponsibility, thoughtlessness toward others, selfishness and lust. These two poets certainly brought great suffering into the lives of others, especially women they loved and later abandoned, and the children they carelessly fathered out of wedlock and later abandoned. (Regrettably, I will have to count Wordsworth also among this list.) There's no doubt their poetry is inspired and often very beautiful. But at what cost to others, and ultimately to themselves? Having to listen to the wastrel saga of their lives distracts from the appreciation of their verse. For that reason, I am reluctant to recommend the discs devoted to Shelley and Byron. Sample and admire their poetry to your heart's content, but spare the biographical commentary about their lives.As for the others, they are absolutely wonderful! Nicol Williamson does not just read Blake; he IS Blake! Listening to him read the Songs of Innocence brings tears to my eyes. You will come away from hearing the Blake CD overwhelmed by this man's humanity and spiritual depth, as well as his poetic inspiration. The other poet who truly surprised me was Coleridge. We've all heard stories about his opium addiction, but the man himself is presented as excessively thoughtful and considerate of others, perhaps too much so. He apparently had a very nervous disposition, and was easily discouraged. His life-story is presented in a very positive light, and he comes off very well here.The Keats CD is another miracle. We are spared the details of Keats' short tragic life. Douglas Hodge reads Keats' greatest poems with such perfect phrasing and the finest British diction, again it is as though one is listening to Keats himself read; it's simply stunning. I will come back to this particular disc many times to hear this authentic Keatsean voice, which gives the great odes their perfect vehicle.The two Wordsworth CDs are also quite excellent, and again one often has the sense that this is Wordsworth reading from his own work. All of his greatest poems are presented here, as well as generous excerpts from the Prelude. He comes across as a great poet of nature, and above all else a man who tried to see harmony and concord in nature. But it is also evident that he was a man consciously trying to beat back a sense of deep depression as he grew older. There is one short poem of Wordsworth's, the one about the young boy who died, a poem which I believe he later included in the Prelude: I had not been familiar with this short poem, but hearing it read one day while I was driving brought me to a state of almost complete emotional breakdown; I'm glad I was on a country road, for I just had to pull over. To this day, I cannot hear this poem read as masterfully as it is on this CD without feeling a sense of deep, almost mystical, emotion sweep over me.This superb set is sure to be a constant resource for me for many years. This poetry was meant to be heard! Of course not all the poems in this collection are great, but if you are familiar with the romantic poets you will find the poems you most admire in this collection, and you will likely find new ones to admire as well. I highly recommend this set. Many thanks to Highbridge audio for these recordings. Here's hoping that the Victorian poets will soon be presented in the same format."},{"Title":"The Romantic Poets","review":"The only negative point about this collection of Romantic Poetry is that it consists mainly of poetry by William Blake. In between, a few pieces by other Romantic Poets (Wordsworth, Byron and so forth) can be found, but in comparison to other collections, the scale very much tips towards Blake.Some of the comments that are shown as connected to this collection are misleading insofar that this is NOT the same collection as \\"The Romantic Poets\\" available on Audio CDs published by HighBridge Audio. There are no comments on the poets' lives in this recording!"},{"Title":"Walks In Rome","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this book had been reprinted.

Henry Prize Stories)","review":"According to the editor of PRIZE STORIES 2002: THE O. HENRY AWARDS, thousands of short stories from hundreds of magazines were painstakingly reviewed in an effort to compile an anthology of the year's best in stort story fiction. This year twenty stories made the list while three of them were voted the best by the jurors Dave Eggers, Joyce Carol Oates and Colson Whitehead. I personally do not agree with the juror's selection of the top short stories, which is a clear indication of how subjectivity is involved in the process of judging literature. What is enjoyable to one person certainly might not be for another. I've been reading this analogy periodically during the past couple of weeks and I finished with mixed feeling. Some stories intrigued me while others were downright uncaptivating. In addition, a couple were so utterly strange that they could be episodes of the twilight zone!Out of this collection my favorite short story was A.M. Homes' \\"Do Not Disturb\\", which is a tale of a husband trying his best to emotionally deal with his bitter terminally ill wife as their marriage falls apart. I also enjoyed Anthony Doerr's \\"The Hunter's Wife\\" about how a husband deals with the supernatural powers of his wife in Montana. The reason why I didn't give this book five stars is because I believe that there are more losers than winners in this collection. But don't just take my word for it. Remember that the appreciation of literature is subjective. You just may love it!"},{"Title":"The O. Henry Prize Stories 2002 (Pen / O.

Don't worry that one of the judges edits the periodical that published the winning story -- it was one of the few intense stories in this book. Most of the stories are just character and setting studies by authors who added notes like, &quot;I wrote the beginning, and then I didn't know where to go with the story.&quot; Apparently, the judges like to read about different people and places, but I don't. I like memorable stories that aren't filled with description, like the best works of O. Henry, which were not character sketches.

The book emphasizes her racist and eugenic tendencies, not her disciples' favorite topics.If one is seeking a balanced or hagiographic approach, this is not a book to read by itself. The author is occasionally witty, but mostly outraged at a woman who led a quintessentially outrageous lifestyle. Drogin, surely with tongue in cheek, does record the eulogy given at her funeral by the late Reverend George Ferguson, rector of St. Philip's in the Hills Church of Tucson: &quot;all the elements of sainthood were personified many times in her life.&quot; Either the Episcopal divine meant &quot;exemplified,&quot; or he was accusing her of multiple-personality disorder."},{"Title":"Margaret Sanger: Father of modern society","review":"Excellent pamphlet. Well written and well sourced. Gives and accurate telling of all the hard truths about Margaret Sanger and the abortion industry known as Planned Parenthood, as well as all their motives. The author would know firsthand as she experienced the &#34;free&#34; lifestyle encouraged by Sanger, full with an active sex life as well as an abortion; she experienced this prior to her own conversion giving her research and writing plenty of validation. If the founder of Planned Parenthood is such a racist, eugenicist monster, how can the very organization she founded and instilled with her own principles be so different?

One can see the beautiful springtime in the Channel Islands, the ancient buildings of the St. Pierre convent, and the wild wilderness of New Zealand. Elizabeth Goudge does best when describing landscapes, action, and settings. People, not so much.\\"Green Dolphin Street\\" is about two sisters- Marguerite (the good,passive one) and Marianne (the brash one). They're both smitten with William, for some reason. William soon sets off on a trading mission to China. He proves \\"friends don't let friends drink and write\\" when he mistakenly sends off for Marianne instead of Marguerite as his wife. William doesn't try to set the matter straight (he doesn't end up a polygamist like Jacob with Leah and Rachel) A heartbroken Marguerite goes to the convent, where the Mother Superior gives her a heavy-handed sermon about Jesus as the Divine Lover. In the meantime, William and Marguerite reluctantly marry each other, spending their wedding night in separate bedrooms. They make friends with the Maoris in New Zealand, as well as an obnoxious green parrot named Old Nick. Among the Maori, they deal with a preacher named Samuel who makes heavy-handed sermons who sees them only as life-loving heathens.\\"Green Dolphin Street\\" goes through many complications (like Marianne when she gives birth to her daughter Veronique) There are some useless love triangles thrown in. The story ends with the three elderly leads kissing and making up. Marianne has miraculously become humble. All's well that ends well.\\"Green Dolphin Street\\" is a trippin' romance novel. Though it was published in 1947,it's got psychedelic qualities (especially when Marianne and William live among the Maoris) Goudge tries to come across as smart through using famous quotes, and making long,heavy-handed sermons. Still,it's good dumb fun!"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"Read this story as a young girl... so thankful to have found it again and the book is in hard cover too...."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"Interestingly, like Goudge's FIRST novel, \\"Island Magic\\", her only run-away best-seller \\"Green Dolphin Country\\", is also based on an intriguing event in the lives of her Guernsey Island ancestors.Her maternal grandfather's brother found himself in trouble, and escaped to a kind of exile in the antipodes. When he began to prosper he wrote back to the island to propose to his childhood sweetheart.But, with a Goudgeian poor memory for names, in his letter he proposed to the older sister of the girl he loved.When she finally arrived to marry him he was agonised, but he never told her.What may seem far-fetched in this rich romantic novel, actually happened, and knowing this makes the book all the more readable.On an epic scale, the novel tells of the lives of two sisters and the man they love, reaching from their childhood home in the Channel Islands to the New Zealand antipodes, and returning full circle to the islands.Their personalities clash against and counterbalance one another as they each seek for different kinds of personal truth or salvation: longing for a lost home, an Eldorado which somehow always seems just over the horizon; searching for the perfect mate to share life's torments and joys; craving for inner purity and peace.Like Goudge's later comtemporary, adult novel \\"The Scent of Water\\", the story is wild rough romance and religious soul-searching and meditation, mixed like no other writer can.All of Goudge's novels are \\"romances\\" in one important aspect: they hinge on moments of visionary insight for her characters, filled with that romantic longing for a strange beauty and joy which is known in German as \\"Sehnsucht\\". Dreams, glimpses of landscape, moments of weather, the sound of a voice or melody when no one else is present, sudden remembering of lost experience, or a poetry quote which stabs to the heart.These are frequently counterbalanced against moments of evil, terror, despair, emotional collapse, irrational rage or blinding hate.Most of her central characters are well educated and intellectually or emotionally gifted, although many are presented as frail, absent-minded, wounded. Yet not only are they bound up in everyday tasks, they are surrounded by salt-of-the-earth uneducated workers, heroic peasants comparable to the subjects of Hopkins' poems \\"Felix Randall\\", \\"Tom\\" and \\"Harry Ploughman\\", people of utter reliability and ancient Hardyesque virtue.Her characters' ages may vary from eighty to eight, or even younger.For Goudge there is little difference between adult and child except length of experience and acquired knowledge - their interests, emotions and needs are fundamentally the same. In some cases the children show greater maturity than the so called \\"adults\\", and even the animals, dogs particularly, owned by her characters show unspoken wisdom which may ironically exceed that of their masters and mistresses.Highly recommended.John Gough -- Deakin University - jagough49@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"When a man sends for the wrong girl to marry him in a faraway place a love story starts.Although the wrong bride comes to New Zealand ,due to a slip of the pen, William decides he will never let her know the mistake he made.

I ran across a first edition hardcover in a junk store for a dollar and I'm quite glad that I did.So many book titles have become a reading list mantra of university professors as being \\"must-read\\" examples of classic literature. And spectacular works of literature such as this one have somehow fallen through the cracks and into an unfortunate obscurity. It's gratifying to see that this one has been recently revived in paperback.THE STORY: (Circa mid-1800s) Two girls born on an English island, the younger (Marguerite) is a confirmed giggler and yet as beautiful as a spring morning while the elder (Marianne) is chic but not actually pretty... but she's a go-getter. William is a handsome and likeable youth, between the two girls in age, but sometimes a bit of a muddler. The girls live in a nice home along the island hamlet's Le Paradis Street while William and his widower father, Dr. Ozanne who is only recently returned to his modest island home, reside in a lesser neighborhood on Green Dolphin Street.Both girls have their sights set on William but it is Marianne who puts her savvy to work to assure his early success in life -- she inspires her wealthy father to fund his naval training where he soon rises to officer status. But William has a bit of bad luck during a shore leave in China and suddenly finds himself to be AWOL from his ship.William makes his way to New Zealand by the aid an old friend, Captain O'Hara. After re-establishing himself there as a prosperous lumberman, he writes to the girls' father, asking for permission to marry one of his daughters. Unfortunately, through a comedy of errors directly related to William's carelessness, he acquires the wrong one! (I won't reveal my definition of \\"wrong\\" since this term can clearly have multiple meanings.)William immediately comprehends his mistake as his bride-to-be steps off the ship in New Zealand, and being a man of character, makes the best of it and carries through with the marriage! From there, the couple is in for a roller coater ride of adventure in a land where the wars between Great Britain and the fierce native Maoris nearly rip the country apart.Here's a quotation from the text: \\"Perhaps these days were the best of all, for Nat sang sea chanties to them and Captain O'Hara told wonderful tales of his boyhood in Old Ireland, and Old Nick did not confine his conversation to ejaculations only, as he did in the everyday world, but told the most wonderful yarns about all the countries he had visited during a life so long that he had clean forgotten how old he was. No one was ever unhappy in Green Dolphin Country. There were no quarrels there, no scoldings, and no misunderstandings. It was in fact, so papa had said one day, Paradise.\\" (Page 299.)There are multiple shrewd subplots within this work which help to define it as quality literature. The book (in the original hardcover edition) is 502 pages in length. Elizabeth Goudge was no slacker at writing such novels -- here is a list of some of her other works:-- Island Magic-- A City of Bells-- A Pedlar's Pack-- Towers in the Mist-- The Middle Window-- The Sister of the Angels-- The Bird in the Tree-- Smoky House-- The Golden Skylark-- The Well of the Star-- The Blue Hills-- The Castle on the HillThis superb story was also made into a terrific film starring Lana Turner, but unfortunately it's only available in VHS tape format:Green Dolphin Street.Women who typically enjoy an adventure novel in an historic setting will probably find this book much to their liking. And since the romance angle is not overdone, most men will similarly enjoy this one too.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"Elizabeth Goudge writes like no other. Her descriptions of scenes are so detailed and she manages to capture exactly the right essence of what she wants to convey onto paper. Her scenes of early mornings and other happy experiences for the characters for example are a lot like the paintings of the French Rococo period such as Fragonard's works-- glittering, thriving, magical, whimsical."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"As advertized. The book was in excellent condition and came within a week. Great way to find an old title. Thank you to shipper.Michele Stratmeyer"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"The book I reeived (second hand) was too much money. I should not have paid more than $3.00 plus shipping.When I opened the package the smell of mustiness almost knocked me over and had to be set out doors in the sun for several days to dry out."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"I read this book to shreds when I was a teenager. It is quite old-fashioned in its setting, but the strong story and the personalities could never be old-fashioned. The two sisters, Marguerite and Marianne, are very different and represent two different possibilities for a woman's life. Strong-minded Marianne's personality is more stylish according to the standards of today, but gentle Marguerite has a strength and wisdom of her own that one could also learn from. The part where the sisters talk to each other as old ladies is one of my favorite things in all literature. I also love the depiction of the (really clueless) character William that the girls are both in love with and how he grows as a man, even though he is never that bright. If you read this, you won't be sorry. As one reader noted, there is some silly thinking about people from other races in certain parts of the book, but although I am black, I found this only mildly annoying and I think it can be easily skipped over.And one of the most interesting sections in the book is when Marianne is forced to live as a Maori and learns a great deal of respect for them and their way of life, in spite of herself. The destruction of their culture is presented as a tragedy, in a very thoughtful way.Goudge was a very intelligent writer and should be better known. You need to read this book with an open mind; the characters don't behave as we are taught to expect to in the late twentieth century, but there is much to think about and much to learn. Certainly it will make you question some of your assumptions about women's lives."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"I first read Green Dolphin Street as a teenager after seeing a television replay of the MGM movie version of the book and becoming curious about 19th century New Zealand and the Maori civil wars. Since then, Ive reread it two or three times and always find myself engrossed in the characters and the wonderful descriptions of the landscapes they inhabit. Goudge is a very lyrical writer whose vivid portrayals of people, places, and things stimulate your imagination and make you feel you are right there living the story with them. A strong thread of spirituality or religion runs through her books, which isnt my personal cup of tea, but the author never lets these elements take center stage. Her focus is very much on character and character development, and she creates complex individuals who are multi-dimensional never black and white. They keep you interested and turning the pages to find out whats going to happen next.The basic plot in Green Dolphin Street follows the life choices of two very different sisters, Marianne and Marguerite, and the man they both love, William Ozanne. All three form a bond as teenagers living on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel during the mid 1800s. The author does a truly marvelous job depicting the charm of the windswept city of St Pierre &Ntilde; its sunny sheltered streets, high-walled gardens, and tall granite houses, all softened by roses, hydrangeas, lavender hedges, and tangled vines. Marianne at age 16 is dark, elfin, and intelligent: &Ograve;There might have been beauty in her black eyes had they not been so needle sharp under the heavy black brows . . . and so full of a hunger that disturbed one in the eyes of so young a girl . . . and the lips, folded in so mature a repression of her passionate temper, and the brain that was too quick and hard and brilliant for her years and sex.&Oacute; Marguerite, at age 11, is gentle and easy-going: &Ograve;She had taken to herself her mothers fair beauty and as much&Ntilde;and no more&Ntilde;of her fathers intelligence as it was desirable that a pretty child should have, and to them some good fairy had added something else, the best of all gifts, the power of enjoyment, not just animal enjoyment of good health and good spirits but that authentic love of life that sees good days.&Oacute;Each sister quickly and secretly determines that William is the love of her life. William, in turn, is immediately drawn to one of the girls, but he is a somewhat absent-minded and indolent lad and when as a young adult, making a living harvesting lumber in New Zealand, he sends for his true love, he writes the wrong name in the letter! The consequences of his mistake and how he and his new wife hammer out their relationship (over the next 40 years) is the focus of most of the book. The changes each of the three main characters goes through during the course of the novel reflect three deep cravings of the self: the restless craving that makes man a wanderer looking for a better country, the craving of the lover searching for the perfect mate, and the inner craving for perfection and spiritual purity.In contrast to civilized St. Pierre, life in turn of the century New Zealand settlements was rough, crude, and often dangerous. Again, Goudge does a great job evoking the atmosphere of New Zealands primitive forests and Williams lumber camp. Theres also some great action&Ntilde;an earthquake and a frightening attack by rebellious Maoris&Ntilde;as well as wonderful secondary characters, including the foul-mouthed parrot Old Nick, Williams mentor Tai Haruru (a former Englishman gone &Ograve;native&Oacute;), colorful Captain OHara and his glorious clipper ship, and the crippled fiercely loyal first mate Nat. For those who enjoy a complicated romance taking place in exotic historical settings (think Forever Amber and Gone With the Wind), I think youll like this book."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"I too read this book in my teens and loved it. Recently picked up a copy of The Dean.s Watch at a yard sale, which reminded me how much I liked her novels... got this and was enchanted all over again. Old fashioned..yes. Wordy...yes. Racially preduciced...yes. But, remember the context; just after WW II.

They gave their copy to me and I'm now reading it again, 25 yrs later. It is an intense story of two sisters; one who is ambitous, strong and stubborn, the other who is sweet, caring and easy going. Both of excellent character and intentions. It reflects an ageless story of childhood devotion blooming into infatuation or love. And the odd twists in life that send us down different roads. My oldest impression of this book was the way these roads led one of the sisters to meet her soul mate and the other to meet her soul's salvation. In all things destiny controls. This book has adventure, travel, love and colorful characters. All in all, a very good read."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"When I first read this book, as a teenager, I just loved it. I reread it many times over the years, and my husband and I read it outloud while camping when we were young. Sooo romantic! So, it was with much sadness that, after a break of about 15 years, I tried again and found that it now seemed sadly out of date and old fashioned. Oh well. Still, there may be some souls out there who find this wonderful story, full of sweep, journeying from the channel islands to New Zealand, from youth to old age, from cluelessness to profound enlightenment, quite nice. One of the nicest things about this book was that it led me to find the little book Marguerite is given by the nuns, and that book changed my life, too. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"I bought this edition a few months ago, excited to read more Elizabeth Goudge after reading The Bird in the Tree. So far, I've only gotten about 75 pages in. There are lots of typos on almost every page. It seems the book was scanned and never proof-read. What I've read so far intrigues me, but it's exhausting to try to puzzle out the text with all the typos.While my copy of The Bird in the Tree from the same publisher wasn't nearly as poorly edited, there were two pages of text completely missing from the book. A friend, who owns an older edition, typed the pages out for me. Since each page is important, I missed some important images and character development, as well as dialog, until I received my friend's help.I wrote to the publisher three times and have yet to receive any response. I'll be looking for a used copy and will be avoiding the new editions in future.Miss Goudge's writing is wonderful, but avoid this edition!"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I had kept this book around with many others in my library for years and finally read it this year. It was enscribed as a gift to my aunt in 1945.Elizabeth Goudge has captured my heart in her writings of Green Dolphin Street. She offers an interesting story of two sisters in love with the same man and the twist this takes in all three of their lives, as well as an ability to express life philosophies that mirror what I have felt and believed throughout my life. I was so surprised to find these insights into human nature so wonderfully written in a novel, that I found myself marking pages to read again.This book flowed well and kept my interest. Ms. Goudge's descriptions allowed me to be able to picture and share in the lives of the characters. I would look forward to reading it each evening and not skip to the end as I have done in the past with some books. If you want to experience what I call an opportunity to read a book that offers a depth of talent and character that I don't see today, then I recommend this book for a pleasant experience."},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"\\"It is tasty as a marshmallow, and practically written in Technicolor,\\" said Time Magazine of Elizabeth Goudge's Green Dolphin Street. The other contemporary reviews of the novel seemed to agree with Times' analysis. Most agreed that Green Dolphin Street was well written, imaginative, and readable, only lacking in some way in each of their eyes. The New Yorker called it, \\"A soundly conceived, well-constructed historical tale, diligently supplemented by poetic observations that hit the reader with all the force of a wet sponge.\\" And Harrison Smith, writing for the Saturday Review of Literature, wrote, \\"We can only hope that the enormous prize it has won will not induce its promoters to call it the greatest novel of the day.\\" This was prefaced however, by his saying \\"The reader can only view this newest contender for best-selling honors with awe and respect, and wish it as many scores of thousands of readers as it can find, and finally as many breathless and emotionally damp audiences as the producer can draw into the movie theaters.\\"Time and the Saturday Review's discussion of the movie version of the book in the book review was not unusual in the reviews, since Green Dolphin Street was published because it had won the MGM Award, and was to be promptly made into a movie. In fact, M. L. Becker, for the Weekly Book Review, wrote of the book, \\"A right romantic tale set in strange places, not without violence, crowded with real people, it moves from scene to scene through evocations of loveliness explicit as stage directions. To touch but one of them, Midsummer Day on the island provides not only an episode of vivid beauty but a moment such as a star might covet and every young woman in the audience desire.\\"Beyond the film version, however, the quality of the book that most critics seemed to praise was the narrative descriptions that seemed to take on life in the book. William Du Bois wrote for the New York Times, \\"Most of the punches are telegraphed; like the author's view of life, they seem to come right out of the Victorian hope chest. But the few chapters dealing directly with St. Pierre are alive with beauty and a sense of the pictorial line and poetry of background. Miss Goudge writes from her heart when she describes these islands, as we can see from her fresh-tinted picture of Militia Day and the choosing of a village Flower Queen, or of the picnic that ends with Marguerite's climb to the convent.\\"The critics also agreed on the result of the moral themes running through the novel. The New Yorker said, \\"[it] would have been more effective, and certainly more readable, had the author been more willing to let the moral implications of her story speak for themselves.\\" The Times (London) agreed, calling the novel outside of the New Zealand scenes, \\"an undistinguished mixture of conventional romantic incident and a conventional moral piety.\\" However, the Times adds an admiration for \\"the author's steady perseverance.\\"All in all, Green Dolphin Street, to the critics at least, was as the Times put it, \\"lack[ing] the sterner virtues of good literature,\\" but still enjoyable none the less. (Time referred to the entertainment value of the book with the \\"tasty as a marshmallow\\" quote mentioned above.)SOURCES: From a compilation of book reviews in BOOK REVIEW DIGEST 1944:1.

It is so obvious that Ms Goudge had a love and appreciation for the Channel Islands.This is a wonderful book. I would also highly recommend that people who enjoyed this to search for a copy of &quot;Island Magic&quot; which also centres on Guernsey.It is truly a &quot;magical&quot; story and, for one who lives there, very warming! Sadly I must point out that &quot;Island Magic&quot; is not in print anymore so copies are probably rare.Mine is indeed very old. Perhaps someone will arrange for it to be re-printed again?I can't seem to work the age dial so for those of you who are actually bothered by age, I'm 35!!"},{"Title":"Green Dolphin Street","review":"Green Dolphin Street is full of adventure, love, romance, great relationships and amazing insights. Ms.Goudge's insightfulnes into people and relationships is only surpassed by the great light she shines into that mysterious misty place where deep spiritual secrets are kept. In reveling secrets, which is often done in such a subtle way as to be easily missed, many facets and views of spirituality are reveled--pagan, evangalicalChristian, ESP, prayer, but without degrading anyone. Everyone seems to be given value. I only had one problem with the book and that was the old British (and American) attitude towards other races, but these were the attitudes of the times. I think I would want to discuss that with a young person reading this book for the first time. I plan on giving it to my grandaughter for her birthday. But it is a great adult book too. Maybe even a good marriage manual. I found it because it's my best friends favorite book, and has been since she was a very young woman."},{"Title":"The Two Doors of Heaven: A Story of Your Future","review":"This was an intriguing book that sort of goes along the lines of The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom.

I don't live my life by regrets and it is because I take the time right here and right now to right the wrongs I may commit. It means something --- down the road.

He's holding his life together, but a divorce appears imminent, which means he's going to lose his wife and children. He stops at Starbucks and while waiting to place his order he has a phone call from his wife. There are problems with the kids-and Jack assumes the conversation is about making the problems his fault. And there's one other thing she wants to say, but bad reception ends the call.Sitting on the patio with his latte he studies the people around him-people watching is his past time. There's the one-legged black woman named Millie whom he bumped, then ignored on the way to the patio. She's working a crossword puzzle. There's Elliott, a young geek-type furiously and delightedly typing away on his computer. And then there's Alexis, a young lawyer with her now-retired philosophy professor, Sean Stanton.A truck loses control, crashes through the patio into the brick wall that then cascades down, killing everyone. And life as the five people know it is over. Nate shows up to be their guide to the two doors-one choice leading up to heaven, the other to hell. On the way to the doors they each get to revisit portions of their lives and the choices they've made, choices determining which of the two doors will open.Bolin writes in a crisp, interesting manner. An interesting addition to the book is a follow-up conversation that has Bolin discussing the book as a possible Hollywood film with a studio exec, Chris. This allows us to get the back story on each of the characters-and a very clear picture of what each of us must do on this side of death to have the door to heaven be our choice after death. Armchair Interviews says: Thought-provoking discussion questions accompany each chapter and make this book and excellent choice for a small group study."},{"Title":"The Late 1980s, Vol. 17: Cave Wimp, Mode O'Day, Aline 'n' Bob, & Other Stories, Covers, Drawings (v. 17)","review":"Buying this, and rating it, depends on your level of dedication to all things Crumb -- bear in mind, that at least half of the book is taken up by glossy art work, comic covers, private sketches, and a peppering of his wife's artwork.To some this will be a plus -- to me , it is a minus point. Much as I love Crumb's cover art/sketches, I buy his work to read his misanthropic,hateful, resentful, self mocking, self deprecating STORIES, and not to browse at his coffee table art.This is not to denigrate his artwork -- I am simply saying that the buyer has their priorities.Having said that there are some startling stories included here -- \\"Memories\\" the first tale in the book is written around the theme of his own self loathing and uncontrollable, self mocking, hateful lust.It's classic Crumb, and a tale of his seeking out dysfucntional women to \\"seduce\\". Though that may be the wrong word when we observe Crumb's inadequate fumblings.\\"I am Grateful\\" is a tale of all the things Crumb is grateful for in life, and , Harvey Pekar style, investigates his love of rare rare vinyl, his love of everyday pleasures such as reading a good book, and seeking out girls, usually unsucessfully.\\"Cave Wimp\\" is the peak of the book -- it's set in the stone age, with a lead character clearly representing Crumb.The lead character is an alienated intellectual, a weak pathetic, sexually obssessed, awkward figure, who is rejected by the rest of the tribe.So, it has it's excellent , outstanding moments -- but for those of you not particularly interested in his ( albeit beautiful ) artwork -- it may be wise to check out other books first.If you are a Crumb completist, well you sure won't have a thing to complain about here."},{"Title":"The Late 1980s, Vol. 17: Cave Wimp, Mode O'Day, Aline 'n' Bob, & Other Stories, Covers, Drawings (v. 17)","review":"Every volume of this series is a treasure.

Entitled \\"Wichita, The Rat Dancer\\", Crumb gives a dead-on portrayal of the artwork and rambling, beyond-trivial dialog. Absolutely HILLARIOUS!!Can't wait for the next volume. Will they have the guts to have the cover portraying one of Crumb's best stories, \\"When the N****** Take Over America\\"? We shall see..."},{"Title":"The Late 1980s, Vol. 17: Cave Wimp, Mode O'Day, Aline 'n' Bob, & Other Stories, Covers, Drawings (v. 17)","review":"If, God help me, I ever get disgusted enough with the 21st century to start looking back to the 50s and early 60s of my childhood with fond nostalgia, I hope that someone will whack me with an R. Crumb book. If there's anybody who can pop nostalgia bubbles for that horrible period, it's Crumb. His satire is unexcelled at reminding us of the empty-souled, plastic, picket-fenced hypocrisy of the Ike decade. He also reminds us of how much of that whole disgusting period we still carry around with us. If his work wasn't so damn funny, it'd be almost unbearable.The Complete Crumb #17 collects some of his very, very best \\"Zap\\" and \\"Weirdo\\" satire on the June and Ward Cleaver ethos. Typical of Crumb, he not only pokes fun at it, but also at himself when he falls into patterns in his own life that replicates it. So in \\"Mode O'Day,\\" which Crumb considers one of his best storylines, and \\"Academy Awards,\\" Crumb dissects (or is it vivisects?) the middle-class's adulation of money, fast cars, and glitzy movie stars, as well as its cultural pretensions. In \\"Aline 'n' Bob In Our Lovely Home\\" and \\"I'm Grateful!, I'm Grateful!\\", he takes a few swipes at his own comfortably middle-class lifestyle (no more bohemian, struggling artist for this guy!). The neat thing about this piece, as with so many of Crumb's family-oriented autobiographical stories, is that it's great satire but also reveals genuine and tender affection for his wife and daughter. The brilliant \\"The Adventures of Wichita the Rat Dancer,\\" one of the best things he's ever done, is a Peyton Place-like soap opera satire on sex and the beautiful people. And speaking of sex: the entire collection is prefaced by one of Crumb's crazy (and, for some, highly offensive) sexual reminiscences (\\"Memories Are Made of This\\") that's bound to remind many of us of the stupid things we used to do when we were young and full of hormones.But my absolutely favorite piece in the book is \\"Cave Wimp,\\" in which Crumb imagines a caveman Crumb--neurotic, skinny, nerdy, and sexually frustrated--who finds a way to beat the system, the neanderthal June and Ward Cleaver cave culture, through art. Crumb claims that \\"Cave Wimp\\" is the second best planned strip he ever wrote and drew. It's fantastic."},{"Title":"The Late 1980s, Vol. 17: Cave Wimp, Mode O'Day, Aline 'n' Bob, & Other Stories, Covers, Drawings (v. 17)","review":"This volume of The Complete Crumb reprints comics from 1988 to 1992.

The first page [left and right side] has 4 cars colorfully illustrated. Under each distinctly different car it has its type of car printed -- sports car -- hatchback -- pickup truck -- hot rod. How old a child must be to benefit from this type of learning device depends on the child, but it is intended for pre-schoolers, probably around age 4 for the most part.The same format is followed throughout the book and the sub-themes you will find pictured are as follows;CARS, FARM MACHINES, TRANSPORTERS, AIRCRAFT, FIRE ENGINES, EMERGENCY MACHINES, DIGGERS, DUMP TRUCKS, TRAINS, MOTORCYCLES, RACING CARS & TRUCKS.BOTTOM LINE: INTERESTING COLORFUL ILLUSTRATIONS BUT YOUNGSTERS MAY NEED EXPLAINATIONThe one limiting factor I see here is that a child must be able to grasp the differentiation between abstract concepts, such as, 'Sports Car' or 'Hatchback', or a 'Dump Truck' versus a 'Giant Dump Truck' and then discriminate between them. What this means is simple -- you'll have to get your child to comprehend first, and then discriminate between a car and a truck, a tractor and an airplane, before she/he can take the next step and discern the difference between a 'Sports Car' and a 'Hot Rod' which is what this book is all about.

In comparison to similar books I have read for this price and less (some more), this book is over priced. Id put the value of the Kindle version of this book between $1 and $2.I do not mind paying a premium for my books. Yet when I do it should be because of premium presentation and content. It's hard to justify this book being worth $7.99 with books out like 28 Days to a More Magnetic Life, Think and Grow Rich, The Success System that Never Fails, It Works, and others for kindle available for $1-$3.Nothing new here, could have added more relevant substance for the price, and left a lot of other stuff out. I'm not sure how to give more detail on that comment without posting sections of text as examples.WordyThe book reads very wordy, as if the writer was trying to stretch what should have been left to less than 90 pages to over 230. In comparison to the style of the authors writing in their own review, the book was not given the substance enhancing editorial job the review was given before being published.In other words, the author writes a review about their book that is poetically to the point, but the book itself is full of unnecessary rewording of the same points over and over in an annoyingly obvious manner.1 review should be removedIt is inappropriate for the authors review to be included in the Amazon review system. What author isn't going to leave themselves a five star review? From the buyers stand point, it makes Amazons \\"sort by review\\" feature less effective or useless.Overall skip this book until its priced at $2 or less and you won't feel you're throwing money away.

When, finally, all of his memories were chattered along the city motorways, and its lost sense of place and human scale.In the Urban Prospect of 1968, Mumford opens our eyes on the great myth of technology and advance we are fooling ourselves to be living in, yet ignoring, and sadly forgetting that above all we are humans.In the first six chapters, Lewis Mumford discusses issues of humanitarian and sociological nature, from an observer's point of view. In chapters from seven till fourteen, he discusses more specialized issues relating more to his thoughts and ideologies on urban and regional planning.

I came across a number of FEM texts in my years, and most of them were horribly inaccessible to the beginner who just wanted to start doing some applications. Granted, there is no easy way to learn this stuff, but Burnett made it accessible with a bit of work. We affectionately referred to this as \\"The Bible.\\""},{"Title":"Finite Element Analysis: From Concepts to Applications","review":"It seems to me that there are two types of teachers in this world, 1) those who are trying to prove to others how intelligent they are, and 2) those who are actually trying to teach. At the grade school level we find mostly teachers who are actually teaching, but at the college level, and particularly at the graduate level, I've found that most teachers are far more interested in proving how smart they are than actually imparting information or skills to others.I've been interested in solving partial differential equations numerically for many years, and I've worked with a number of books on this subject. I've found most of them to be quite difficult, requiring far more effort to understand than the material itself would warrant due to the poor communication skills of the writers.However I recently came across the book Finite Element Analysis by David S. Burnett, and it was quite a refreshing change from the standard books on this subject. It is very clearly written, setting out the fundamentals of finite element analysis in a straightforward manner so that any student with a reasonable background in differential equations and linear algebra can easily understand the techniques presented. Had I discovered this book earlier in my studies it would have saved me many hours of frustration trying to understand this area of numerical analysis.Here's one example of the clarity of Burnett's style: at several points in the book he finds it convenient to digress to explain a side issue related to the main thread of discussion in the text. When he does this, he's always careful to delineate the digression to keep it separate from the main thread. In one example, he starts with the statement \\"This deserves a short digression for some explanation\\", and then several paragraphs later he ends it with the simple statement \\"This ends the digression\\". How many authors have you seen do that before!The book was written in 1987, so one won't find the absolute latest research on the finite element method in it, but the basics are all there, allowing the student learn the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced material. I highly recommend this book as an introduction to the numerical solution of partial differential equations, particularly for engineers and scientists who are interested in practical applications of the method rather than pure theory."},{"Title":"Finite Element Analysis: From Concepts to Applications","review":"The author has gone to great pains to make the finite element method understandable.

Falsely accused parents and client/victims of RMT will find answers to the many questions related to this phenomenom. As a &quot;retractor&quot; of false memories and a therapist intern, I appreciated Dr. Simpson's courage to come forward as a therapist who had once been involved with this most unethical treatment. I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Simpson at a recent conference. There, he apologized to all parents and clients negatively effected by RMT. His apology, given in the name of all RMT therapists, touched my heart. This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for all therapists and those who have recovered memories of abuse. I encourage all to read this book with an open mind. Take the time to have Second Thoughts."},{"Title":"Second Thoughts","review":"Dr. Paul Simpson is a christian psychologist who was very involved in the practice of helping his patients recover memories of abuse through the very popular therapy called RMT.Like so many other therapists today, Dr. Simpson at first believed he was doing God's work, helping to retrieve memories of real abuse so that his patients could be healed from broken lives which had stopped working due to emotions out-of-control and destructive personal behaviors.Later he discovered he had been greatly in error as are his colleagues who continue to practice RMT today commonly resulting in false memories, and assigning the false identity of &quot;abuse victim&quot; to dependent patients desperate for answers to their problems in living.The author says the Christian Church is in great error in its acceptance of the concept of recovered memory and needs to do more to aid the falsely accused parents of children giving false witness based upon therapy suggested &quot;memories.&quot;The expose of what is happening in today's therapy is all the more important because it comes from someone who was inside the clinical office and involved from start to finish. Also, it is important because Dr. Simpson has all the right credentials, a born-again Christian, alumni of Christ for the Nations, Rapha therapist, dedicated care-giver. Still, his practice of RMT hurt his christian patients and their families.Simpson says in RMT, he saw 100% of his patients go into severe decompensation[nervous breakdown] due to the effects from recalling or imagining vile scenes of horrific abuse. This led them to become very dependent upon him in an unhealthy way. Some of them could not even open their own mail. One assumes this is the point where such a patient will accept the label of MPD or satanic high priestess for themselves. Anything just to get it over with and back to a sense of normalcy.Paul Simpson says he prayed with his clients and asked God to bless the therapy and still had ungodly results. He now realizes that God will not bless idolatry and occult practices no matter how much a spirit filled Christian might pray. Obedience to bibical principles and truth is absolutely necessary to avoid self-delusion.Dr. Simpson gives an account of how his patients lives were affected before and after his therapy with them. The statistics as to how they were functioning supports his statement that he never saw a single patient who was better off after the therapy for having remembered such abuse.This important book is must reading for all Christians and especially those who believe wrongly that christian psychologists will not lead them into error or that the Spirit of God will keep them safe from consequences of their idolatry.The author has appeared on the James Dobson radio program Focus on the Family to discuss his book and the topic of RMT. Paul Meier was also on the show claiming that his own SRA and MPD patients were valid. He was talking when he should have been listening.Buy this book, which like all truth is hard to find at the bookstore."},{"Title":"Second Thoughts","review":"A family member has become brainwashed by a therapist claiming to be able to promote healing through recovery of repressed memories using supposed regression therapies such as body memories and hypnosis. Over several years, the memories have become stranger and further removed from reality. Now she has cut off all contact with her family. I wish I had researched false memories several years ago because it may have saved her from the mental deterioration that has resulted from abusive therapy. Unbelievably, it has the characteristics of a cult and has become a current day witch-hunt. After conducting lots of research on-line and reading five books on the subject, I recommend this book by Dr. Paul Simpson, as the most readable. It is sensitive to the legitimate issue of sexual abuse against children. Dr. Simpson is a recovered repressed memory therapist. He presents well-documented evidence and highly-informed intelligent logic to explain how the therapy produces false memories and how it hurts the patients and those they falsely accuse. He is not afraid to address Christianity and how it has contributed to the problems but also how it creates a duty to seek the truth. I hope I can figure out how to get my loved one to read the appendix, \\"A Word to Regression Believers,\\" especially Dr. Simpson's list of 9 \\"rights\\" that patients \\"may not have been told about\\" by their therapists. It may save her life. If you are one of these regression patients, have the courage to read this book without the permission of your therapist. If you are one of these therapists, have the professionalism to explore the possibility that you have made a mistake and are harming instead of helping your clients."},{"Title":"Second Thoughts","review":"Upon hearing there was a name for the nightmare my family was going through, the book by Dr. Paul Simpson, Second Thoughts, was recommended to us to realize it truly was real and we weren't alone.The book put all of it into perspective for us.

Excellent/documented information a must to help teens."},{"Title":"Second Thoughts","review":"Paul Simpson is a psychologist who claims to have been deeply involved in what he calls \\"regression therapy,\\" facilitating clients to recover forgotten \\"memories\\" through an induced hypnotic state. Eventually he came to question the validity of this method of therapy and the accuracy of the \\"memories\\" which were \\"resurrected\\" by it. This led to his contacting the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, whose tenets he now vociferously proclaims. He has become a strong advocate for accused parents and is involved in Project Middle Ground, serving as a supposedly unbiased mediator between accused parents and their accusing child (p. 119).While some of Simpson's observations and concerns are quite valid, he unfortunately loses significant credibility through the manner in which he argues them. Generally he creates a worst case scenario and portrays it as a seemingly universal representation of all therapists and clients who believe in the concept of recovering dissociated, traumatic memories (e.g. pp. 3-6, 62, 115-17, 133, 137-38, 151-57, 166, 186-87).He also erroneously lumps all such therapists together and labels them as \\"regressionists\\" when in reality this term should only be applied to those who deliberately age-regress their clients through hypnotic techniques for the purpose of recovering \\"forgotten memories.\\" He ignorantly considers \\"dissociation\\" to be merely a renaming of \\"regression theory\\" (pp. 63, 203).If his book were truly about the small group of true \\"regressionists\\" (frankly a term I've not heard before), it might have more validity, but I do not believe that this narrow focus is his intent. Nevertheless, using this term cleverly gives him a seemingly more legitimate platform to stand on as he wages his war against those he perceives as charlatans and witch hunters.He engages in a similar type of \\"word gymnastics\\" when he attempts to convince his readers that any attempt to recover \\"forgotten\\" traumatic memories is not only unscriptural but in essence an unrecognized error of following the doctrine of demons. In these arguments he mockingly calls the process a \\"spiritual gift\\" (p. 184), a \\"doctrine\\" (p. 184), a \\"philosophy\\" (p. 188), a \\"new gospel\\" (p. 191), and a \\"miraculous event\\" (p. 192) just so he can falsely apply scriptures using these words to the phenomenon. He then paints a rather unsettling picture. Instead of believing in the existence of a covert web of multi-generational Satanists, which many \\"regressionists\\" claim, Simpson seems convinced that the therapists facilitating the recovery of these memories are the ones whom Satan is using to accomplish his agenda in the world (pp. 190-94).In another place he twists psychological information to support his argument in a manner that less informed readers probably would not catch. After presenting good material on the characteristics of fantasy prone and easily hypnotized individuals, he quotes from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) that individuals with DID \\"tend to be highly hypnotizable.\\" In questioning why this is so, he claims to have found the \\"secret of the False Memory Crisis.\\" He says, \\"It's not that MPDs and repressed memory victims accidentally happen to be hypnotic virtuosos. It's the other way around.\\" Highly hypnotizable people are particularly vulnerable when falling into the hands of \\"regressionist\\" therapists to imagine themselves into a false diagnosis of MPD [DID] (pp. 165-66).His error is in failing to acknowledge that dissociability and hypnotizability are virtually synonymous terms (referring to a high propensity for entering an altered state of consciousness), meaning that dissociative individuals are indeed by their very nature \\"hypnotic virtuosos.\\" The two are inseparable.Another concern within the book is Simpson's inconsistent documentation. While his book is prolifically footnoted, some of his key technical points lack any footnotes at all(e.g. pp. 56-62; 121, 123, 134, 136, 161). He also fails on at least one occasion to list critical information regarding a study supporting his view(p. 45).He claims there is little corroborating evidence to legitimize recovered memories (p. 11). While acknowledging the reality of true child abuse, Simpson seemingly only believes reports of such abuse if the person has \\"free standing\\" memories.Making no allowance at all for dissociated traumatic memories, he also seems to question the existence of Dissociative Identity Disorder (pp. 24-25) even though this is fully recognized and described in the official diagnostic manual of psychologists (DSM-IV). On the other hand, he gives a lengthy description of \\"False Memory Syndrome\\" (pp. 105, 108, 121), which has never been professionally recognized or included in any diagnostic manual. Furthermore, after shooting down the definitive nature of symptoms lists others have established for suspecting buried childhood trauma (pp. 31; 94-102), he seemingly has no compunctions about creating his own list of symptoms which he says indicate a person is believing in false memories (pp 121-22).Simpson's call for some sort of external corroboration of abuse memories and the witness of at least two individuals before making accusations of presumed perpetrators is both valid and biblical. Sprinkled through his chapters are other valid points regarding the potential influence of predisposing belief systems, mind contamination, suggestibility, and group dynamics in possibly creating \\"false memories,\\" particularly in fantasy prone individuals. If he had presented these dynamics in a more balanced manner, allowing for the reality of true recovered memories as well, his book would make a more valuable contribution to the subject.Simpson concludes his book by referring to the \\"mountains of research findings that contradict regressionism\\" (p. 224). Somehow I missed seeing these \\"mountains.\\" The best I can say is that he presented material to cast a \\"reasonable doubt\\" on the validity of memories evoked under hypnotic conditions through the suggestions of therapists. However, the fervency with which he tries to cast this description on all therapists who believe in accessing dissociated, traumatic memories, his total rejection of any legitimate \\"recovered memories,\\" his seeming manipulation of terminology and Scripture, and his selective documentation leave me wondering why."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"The heroine, Melissa is quite likable even though she's a bit of a milquetoast. It's never clear if she's unable to stand up herself when faced with her snooty and abusive employer or if she's just trying to 'keep the peace'. I wish she'd have been a bit more of an 'Ugly American' and stood up for herself when faced with completely anti-American sentiment. And in the end she does begin to discover herself and take charge of her own life.I was sad when I finally finished the book because she was just beginning to be interesting."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"You can often identify \\"chick lit\\" by the style of the jacket illustration, and this is definitely one of them. (Not a put-down; I read and enjoy a lot of contemporary light fiction written by. and purportedly for, women.) Melissa is a slightly zaftig young woman, late 20s, from Oregon, who lost her job with a San Francisco ad agency, and then lost her apartment, and then broke her engagement -- and decides \\"what the hell\\" and takes an offer of short-term employment in Britain as au pair and nanny to the three children of a Member of Parliament. The family hasn't much money -- by British aristocratic standards -- and Melissa ends up being bullied into seventy hours a week of housekeeping, cooking, and general dogs-body duties by Mrs. Haig-Ereildoun, who's a real piece of work. Melissa just can't say \\"no,\\" and she's almost pathological in her attention to her duties, and even though she hates the way she's treated -- as a servant and a cultureless American -- she stays on, month after month. The youngest child, Claire, who's three, is deaf, and much of Melissa's job involves spending time with her and developing her vocabulary, and which she's extremely successful. But Melissa's pathetic self-image, and her general wimpiness, and her inability to deal with commitment when it comes to guys, and her unbelievable naivete about Britain -- an American university graduate who made a living with her writing not knowing that \\"lorry\\" is Brit-speak for \\"truck\\"? -- make her a not very sympathetic character. The story improves in the last third, as she gets involved in serious cooking, gets paid for writing columns about her culinary experiences for the paper back home, and begins to understand herself a bit better. But in the earlier chapters, you just want to shake her."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"This semi-autobiographical book tells the story of a 22-year-old Californian who has post-poned her wedding and been fired from her job. She decides to take a 6-month job as an au pair (kind of an exchange-student/nanny) in Great Britain. She ends up working for an upper class family with more class than money, which means she has to endure some unthinkable economies in their household but gets to visit some fabulous houses. The father is a non-selling-book-writing MP (Member of Parliament), the mother is beastly to the au pair (hence the title of the book), but the children are great. The three-year-old is deaf, and since the parents want her to learn to speak and understand oral language (as opposed to teaching her sign language, which would be the thing they'd do now, at least in this country), it will be the au pair's job to teach her to speak -- preferably with a British accent.The author writes quite well and this book is sometimes very funny. I think one of the most memorable lines says something like \\"just as the Eskimo have many words for snow, I think the Scots must have many words for gray.\\"She creates vivid characters and scenes and obviously went to some amazing estates as an au pair. Since au pairs are not to be treated as servants (but really are), she was allowed to mingle socially with her employers' upper class friends and to dine at the main table with them. On the other hand, she was expected to share the same bath water with everyone else when the family was at home (to save water)!The author's own experiences were several decades ago, and I think the book would have worked better if she had just set it in the past, as there seem to be some anachronisms.

Yes, and it would have been a different story. For it is as much a story about the relationship of two countries, the myths, good and bad, the stories we tell about the other, the class system, old institutions versus self inventiveness. Cleverly woven into this theme, are many others, the principal being an education in life for a young 22-year-old American woman, who has lost her job back home and canceled her wedding. As Melissa sticks out a six month term as a nanny (because &quot;a promise is a promise&quot;) under horrible working conditions, we chart her growth and the development of the overall theme.The author walks a fine line that accurately presents but doesn't exaggerate the cultural mores, social attitudes, and behavior of the British upper classes. I think she is careful to provide a balanced view. Although I'm sure there will be those who disagree.I was pleasantly surpised at the depth of the story, the introspection that is assigned to Melissa, her coming to terms with the differences of another culture that surprisingly doesn't speak the same language, even though it's English, with issues of child rearing, and the ability to experience true intimacy. Ultimately, the story is just a sheer delight to read. You will laugh and cry, be outraged and charmed even at the minutiae of Melissa's &quot;diary&quot;.

Melissa exposes an appalling WASPs' nest of snobbery among the Brits. But I definitely am a Melissa-phile. She's utterly charming. Her diary is alternately moving, biting, funny, sarcastic and sweet. Somehow she manages to unearth a bit of humanity even in the most unlikeable people. I was completely engrossed in Melissa's adventures working for the Employer from Hell, and would recommend this book to anyone who likes fines writing, beautifully drawn characters---and who thinks they like the English."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"The San Francisco ad agency let Melissa go. Feeling despondent, Melissa reconsiders her engagement and decides to end it. Thus, she feels as if she has failed in both her professional and personal lives.Needing a change, Melissa accepts a job as an Au Pair to the family of a Scottish member of the English Parliament. Melissa knows she has three children to care for, ranging in age from three to eleven, but still expects to enjoy the social life of a parliamentarian. However, culture shock stuns Melissa especially as defined by her employer's wife, who demands no Americanization of her three children and rationing of hot water and even seemingly the sun. Will Melissa last six months or will this be strike three?DO TRY TO SPEAK AS WE DO will surprise readers who give this debut novel a chance. The story line is often amusing and at times acrimonious as Melissa feels more like a downstairs drudge who envies Cinderella's pre-princess role. Readers observe the radical differences between the American and British cultures through Melissa's relative perceptions. Anyone who enjoys a contemporary humorous modern tale will find that Marjorie Leet Ford debuts with a triumphant social commentary.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"As I read this book, I often wondered if the author was horribly hungry as she wrote. The food descriptions were so vivid - I could almost smell and taste them. This was a surprise, as I hadn't expected the focus on food to be so intense.Food does play a part in the narrator's (Melissa - the American au pair) life. As for many of us, she uses food as a substitute for something she truly craves and needs.Anyone who's done research on losing weight and eating right understands this food replacement theory. Understanding the problem is one thing; doing something about it is quite another.Melissa must also deal with an overbearing boss, rambunctious children - one of which is deaf, a needy quasi-fiance back in the states and a possible new love interest in London.The story is an entertaining read, but after so many of Mrs. H-E.'s blowups, I wondered when the heck Melissa was going to get a backbone and stand up for herself and start taking charge of her life.The ending is somewhat predictable and not quite the complete path I'd have hoped for Melissa. But it's satisfying to know she'll head in the right direction."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"The previous reviewers have done good work outlining the plot and premise of &quot;Do Try to Speak...&quot;, so I'll just add my twopence worth in agreement that it was a bitter/sweet read; funny but disheartening (I'm also an Anglophile). Really, it's a coming of age story. Melissa's horrific experiences were undoubtedly the catalyst for her self-discovery. And not everyone's all bad! I positively adored Nanny, her stealthy eating habits and love for duck eggs!

There she attempted to be a perfect nanny to the three children of a Scottish parliamentarian and his very difficult wife, both of whom had read history at Oxford (he got the first; she demurred from unladylike zeal of receiving a first). So there's Melissa, American woman with a six-months' commitment, who quickly sees that this aristocratic family is a strange one: very tight money situation and a deaf child, to boot. I often thought Melissa could have just packed it in, but I understood how fear can hold someone back, especially a woman in a foreign country, afraid to return to the mess back home, therefore willing to stick to a mess of someone else's.I remember that in 1982, I was fed up with San Francisco, too (but I am a native). I saved my money, took one semester of German at City College, then headed off for Germany through a one summer ( three-month) job commitment on a farm near Bielefeld. I fantasized living out in the countryside with a three-generation, happy bunch of Germans, four kids and so on. Boy, was I in for some very nasty surprises! The father wanted an American there, to cheer up the family, after the death of a daugher (8) from drowning the year before. The wife gave in, and got revenge of her husband by treating me badly. I was already 22, not fit for general kicking around, and it was a bad start and bad end. Luckily, I had been kicked around in jobs in SF, so I knew when to leave. Even sticking it out until the fifth week felt like the longest hell of all: but I took up my courage, my orange secondhand backpack, passport and money, told the father goodbye (mother was out of the house), and hit the road by hitchhiking. I got all the way to Greece, then Crete, and had a fantastic time, the best time of my life, for the next 1.5 years, bumming all around Europe and never working again, just living cheap or being peoples' guest. I kept wondering, reading about this Melissa, when she would do what I had done, admitted her fear but packed up and left to try to find something else. She even HAD money in the bank! Was it because she was attracted from the start to the father, the Scottish MP? The supposed fame of living with such a family? Her endless discussion of food, cooking, her weight gain and need for new clothes made the book a bit too girlish, but it illustrated her loneliness and lostness. I personally remember LOSING weight in GErmany, on that dreadful farm, because I was so unhappy, scared of the mother, that I had a stressed stomach and could not eat properly. I did not understand the language, either, and the food was odd to me at the time...got used to it later.All in all, I found this a good read, simply because I too had known a situation like this. She might have made it clear that it happened in the past before Internet and modern phone systems, because it is confusing to a reader today, esp. a young one. On the other hand, I liked hearing the details of how it was difficult to place a long-distance call, etc. because that is how it was in the 1980's for me.I did write a lot of letters by hand, and lots of postcards, too.So thanks for the good read - you all can skim the more silly parts. You'll like the description of the parents and their habits, as well as the children's personalities. She has a sharp eye indeed for them!"},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"An enjoyable novel about a young girl who, after losing her job as a San Francisco advertising copywriter, decides to postpone her impending wedding and take a chance at a nanny job in England. Supposedly this will give her an opportunity to travel and work at the same time, and since she has a great friend who has married an Englishman and lives in London, she is hooked up very quickly to two potential families who need an Au Pair.Too bad Melissa chose the wrong family. The one thing I could simply not believe is how MEAN the employer character was (no way is any human being so entirely single-faceted), and the other was that since Melissa had such a good close friend nearby, why she simply didn't just up and quit, and head over to her friends' house after being treated so abominably by her employer. She was even told by her employer how the previous four or five nannies didn't last longer than a month (Uh, Danger! Danger! Will Robinson !!), and if that's not a warning sign I don't know what is.Although I do recall how many self-doubts I had when starting out in the working world, I can't imagine I would be so spineless as to allow myself to be treated so meanly. No way. The &quot;I promised to stick it out for six months&quot; reason she gives for staying is feeble, and doesn't jive with the other strengths and smarts which Melissa has in abundance.Other than this, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Other than Mrs. H-E, the rest of Leet Ford's characters are engaging, well depicted, and realistic. I think she does an excellent job highlighting fundamental personality differences between Brits and Americans, although I was a bit stunned at how much Brits seem to loathe Americans (which is also a bit curious: why would the Haid-Eruldson's settle for an American nanny if they despise the Yanks so much? Another surefire warning that she can't find anyone else dumb enough to take the job!). For some reason I never quite got that negative vibe from any of the many English folks I've met, either here in Canada, or in the U.S., or in England, or while on vacation elsewhere in the world. Perhaps Brits don't hold quite the same low opinions of Canadians, given that we were once part of the Commonwealth (or maybe we still are?), and we're still silly enough to pay their Queen &quot;royalties&quot; for having her all over our money!I do recall a telling meeting with a young Brit while on vacation in Florida. He and his friends seemed desperate to speak to some intelligent young women, and were quite appalled when regaling a meeting with some American ladies the previous day. When one of the young women claimed she loved to hear them speak 'their language', he said [to me], &quot;Don't we all speak the same language?&quot; &quot;No&quot;, I said, &quot;you speak English, while they speak American. Quite a difference. We Canadians pride ourselves on speaking the Queen's English, but that's not really emphasized south of the 49th parallel.&quot;I enjoyed Melissa's letter-writing prowess, her food obsessions, and completely related to her surprise at her increasing girth. It seems to happen to young women away from home, I've experienced it myself. I'm sure there's an appropriate psychological analysis of it all, but who really cares? The great thing is that Melissa has several enlightenments which all combine into a major resolution to change what she doesn't like about her life. Bravo! Melissa, and I feel that all readers would be rooting for her too.Perfect reading just in time for New Years' Resolutions, although it's good any time."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"The writing in this book was not bad, though it got off to a shaky start. I could sympathize with Melissa's confusion about some of the differences in English pronunciations and terms, having just spent three months overseas myself. However, there was one aspect of the book that seriously bothered me: the author's treatment of the three-year-old Deaf child, Claire. Now, I will allow that she hinted about the possibility of a mental problem with the girl due to her mother having rubella during the pregnancy, but that does not change her treatment of deafness as a mental disability instead of a physical one. She frequently stated through both Melissa (the au pair) and Mrs. H-E (the mother) the belief that teaching the girl sign language would *isolate* her from the rest of the world. This passage particularly disturbed me: \\"'A normal person spends a great deal of energy thinking. Children even more than adults. *Since Claire's ability to think is limited*, she has an excess of physical energy.'\\" [My emphasis.] And in the next paragraph: \\"'Children who don't have words tend to create a world of their own, in their heads.' Miss Gilbert pointed her index finger at her own head and buzzed it in circles-international sign language for \`nuts.'\\" This from a supposed medical professional!It's patently obvious Ford has never known Deaf people. She obviously made no attempt to learn anything about them before writing this book. She has no idea how wonderfully expressive they can be. Their ability to think is in no way *limited*; they simply think differently than most speaking people do. Rather than thinking in words, they think in pictures and ideas. My Deaf sign language was one of the kindest, smartest, most creative people I've ever met - and he was very outgoing with Deaf and speaking people alike. In America, at least, Deaf people have a very close-knit community and their own culture. However, this does not isolate them. If they are at all isolated, it's because of people like Ford who refuse to learn about them and their language, and then pass on their ignorance and misconceptions to other people."},{"Title":"Do Try to Speak as We Do: The Diary of an American Au Pair","review":"Having been a nanny myself, I can appreciate just how true this story is. Parents take outrageous advantage of their nannies (I worked those 16-hour days without the promised days off.) Beyond that, I was not that entertained by this book. The datedness of the story really hampered my enjoyment of the book, and only because the author made vague attempts to update it! Why bother putting in a few disingenuous mentions of e-mail when one whole basis of the nanny's job is that weird pre-1975(?) idea that teaching sign language to hearing-impaired children was bad. Come on! A 22-year-old in the year 2001 would seek out the first internet cafe in London she could find on her first day off, not be sending long letters to her friends back home. The diary is supposedly written on blue airmail paper. I think the last time I saw blue airmail paper was in 1988. The story would have been much better if the author had either relented and set the story when it obviously really did happen (which, according to the author's bio, was when she was a nanny in the early 1970s), or had overhauled it and truly updated it to reflect that most modern 22-year-olds e-mail each other, don't think they're automatically going to stop working when they have children, have international phone cards instead of calling collect, etc. The story itself was ok. I read it all the way through out of a kind of morbid curiosity; well, that and I was stuck on a plane for several hours."},{"Title":"Opening a Mountain: K=oans of the Zen Masters","review":"Recommend to all zen practitioners as well as mountaineering folks as well as those who love to gaze at mountains."},{"Title":"THE MAGNETIC MAN - The Avengers (8) Eight","review":"I was a fan of the Avengers television series when it first aired. The quirkiness of John Steed and his two companions Emma Peel and Tara King was a sharp contrast to the roughness of other shows involving secret agents.Unfortunately that quirkiness is not captured in this book. Steed is sent to Hong Kong to serve as a courier for some secret documents. As he is leaving the building, there is a small riot and the case handcuffed to his wrist is exchanged for one containing approximately 250 million dollars. Not knowing who it belongs to; Steed and Tara King go on a wild spending spree in an attempt to bring the owners out into the open. The plot also involves agents of the governments of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China, none of which seems to be able to bring their A game. Although there are many characters, none of them seem to be that interesting and the repartee between Steed and King never gets beyond her desire to spend as much money as possible. The action is weak and never actually grabs you."},{"Title":"Porch Swing Stories","review":"_Porch Swing Stories_ makes for wonderful reading. While the book appears at first glance to be a collection of short stories peopled with characters legendary in Southern fiction--sages, servants, saints, and spinsters all make their appearance, not to mention fools and hypocrites--we soon realize that all the main characters in each story are related to each other; in fact, often we see the same characters in different stories, sometimes at very different ages. For the history in this book isn't told from the beginning to the end. Rather, we're taken on a journey that constantly shifts from the present to the past and back again. As the journey proceeds, we come to learn more and more about these people: their fears, their weaknesses, but also their sense of humor and their triumphs. Moulds is a great storyteller, and the deeper social issues he touches on in the book remind me of that other great Southern writer, Flannery O'Connor. But where O'Connor is rather obsessive to show us the &quot;big issues,&quot; Moulds lets the story take center stage; thus the larger lessons we learn are somehow more human and more vivid. You will remember _Porch Swing Stories_ for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Porch Swing Stories","review":"By the time I was being raised in the South, things had already changed, but in some ways just barely, from the way things were in PORCH SWING STORIES. Reading these very connected stories brought back many memories of people I had known as a child, people who were very much like Mr. Mould's relatives/characters.If you are of a certain age and are either living in the South or from the South, this is a &quot;must read&quot;. If you are not from or living in the South, you can also enjoy it. Just one thing ... please read it with an open mind. The people depicted in these stories are simple; and I am sure I'd be bored to death if I had to spend an afternoon with any of them. However, as characters in these stories, they are truly something special."},{"Title":"Porch Swing Stories","review":"I had the pleasure of reading this collection of wonderful stories long before the advent of the internet being an option for upcoming artists and writers. I am not an American, but have always had a great appetite for learning the ways of American culture, from coast to coast. In this book, so appropriately named, one can feel - indeed taste - what it would have been like (or is like) to have lived in the South. The characters, the dialogue, the situations, all conjure an image of a people whose existence, however humble, are alive with tradition and a common sense of belonging. By the end of the collection, the reader truly acquires a sense of what it means to be &quot;from the South.&quot; The prose, exquisite in its simplicity and involving dialogue, along with the intricate stories designed around simple situations, makes for perfect reading under the shade of a front porch, while sipping lemonade and swinging on the porch swing. Bravo."},{"Title":"Porch Swing Stories","review":"If nostalgia is the fruitful reverie of a past whose text is a history of longing, R. A. Moulds's sensitive and quietly startling Southern scrapbook may very well be the happy result of such imaginings.The sketches of Porch Swing Stories--and I say sketches advisedly because the emphasis of Moulds's narratives is on character rather than plot--are not offering some uncharted utopia in the dust-covered and gone-by-the-wayside town of Ringgold, Mississippi, a community more often than not sans unity in matters of brotherly love, Methodism, and, well, equine equality (in short, in matters of civil rights, as our more prosaic historians would undoubtedly label it). Instead, seen through the eyes of T. J. McPherson, the reporter and editor of these news from somewhere (decidedly, concretely, somewhere), Ringgold gradually emerges as a circle of resplendent potential, a potential squandered like a ring of gold pawned before the nuptial.So lost is Ringgold and all that rings true in it that, on occasion, T. J. has to leave the swing on the porch and swing open instead the portal of the local cemetery in his attempts at bringing to light the unremembered out of which he fashions his memorials. And while far from morose or bitter, each miniature celebrates not so much the independent spirit--overrated, perhaps, in American life and fiction--but insists upon spiritual interdependence, upon the viability of communion, the bond between siblings, friends, and lovers, upon the elective affinities and nurtured alliances at odds with a larger, nominal community such as &quot;Ringgold.&quot; Many hands join in Ringgold; some never dare; and some only furtively, encircled by spying eyes that permit no proud display of rings.It is fitting that a book so resilient in its belief in sheltering friendship and so alive with parlor poetry and song should be read out aloud to be shared and enjoyed with others; it defies the linear and chronological imposed upon the human experience by the historian and offers instead an intricate web, the lively circling and swirling of memory, encouraging a cross-referencing and back-tracking (as well as a leaping forward to notes to the stories), a collecting and recollecting it so amply rewards.Each reader will find particular favorites in Ringgold and award the star that has been taken from my rating of Moulds's wonderful history of longing to one of its denizens, to the formidable Sophronie, perhaps, facing the wreck of Amy Magill, to her gentle sister Eulalie giving up her hat at the drop of it, to the emboldened Ardis McCreery at the moment of his impassioned reception of Daniel Tan, or to the courageous Cassandra Thibodeaux singing before an audience stunned and stunted by racial hatred.While Porch Swing Stories abounds with enriching allusions to art, music, and literature, I could not but create my own bridges. Moulds's sketches are reminiscent of Elizabeth Gaskell's Cranford (1853), a collection of stories--comic, melodramatic, tragic--about everyday living and dying in a small town. And although American narratives like Willa Cather's My Antonia will also come to mind upon perusal of this volume, the mention of &quot;Prince Albert Magill&quot;--a young man so pretty that, as Eulalie has it, &quot;some boys from over Pachuta would've just about married him if he'd a put on a dress&quot;--suggests a fondness for Victoriana, especially the comic realism of the Cranfordian (or Barsetshire) variety. Sophronie, Eulalie (and their mysteriously exiled brother Jim) bear some resemblance to Gaskell's portrait of two elderly sisters, the formidable Deborah Jenkyns and the gentle Miss Matty, and their disappearing brother Peter (who, like Prince Albert, is argued to look pretty in a dress). Both books, albeit not novels, are intricately woven; their social commentary is offered joshingly rather than acrimoniously, and their outlook is cheerful rather than grim, even in the face of tragedy. Such books make pleasant companions. It is hoped that R. A. Moulds's Porch Swing Stories will find and keep the company of appreciative listeners that Cranford has been enjoying for a century and a half now."},{"Title":"Chancy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the story of a boy who was condemned with out a chance as a child that progresses into the inspirational tale of a man searching for a future, but being haunted by his past.

I represent myself the American man of the Frontier as Louis L'Amour who loved giving birth to strong characters as Ottis Chancy.Be ready to be surprised by the quality of the story, the sense of action, the humourous passion of the West. Louis L'Amour, you still are a great author."},{"Title":"Chancy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"L'Amour viewed himself as a storyteller, keeping his audience on edge as a mysterious storyline unfolded, replete with characters worth caring about. \\"Chancy\\" is a product bearing the mark of the master storyteller. The plot is not resolved until the final page. L'Amour writes authentically because he lived the lives of the characters he created. Yes he lived a few generations after the Western Frontier days, but as much as reasonably possible, he put himself into the locations and mindset of those living in the Ole West.L'Amour ties in a subtle romantic theme that sees positive resolution in the conclusion of \\"Chancy.\\" The protagonist is motivated by wanting to do something significant with his life. He isn't greedy or selfish. Chancy sees himself as an outsider and one of his sidekicks is an Indian who views himself in the same way. Kindred spirits are drawn together for a common purpose. My only real complaint is that all the conflict resolutions are made through violence. The strongest always win. That's just too unrealistic, simplistic, and sad. Otherwise, this is a good escape read."},{"Title":"Chancy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I thought this was a great book. Otis Tom Chancy was a great man and also not one to give up. Louis lamour did a great job on this book. I would have given it 100 stars if it was possible."},{"Title":"Chancy (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was my first L'Amour novel and for two thirds of the book I was drawn in and liked it very much. L'Amour wrote this at the age of 60 and by then he was a master at story telling. His prose is clean and efficient; he can set up a scene and in a few skillful sentence describe nature and places. In Chancy he created an appealing 19-year-old, fighting against great odds to create a good life for himself and to become a respectable man. His father was unjustly hung as a horse thief and he was forced to watch as a 13-year-old boy.The problem is the last 20 pages of this 160-page novel. I like novels where I can believe the events could actually happen, even if the events are extreme. But L'Amour piles up so much derring-doo, so many struggles-to-the-death, so much total bravery, and our hero overcoming such incredible odds, that this becomes comic book stuff. For example: four desperados are waiting to kill our hero in Cheyenne, after he has had a bruising fist fight and many harrowing escapes. He has a pistol and a rifle. Our hero's trail partner, who is very good with a gun, offers to help. This is my fight, our hero says and goes out alone. You can hear Tex Ritter singing \\"High Noon\\" though in that great movie Garry Cooper repeatedly asked for help. Chancy quickly dispatches two of the desperados with his rifle butt; plugs the third after he has started shooting at him from a balcony, and finally brings down the expert gunman with his rifle. Isn't it a bit sad that L'Amour felt he had to give his readers this kind of fantasy rather than a at least a little dose of reality? I remember seeing the movie, TV and popular book versions of the \\"Gunfight at the OK Corral\\" Then I read James Horan's wonderful book \\"The Lawmen\\".\\" part of his authentic Wild West series. Horan actually found and read the court transcripts of the trial after the OK Corral shootings and looked up all the actual newspaper accounts. Almost everything in the movie, TV and \\"biography\\" of Wyatt Earp was a pack of lies. Is it good to live in la la land? Is it good to have a US president who thinks he's John Wayne? For that matter Wayne ducked enlisting in World War II . Hell, he had a career to pursue. But he sure was a great movie cowboy and Marine sergeant. Anyway, read Horan's wonderful books.

It has helped change my life, along with all theBragg books"},{"Title":"Water: The Shocking Truth That can Save Your Life","review":"When I had this book recommended to me, I was the cook in my own restaurant for almost two years prior to selling it. In less than a year I gained 60 lbs. and developed gout in my left foot, swelling to twice its normal size. Gout is a result of an over production of uric acid creating crystals which collect in a joint, and like broken glass, these crystals grind in the socket causing great inflammation and pain. I couldn't wear a shoe or stand very long on one leg since I couldn't put pressure on my left foot. The doctor said it was the worst case of gout he had ever seen in someone so young. To be able to function I needed 500 mg of Zyloprim twice a day to keep the gout at bay in order to function without constant, searing pain. The doctor warned me that this quantity of Zyloprim could severely damage my kidneys over time.A customer came into the restaurant two days later and asked why I was limping and I responded, gout. He said I needed to read two books by Dr. Paul Bragg, \\"The Shocking Truth about Water\\" and \\"The Miracle of Fasting.\\" So I asked my wife to pick them up from the health food store. These books literally changed my life! I learned the simple truth that distilled water was the purest water available. I was amazed at the simple fact that fasting with distilled water would cleanse my body of foreign substances such as dissolving kidney stones, gall stones, uric acid crystals that form in a joint, inorganic mineral plaque forming in arteries and much more.Dr. Bragg also talked about the importance of fasting and how it helps clean the body of stored inorganic substances, toxins, carcinogens and the colon from years of impacted fecal matter. He mentioned that fasting using distilled water would not only clean out our body, but also give our digestion system and its organs a chance to rest and regenerate, adding years to our lives and preventing many diseases.While I was studying Bragg's book, my wife was suffering from phlebitis (blood clots) in her legs. She was taking Coumadin, plus large doses of antibiotics for her frequently recurring kidney infections, being admitted twice for intravenous antibiotics.We both started drinking a gallon of distilled water a day and I started my fast while cooking in my restaurant 12 -16 hours per day. No food at all, only distilled water. Was it easy? Absolutely not. The only time I wasn't constantly being tempted was while I was sleeping. However, I think I may have had nightmares about starving to death. LOL! I actually had no choice: fasting was my only hope for getting off that deadly medication and eradicating the gout.I had been smoking since entering the Navy at 17, so I was also looking forward to this fast to cleanse my lungs of tar and nicotine deposits, as Dr. Bragg had promised. After the system is clean of this addicting drug, it is much easier to quit smoking for good. Dr. Bragg was saying that even though any length of fast is good for you, you should go beyond 17 or 18 days, or else it is not a total cleanse. The 18-19th day is when you have your last bowel movement. During the fast the distilled water helps pull out toxins, carcinogens, chemicals, artificial colorings, flavorings, preservatives, etc., including tar and nicotine in the lungs and colon from smoking.The colon has been actively moving, loosening and breaking free the impacted feces composed of encrusted, undigested, mucus coated greasy food and putrefied, rotting meat, all of which can contribute to colon or rectal cancer. When this is taking place, you will hear loud growling and gurgling noises, and maybe some cramps. This is a great sign that very good things are happening. The activity plus the cramping is what will bring on the last elimination of the colon. Make sure you're alone in the house and the bathroom fan is on with all the windows open. Purchase a pallet of industrial air freshener in advance. That experience for me was life changing! When I saw and smelled what came out of my body, I was appalled. The smell was like that of a dead, rotting animal, the texture was slimy, sticky and gummy, and I thought I had given birth to a still-born tar baby. As a matter of fact, it stuck to the side of the toilet bowl and wouldn't let go, as if it were a foul, demonic creature with needle-sharp, stainless steel claws planted into the side of the porcelain bowl whose footprint was extremely hard to eradicate.When you're done gagging and retching and judging me for my lack of discretion, just remember your body and colon could be more impacted and toxic then mine was at 26, depending on your age and especially if you have never fasted. My candid description is to hopefully invoke some degree of concern and action on your part.Thank you dr. Bragg for writing this book."},{"Title":"Water: The Shocking Truth That can Save Your Life","review":"\\"Unfortunately, man is more interested in the unknow darkness of outer space than studying and protecting our vast seas!\\" Aside from poor grammar and unnecessary repetition, this book includes all kinds of shocking \\"facts\\" that are ultimately unsubstantial:According to the book, Fluoride causes \\"Cancer in all it's deadly forms.\\" How can the author make such a statement without elaboration?!

I have heard it all from distilled, reverse osmosis, mineral, micro and BEV! I was so confused until I read Patricia Braggs book &quot;Water-The Shocking Truth.&quot; The challenge I had with the previous advice is nobody would tell me &quot;why&quot; I should drink the water they recommend! Patricia finally puts that question to rest once and for all with a finite explanation of the difference of non-organic and organic minerals! Simply put, the body will NOT assimilate non-organic minerals thus the human body craves pure H2O water...distilled water...nothing but Hydrogen and Oxygen! This book really drives the point home and gives you a feeling of security while making the choice to change what water to drink! Thanks again for a wonderful book packed with information!!!"},{"Title":"Water: The Shocking Truth That can Save Your Life","review":"Received the book in just a couple of days and the book was in excellent condition. The information in this book is an eye opener. I could not put the book down. So much information!"},{"Title":"Water: The Shocking Truth That can Save Your Life","review":"The fact that this book includes advertising for the publisher's other, completely unrelated products should be a clue that the information is heavily biased. I bought this book, along with a few others on the same subject, because it was highly rated by other reviewers. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed, which compelled me to write a review of my own.One of the main tenets of this book is that beneficial minerals, like calcium, should be ingested from organic sources like vegetables, not from inorganic sources like non-distilled water. The Braggs suggest that inorganic minerals in our drinking water contribute to hardening of the arteries and a host of other ailments.This theory, which is stated as a scientific fact, is hardly established within the medical or scientific community. This, and much of the other material presented in the book, is quite controversial, and the Braggs never acknowledge any opposing views, presenting their opinions as gospel.While I actually agree that distilled water is healthy, there are a few issues that the Braggs never even discuss. One: the possibility of distilled water leaching essential minerals from your body. This is easily addressed, since the amount of mineral loss you can expect is easily compensated for by a healthy diet. Two: the importance of storing distilled water in an &quot;inert&quot; (e.g. glass) container, since distilled water is &quot;aggressive,&quot; meaning it tends to leach possible toxins from plastic containers.These are just two examples of glaring omissions that the uninformed reader might never realize. This book makes a lot of amazing claims. Just remember, if it seems too good to be true, you should be suspicious.

Those that actually want to look into the issue should seek out double-blind scientific studies, not books with advertisements for the author's products. It is a bit odd that there isn't a single formal reference to a single study anywhere in the book since there is such scientific gospel between the covers. A quote from the book that is typical of all the information inside - \\"The only scientific way to free the necessary quantities of fissionable Uranium 235, buried in the inert mass of its parent U-238, is to force uranium hexaflouride gas through many acres of porous barriers. The next part of the process gradually concentrates the elements, creating a deadly hazard from radiation. 'Hex' is what they named this vicious stuff.\\" The author decides to mix fact and fiction by giving an impressive-sounding fact, and then adding something completely false. She proclaims that chemists call uranium hexaflouride gas \\"hex\\" because of the negative implications of the word (from the German hexe meaning witch). It must have slipped the author's mind that the prefix is not \\"hex\\", it is \\"hexa\\", a Greek word meaning six, ie hexagon, hexadecimal, etc. The word means that there are six atoms of flourine in one molecule of uranium hexaflouride. If the author did not know that (which I'm sure she did) she should not be writing this book. For the icing on the cake, she implies that flourine is inherently radioactive because it can assist making the atomic bomb. She must not have heard of the H-bomb, made with hydrogen, the same hydrogen that makes up 66% of water. I've only mentioned one instance, but anybody buying this book should only do so for a good joke, this book is full of them. People may be impressed people by scientific jargon, but please realize that there is no mandate that even scientists (much less people trying to sell a product or idea) have to be honest. Honest science is a very good thing, but nearly all the time the only message heard comes from those that have the money to put it forth, and that certainly isn't research facilities. Research before you believe."},{"Title":"Water: The Shocking Truth That can Save Your Life","review":"OMG! This is a most incredible book! The information in this book probably did save my life. I was experiencing pretty severe swelling in my ankles and feet that my doctor was very concerned about. I was told that if the problem didn't get resolved with a low salt diet I would have to go on diuretics. I do not like taking any kind of medication, even aspirin. After reading this book, which dicusses the dangers of drinking tap water, I immediately bought a water distiller. After a few weeks, the swelling in my feet and ankles totally resolved itself. The other benefits of drinking distilled water are also discussed in the book, such as resolving symptoms that seem to be arthritis, which are actually caused by the calcifications produced in your body from drinking inorganic water. I have experienced relief from these symptoms also. Thank You Dr. Bragg for making this information available to us!!!

Water is mentioned repeatedly in conjunction with so-called information about \\"inorganic minerals\\" which are blamed, together with but not separately from toxins in our waters, for many health problems; but very little about water on it's own. The Messages in the Water guy, Masaru Emoto, says the most healthy living water has evaporated, precipitated through clean air, filtered through clean earth and percolated back up through mineral rich earth's crust; yet this book claims only distilled water is naturally healthy. My common sense balks at the claim that steam distilled water is 'natural', for a start. This book is more sensational than informative. Not for the serious student of water, IMO.

This is acutally the second book of what appears to be a loosely linked trilogy. I haven't read the first book in the set &quot;werewolf's kiss&quot;.I found that as a stand alone novel this was well written. The author has a clear writing style and sticks to reasonalbly simple story lines. I also found it was quite lyrical and had a bitter-sweet ending.It's the story of the &quot;cursed&quot; marley werewolves. The eldest child of each generation is cursed so that on the &quot;night of their greatest triumph&quot; they will turn into a werewolf and start killing. Andrew Marley is the 3rd generation for this to happen to and on the night of his ordination as a preist all goes to hell.The cover somewhat does this book a dis-service. It looks like a dyed-in-the-wool romance, but the story is in many ways more of a tragedy than a romance and I was grateful I found I was actually reading a story and not a torrid romance that simply revolves around love saving the day and sex.If you want a &quot;light&quot; werewolf novel that is quick and easy to read this is reccomended."},{"Title":"The Werewolf's Touch","review":"I am not in love with the book.

What a totally inappropriate title for a book, especially when the subject matter is; view points of different cultures. Who gets to decide who is competent and who is not? Would one become competent after they read this book? People who do not agree with the authors, are they incompetent? After the initial shock of the title, I started reading this book, in fact I had to read the whole thing since it was the text book of a class that I was taking. Unfortunately the shock intensified. They define things that are not definable and they categorize things in the most reductionist and mechanistic fashion. Not only that but they don't even use English properly. They ask a question about apples and then give an answer about oranges, not realizing that the question has really no answer and should not be asked to begin with. This book is supposed to be about different points of view but there is nothing in it that would make one understand other cultures. It is all about the extremely narrow and linear point of view of the authors. They explain the simplest concepts in the most convoluted way possible but in reality the information is extremely superficial. They basically name and categorize things and consider them understood. After a few weeks our class turned into 'lets find out how wrong the authors are' class. I must admit after that it was kind of fun. When I asked my teacher as to why she chose this book, thinking perhaps I am missing something, her answer was &quot;because it seems to be quite popular&quot;!

This book was HARD TO PUT DOWN!!!!!!!! It's just like Pringles, once you pop, you can't stop!This is the story of one youth named Solomon Action, a youth who struggles with his identity and faith. He wants this flying motorcycle so badly he steals one, and lands in prison, and thus begins a spiritual battle for his soul. This is the end of the 1000-year reign of Christ on earth (if you're premillenialist and take the Millenium literally). The Devil is set free from his prison in Hell, where he has served a 1,000-year sentence. All Hell breaks loose as Satan wages his final rebellion against God, six days before Judgment Day! This gives poor ol' Solomon only six days to repent! Will he repent in time? Read the book and find out!The chapter on Judgment Day is as interesting as it is sobering. If you're a Christian it makes you really make sure you are one, and if you're not, well, it makes you think! Never before have I read a novel chapter on the Day of Judgment (or Great White Throne Judgment as described here) described in such detail. This could very well be the literary equivalent of Michelangelo's Last Judgment or the famous hymn Dies Irae.Whether you take the Millenium literally or whether you interpret it allegorically, whatever your religious persuasion, whether or not you are a Christian, I promise you YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Thunder In Paradise","review":"This book is the sequel to Jon Cash's first book, The Age of the Antichrist, and for those who have read it(Antichrist), this one is even better!

The cast of characters from Antichrist has survived the Tribulation and have been enjoying 999 years and 360 days of love, peace, and prosperity. The Thunder refered to in title becomes real as the Devil is released from God's prison and the people of faith have to battle spiritually with his demons and the dragon himself. The action moves very quickly and the book is difficult to put down. The end is riveting, and unquestionably inspired by God.

John keeps you completely enthralled with his fast paced action-packed thriller.

But even in a perfect world, they have retained their free will and can decide what to do with their life. Will Solomon make the right choices, or will Satan claim his soul before the final battle is fought?This book was not only a wonderful and enjoyable, but a book that will strengthen your faith as a believer.

Many of the works you find on the classroom shelf (I mean the shelf that holds the teacher's professional books and is never touched, year after year after year) are filled with either dry as dust text books that have languished there since the teacher finished their last undergraduate or graduate course and never-to-be-opened-again, or some snazzy new publication which \\"someone\\" higher up in the food chain decided would be good for all the teachers to have (having never had to read it, much less use it themselves), and in reality probably should have never have seen the working side of a printing press. Lots of good trees have died in this fashion!And then along comes a work such as \\"Just Deal With it\\" by Diana R. Jenkins! Ms. Jenkins has created a work here that is not only a valuable tool to be used in the educational process, but it is a work that enables the teacher to reach her or his charges on so many different levels and in so many different disciplines. Please, please, please...read on!This 239 page book is a collection of 19 short plays which can be used in the classroom; any class room, and used quite effectively. I have noted in my years on wondering about schools, in and out of class rooms, that most kids like to act, or at the very least, seem quite enthusiastic when allowed to become active in their own learning process. This is particularly true of the age of student being targeted here. Now putting on a \\"play\\" may seem like a daunting task; cast selection, stage, props, lines to memorize, lighting, costumes, etc. Ah, but this is not so with what we are dealing with here! Much of the work and organization has been done!The author has given us the concept of \\"Reader's Theater\\" to ponder and work with. Each of these delightful plays (More about them later), is to be read by actors and not memorized in the traditional sense. Each little play requires six to twelve student actors and for the most part all of the props can be found entirely in the class room. Costumes are not a problem as the kids are already wearing them for the most part. Rather than memorizing the lines, the students are allowed to read them as the play is being acted.The audiences for these little mini-productions can come from the rest of the class, other class rooms in the school, invited family members, nursing home dwellers, civic groups....and the list goes on. The author has given the teacher plenty of specific instructions and suggestions on the workings of each play which can be follow...or not...depending upon the comfort level of the individual teacher and the individual students.The subject of these plays cover a wide gambit of everyday situations, from encounters with substitute teachers, visits to the doctor's office, the pushy classmate, the fearful teacher the students will encounter \\"next year,\\" getting along, not getting along, how to deal with difficult situations and the list goes on. One of the most important things to note here is that this author/teacher most certainly has a sense of humor and perfectly understands life as seen through the eye of a young man and woman...she knows her subject! These plays range from amusing to funny!There are of course many educational advantages to producing class plays such as this, with the first being allowing the child to become use to speaking in front of an audience; a fearful thing for most people. There is the additional benefit of the act of reading. We also have the building of organizational skills here, and each and every one of these skits teach a valuable lesson in life and give the kids something to think about. (Note: There is no \\"preachy\\" stuff here). Learning to interact with their classmates on a project such as this is a benefit that cannot be overlooked and of course there is always the chance that a \\"great acting talent\\" may be awakened in each and every child. Learning language art skills, reading skills, public speaking, writing and listening...it is all here folks for the taking.Each script is well thought out and I cannot find anything that the author has overlooked. There are parts in each play suitable for appropriate reading levels; some large parts, some small parts and some in the middle. There is room for plenty of drama, comedy, serious thought and above all, participation. The teacher is given plenty of opportunities to throw in their own spin on things if so desired.To be honest, I wish my teachers had had access to a book such as this when I was a lad; it would have added some excitement to the school day. Of course when I was going to school we had to dodge mastodons on the way to the school house which was excitement enough...I suppose.Note: The author has given us another collection, which is just as useful and delightful, and can be found at:All Year Long!: Funny Readers Theatre for Life's Special TimesDon BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Just Deal with It!: Funny Readers Theatre for Life's Not-So-Funny Moments","review":"Jenkins' \\"readers theatre\\" plays for classroom use can play out in lots of small group situations -- think youth groups, Scouts, afterschool and summer programs -- there are many ways to use these truly funny but thought-provoking plays.As always, Jenkins asks her young readers/performers to \\"consider the journey\\" they are taking -- as the characters do in each of these plays.

The author narrates the lives of several of her wealthy friends as if it were a novel of gossips. All in all I can tell you that the whole thing is about how incredibly wacko, stupid, egocentric and superficial rich people are in Mexico.I was not expecting this sort of descriptions because the author is not a leftist writer, but when I read about the lives and ways of thinking of the very rich characters portrayed here, I only found a single one elaborated reasoning when a guy explained the way banks works and more stuff. But even that single one commentary was not so great, that poor fellow had to be like most of the Mexican upper class: zealot admirer of rich nations (under grounds their money, not what their cultures are really about) That poor youth seemed to be proud to be indebt with a British bank, something not easy for most Mexicans (lucky them). The huge lack of analytical thinking of these people is even disgusting at times, their vocabulary is an horrendous mixture of English and Spanish and it seem they get everything in life out their personal connections, never from their high skills even when they think very high of themselves and their private schools.I'm not sure if this book should be taken seriously for professional sociology studies. The author herself is highly wealthy and displays much of teh same flaws of her social group. For example, she takes all of her mere points of view as facts. But the book's strength remains, it's fresh data taken from the very source of information and from someone who belongs to that source of data.By the way, think again if you think these people are not so wealthy for living in a poor nation. It's all the opposite, while the 3rd world is flooding the rich nations with its poor inhabitants, its wealthy people own several billions of dollars and many have made it to the Forbes' list. One of them is Carlos Slim from Mexico who own about 30 billion dollars. You may well wonder whether these people's fortunes are directly related to the extreme poverty of their nations, I think so, but this author is not much about explaining why this people are so rich. At least it has a chapter that shows how stingy are these people when paying their employees. Just in case, I explained a bit how these people cause poverty in Mexico in my review of \\"Cuentos Chinos\\" by Andres Oppenheimer."},{"Title":"A History of European Folk Music","review":"I was working on a paper dealing with folk music and this is truly the best book on the subject that I found!

We have most of the other airport and terminal design books on the bookshelf (up to 2005 publication date), but every time we come back to using Horonjeff for the serious design of new airports and extensions. It is also good for layout design by the engineer for terminals - although the architects may want more books. But there is another book - the 2003 book titled Airport Systems - Planning, Design and Management by Richard de Neufville and Amedeo Odoni - that will become the definitive text on airport design for the first part of the 21st century. So you'll need both, especially if you have to deal with the complexity of systems and stakeholders that are part of medium to large size airports.Horonjeff has got the full set of data tables and charts to enable you to design anything. I seldom need to use the ICAO Manuals on a daily basis, and only use them for cross checking an obscure point. The upgrade from the 3rd edition to the 4th edition was a big one - it metricated much of the book, added in the latest aircraft (late model 737, 767s and ER, and the 777-200), and generally updated the book. Examples of new information are some good stuff on runway/taxiway capacity, and some additions to ACN/PCN. Worth spending the money to update. Essential to buy if starting from scratch.

Standard symbols are not the same found in other books, which adds to the difficulties in concentrating on the concepts the author is trying to convey. Furhtermore, you'd have to flip and back forth to understand what the symbols represent, because the author does not reiterate what they are.

This is the bible for analog design and is the one most widely used for its content and deservedly so. What the book really deserves credit for is teaching the manner of approaching circuit design by back of the envelope calculation. They teach you how to approximate via hand calculation, a very useful skill. They teach you how to become intuitive with circuits, this is the key. Before this book I had been asked to calculate the output impedance of a cascode mirror as an undergrad, it took about 5 pages and resulted in an expression of about 10 terms. Grey and Meyer shows you how to pop this out of a simple expression that contains only 3-4 terms and how to easily recognise the largest term. That is the beauty of this book, it teaches you how to become intuitive in transistor circuit analysis. The coverage is very good wrt the topics covered, most of the major issues are covered, but it is not encyclopedic. The problems are good and not terribly difficult, they are geared towards nailing down the material. The senior authors are both world renowned analog designers and both Fellows of the IEEE. The junior authors are also well known in this field. The writing is clear and to the point and the book has very few typos. There are other good analog IC books coming out now those by Lee, Allen, Razavi, and Johns have made it onto my shelf, but This is the Bible!"},{"Title":"Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits (3rd Edition)","review":"This text book should form the core for your analog design library.

If you haven't already been introduced to this book, better make it a part of your library.You'll find good stuff on:Large & small signal BJ & MOS transistor models,An informative chap. on IC technology & construction,Good chap. on current mirrors & active loads,Several chaps. on amps. including a detailed analysis of 741,Good info. on frequency response & analysis of IC opamps.,Chaps. on feedback & stability of IC opamps,A lot of attention to MOS technology throughout,Loads of transistor equations & useful approximations.Also there's other material which should interest anyone in analog circuit design, including discrete design. There's even an interesting chap. on circuit noise, which for me had been a subject with about as much sex appeal as Thermodynamics.Be forwarned, this isn't for the novice circuit designer. It's a rather rough trudge to make your way through the book. But as far as I'm capable of critically reviewing, this is a very well written book with very few errors (4th edition). There're a few quirks here & there. For example they introduce their own symbols for MOS transistors (as if we don't have enough), over play SPICE as \\"an integral part of many examples\\", & make stability analysis witht Bode plots (Bode not credited) more complicated than need be. However, these are trivial when compared to the overall work.I would therefore give the authors a resounding 5 stars. However, I can't do so for the version of the book which I received. I bought the book for self-study purposes. I was very disappointed to find 20 to 40 problems @ the end of each chap., but with NO answers! I assume this is the decision of the publisher. It's one thing not to include problems in a book (as in a thesis or paperback), but quite another to include problems (as in a \\"textbook\\") without any answers to those problems.So, look elsewhere first, if you're looking for a self-study aid on the subject."},{"Title":"Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits (3rd Edition)","review":"I agree that the material is well presented and comprehensive but be aware that much of the derivation is first for bipolar circuits and only secondarily for CMOS, often with reference back to the development of the bipolar counterparts.

I personally adore the treatment of feedback in amplifiers: Explaining the difficult subject, often still not well understood by many, is worth any effort. Another subject of hight importance which was give much attention, was the noise. As the low voltage/low power circuits do prevail, it is the noise level which sets limits of usability of analog circuitry."},{"Title":"Analysis and Design of Analog Integrated Circuits (3rd Edition)","review":"This is an outstanding textbook and is the best overall book I have found on analog design. Anyone contemplating writing a technical textbook should read this book to see how it is done.The text begins with the obligatory review of device physics and the development of active device models. MOS and bipolar devices are introduced together and the book switches back and forth between the two technologies with ease. Many analog texts will overdo bipolar design and skimp on MOS--while the vast majority of contemporary design is MOS-centric.Derivations are methodical and beautiful. The authors are masterful at mathematical derivations. I particularly appreciate the way the authors will introduce a topic for bipolar design and then repeat for MOS design without skimping on the details. The repeative analysis may be slightly redundant to the experienced professional--but should be a delight to the student diving into analog design for the first time.On the negative side, the book is a classic and has been in print for over a quarter of a century. The fundamentals are covered in great detail--and the basics are still the basics. Nevertheless, a few things have changed. For instance, integrated inductors (a mainstay of CMOS RF ICs) are casually dismissed as impractical.But all in all, a very fine text.

You have to look under COSSACK Plans to read about the detailed process of bringing Neptune and Overlord to fruition. This happens fairly often. A feature that was appreciated was that running throughout the book, the contributors would include additional reading choices if their comments peaked your interest on a specific topic.For enthusiasts, this book would be an excellent supplement but its no replacement for books you may already own.

However, the novel did not sit well with me: it's really two books in one. The first part deals with Robert Rogers' St. Francis raid- our fictional protagonist joins Roger's Rangers on the eve of their raid on St. Francis. This tale is briskly told, conveying the dangers and hardships of the mission, weaving historical figures into the narrative and accurately (as far as I can tell) portraying the details of the mission. In this first half (350 pages) of the novel, author Roberts deftly explores tensions between the British regulars and their Provincial counterparts; as well as portraying the ambivalent attitudes of both toward Native Americans. All in all, the first half of the novel is a brisk, rousing historical adventure. The book started to lose me in the second half, however. The life of our fictional protagonist, Langdon Towne, continues to revolve around that of his former Captain, Robert Rogers, as Rogers' life descends into a Dickensian drama. Rogers attempts to parlay his military prowess into fame, fortune, and a personal empire in Britain's newly acquired Western territories. Rogers is no match, however, for the politics and skullduggery of imperial management, as he deals with- and runs afoul of- people like Charles Townshend, Edmund Burke, Sir William Johnson, and Jeffrey Amherst. Constantly scorning authority, the alcoholic, womanizing Rogers winds up in debtor's prison in London before returning to America to raise another Ranger contingent to fight the upstart American rebels. This second part of the tale could have been told much more efficiently; it was hampered by a contrived, melodramatic romance and repetitive ruminations on the relationships between Indians and whites in the Western territories. I almost gave up on the second half of the book. If readers find themselves losing interest after the first 350 pages, I'd advise letting it go- enjoy the tale of the St. Francis raid, but you won't miss much by dropping the book after that."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"True, the language is archaic (published 1937) and the vocabulary at times daunting (we've dumbed down quite a bit since 1937).

Because he excels in two categories (research and writing skills) he would be a perfect fit for any High School class studing 20th century American Writers and their various styles.Northwest Passage: as others mentioned this novel is broken into two sections. The first section is a pure adventure story - perfectly told. The second section is more internal, a little slow and a little long. Taken together they bring to life a few hardy Americans just before and during the American revolution.This novel is for you if you are interested in: American revolutionary history, adventure stories, American Indians, good writing skills, books that read quickly and last longer than a night or two.This book gets 4 stars only as a way to differentiate it from \\"Arundel\\" by Mr. Roberts which, in my opinion, is a 5 star book."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"I received this book on time and its condition is excellent. The book is clean, the cover is new, not a mark on the book. Great."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"This tale, cast as a memoir by a fictional acquaintance of the historical Robert Rogers who gained fame in colonial America for creating and leading \\"Rogers' Rangers,\\" is lengthy but compellingly told, especially in its first part. As others have noted, the first section, which recounts how young Langdon Towne, an aspiring artist from New England, finds himself on the run from local authorities and thrust into the arms of the Rangers is fast paced, vivid and exciting narration. Towne and a companion soon end up enlisted in the Rangers on the eve of their departure for the Indian town of St. Francis where French-supported Indians who have been terrorizing the New England colonists are based. Under the spying eyes of French and Indian scouts in the latter years of the French and Indian War, Rogers' Rangers depart the British stronghold of Crown Point and, led by the indomitable Rogers, succeed in making the lengthy and difficult passage in secret to St. Francis where, in a surprise attack, they slaughter the Indians dwelling there. The return home to safety turns out to be the real challenge though as Major Rogers must herd and cozzen his failing and soon starving troops back to New England via a different path in order to avoid retaliation by the French and Indians of Canada.The long trek back nearly kills them all though many finally get through thanks only to the unyielding will and capacity for outthinking his opponents that Major Rogers reveals, thus gaining the hero worship of young Langdon Towne and others in their company. Toward the end of the journey back, nearly starved and dead, it is Rogers who manages the final leg to bring back help for what remain of his men and, in so doing, he earns the undying gratitude of the colonials and the British Army itself. But Rogers is a man who needs action and who dreams big and he has begun to think of something that only the boldest have dreamt of, finding the Northwest Passage through North America to the shores of Japan and China. Young Langdon returns to his hometown of Kittery, a coastal settlement northeast of Massachussetts, to take up his old life which he finds no easy task, under the circumstances. Still, despite the respect he has now earned from his neighbors, he eventually decides to pursue his artistic inclinations and, disappointed in love, finally takes ship for England. The second part of the tale is rich in the London of the period as young Towne works to earn his living as a painter so that he can one day return to America to paint Indians. But Rogers shows up in London, too, and before long they have resumed their former close relationship with Towne hero worshipping the great man. Rogers is working to get support from the English aristocratic class and, especially, from the king himself, for the expedition to discover the Northwest Passage and promises to take Langdon Towne with him when he goes.Meanwhile, Towne is enlisted in a task laid on him by Rogers' personal secretary, one Natty Potter, to find the lost daughter of the secretary's disparate youth. In a complex series of events, Rogers seems to get what he is after, all the while drinking heavily and carousing with the London upper crust, while Langdon, through Rogers' good offices, achieves some respectability as an artist himself. Returning to the Americas, his relationship with Rogers restored, Langdon Towne affiliates himself with the larger than life adventurer once more and soon finds himself in Michilimakinac, at the juncture of the Great Lakes where Rogers means to establish himself and branch out from there to discover the elusive Northwest Passage. But things don't go as smoothly as the relatively simple operation that destroyed St. Francis had and Rogers soon finds himself embroiled in a political battle with the influential Sir William Johnson, His Majesty's Indian Agent (and friend of the Iroquois Confederation), who aims to retain a monopoly on the Indian trade at all costs. Rogers' plans get in the way of Johnson's objectives and the two are set on a collision course.There is as rich a detailing of wilderness life in this part of the book as in the first half though we never see the Indians themselves in any great depth. But the narrative threads are less taut as the tale shifts from one of adventure against deadly adversity to the complex interactions of numerous personalities against the backdrop of the Johnson-Rogers feud over Indian control. In the end the forceful and energetic Rogers is undone by the subtler and more cunning Johnson (aided and abetted by the shortsightedness of Rogers' own supporters in London who tie his hands rather than fund his plans, to which they have supposedly signed on) and all of the major's dreams come crashing down upon him. A lately discovered betrayal by the major of his young protege's personal interests turns Langdon Towne against Rogers too, as he soon sets out to rescue his damsel-in-distress, spirited away from him to Montreal.The rest of the novel brings Towne at last back to London and his lady love -- and, surprisingly, Rogers, too, though the latter is no longer in the condition or state in which he had once been wont to appear. Eliciting Towne's sympathetic assistance in a Debtor's Prison in London, Rogers wins back at least a modicum of his old friend's loyalty, albeit without the same level of respect, and the two part again, Towne to become the artist he had dreamed of being and Rogers to move onto other ventures and unachievable dreams. With the onset of the Revolutionary War, Rogers returns yet again, though now on the wrong side as far as the colonists are concerned for he is still serving the British. But the man, whatever his skills on the battlefield in guerrilla war has become but a shadow of his former self and so the story fades with the fading of Major Robert Rogers himself.Kenneth Roberts has penned a worthy novel which strikes true to the historical record and populates his pages with vividly drawn characters, not least of whom is the larger than life Robert Rogers. That the historical Rogers ended up on the wrong side in the Revolutionary War goes a long way toward explaining why his name and fame largely faded from America's historical record.Stuart W.

Surely if other K Roberts books are in print this one should be! This was one of my favorite novels in high school - I have read it several times since and enjoyed it as much each time!"},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's finest writers of historical fiction- mainly because he actually really knew the history into which he placed his fictional characters.\\"Northwest Passage\\" is arguably his most popular work, and its Book I was made into a pretty good 1940 movie with Robert Young as the fictional Langdon Towne and Spencer Tracy as the legendary Robert Rogers. (I must admit that everytime I read Rogers' dialogue in \\"Northwest Passage\\" I hear the voice of Spencer Tracy.) Anyway \\"Northwest Passage,\\" the novel, is actually made up of two very different books.Book I is one of the finest pieces of historical fiction that I have ever read. It's the story of Rogers' Rangers attack on the Abenaki Indian village of St. Francis during the French and Indian War. The story revolves around a fictional character, Langdon Towne, an upper middle class lad who wants to become a great artist by painting \\"true life\\" subjects such as Indians. Fleeing a dispute with local crooked politicians, Towne joins Major Rogers and his Rangers on the eve of their departure for St. Francis. What happens next is a thrilling story. Roberts' descriptions of the northern New England terrain, the agony of fatigue and starvation, and the gruesome depiction of the barbaric nature of war are stunning to read. Also amazing is the depiction of Major Rogers as seen through the worshipful eyes of Towne. The reader will finish Book I with a heroic image of Rogers as an indefatigable, courageous, clever tactician and born leader.Book II, though, is a disappointment. Of course, it is very understandable that Book II is a let down, since Book I can hardly be topped as a historical adventure. Roberts' spends most of Book II tearing down the heroic image of Rogers that he built-up in Book I. Alcohol, debt, political enemies, a bad marriage, and his own vices reduce Rogers to a rather pathetic character. Book II also suffers from a lack of focus- we follow Towne as he develops into a famous painter from New England, to England, to the Upper Great Lakes, to Canada, back to England, and then to New England. Unlike Book I, which dealt with just a few short months of time, Book II is all over the place. However, the biggest problem with Book II is that nothing really happens in it- just Rogers' long decline and Towne's search for fulfillment.Finally, Kenneth Roberts' books usually contain some extremely well developed and strong female characters, but \\"Northwest Passage\\" is lacking in this department. The interesting character of Jennie Coit disappears quickly. And Anne Potter, who had the possibility to be extremely interesting, is just too thinly drawn.\\"Northwest Passage's\\" Book I is a terrific piece of historical fiction. I cannot speak more highly of it. However, Book II drags, and is really only interesting in that illustrates what happens to the characters introduced in Book I. Book II is actually just a very long and detailed epilogue to Book I."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts' &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; is one of the great novels of the 1930's. Little remembered now, it is the story of Major Robert Rogers and the early Rangers of the French and Indian War. Most of the book is an accurate description of what occured during that time period, and one gets an incredible feel for the hardships and calamities that befall these men. The book is written in the first person as the narrator is one of the Major's trusted associates; the story involves both men and their lives together in the wilderness and much later when their paths cross once again near the end of the 18th Century. Rogers himself commanded the first real &quot;commando&quot; unit and he is the father of all subsequent outfits like the Green Berets, the Navy Seals etc. Kenneth Roberts was one of the great historical fiction writers of his day and anyone who is interested in this time period would be wise to read this book. It is truly a classic."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts was one of America's best-known nonfiction magazine writers back during the heyday of the Saturday Evening Post. One of his best-known articles was a profile of Hitler following the Beer Hall Putsch, which became a book in its own right at a time when no one in America knew who Hitler was.Beginning in the mid-1930s, Roberts wrote a series of brilliant but erratic historical novels about America in the late 1700s, set in his beloved Maine or in neighboring Boston and Portsmouth, NH. \\"Northwest Passage\\" (which was serialized by the Post) was his masterpiece and the most popular book in America for two years during the 1930s, although it's barely remembered today (or, if remembered, known only as the source for a mediocre Spencer Tracy movie of the same name).The book is the story of a real person, Major Robert Rogers, a miltary leader from pre-Revolutionary America whose unit, Rogers' Rangers, was America's first to fight \\"Indian-style\\" (in other words, to fight battles the way we fight them today). Rogers' great success in warfare led to him becoming one of the colonies' first published authors, a star in London, and later the royal governor of Michilimackinac (the fort at the tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan ... and the land westward), but his unwillingness to join with pluderers who wanted to loot the British and colonial treasuries in the name of the Crown led to his arrest and unwarranted disgrace ... and to his ultimate decision to side with the British during the American Revolution, like Roberts' other main hero, Benedict Arnold (\\"Arundel\\" and \\"Rabble in Arms\\").This novel is made up of two very different but intricately-plotted books. Book 1, which ranges in place from Harvard College to the British Army during the French and Indian Wars and the New England art world, tells the story of a young man, Langdon Towne, who becomes Rogers' personal secretary during Rogers' Rangers' expedition to destroy the town of St. Francis, home of the native group most hostile to the New England settlers. Book 2, which begins in London, crosses back to upstate Michigan and the Dakota lands, and then returns to London, tells the story of Towne's advancement as an artist and his involvement with Rogers' plan to discover the Northwest Passage.The reason that this book rates 4 stars instead of 5 has to do with a writing issue that must be mentioned. Roberts' friend Booth Tarkington served as \\"editor\\" of the first three-quarters of the book, and the Roberts-Tarkington prose is stellar. However, under severe time pressure to finish the second half of the book (due to its smash-hit status), Roberts wrote the last quarter without Tarkington's help, and the change in writing quality is jarring -- especially as it comes right during the most historically-important and dramatically-important section of the book, Rogers' betrayal by his Northwest Passage expedition commanders and by his British and American enemies. Roberts had offered Tarkington co-writing credit, which Tarkington refused, but this justaposition of styles shows just how critical Tarkington's help was. The plot continues smoothly, though, even if the writing doesn't.One more point: in researching and writing this book, Roberts uncovered (after two years of searching, and just before publication of Book 2) the actual court-marshal transcripts of the two court-marshals with which Rogers was involved, which were believed to have been destroyed by Rogers' enemies -- and both supported Roberts' sympathetic treatment of Rogers. Thus, not only was this book incredibly popular, but it was significant for historical research as well. What more can you ask from one book?"},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"I first discovered Northwest Passage at a library while I was still in high school, and ever since then I have been a confirmed Kenneth Roberts fan. His ability to bring the frontier and its characters alive is uncanny and unmatched by any other author I've ever read. His research into the foods, weapons, country and historical events he writes about is unparalleled, and each character in all of of his novels seems so real it sometimes becomes diffcult to determine if they were real or not. Mingling real-life historical figures such as George Washington, Benedict Arnold and others, with fictional characters such as Steven Nason, Cap Huff, and other truly unforgettable creations, lends them a credibility that results in history coming alive. One's understanding of historical events and people that have become blase' over the years is competely turned upside down and inside out as you gain new insight and understanding of what happened, why it happened and what it meant through Roberts' masterful writing backed up by exhaustive research into his subjects and events. The characters not only are drawn larger than life in all their strengths and weaknesses, but as they move through several of Roberts' novels and are observed and encountered differently when viewed from different perspectives, we begin to realize that history is not static but is dynamic and alive. Example: RABBLE IN ARMS and OLIVER WISWELL are both books about the American Revolution, but written from diametrically opposite viewpoints ! RABBLE IN ARMS follows the struggle of the colonists to free themselves from England's grip as envisioned from the rebellious colonists' perspective, while OLIVER WISWELL is about the very same events written from the perspective of a Loyalist; many of the very same characters populate both novels, but the view one gets of them is so different from one to the other of the books that it hardly seems as if at first they are about the same thing. Additionally, OLIVER WISWELL is an outstanding exploration of the Loyalist cause and why they believed we would all be better off to remain loyal subjects of England.I've read all of Roberts' books, and have a first edition of OLIVER WISWELL purchased for $3.00 from a used bookstore with an original newspaper review that had been tucked inside the book by the original purchaser. The review is of the novel itself, and after reading that review from more than 60 years ago, it is very apparent over the years the very high and well-deserved reputation of Roberts has not diminished.My recommendation is: read them. Read them all !! You will never find finer writing or an author with a keener appreciation of his subject matter and the period about which he writes than Kenneth Roberts. All of Roberts' books should be reprinted, again and again, as they were when they were first published (check the frontispieces to see how many times his novels have been re-printed over the years --- it's astounding!). Every person who reads Roberts becomes a devotee and a reader for life, and every one to whom you loan a copy of any of his novels will then be someone with whom you can share the pure pleasure of having read a Kenneth Roberts novel, and there are many of us out there. Welcome to the astounding, incredible world that will soon be at your fingertips!"},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"Northwest Passage:Kenneth Roberts was the premier historical fiction author of his day. What starts out as a simple French and Indian War tale of a daring raid on the St. Francis Indian village by Major Robert Rogers, eventually spans North America, Europe and the Mediterranean. Roberts' descriptions of wilderness warfare and survival bespeak his excruciatingly thorough research and knowledge of eighteenth century America, to the point where you might wonder if he was actually there. His battle scenes are unsparingly violent and brutal, even by today's standards, but the whole novel is infused with a quaint romanticism, that is usually avoided in modern literature. In Robert's works, warfare is bloody, and politics unsavory, but noble spirits and strong hearts prevail. Anyone who likes historical fiction, art history, or adventure travel, would do well to start with Northwest Passage."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"Kenneth Roberts is my favorite novelist so this review may be somewhat biased, but Northwest Passage truly is a book people should read. It is gripping, a book I had a difficult time setting down. Roberts had a style that was unique in that the reader can many times feel the sensations he is describing. When the soldiers were hungy and were failing at hunting, Roberts could create a sensation of hunger and frustration. When he described the streets of London, the reader feels like he/she is actually there.This book is wonderful. It's full of lively, intelligent characters and solid story plots. It is as good a represtation of colonial America as was ever done in the form of a novel. Hopefully it will remain a timeless classic forever."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"As a history buff, Revolutionary War reenactor and New Englander, I was interested in reading about this author who I'd never heard of from my area. Although this story is historical fiction, the events mentioned (and many of the characters) are real. The amount of detail the author was able to put in this book is staggering. Once you start reading this story you will be dragged into the daily struggles of the many characters. In addition, you'll better understand the trials of the native Americans and how they suffered and were taken advantage of. There was a 1940 movie by the same name starring Spencer Tracy which follows the book pretty closely. Unfortunately the movie only takes in the first half of the book. Since reading this book, I have read 4 other historical novels by Kenneth Roberts and enjoyed each one. He is a prolific writer and has taken great pains to portray the events and their details in an easy reading style. Sit down with this book on a snowy evening in front of your fire and be transported back to the 18th century. You won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"I was fourteen years old when a family friend gifted me on my birthday with Rabble in Arms in Hungarian translation. It took no little trouble and risk to locate other works by Roberts in Communist controlled Hungary. Northwest Passage was the second book by Roberts I read and this as well as all other works in Roberts 'Chronicles of Arundel' series sold me on the US. Northwest Passage is the story of revenge within the framework of the French and Indian War, a fantastic account of courage, endurance and heroism. It is also the story of one man, Major Robert Rogers; one man's life at its zenith, as he relentlessly inspires his men to superhuman performance; also at its nadir, as he descendes into debauchery, debt, and succumbs to disease. The narrator, Langdon Towne, aspiring artist, only matters insofar as he is the one,(in first person, as many of Roberts' protagonists do,) who tells the story. His viewpoint is that of a participant, not an outside observer, and this makes the story come alive even more than it otherwise would have.It is one of Roberts' masterful works. It lost nothing in translation although I consider myself fortunate to have many of Roberts' works in their first editions.It is my uderstanding that Roberts' works had been translated into over 52 languages. If any of those translation are as well done as the Hungarian version Roberts should be a universally celebrated and rewarded author.Northwest Passage is true classic. Even though the movie with Spencer Tracy now seems obsolete this deserves a remake that should closely follow the book. I wouldn't recommend changing anything just go by the book. I sure would go and see it. As it is I have the book and have enjoyed reading and rereading it over the many years."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"I've spent a lot of time on the history surrounding the actual events of Rogers Rangers raid on the Abenaki village of Odanak in 1758. But here is a book that throws back the curtain and hurls us out the window into the midst of 18th Century America and Britain.This is simply one of the finest historical novels out there; closely rivalling LeGrand Cannon's Look To the Mountain. Good historical escapist fun and drama."},{"Title":"Northwest passage","review":"Somehow I only recently got around to reading Northwest Passage, even though it is better known and deals with an earlier period in American history than than the Roberts novels on which I started, such as Arundel and Oliver Wiswell. I'm glad I waited.Other reviewers have commented on the differences between the first and second halves of the novel. Not only are they stylistic, but the scope of the story widens dramatically in part 2. Here's where reading NWP out of order helped, though, because the other novels created a context that made the dramatic shifts more understandable than they might have been otherwise.Without giving any spoilers, all of Roberts' usual themes are here, including betrayal, corruption, and a fairly cynical attitude towards women.All in all, great, thrilling stuff, of a type that isn't really done any longer. Enjoy."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I've been reading this book to learn PHP and it is undoubtedly the best book for beginners you're going to find. I've been trying to learn PHP since version 3 (yea, finally there is a book that I can understand). If you're new to programming, and new to PHP, do not listen to people who say 'oh, just go to www.php.net'The online help manual for PHP is not geared towards beginners. It's geared towards the type of people who simply have to read the rules of a programming language and then can go and program with it effectively. Basically, it's for people who know what they're doing. They have the programming mind already. I am not that type of person and many people who are new to programming are not like that.Andy Harris' book teaches you PHP, but you will have to have a solid foundation in HTML/CSS (which I have) and it says that in the book. The only errors I've noticed in the book so far are HTML and they're nothing major. If you know HTML you'll be able to see them right off the bat and correct them for yourself (it's not like the book is $50 or something, it's just a minor inconvenience you'll only encounter maybe two or three times in the entire 12 chapter book). Also, the examples in the book are sometimes different from the ones on the CD (which implies that the CD is much more up to date than the book). Those are usually only minor changes to the code.In any case, while reading this book everything is explained and introduced in a way that is easy for me to understand. I think the way he introduces concepts is great. He doesn't simply say 'these are the rules and let me explain them' like the other books. No, he gradually works you up to them, preparing your mind. I find that this is more effective and this is a beginning programmer talking, after years of trying to find a good book. The one thing that I think is great is that this book uses examples that are relevant to what you will be programming. Too many times (back when PHP 3 and 4 came out) have I read those books that use boring examples that I'll never use (like some math formula for example). Instead, the examples in this book are challenging, yet fun and practical, and he goes over every part of the code so that you understand what each part is doing. Sometimes the examples are really big, but this isn't a problem. Even if there is an area where his explaining doesn't do it for me, if I simply go over everything in my mind and break things down on a piece of paper I'm able to understand. The only reason I'm able to understand is because the concepts have been introduced in a way that I can know what's going on. The only issue is then figuring out what a large example is doing and that's something you have to figure out for yourself. I haven't run into a problem I haven't been able to figure out so far.This book is shaping my mind into a programmer's mind. I can now see the planning involved in each program and I'm finally starting to see the method. It's a lot more effective than other books that simply give you the syntax, explain it, and then give you a problem to do without giving you relevant examples on how to use what you just learning and shaping your mind so that you'll know when each tool is effective, when you'll need to use it, and how they work in different situations. I now know the reason why I couldn't get through those books. I knew the rules, but my mind didn't know how to think like a programmer. All those so-called beginner books don't teach you that at all. Andy Haris' book does. I feel like I can go on to other programming languages now because I finally read a book that taught me the method.PHP5/MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner is not the PHP5 bible but it explains PHP5 enough so that by the time you're done you'll be able to do what you want and get out there and learn more without being intimidated. If you're a beginner to PHP5, don't waste your time with other books that won't introduce you to the mechanics of programming. Get this book!"},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I am an Absolute beginner. When I say absolute I mean it. My education was spent in the history department and reading through texts written centuries ago. I took my last math class as a college freshman and only in the past couple of years opened up a web design program and got to learning html.Programming is an entirely foreign world for me. It is an entirely foreign way of thinking for me. I can happily write twenty or more pages on some obscure incident in the late Roman Empire but show me a bit of code and my brain fogs over.This being the case I found Andy Harris' book to be exceptionally helpful. He takes you step by step, explaining key concepts and vocabulary, inserting bits of humor and the occasional tangent, keeping the lessons fresh.The first seven chapters deal more directly with the basics of PHP. The rest deal mostly with MySQL.I got into PHP through my wrestling with Wordpress, and my interest in working with other CMS systems for an education environment. Underlying these great open source programs are PHP and MySQL. Harris' book, then, serves as a wonderful foundation for my pursuits as I move past being an absolute beginner.It may not be appropriate for those with a stronger foundation in programming, but then the title should give that away. There are the very occasional errors in the code, but these are fixed in the provided CD, so it gives a person experience in discovering how to fix broken code, another great lesson. As most of the errors in the code come from my own mistakes, not the book's, getting good at comparing my work with the cd is a useful lesson indeed.Because of this book I am no longer an absolute beginner but instead someone able to both develop new projects and work much more effectively with established open source programs.

For people (like some of the more recent reviewers) who do have programming experience in PHP or other programming languages, I imagine this book would be remedial as it covers basic programming concepts (which are the same in all programming language) like variables, loops, and arrays, in great detail. For the complete Novice, this is excellent. For the experienced, I'm sure this feels like a waste of time--but really--what can you expect from a book that says in its title \\"For the Absolute Beginner\\".As it is titled \\"For the Absolute Beginner\\" and IS indeed for that type of person, I have no complaints whatsoever. And the other reviewer who said \\"The Code is outdated\\" is incorrect. PHP 5 is currently the latest version of PHP, and this book covers PHP 5. I've yet to have a piece of code not execute from this book (except when I mess up the coding...)I'd highly recommend this book for a person with no real programming experience. I myself was 'hobbyist' programmer in BASIC fiften years ago...and this was an EXCELLENT book to remind me of all the things I had long forgotten as I delved into writing PHP and using MySQL.There are TONS of topics and coding that is not covered here, but hey...for absolute beginner...this is THE PLACE TO START. After digesting this book, I would recommend going over to Jason Gilmore's \\"Beginning PHP 5 & MySQL\\". I purchased Jason's book first...was utterly lost...and then purchased this one. Now, after understanding these concepts much better, Jason's book makes MUCH more sense...and is a great resource in my PHP library."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I was a little scared about other people comments, but I decided to buy the book and give a try, thanks God!... I did it,I have learned so much with this book, if I can give 10 stars I will, hoping the author continue making books like this in a series, excellent work."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book is awesome for someone who is just beginning to learn PHP. Probably the best intro book I've ever read. The examples and concepts are explained very clearly. It is also easy to follow.I am also a student in the department where Mr. Harris teaches, and I've taken a number of distributed education courses where he is the instructor on the videos. He's a great instructor and has been helpful to me when I've emailed him. If anybody is in the area, I'd highly recommend that you take one of his courses. The videos compliment what he talks about in his books."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"While the concept of a book for \\"absolute beginners\\" is great, it seems the author has skimped out on spending actual effort in writing the book. There are a few gems and insights, but the vast majority of passages include obvious bromides, such as a whole paragraph wasted on the real-world tip: \\"don't include your real password if you share your code for mysql_db_connect.\\"Despite its title, the book only spends a short chapter on actual integration of php and mysql--and it doesn't even broach up the suppression operator (@mysql_connect(l,u,p) OR die('can't connect to mysql')). Moreover, the XML/PHP part is too brief.In the file chapter, the guy implies that using file saving methods isn't efficient because in a real-world website, two users might write to the same file at once--thus, he won't spend much time talking about files, but will broach up more on multiple-user access in the XML chapter... which he seems to have forgotten (or did he expect us to waste $30 on a book just to go back to the easy-to-install php nuke system instead of actually designing our own functional CMS system allowing for multiple user file writes).The code snipplets include a number of typo'ed functions (as do the text descriptions following them). Moreover, a lot of functions are used without adequate explanation. The book expects you to read through the documentation on php.net or to suffer through countless hours of frustration trying to get the exact code to work.I'd say that this book is good to skim over (say, 20 minutes) if you don't know how to program. If you trust the guy's code snipplets and attempt to learn from those, then... may the author's non-existent errata help you.If you disagree with any of this and have actually read the book, please contact me via jackline.hunter at gmail dot com."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"Andy Harris has written a gem of a book. He is clearly an educator who has thought about how to teach programming. This book takes you step by step through php, introducing excellent examples and adding to them as the book moves along. This is a good text to use as an instructor or it would be great for self study. Clearly the best beginning book on the subject.While the book covers php and mysql from the beginning, it would help if the reader had a background in html, css and some programming."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This is an excellent book for the beginner. It steps you through the functions and has good sample code. I really recommend this book."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I decided to go to a bookstore and by a book on php. I decided to buy php 5 /MySQL programming from Andy Harris, I found that it's easy to read but had trouble getting the projects to run. In chapter 2 pg. The border Maker does displays the .html page but when i press submit it does'nt do anything, ive been running the .html files that are included in the CD, and some of them do not seem to work correctly. Im using MAMP on my mac. In chapter 3 there is a program called responding to checkboxes, i wrote the code and it ran on the web but when i pressed the submit button it linked to the .php page that should display the results,they showed part of the code but the most important thing , the values from the variable where missing ....... I tried running the code from the CD and the same thing happened. I was getting frustrated because i want to learn I decided to give it another chance, and on chapter 4 loops and arrays i ran the poker dice program and it didnt work right. Everytime i hit the submit button the page kind of refreshed and nothing happened, in the program you are supposed to use cash everytime you roll the dices, after hitting the submit button i stil had 100 cash which is the amount of money that you start with. I finally gave up at page 96. I dont know what's up. I'm thinking that the code is too old or the server configuration that andy used for the the programs is not compatible with the one im using. I gave up on andy's book, ihave PHP solutions from David Powers on the way. Hopefully he can help me learn php and mysql."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"Not knowing a thing about php, I got this book with some others. This book turned out to be the one for a beginner. There was only one snag which was that when I installed the apache and MySQL it did not work. This may be because I installed it in Win 7.I reinstall this with instruction from another Web Site and everyone began to click.This is the book for beginners, there is no doubt about it. This will give you the foundation, the ABC of the process of using php.PHP was mind boggling to me because other books which I tried to use began at a very high level of the coding. This made the whole thing easy because of giving the very foundation and building up very slowly. Undoubtedly the author told the truth when he titled as being for the Absolute Beginner."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I am an experienced programmer and I wanted to learn PHP, so I got this book. I use Apache 2.2 and PHP 5.2.17. Well, where to begin. Some (many) of the examples on the disk are unlike the ones in the book. Second, the author uses &lt;?...?> to indicate the code that is PHP (to be processed by PHP). When I use that, nothing happens. I have to use &lt;?php (as every refereence on line says). And thirdly some code just doesn't run at all and emits errors. For instance (and there are others), persistence.php: When I run it I get this:Notice: Undefined variable: txtBoxCounter in C:\\\\usr\\\\web\\\\persistence.php on line 14Notice: Undefined variable: hdnCounter in C:\\\\usr\\\\web\\\\persistence.php on line 15There are many more like it. Perhaps if the book were corrected it might be OK to get."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book is the best. As I read it I clearly understood all I had in my head for my new web site. It is simple and there is a lot of useful examples. Thank you!"},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"The authors writing style leaves a lot to be desired. He's hard to understand sometimes. He uses a game to illustrate the concepts of PHP & understanding the game was more difficult than the code. It's not bad - it's just OK. I'd recommend Charles Wyke-Smith \\"Codin for the Web\\" for a clear explanation of rudimentary PHP MySQL concepts with real world examples - not stupid games."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"This book is physically easy for me to read. It is clearly written and helpful for me as a rank beginner in PHP programming. The reader needs some background in programming with HTML and CSS."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"The book seems to do an OK job of getting the major points across, but I would have liked to see a clearer progression of information with a separate section for a quick reference. I like the CD with the code available to use. That is a valuable asset for the book."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"When it comes to programming, Mac users appear to be at a disadvantage. However, with a little research via the internet, I've been able to take advantage of the programming material that is mostly geared towards Windows. This book is no exception. The most difficult part of the process is getting PHP and MySQL set up and that has nothing to do with this book! A quick search on the internet shows that a lot of people have this problem.Initially, I thought there were some problems with the code, but I always discovered that is was MY code, not what was written in the book. It's very easy to forget a semi-colon or a bracket or even a period and not see it even after carefully re-checking. (It can help to print it out instead of trying to read it from the screen.) Personally, I think programming can be quite dull, especially for someone who enjoys \\"design.\\" But, that's part of what makes this book good, it does incorporate design and it uses concepts that are actually fun. I'm still learning, but I'm enjoying the process and I can't wait to start using some of things I've learned on my own website."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"My son was looking for an introduction to web development, and I couldn't think of a better place than PHP with which to start.I found the author's writing style very enjoyable - and was particularly impressed by his choice of example programs. For instance, the chapter on databases introduces concepts using an adventure game!The only problem I had was the lightweight treatment of Content Management Systems (in particular the discussion of PHP-Nuke), which ended up being much too generic to be of use.However, that doesn't really detract from the quality of the rest of the book, which is highly recommended."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"The author Andy Harris comes across as a very nice guy in this book and he really is trying hard to think on a beginner level, but this book simply is not designed for someone with no programming experience. I have gone through many PHP books (as well as other programming language books) labeled \\"beginner\\" and it seems that none are able to truly grasp what a newbie to programming is going through. I ran into several errors in the book and, alas, there is no accompanament website that lists errata. NEVER purchase a book that does not have a frequently updated accopanying website.There are some good things that you can pick up from this book, but if you rely on it for your sole introduction to PHP than you will go insane. I recommend finding a programming mentor -either in real life or online- and searching for peices of the puzzle on the internet. A great place to start is simply www.PHP.net."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"Firstly, there are no clarifications for Mac OS X users (who have the advantage of having Apache already installed).Secondly, I was told in a PHP forum that the code in this book is outdated, thus the reason why I can't get any of them to work. Mind you, when I copy and paste coding from online sources, they work fine; So I know my PHP is working. the code is bad.Finally, while I enjoy reading from a book better than from screen, I have found the tutorials at http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/627infinitely more helpful. Their code has comments telling you exactly what each segment of it does. Their pace and progression is better.My advice would be to make sure that the book you want to buy was written recently, and not an updated version of an older book. Look for books that the code is prominent and well explained. But online tutorials abound."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"In 428 pages, the book barely moves past control structures. I learned very little from this book and not enough for a functional php/mysql website. Functions are not explained well and very few are included. The author uses old and bad coding practices.As far as the PHP parts go, online tutorials have been more helpful. The title implies that the book is not only about PHP but ALSO largly about MySQL. It only touches on MySQL.This book was useless. I had trouble installing PHP and MySQL despite the book's instructions. The software on the CD is not usable if you want the most recent versions. The coding on the CD did not all work correctly and was incomplete."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"Totally asinine book. Apparently you cannot use php without dealing with a webserver. But if you know how to deal with a webserver, then how are you an absolute beginner when it comes to programming webpages? The cover of the book says \\"NO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED\\". That is an absolute lie. If you are an absolute beginner when it comes to web programming, i.e., you were born before 1990, you'd be better off adding 1 cent to the $29.99 publisher's retail price of this book buying yourself 30 lottery tickets and using any money you win to pay a programmer to do what you hoped you could use this book to learn how to do. Risking your money with the lottery would give you a better chance of getting something accomplished than trying to make sense of this book would. I wanted to design a website with a presidential election game, but I think I'll stick with biology and history- things that I understand."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"Unfortunately this book, despite its best efforts, falls flat on its face when it comes to teaching php. I am a beginner to the language and I ordered the book recently to begin teaching myself. The code in the book did not work at all, even when I uploaded the pages stored on the CD rom directly to my site they didn't work properly, which let me know that even though I'm new to the language the errors weren't my fault. The script is incomplete and poorly written, as told to me by professional web site authors I know. It lacks the most important parts of the script to make them work and if you're on your own you won't be able to figure out why it isn't working, unless you find the answer in a forum or something. I recommend this book instead,PHP 6 and MySQL 5 for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide. The code in this book actually works and any errors are insignificant plus have corrections online at the author's site. Don't make the same mistake I did in buying this book. It will just disappoint you and waste your money."},{"Title":"PHP 5 / MySQL Programming for the Absolute Beginner","review":"I have used many different books and resources to learn programming languages and this seris is by far the best I have ever used."},{"Title":"The Revolutionary Guide to Win32 Programming Using Visual C++","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be an extensive guide to Win32 API programming as the title suggested.

The results were exactly like my first generationgrandmothers cooking long ago. If you want authentic this is the book to follow."},{"Title":"The art of Irish cooking","review":"Warning: this cookbook is so good that people will borrow it and you will never see it again! I was pleased to find an inexpensive replacement on Amazon, as apparently it has become fairly collectible in some quarters. It is my understanding that Sheridan was known for bringing the joy of cooking back to Ireland after years of austerity and frugality during the war. Being of Irish descent, these recipes are homey, familiar and comforting. If you are not, it doesn't matter. Irish peas (fresh peas with fresh butter, mint and a little sugar) should be on everyone's plate... mmmmm. For some novice cooks the recipes might be a bit difficult to follow in spots. Sheridan assumes a certain basic level of cooking skill that some young and/or inexperienced cooks don't necessarily have in this day and age. For example, a recipe may say \\"put X in pan\\" and the reader is supposed to automatically know to first heat the pan, place oil in the pan once hot and slice up the ingredient before adding to the pan. It's not too frequent though, and most people should be able to figure little things like this out. As far as the seller, (anyone know how to review someone's Amazon store?) the book arrived days before the anticipated due date, had the \\"free shipping w/ $25 total Amazon purchase\\" option even though I did not have to buy the remaining $25 of qualifying merch from this seller, the book was packed with care and was in the condition described-- YAY! Excellent all around."},{"Title":"You're Probably an Old Geezer If...","review":"Exactly what you would expect from a book with this title, &quot;You're Probably an Old Geezer if...&quot; is full of short observations about old age put in a humorous light. Of course some of the comments are funnier than others, but generally it is a source of a good laugh at old age. &quot;You're Probably an Old Geezer if...&quot; is a recommended book for anyone who wants to see the funny side of getting older."},{"Title":"You're Probably an Old Geezer If...","review":"1. Very slow delivery by USPS \\"because it is a book\\"2.

LeGuin. All of the stories have cats as their primary theme.This anthology's 213 pages contain 13 stories by the following authors: Fritz Leiber, Michael Bishop, Tanith Lee, Isaac Asimov, Ward Moore, Lucius Shepard, Lilian Jackson Braun, Pamela Sargent, Ursula K. LeGuin, R.V. Branham, John Collier, and Avram Davidson.I particularly enjoyed Lucius Shephard's short story \\"The Jaguar Hunter\\" about a Central American villager and hunter of Jaguars. The story is about the encroachment of urban life on the small town village. It had an incredible integration of Central American Indian themes that I really enjoyed. I want to say more, but I'm afraid I might give away the story.Avram Davidson's story \\"Duke Pasquale's Ring\\" is set in his alternate 18th century universe of Doctor Englebert Esterhazy and includes witchcraft, aristocracy and, of course, a cat! Avram Davidson is well known for his amazing ability to create a rich background and convincing language.I highly recommend this fun little anthology.Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan"},{"Title":"Freedom on the Menu: the Greensboro Sit-Ins","review":"As a teacher assistant and Sunday school teacher, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read this book to my seven and 8-year-old Sunday school class and they really enjoyed the pictures and the message given. I live in North Carolina not to far from where the sit-ins took place and it's nice to be able to read about something that has happen within your community and the positive outcome that happened.The book was very well written by Carol Weatherford not so much that only an older child could read it but I felt that even a younger child could understand the language with guidance.This book has been added to my collection for Black History month."},{"Title":"Freedom on the Menu: the Greensboro Sit-Ins","review":"The civil rights movement was pivotal in our history, this should not have to be stated. However, most students learn about it only in passing, as the history curriculum in schools still tends to end just after WWII. Even treating this through picture books is better than that.This book, featuring a young girl whose socially active brother and sister participated in the sit-ins, signed people up to vote, and got arrested for their troubles, takes a good look at the Greensboro sit-ins. I like how the main character acts like a real child - she's proud of her siblings, yes, but she also wants them to stop protesting and stay home and be safe. She's eight years old, and, given the wordiness of the book, that's probably about the right age for the reader.The artwork is pretty enough, but it would have been better on a larger book. When sitting with a kid in your lap reading with the light dim for bedtime, they end up looking a bit muddled."},{"Title":"Freedom on the Menu: the Greensboro Sit-Ins","review":"My boys loved this book. It was written so that kids can easily understand what sit ins meant and how to handle a situation without aggression. All parents should read this book to their kids. This book should be a required reader for all teachers."},{"Title":"Freedom on the Menu: the Greensboro Sit-Ins","review":"I used this story as part of a unit that I taught to my 4th-graders. They loved it and it presented this slice of history at a level my students could understand. I loved the way the characters were portrayed - strong, calm and very family-oriented."},{"Title":"Freedom on the Menu: the Greensboro Sit-Ins","review":"My 7 year old read this as one of his weekly reading assignments and found it hardto believe that there were rules again being able to eat lunch at a store or that certainpeople were denied the right to sit at a lunch counter. He had to write a report aboutwhy this happened and ways people can combat injustice and it really caused him to think.Another great selection any time of the year, but especially for all kids during Black Historymonth. It shows the history of entire families getting involved in fighting for civil rights. Ithelps kids recognize that even little kids can play a role in changing history or doing somethingabout practices that are wrong or unfair. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"The New Palladini deck was recommended to me by a fellow working at our local new age store--he said it was their hottest seller and his personal favorite. While my personal favorites remain the Cosmic Tribe and Thoth decks, I still have to say that the Palladini deck is in a class of its own. I don't believe I've ever seen richer, deeper colors in any deck. So many decks, like the Rider-Waite, have very washed out pale colors in comparison. Additionally, there is a great uniformity and cohesion in these cards which makes them work well together in creating a holistic, alternate world. Despite the artistic uniformity of the deck, there is no sense of repetition or redundancy.The symbolism is traditional yet fresh, very intuitive and easy to grasp. This is truly THE ideal deck for beginners--I really wish it had been my first deck. It has such a positive energy, and a simplicity that doesn't seem simple. My two favorite decks above, I've noticed, are intimidating to some people. The New Palladini deck seems to have much wider appeal. If you love Tarot decks, there is little chance this deck will disappoint you."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"I was first drawn to the Palladini deck after seeing some of the cards on the internet. For those of you who find the Raider-Waite deck a bit antiquated, you will probably find the modern art style and imagery much more accessable. The deck makes use of images and people of many cultures, very useful for those of us from an eclectic tradition. I was giving very accurate readings with this deck inside of a month, using single-card divinations and large spreads such as the celtic cross. At first the cards seem plain, without a lot of the detail in something like the Thoth deck, which is good for a beginner. They can focus on the big picture and let the story unfold. But there is plenty of detail in the cards. Every time I look at them I see something new. The deck is well balanced gender-wise. The King and Queen cards of each suit seem like equals. The card backs are symmetrical, and each card is clearly labelled, though you don't need to see the words to tell what the card is, thanks to the excellent artwork."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"I just purhased The New Palladini Tarot Deck and book set, and I couldn't be happier. Being new to reading tarot cards I couldn't believe how deep and moving my first read was! The art work is stunning.

I was especially drawn to it because it is an authentic rendering of the Waite tarot images in a much more pleasing form. It is simply gorgeous! The images are vibrant and colorful. They stay with me and even seem to speak their message. I love it."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"I love this tarot deck and book set. The cards are a nice size and feel good in the hand. The back of the cards have two infinity snakes on them in a dark, red background....very rich in spirit.... The cards are bursting with color and are quite beautiful to work with if you love color. The healing properties of color can be very positive and I prefer the happier, more whimsical tarot decks because they reflect my personality. I love the Aquarian tarot deck too, for these same reasons. Every card is boldly marked with its name and is breathtakingly creative and insightful. The Three of Swords presents the heart swollen and punctured...just looking at it makes your emotions swell.... The book is clear and easy to understand. I just love it !! There is wonderful information on all sorts of Tarot issues, special instruction on suggested spreads and enough explanation to give you answers without being overwhelming. It dawned on me that this set would be a fabulous gift for anyone, whether they be an experienced reader or a beginner. I find this Tarot set to be very joyful and working with it everyday is a pleasure for me."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"This is my first tarot deck as I have always been wanting to own one for a long time. I am confident to say that the revelations shown by these cards give good indication of forthcoming occurences and answers to questions that I seek. The cards are well designed with elaborate symbolism that give deeper answers to the questions put forth. One need not really be skilled in tarot to gain benefit from these cards. Using the provided introductory book as a guide with one of the suggested spreads, one can get a general idea of transpiring events by relating the cards (keywords) to the situation. All in all, these cards have given me good insight and I am very happy to have made this purchase.PS: The deck comes boxed in a decorated cardboard case (refer to picture above) along with a book that explains the basics of tarot and the intepretation of each card."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"I've been on the hunt for a tarot deck that is traditional, yet more artistic to my modern sensibilities, with a corresponding book that will also give a nice combination of traditional and more modern, or fluid meaning.

(Seeing as how tarot is such a very intuitive thing.)"},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"I've been reading tarot for thirteen years and have had many decks of all sorts. At first, the booklets and actual books that come with them really matter - you need them to make sense, be readable, and be somewhat in accord with your worldview. But these days I find that I do not need any books anymore, as I have developed my own opinions on the proper meanings of the cards. This deck, which I recently acquired, already means more to me than any other I've ever had. The art is sufficiently vivid and striking, and neither depressingly shadowy nor watercolourish and sappily cute. It is perfect, and the fact that the booklet and book are judgmental, unpleasant, and totally useless means nothing. I assert the cards! And I mercifully got rid of the books before the meanings stuck to me."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"This is the prettiest deck I own. It really should be mounted and shown off as glorious artwork. However, I get nothing out of the cards. Old Rider-Waite or (best deck) Crowley's Toth are the real working tarot cards.I love Palladini and won't part with them for the sheer exquisite joy of having such lovely images. But, for tarot readings, Crowley is the best of all decks.Please keep in mind that this is my reaction to the cards and you might be thoroughly inspired by Pallidini and not get a blip with Crowley. That's why there are so many different decks, just like models of cars. No one true deck. No one right way. This is just my reaction to Palladini. Just like the reason for different models of cars."},{"Title":"The New Palladini Tarot Deck [With Book]","review":"Great starter deck for beginners.

I love the graphic nature of the deck I have...Geometric as if Pythagorus had his hand in it...but I fear the deck you have displayed here is not of the same year.

Yes, the art work is wonderful, but that's about it. I get no energy from this deck, and it's one I haven't even used yet. I may use it in the future. Save your money, or try another deck (e.g., Morgan-Greer or Rider-Waite)."},{"Title":"Secrets from a Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This book contains some really original and exotic recipes. The ones I've tried are really good. This book however is really for those who like to cook a lot and also like to try out something new. Those who are beginner vegetarians, or looking for some basic, simple recipes should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Secrets from a Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"Unlike some exotic cookbooks, this one is simple to use, and immediately banishes any fear of the unknown realms it leads one through. The recipes are practical and turn out as they should. They are clearly written, not overwhelming and the format and photos really help readers to succeed, thus making the book practical rather than a coffeetable book.The author blends flavors in delectable ways, for example the cardammon and coconut ice-cream recipe sounded inedible to me, but the actual icecream was so delicious that I have had many requests for it. (Special gadgets and ice-cream makers were not called for in this recipe, which made it accessible to cooks with basic kitchen tools.)"},{"Title":"Hold my hand: A collection of stories and poems","review":"This book, published in 2003, is a collection of several stories and poems written by children's author Charlotte Zolotow between 1947 and 1986. A couple of the stories are a bit dark, one with an older brother who keeps trying to ditch his pesky younger sibling and another about a little girl who has to learn to deal with the constant teasing of her big brother (once she stops crying all the time, he gets bored and quits harassing her). These stories do not exist inside the magic, sanitized fairyland of happy-all-the-time stories, but for families that are going through similar issues, these are sensitive, realistic portrayals of common problems. There's a sweetness to the stories as well, and none of the stories end with hurt or hostile feelings. Parents might want to preview this book before reading it, but it's certainly worth checking out.

Then comes a poem, again it's wonderful. Then the book takes a turn for the worse. The next two stories are full of siblings teasing each other without any involvement or guidance from the parents. Definately not the model of a loving relationship between siblings! The last story seems cute at first, until you realize how good this little girl is at manipulating her clueless father. Reading that one is just asking a child to try \\"I'm not tired\\" as a means for getting to stay up late. Bleh, no thanks!I'd still recommend this book, but only for the first story and the first poem.

I just couldn't get into Barry. He was a dweeb, a doofus, a Dudley Dooright and all those other D words. He's a missionary trying to be a preacher but he just doesn't have that knack of keeping people's eyes open. At one point his congregation even tries to get rid of him. Then the Great War breaks out and Barry joins up.Barry is assigned as the battalion's chaplain, or Sky Pilot as the slang goes. Again Barry has trouble getting his butt cheeks unclenched and doesn't quite connect with his fellow soldiers. But as the war progresses and Barry has his baptism by fire, he begins to loosen up and soon becomes the most beloved man in the army.Ralph Connor was a Canadian and so in this book Canada is the Greatest Nation on Earth. Oh, America and Great Britain are blessed by God as well, while those baby-killing, women-raping Huns are the Devil incarnate. (Oddly, the French are hardly mentioned although most of the story takes place in France.)All the Anglo Saxons talk with that stiff upper lip, calling each other Old Chum or Old Boy, while things are Ripping and Keen. I hope people didn't really talk this way in real life.I'm being a bit too hard on this book, but I just didn't like Barry. He was a nerd, a nincompoop, a ninny-hammer, and all those N words. In fact, all the characters were just too unreal to form a connection to. I will say that although the pacing was rather slow in the first few chapters, the ones set in Canada, once the War starts things start picking up. The pacing, that is, not just things in general since there's a war going on.Still, for a World War I story, I would go with \\"All Quiet On The Western Front\\" for a better read."},{"Title":"The Sky Pilot in No Man's Land","review":"The Sky Pilot is a story of times gone by that we will not see again without following our call to serve the Lord in harder places without all the comforts to which we have become accustomed. It takes place in the foothills country of western Canada in the late 1890s, a country not unlike that in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana just east of the Rocky Mountains. The four chapters about Gwenn in the middle of the book are truly beautiful and were made into a tabletop book which, like The Sky Pilot, sold over a million copies in the early 1900s. Grace Livingston Hill mentions The Sky Pilot two times in \\"A Voice in The Wilderness.\\" Obviously she had read it and admired it."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"The thing with Shakespeare histories is that almost no one reads them, as opposed to his tragedies and comedies. I don't know why that is. The histories that are read are either Henry V (largely due to Branagh's movie), Richard III (because the hunchback king is so over-the-top evil), or the gargantuan trilogy of Henry VI, with the nearly saintly king (at least by Part III) who much prefers contemplating religion and ethics to ruling and dealing with the cabals among his nobles.So why read a relatively obscure history about a relatively obscure king? Aside from the obvious (it's Shakespeare, stupid), it is a wonderful piece of writing - intense, lyrical, and subtle. Richard II is morally ambiguous, initially an arrogant, callous figure who heeds no warnings against his behavior. Of course, his behavior, which includes seizing the property of nobles without regard for their heirs, leads to his downfall. Nothing in his character or behavior inspires his subjects so he has no passionate defenders when one of the wronged heirs leads a rebellion to depose Richard II. But Richard now becomes a much more sympathetic figure -especially in the scene where he confronts the usurper, Richard acknowledges his mistakes, but eloquently wonders what happens when the wronged subjects can depose the leader when they are wronged. What then of the monarchy, what then of England?On top of the profound political musings, you get some extraordinarily lyrical Shakespeare (and that is truly extraordinary). Most well known may be the description of England that was used in the airline commercial a few years back... &quot;This royal throne of kings, this sceptred isle, ...&quot;If you like Shakespeare and haven't read this play, you've missed a gem."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"Richard II was incompetent, wastefully extravagant, overtaxed his nobles and peasants, ignored his senior advisors, and lavished dukedoms on his favorites. His rival, Henry of Bolingbroke (later Henry IV), was popular with the common man and undeservingly suffered banishment and loss of all his property. And yet two centuries later Elizabethans viewed the overthrow of Richard II as fundamentally wrong and ultimately responsible for 100 years of crisis and civil war. Queen Elizabeth's government even censored Shakespeare's play.Shakespeare masterfully manipulates our feelings and attitude toward Richard II and Bolingbroke. We initially watch Richard II try to reconcile differences between two apparently loyal subjects each challenging the other's loyalty to the king. He seemingly reluctantly approves a trial by combat. But a month later, only minutes before combat begins, he banishes both form England. We begin to question Richard's motivation.Richard's subsequent behavior, especially his illegal seizure of Bolingbroke's land and title, persuades us that his overthrow is justified. But as King Richard's position declines, a more kingly, more contemplative ruler emerges. He faces overthrow and eventual death with dignity and courage. Meanwhile we see Bolingbroke, now Henry IV, beset with unease, uncertainty, and eventually guilt for his action.Shakespeare also leaves us in in a state of uncertainty. What is the role of a subject? What are the limits of passive obedience? How do we reconcile the overthrow of an incompetent ruler with the divine right of kings? Will Henry IV, his children, or England itself suffer retribution?Richard II has elements of a tragedy, but is fundamentally a historical play. I was late coming to Shakespeare's English histories and despite my familiarity with many of his works I found myself somewhat disoriented. I did not appreciate the complex relationships between the aristocratic families, nor what had happened before. Fortunately I was rescued by Peter Saccio, the author of &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;. Saccio's delightful book explores how Shakespeare's imagination and actual history are intertwined.I hope you enjoy Richard II as much as I have. It is the gateway to Henry IV (Parts 1 and 2) and Henry V, all exceptional plays."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"This is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, but in the Kindle edition the footnotes are not activated.

They product is always as advertised, packaged and mailed on time. I have bought many products from Amazon with no problems."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"While many of Shakespeare's works play on English pride, we can say patriotism sets two of his plays apart from the others. Obviously there's Henry V with its depiction of the king who delivered England's greatest military victory and that's a winner-take-all heroic epic. The other play is this one, Richard II.Both plays belong to the same cycle of four histories that also includes Henry IV parts 1 and 2. In Richard II, Shakespeare launches the cycle with a tragedy.The play starts with Richard presiding over a trial by combat. Henry Bolingbroke (who later becomes King Henry IV) and Thomas Mowbray each accuses the other of treason and are going to fight it out. In a trial by combat, God himself decides the issue by lending strength to the righteous. Whoever wins, though, will put Richard in a delicate position, so he stops the combat and exiles both men; Bolingbroke to a few years of banishment but Mowbray forever.This is wrong. King though he may be, Richard is not God and by stopping the duel, he usurps divine providence.Why? Bolingbroke's father and Richard's uncle, John of Gaunt, is a rich man and Richard needs money. In exiling the son from his old and frail father, he hastens the man's end. This gives Richard the opportunity to seize Bolingbroke's inheritance. Bolingbroke returns to reclaim his birthright and wars upon Richard, using as a pretext that his courtiers have given him evil counsel. Bolingbroke wins, seizes the crown and becomes Henry IV. Richard is deposed, imprisoned, and dies.Shakespeare offers two remarkable soliloquies by dying characters. As he dies, John of Gaunt extols the virtues of England.\\"This royal throne of kings, this sceptered isle,This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,This other Eden, demi-paradiseThis fortress built by nature for herselfAgainst infection and the hand of war.This happy breed of men, this little world.This precious stone set in the silver sea...\\"Patriotic stuff! The whole play is about how a king for reasons of personal ambition, through negligence and incompetence, betrayed his duty towards his holy realm. By the end of the play, we witness Richard reaching this conclusion. But thinking it through pains him.\\"I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,My soul the father; and these two begetA generation of still-breeding thoughts...\\"Where John of Gaunt dies full of worries over England's fate yet still conscious of her glory, Richard dies in despair. He is at a loss as to what he could have done to avoid his predicament, yet he is conscious the error belongs to him.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"The product came within a couple days of ordering it, which was amazing because I needed it for school. And the condition is good. It was from a library, so it had the plastic still on it, which preserved the book itself."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"\\"Richard II\\" is a lyrical treat for the reader, and one marvels at the creation of a character as complex as Richard. King Richard is a hopelessly deluded and inept monarch who believes supremely in the divine ordination of kings. He leans on this belief to the exclusion of all of the other king's responsibilities. He makes one poor decision after another, and never reflects on the choice or its consequences before he makes them. However, we still feel a tug at the heart when this monarch is murdered, and this is attributable only to his glorious poetry. Richard speaks in some of Shakespeare's finest verse, and he has the mind for metaphor. I would recommend reading Shakespeare's History plays in order of the king's reign, and one comes to appreciate the complexities and strength of Shakespeare's storytelling.There really are no exceptional characters in this play other than Richard. His antagonist Henry Bolingbroke is a cold hearted dud (and master politician) who plays to the common man and ruthlessly kills those who oppose him. All the while, telling us, and himself, that all his actions are justified and are the results of other's choices. Really he is no different from Richard, except he lacks the King's sense of poetry and theater. There are also some good speeches from secondary characters in this text, especially John of Gaunt. Shakespeare's genius is too large to be contained to only the main characters.\\"Richard II\\" is worthy of a read, if only for the extraordinary experience of feeling revulsion AND pity for the title character."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"Shakespeare's age was the high renaissance in England. Most of the plays were performed at the Globe. The date of the writing and the first performance of RICHARD II is 1592. Richard has two roles. They are God's deputy and Adam's heir.A Machiavellian conflict between the king and his usurper is set forth in the play. Richard exiles Mowbray and Bolingbroke. John of Gaunt is sick and England is sick. England is subject to misrule by Richard, Gaunt asserts.Following the death of John of Gaunt, traitors, so-called, appear. Many of the nobles in the kingdom go over to the side of Bolingbroke, (Gaunt's son, also known as Henry IV).It is Act III and Richard lands in Wales. His rule still shows outward splendor. When he learns of Bolingbroke's advance, he loses his air of authority. Richard learns that his uncle, the Duke of York, has joined with Bolingbroke's forces.Bolingbroke seeks to have his banishment reversed and his lands restored. (At first he did not seek a complete regime shift.) Richard is imprisoned at Pomfret Castle. His queen is sent to France. Sir Pierce Exton slays Richard."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"The Penguin production of Richard II is full length and well done. The other version(s) are abridged and not so good. I find it increases understanding and satisfaction of Shakespeare to listen to the tapes while reading."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare should have had some dialogues where the characters discussed crucial history before the play opens. Gloucester (murdered or dead before the play but mentioned several times) had tried to usurp Richard's crown too many times. History itself is not sure if Gloucester died or was murdered. Bolingbroke for a while conspired with Gloucester and now sees another oppurtunity to usurp the crown.The virtuous John of Gaunt served Richard with honor and integrity and eventually moved parliament into arresting Gloucester for treason. This would of made John of Gaunt's rages all the more valid. Otherwise this play is outstanding! Richard shows himself to be capable of ruling at times, but gains our contempt when he seizes his the honorable John of Gaunt's wealth. John of Gaunt's final rage in 2.1 is a passage of immense rageful beauty. Also, Shakespeare moves us into strongly suspecting that Richard had Gloucester murdered. However, despite Richard's crime, Shakespeare masterfully reverses our feelings and moves us into having deep pity for Richard when he is deposed. The Bishop of Carlisle (Richard's true friend) provides some powerful passages of his own. I can not overestimate the grace in which Shakespeare increases our new won pity for Richard when Bolingbroke (Gaunt's rightful heir) regains his wealth and the death of Gloucester is left ambiguous. 5.1, when Richard sadly leaves his queen and can see that Henry IV and his followers will eventually divide is a scene of sorrowful beauty. 5.4 is chilling when Exton plots Richard's murder. 5.5 is chilling and captivating when Richard dies but manages to take two of the thugs down with him. The icing on the cake is that Bolingbroke (Henry IV) can only regret his actions and realize that he has gotten himself into a troublesome situation. But that will be covered in &quot;1 Henry IV&quot; and &quot;2 Henry IV.&quot; We can easily argue that it is in &quot;Richard II&quot; where we see Shakespeare's mastery of the language at its finest."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"This is a review of the Arden Second Series edition of King Richard II -- an edition edited by Peter Ure and now superseded by the Third Series, but still available on Amazon and lots of other places.(Why there are people on this site giving their opinions of the play itself is beyond me. Of course it is masterful.)I love Arden's editions of Shakespeare because the notes are excellent, the introductions thorough, and the quality of the books themselves -- that is, their sturdiness -- extremely high.But this one falls short. Ure is so fascinated by Shakespeare's sources and his various departures from those sources that the notes are essentially worthless for any other purpose. It is so rare that a note has anything to say other than a remark about the sources that after a while I stopped going to them. The introduction is the same way. I am sure that the question of the sources is very interesting, it just isn't interesting to me, and certainly not in the detail provided here. I would have liked to read about other features of the play too (they are there, just buried in endless discussion of how Shakespeare did or did not use Holingshed for some particular detail).Lastly, if this review is showing up on the page for the Penguin or Folger or Signet or any other of the fine editions of Shakespeare -- my apologies. Amazon does this, not me. I've posted this where it belongs, on the Arden 2d Series Richard II page!"},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"I'm not terribly fond of this publisher's edition. The first thing I noticed was that the book is bulky and cumbersome; it is far too thick for a book of its size, rendering one-handed reading highly difficult. The notes and supplemental material cover as thick a section as the text itself--which isn't inherently a bad thing--but it makes keeping the book open wide enough to read without cracking the spine almost impossible.In addition to the book's width being too short to comfortably hold, it also means numerous lines must carry over into the next line. While this is annoying, it would not be an issue, except the line numberings appear to be done automatically and so include these one- or two-word spillovers as a separate line. This means that when my professor references a certain line number from his edition, I have to hunt around to find the corresponding section. I feel that a work such as this, with distinctive, predetermined lines, should not undergo different numbering conventions.Finally, I believe the annotations are poorly done. I have read many different publishers' versions of Shakespeare, and I have to say this is one of the few times I've ever wished more information were provided. Often I feel books annotate more than necessary with commonly recognized definitions or explaining easily understood syntax. However, I have found myself repeatedly looking to the annotations for a definition to some archaic word or unclear usage only to be disappointed. Also, --and this is more just a pet peeve-- the annotated words do not have any sort of textual indication, such as a number or bubble. I used to think that was distracting and wished it gone; well, now I have an edition without it and it is even more inconvenient, as I have to check the annotations page to see whether a word even has an explanation. The annotations also often spill over onto the next page, causing the reader to have to flip back and forth.Overall, I feel the text and annotations of this edition were poorly organized, resulting in difficulty for the reader."},{"Title":"The tragedy of King Richard II (The Warwick Shakespeare)","review":"This is a very poor quality audio which has been abridged to leave out some of the best parts of the play.

He sees this as grounding an Aristotelian view in which virtues are to be pursued because they promote eudaimonia--human flourishing. Humans can only flourish when biologically-based needs are satisfied. These needs include not only the appetitive ones like food and sex, but &quot;higher&quot; needs of meaningful social interaction and the pursuit of understanding. These universal needs provide the needed telos for judging the rightness or wrongness of actions: How well does the proposed action promote these biologically-based teloi? This view also provides a neutral standard whereby the ethical practices of diverse cultures may be judged, so complete ethichal relativism can be avoided. However, Arnhart recognizes that there may be multifarious, culturally-relative means of achieving the universal ends."},{"Title":"Darwinian Natural Right: The Biological Ethics of Human Nature (S U N Y Series in Philosophy and Biology)","review":"Arnhart holds that the good is desirable, and since we are a natural species, the good can be discerned from our individual environments and our universal constitution as a species. Arnhart's contribution is Aristotelian, in that this philosopher started from the natural position of humanity (e.g., we are a zoon politican--a social animal) rather than from Plato's Ideal World. Arnhart is a Darwinian, in that our constitution as a specied derives from our evolutionary history.This book can be read with profit by professional philosophers as well as beginners interested in understanding evolutionary ethics. It is clear and systematic, avoids jargon, and amply discusses alternative views.I take issue with one part of Arnhart's analysis. I learned that &quot;the good is the desirable&quot; in my graduate student days in economics. I have always thought this quite incorrect (I wrote my Ph.D. dissertation on the topic!). For instance, I may desire potato chips (or heroin) but not consider it good, and may indeed wish that I did not desire these things. In place of Arnhart's principle, I would suggest &quot;The good is what allows us to flourish and to use our natural capacities to the fullest.&quot; The idea of flourishing as a criterion is associated with Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen and others, and the idea of developing one's capacities to the fullest is associated with the young Karl Marx, in his Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.At any rate, virtually all of Arnhart's arguments go through with this minor change.People like me, behavioral scientists, tend to ignore ethical philosophy and have contempt for its practitioners because it tries to find ethical truths independent from the natural position of human beings in the world. Arnhart is a wonderful antidote to this tendency, maintaining a high level of both philosophical and scientific reasoning."},{"Title":"Darwinian Natural Right: The Biological Ethics of Human Nature (S U N Y Series in Philosophy and Biology)","review":"This book looks at morality or ethics and tries to tie together an Aristotelian with what we now know is a moral system that was part of our primate past. Part evolutionary psychology and part philosophy, it is well written, cogent and easy to read. Its message is simply that humans are social and political animals that have innate desires, but need not act on them. Humans can choose to act contrary to their evolutionary past in ethical terms. But also, political systems must not IGNORE our human nature either, or they will fail.From page 259 of the book: To justify his laws, Moses repeatedly insisted that if the Jews obeyed, his laws, they and their children would survive and prosper in their new land. He made no claims about immortality of the soul or about rewards and punishments in an afterlife. Instead, like Darwin, he argued that the purpose of morality was to secure the earthly survival and prosperity of oneself and one's progeny. The first commandment of God in the Bible is &quot;Be fruitful and multiply&quot; (Gen. 1:28). For Moses, promoting the survival and reproduction of the Jews required social norms that led individuals to cooperate within their group to compete with other groups (Deut. 4:40, 6:1-3, 11:8-9, 20, 23:9-14,25:11-16, 30:15-20). Moses taught that &quot;whoever obeys the law will find life in it&quot; (Lev. 18:5). Saint Paul cited this as the fundamental aim of the Mosaic Law (Rom. 10:5). It should not be surprising, therefore, that Darwinian theorists can explain the Mosaic law as promoting the reproductive interests of the Jews (Hartung 1995; MacDonald 1994, 35-55). As a product of natural human experience, not only Judaism but all religious beliefs and practices serve the natural desires of human beings in diverse social and physical environments, and consequently we would explain religion as an adaptation of human ecology (Burkert 1996; Reynolds and Tanner 1995).So even one of the first moral successful systems, the Mosaic Law, recognized the purpose of morality in an evolutionary form, survival of the group. This book tries to go beyond group interests and argues (not always persuasively in my opinion) that a Darwinian morality can subsume the current value system that we all want to see.The book covers the essence of an evolutionary morality. That is, humans evolved with social ranking, justice as reciprocity, political rule, war when group interests collide, religion to explain the fear of the unknown and eventual death, etc. Morality then became part of the pleasure of serving the tribe or belonging. Kin selection, inclusive fitness, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity; these evolutionary processes required that humans have fear and guilt if they act against the tribe's rules. Morality included honor, fearlessness, willingness to die for the group -- that is what the communal sense was all about. Adherence to the tribes moral codes meant the group could fight of predators and other human groups when necessary. Those tribes that could not unify against a common enemy -- what we now call patriotism -- more than likely died out in favor of the more fearless tribes.And how does this morality come about? Well contrary to what folk psychology tells us, from Dr. Laura to President Clinton, both conservatives and liberals, infants are born with a moral nature and seek the rules naturally. That is, even when playing with other children, a child will develop proper behavior by observing others and learning what works and what doesn't, similar to chimpanzees. So the moral do not have to be taught so much as just observed by children. We are naturally moral animals, but the morals change over time and are different for different cultures. However this book argues that we can now change those moral rules that should be abandoned: slavery, clitoridectomy, circumcision, cannibalism, genocide, etc. Perhaps."},{"Title":"Darwinian Natural Right: The Biological Ethics of Human Nature (S U N Y Series in Philosophy and Biology)","review":"Darwinian Natural Right, by Larry Arnhart, argues for a moral system in which we should seek to fulfill our natural desires, which exist due to Darwinian natural selection and evolution.I think it's important to note that in this book Arnhart holds no distinction between statements of nature-what is-and statements of ethic-what ought to be. As such, his arguments tend to ignore this dualism. However, being a person who generally holds this dualism to be true, I found it easier to understand his argument by understanding his claims within such a distinction; the best way for me to describe his arguments is in such a way. His argument acts as a statement of nature in that it says that human beings, as part of their existence, seek to fulfill natural desires. Furthermore, these desires are, at their most basic level, determined by Darwinist evolution. What we typically see as morality, society, and moral sense is in fact the act of human beings seeking to fulfill these natural desires. Arnhart's claim also takes on tones of a statement of ethic, in that he further claims that not all desires are truly desirable; only those that lead to our flourishing are actually desires. He says that we ought to use reason to assess the best ways to fulfill our desires within environmental constraints, and then seek to fulfill them. Finally, he claims that an Aristotelian prudence is required in dealing with conflicting desires and finding the proper balance of desires that produces the greatest good.Arnhart goes on to elaborate on these claims in ten different chapters. The first chapter deals with the origins of his ideas, a series of claims that he feels best describes his argument, and a series of seven main objections that he discusses at various points later in the book. In Chapter Two he defends the idea that the good is desirable, defends the use of reason to determine the best way to achieve the good, and sets out what he sees as the basic natural desires of human beings. In Chapter Three he defends Aristotle's interpretation that human beings are by nature political animals (political in this case is synonymous with what we now consider social to mean). In doing so, he argues against two of the seven objections: the possible gap between biological instinct and learned behavior, and the objection that biological principles are fixed, and allow for no variability. In the fourth chapter he asserts the existence of natural morality and the Darwinian support for it, arguing against the Is-Ought objection; he also argues against the objection that Darwinism fails to allow for free will. In Chapter Five and Six he asserts the existence and significance of the parent-child bond and the male-female conjugal bond; the parent-child bond acts as the evolutionary origin of morality, and serves to aid reproduction, and the male-female bond satisfies needs of social dominance and stratification. He also claims that any society that lacks both will fail because they cannot handle the emotional frustration that results. In chapter Seven and Eight Arnhart deals with what he sees as the most potentially damaging flaws in his model: slavery and psychopathy. In seven, he claims that slavery is a moral wrong-it is the denial of the desire to be free of exploitation. In eight, he argues that psychopaths must be considered moral strangers, and removed from society. In the ninth chapter he deals with two more of the seven objections: the objection on the grounds that Darwinian evolution requires change, while Aristotelian philosophy seeks stability; and the objection that Darwinism is directionless, which conflicts with the essential teleological nature of Aristotelian philosophy. And in the tenth chapter he tackles the last of the objections: that Darwinian Natural Right denies the presence or need for God.There are a few problems with the organization and structure of the book. First, Arnhart fails to adequately explain his argument in the beginning of the book. He lists ten premises that form the basis of his argument, but some of the premises don't follow from the ones before them. Furthermore, some of them seem entirely pointless to his argument (I'm specifically thinking of 7 and 8). Later in the book, you discover the reason behind the confusing premises; in fact, they are key to Arnhart's argument. Unfortunately, he doesn't actually make that very clear until chapters 5-7.The second major problem with the book's structure is that Arnhart habitually changes the context some of his terminology, which in turn changes their definition, and this makes understanding his arguments VERY confusing. For example, at some points he seems to use the word \\"moral\\" in a solely traditional context: morality concerns actions that are more than mundane, such as lying, cheating, stealing, etc. However, in other contexts, he uses his working definition of morality, which is defined as whatever the good is (in this case, fulfillment of desire). As such, things others and I might not consider moral, such as eating habits, suddenly are discussed in a moral context. Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with this definition. The problem comes from Arnhart's habit of changing the definition of \\"moral.\\" (among other terms)The final major problem I had with the book is that Arnhart spends quite a bit of time trying to connect his theory to the works of past philosophers. In essence, he tries to show how past philosophers would have supported his theory. There is nothing wrong with this, when the theory is adequately supported. However, Arnhart has a habit of focussing so much on connections to past philosophers that his support for his theory suffers. The section of his book in which he deals with the Is-Ought problem (the Naturalistic Fallacy) is a good example of this problem.There are two main non-structural objections I have to the book. First is Arnhart's failure to deal with the problem of the falsifiability of natural selection. In DNR, Arnhart lists seven major objections to his book. Pretty much all of these are relevant, and he uses them to bring out evidence in favor of his theory (by the way, he does this very well). However, he never addresses the potential for natural selection to be disproven. Ideally, any scientific theory has the capacity to be shown to be in error--in essence, there is always the possibility that new evidence will show up that will render the scientific theory in question false. Furthermore, to paraphrase Karl Popper, error is manifest. Truth is not. In other words, error is something that can be instantly recognized by human beings. Truth, however, is not (this concept is the underlying premise behind falsifiability).What does this mean for Arnhart's argument? Well, it means that he's supporting his moral theory from a non-absolute position. That is, he support for the existence of Natural RIghts--Darwinian evolution and natural selection--is not set in stone, or in any way known *for certainty*. Insomuch as Darwinism has the capacity to be falsified, Arnhart's argument has the capacity to be falsified. This seems to be a rather serious problem that I hoped Arnhart would address. He didn't.The second \\"non-structural\\" problem is that Arnhart never really addresses the concept of human rights, and how it plays into his theory. His book, in my opinion, seems to imply that when we determine what the right thing to do is (the best way to fulfill a particular natural desire), we ought to do it. Can we force others to do it? To what extent can we force others to do it? In other words, to what extent can we use governmental and social power to promote this moral theory? Arnhart never touches on this.Now, don't let my seemingly negative reaction to this book fool you. I did enjoy Arnhart's work. As an athiest and a humanist, I always enjoy reading works that put forth an essentially nonreligious foundation for ethics, and among those available, Arnhart's is one of the best. He provides excellent support and examples for the arguments he covers, and I found his argument against the Is-Ought dichotomy to be the best I have read. While I do hold to that dichotomy, I can't stand it's stranglehold on modern ethics, and Arnhart's willingness to argue against it--and his generally impressive argument--is refreshing. His chapter on parent child bonding is equally impressive and informative.Overall, the book deserves four stars. I wouldn't go so far as to give it five, because there are some rather annoying issues in the book's format and the structure of Arnhart's *style* of argument. However, the book succeeds, for the most part, in defending Arnhart's theory, and it's VERY thought-provoking.I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in nonreligious support for ethical systems, or in interactions of biology and ethics. It's not an easy read, but it's a good one."},{"Title":"Darwinian Natural Right: The Biological Ethics of Human Nature (S U N Y Series in Philosophy and Biology)","review":"Three \\"Darwinian\\" FallaciesThe misuses of Darwin's theories are legendary. The very first and obvious mistake is to apply Darwin's theories to social processes, since Darwin acts only on natural processes. The second mistake is to assume that humans can imitate Darwinism over the long or short haul. Natural selection occurs naturally, not by human design. The third mistake is to take a natural fact and make it a human value, to take an \\"is,\\" and make it an \\"ought.\\" No \\"is\\" gives an \\"ought,\\" and not \\"ought\\" gives an \\"is.\\" The fact/value divide.Because nature operates by natural selection does not make it a value people should do likewise. To do this is to commit the \\"naturalistic fallacy,\\" which David Hume in 1740 and G. E. Moore in 1903, made plainly clear is a mistake. But let's be clear: These fallacies did not originate with Darwin, but by others who misused his theories. So, when politicians use Darwin's theories to justify their political system, their ethical or moral system, etc., they are plainly mistaken.Uses of DarwinDarwin explicates the evolution and origin of species. It's no longer theory, but fact. Variability in nature is the norm, but that fact does not mean variability should be prized because it is a natural fact -- at least not because of Darwin! To infer this is fallacious. That said, variability in nature opens our eyes to the beauty that variability contributes to our experience of nature, and prizing that variability many of use prize human variability. Some of us prize human variability without any regard for nature. But natural fact does not constitute a social value.How, then, is Darwin useful to us humans? Besides answering questions about our origins, it is the theory of how human life in its immense complexity arrived to exist on planet earth. That complexity is itself valued is a transferred value from natural fact. But natural facts also create calamity, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, poison ivy, etc., and no one \\"values\\" these destructive phenomena, much less seeks to imitate them, because they happen to be \\"natural.\\"Yet, there are many values we can establish, based on our experience with nature. Prizing complexity may be one; prizing diversity may be another; applying Darwinian theory to our interpretation of texts yet another; understanding ourselves through the lens of Darwin's theory still another; etc. But, it would be better to suggest that no other theory in our other domains should not take Darwin's theories into account, not necessarily prescriptively, but factually. Most of us develop our day-to-day theories based on facts, and those theories cannot exclude Darwin without consequence. So, it would be preferable to say Darwin should not be excluded, rather than Darwin should be the model of our theory about X.Ethics, Morality, and NatureThus, when James Q. Wilson wrote his book The Moral Sense, he did not make Darwinian theories the basis of his moral paradigm, rather he considered Darwin's influences on the viability of his moral theory and their compatibility. Conversely, Larry Arnhart's Darwinian Natural Right: The Biological Ethics of Human Nature conceives of \\"Darwinian natural right\\" based on the claim that the good is the desirable, the author argues that there are at least twenty natural desires that are universal to all human societies because they are based in human biology. Arnhart is gravely mistaken. Natural desires do not constitute human good. Nor did Darwin or his theory invoke a \\"natural right.\\" Arnhart confuses is for ought.I cite these two works because they illustrate the important difference between natural facts and social values. The Fact/Value Divide! It just so happens that I support Arnhart's promotion of Aristotle's ethics, and I also support an awareness of Darwinian biology, and I believe that Aristotle's ethical theory is compatible with Darwinian biology. But neither depends on the other for its justification or its support as evidenced by the fact that the two writers are separated by 2,300 years, and neither makes reference to the other. Nothing in Aristotle suggests Darwin, and nothing in Darwin suggests Aristotle.Social versus Natural FactIn fact, the moral theories of David Hume and Adam Smith, written a hundred years before Darwin, have proved themselves worthy of Darwin, but only after Trivers and Williams discovered human empathy as \\"biologically hardwired\\" in humans in the mid-20th century -- 200 years after Hume and Smith and 100 years after Darwin. Empathy, or what Hume and Smith called \\"sympathy,\\" are not merely compatible, but virtually identical. But, the similarities may be necessary, yet not sufficient, which I believe to be the case. Indeed, I don't believe Aristotle is even necessary, but he is sufficient. One could simply impose the Epicurean Rule: Avoid Harm and Injustice as the moral law, which Aristotle's theory does, but goes beyond, while neither Smith nor Hume do.Separating Facts from ValuesLet's begin with separating two facts: surviving and flourishing are different facts. Darwin speaks to survival, Aristotle speaks to flourishing. Clearly, survival is presumed in flourishing, but flourishing is not presumed of survival. The two are different states of affair. Secondly, we are \\"biologically hardwired\\" with empathy, which leads to altruism and reciprocal altruism. But universal altruism (benevolence) is not entailed; merely altruism toward our family, friends, clan, in varying degrees, and our cooperation with others in exchange for mutual favor is reciprocal altruism, not universal benevolence. Thirdly, ethics, morality, politics, etc. are part of our values (axiological) systems, while Darwinian biology is part of our factual (epistemological) systems, and facts (is) and values (ought) are irreducibly divided.Necessary and SufficientPhilosophers love this distinction, because it is important. A trivial example to illustrate: A cup of flour is necessary to make a cake, but it is not sufficient, as other ingredients, cookware, cook, and oven are also necessary; altogether, they are sufficient. Biologically, for example, Darwin is necessary, but insufficient, as atomic theory, physiology, anatomy, biophysics, genetics, etc., are also required. Likewise, Aristotle's ethical theory is unnecessary, but sufficient, while Epicurus' principle is necessary, but insufficient, and Hume's and Smith's benevolence is necessary, but insufficient.ConclusionThe tripartite axiological requirements of Aristotle's ethics, Smith's benevolence, and Epicurus' Harm-Injustice Avoidance as the ideal ethical and moral system are to be commended, but one concedes only Epicurus' Harm-Injustice Avoidance is socially necessary, but insufficient for flourishing. The question of benevolence may go either way, if it is presumed as necessary for the Harm-Injustice Avoidance, and is sufficient if Benevolence presumes Harm-Injustice Avoidance.The language of \\"rights,\\" such as those in the U.S. Bill of Rights, are social facts, not natural facts, and therefore to appeal to Darwinian natural rights is entirely confused. Life on the savanna, the jungle, or oceans has no \\"rights,\\" only survival of the fittest. The \\"rights\\" enshrined in the Constitution are those discovered in the Age of Enlightenment as part of \\"social contract\\" theory. \\"Natural right\\" is therefore an oxymoron and contradiction.Insofar as Darwin's five theories inform our present existence, clearly everyone benefits from the knowledge, which then can be used in making our values. These theories help us to understand how and why we have developed our social facts and values, but do not constitute them. Indeed, most of the theories and social facts we have embraced were done without knowledge of Darwin's theories. That Darwin's facts shed additional information on how we as a species came to be, interact as naturally constituted, certainly augments the understanding and appreciation of our values. But facts will never constitute values or vice versa. But values that incorporate fact (versus myth) certainly are more valuable because of it. Thus, Trivers and Hamilton and Williams' works are valuable for the light they shed on our natural constitution, but neither justify nor deny the value of a moral, much less an ethical, life."},{"Title":"A Guide for Using Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day in the Classroom","review":"After reading this book I used it all the time in my class room and it was great.

I have worked many a courtroom and controlled and manipulated situations, but this was a different animal. I was simply at a loss.I quit my job and I have not worked as an attorney in over two years. Fear won. Along with some renowned pyshologists and experts in the field of anxiety, Jamie gave me a step by step plan on how to best beat this demon, and, not only beat it, but to ultimately use it to my advantage.

I didnt end up in the bookstore by accident.I have been suffering with social panic disorder for about 10 years. It just hit out of the blue when I was on a trip to Florida on vacation. I have had my shares of ups and downs and have been frustrated with why the attacks still come on in the first place after all this time. Reading this book reinforced that I will have these ups and downs and thats ok.

By this time everything he could say has already been said and I couldn't wait for this book to end. He never really explains how he \\"overcame\\" the disorder, other than by sheer grit and willpower. Not very helpful for anyone suffering from the disorder! He doesn't describe his therapy and treatment although there are comments interspersed from doctors and psychologists which are mildly helpful. Blyth's humorous writing style is enjoyable, but his overexaggerated descriptions of rather minor every day incidents is too much. (On the order of those \\"I walked to school 12 miles in the freezing snow, uphill all the way\\" jokes.) He allows two chapters to what made him famous, \\"The Bachelorette\\" TV show.

I would never say this is a classic like the latter, but it was very entertaining and moving and the writing and style was impressive to say the least.Although the book may have been about Anxiety, it was really a metaphor for life. For example, here he partly describes his first panic attack, \\"A tornado swirled around me, and I was stuck in the center of it, unable to figure out how to get out without being swept up in it and hurled away. I had exited myself and was floating around in this strange body, somebody who wasn't me. I stumbled out into the bright morning glow, buzzing inside, and just as quickly as the bizarre episode began, it stopped. It had lasted about three minutes. Just three minutes, and I was about to find that it had altered my entire world forever.\\"I can relate. Ultimately, this book is very uplifting and will make you both laugh and cry."},{"Title":"Fear Is No Longer My Reality","review":"I originally bought this book to learn more about my brother's social anxiety disorder, but what I found was a story we can all relate to since it is laced with very basic, human thoughts and insecurities. Who hasn't let fear stand in his way at some point?This connection was possible because Jamie was completely honest with himself and his readers. It is very funny, thouroughly entertaining and altogether charming! It reads like a novel not a self-help book which is why I finished it so quickly.I highly recommend it.

But it was also a story of strength, love and pure determination - through the good days and the bad days.Anyone that has issues with anxiety & panic attacks and feels like there is no light shining at the end of that dark tunnel, should pick up this book and read Jamie's journey.

These particular chapters were the most powerful and in my view helpful. Its rare to read the awful situation that one with panic can go through, and then his struggle and strength of conviction to make it through. I applaud the author for this. Finally someone uses his 15 minutes of reality fame to help others. he should be applauded."},{"Title":"Fear Is No Longer My Reality","review":"I feel like this could be your best friend telling you all that you have ever been curious about when it comes to panic/anxiety attacks.

The idea behind this story came from a Nancy Drew book Ann M. Martin read as a kid: \\"The Hidden Staircase\\" by Carolyn Keene, which is also worth reading if you're a Nancy Drew fan. In this book, Dawn believes her house is haunted by a previous owner's ghost due to the strange noises she hears at night. Plus she discovers a secret passage between the barn and her bedroom, where she finds very old objects (like a coin, button, buckle, and key) that she believes belong to the ghost. As in all the BSC books, this isn't the only storyline going on in the book. A few chapters involve various baby-sitting jobs, like at the Pike household, which holds some clues to Dawn's ghost theory. \\"The Ghost at Dawn's House\\" isn't the only ghost book of Dawn's.

His work, \\"The Conversations At Curlow Creek\\", contain passages that could stand alone as solitary poems with little change to their form. This is only the third work of his I have read, so even if combined with the fourth I am reading, I still feel this Author's range is remarkable. Australia is not a place where the word confine would seem to be appropriate, however with this story Mr. Malouf creates a very intimate setting that even when expanded, rarely grows larger.As he has done before he brings people from Scotland, or Ireland and tells his story in Australia. When I said he expands the setting without literally enlarging it as well, I meant that his players might roam their memories and share those of others, while remaining all but immobile during the tale. Two men from Ireland share an evening. One represents the authority of law in its most final form, the other a man whose outlaw life should hold values in complete opposition to his jailer. An then there is a third man, also from Ireland, raised as a brother to the lawman, and the possible leader of the group the prisoner is the only surviving member of.The night can be a strange time for thoughts and memories, and when one of the men is supposed to be hung at dawn, every minute is arguably critical. The passage of time seems to obsess the jailer more. When asked the time he wonders if he should just say the half hour, or the actual 28 minutes past. He contemplates the value these 2 additional minutes would mean to the condemned. He uses time to gain information about this man's leader, probing to see if the man is his foster brother last seen when 16 years of age. The jailer sensitive to the man's diminishing time is desperate for the knowledge, but becomes increasingly respectful of the convict.The travels outside the room they share often read as a recollection, until the waking of the dreamer disturbs the memory. It's a more subtle form of recall than just turning the page and finding you are jumping back and forth between dates. As the night passes the ides of forgiveness, redemption, and morality are discussed with the jailor playing the reluctant philosopher/priest. Mr. Malouf is very clever in taking issues that seem so black and white, and making them gray. He examines the two paths in life these men have followed, and the possible life of the third man. All three are very different, but two may have decided to live outside the confines of society's laws, while the third became a custodian of the same society's structure.The book comes to an ending that I doubt many will find expected, and some may argue is ambiguous. Mr. Malouf leaves a great deal of room for his readers to either find the thread he leaves, or to allow space to be filled by the reader. His writing is unique and compelling, and will either hold great appeal, or certain frustration for readers."},{"Title":"THE CONVERSATIONS AT CURLOW CREEK.","review":"This is one of my all time valued books. A splended writer, Malouf uses language as a poet, brings his two main characters to vivid life, makes the reader care about both of them...the convict and the soldier (possibly his executioner). What particularly moved me and sets this book above most is how skillfully Malouf raises the question of morality (without moralizing) relative to the judgement of others...Who is not guilty? Or if guilty, what about the compassion of another. These are to me primary questions in a worldwhere finger-pointing is so prevalent. Malouf is a man whose breadth and depth of insight deserve much attention and applause."},{"Title":"THE CONVERSATIONS AT CURLOW CREEK.","review":"The suspense of the novel is provided by the reader's wondering if Adair will hang an illiterate Irish convict at dawn or if he will yield to compassion after talking and reminiscing with the man through the night. The convict relates a story about a time that he was given a job to impersonate someone under very mysterious circumstances which turned out to be the only instance in the man's life that he was ever treated with any kind of tenderness. This story is marvelously told and does arouse the reader's sympathy. Soldier and convict are united by their Irish backgrounds and the fact that they were both orphans whose fortunes, however, were widely divergent. The reader comes to wonder which position is more difficult: the convict's necessity of facing death at dawn or the soldier's duty to be the executioner. The author uses this situation as a focus for a meditation on mortality that is philosophical and sometimes mysterious. This would be a good selection for a book group as multiple interpretations of the meaning of the book are certainly possible."},{"Title":"THE CONVERSATIONS AT CURLOW CREEK.","review":"Michael Adair is far from his native Ireland. In the scrub of New South Wales, he's been assigned the supervising of the execution of a bushranger. With no priest present, Adair undertakes the task of providing company, if not consolation, for the doomed raider. Carney, an Irishman like Adair, was a member of a gang led by a renowned leader, Dolan. Dolan, famous for his physical stature and cunning, is of particular interest to Adair. The last survivor of the mob, Carney seeks some level of absolution for his sins, which appear minimal. Frontier justice is always grim and Carney expects no favours from his watcher.As the night progresses, Adair's mind drifts back to his childhood in Ireland. An orphan taken in by a comfortable, if troubled, family, he reflects on his foster parents' son. From early days when Adair was caregiver to Fergus to later, more competitive times, the relationship of the two boys was close. It became strained only as they achieved maturity and Virgilia, a neighbour, becomes a tutor to the pair. Carney, it appears, may be a link to that distant past. A link less remote and vague than the circumstances of the lonely night suggest. Reminiscing may lead to connections both men may not welcome, yet each reaches tentatively for the other regardless of the outcome. The dynamics of this tale are intense and compelling.In Australia, there's a long-standing tradition of the \\"bush ballad\\" - a mix of fable, poetry and music. The ballads reflect the stark, unforgiving land and the lives of the people coping with it. The verses are wistful with longing for better times and places, yet reflect the \\"battler's\\" striving to overcome adversity. Malouf's prose reflects that tradition in both style and content. He's parsimonious with words, yet precise and vividly descriptive. He's presented us with a story of profound depth and wide-reaching scope, yet managed it within an astonishing few pages. No words are wasted, but each conveys the fullest meaning within the story. Malouf is a masterful writer, and this book will long stand as a sterling example of his abilities.

The author has created, entirely out of his own imagination, and with no tradition of science fiction behind him, a staggeringly ambitious work: the history of thousands of years in the psi Cassiopeiae star system. And not only history: he has included poetry, folktales, and two plays from the cultures inhabiting the system. Not great literature, perhaps, but I found it fascinating. It made virtually no impression on the literary world at the time and has been almost completely forgotten for 150 years. The book is marred, alas, by a number of obvious typos, and for some reason the author (or is it the translator?) consistently refers to the star as psi Cassiopeia [sic]. And the book is pretty expensive for a trade paperback. But if you're interested in the early days of science fiction, this is a must have."},{"Title":"Trickster in the Land of Dreams","review":"I loan this book out alot, as it often makes its way into conversation.

If you are new to astronomy and wish to learn some basic facts about our solar system and the universe, Isaac Asimov's compendium of essays in this book will help you grasp the basics and give you a good background on the &quot;Whys.&quot; If you are seriously pursuing astronomy as a hobby and post-retirement profession, the book is an indespensible as a little book of known facts and non-intense mathematics regarding moons, orbital mechanics, gravity calculations, and &quot;what-ifs&quot;. If you are a professional astronomer, what better way to bring your knowledge and love of astronomy down to the lay person. (Sometimes we learn so much, that we have a hard time explaining things to the little people who one day might take our place.)Everytime I find a new person interested in astronomy, I come to Amazon to scrounge up a used copy of &quot;Asimov on Astronomy&quot; and give it to them. The book is obviously dated and new things have been discovered since the last printing in 1979; however, much of the book talks about things that do not change with time.Hopefully, the books will be brought upto date and reprinted again. Thanks, Isaac!"},{"Title":"ASIMOV ON ASTRONOMY","review":"Yet more classic Asimov. Here Asimov collects his F&FS; essays on astronomy (complete up to the early seventies). These have been previously published mixed with essays on other topics in chronological order, but republished here as a subject set.He has other books which provide an easy and complete introduction to Astronomy, and if you want an overview you should read one of these. However if you want to have your interest piqued, this selection of essays cover some varied and interesting astronomical topics that you might not find treated elsewhere, and which always begin with a thoughtful idea or premise.This book is an example of his conversational style at its best! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Heavenly clockwork;: The great astronomical clocks of medieval China, (Antiquarian Horological Society. Monograph)","review":"book review _Heavenly clockwork_HEAVENLY CLOCKWORK the great astronomical clocks of medieval chinaby Joseph needhamI read the book because of a statement made in a online discussion group: &quot;the chinese emperor suppressed the knowledge of clockmaking.&quot;This did not fit into my understanding, as i have seen very old water clock diagrams on the walls of bell and drum towers in China, in particular, the drum and bell towers in Beijing had a very complete set of sketches of massive water clocks. Although i could not read the legends i understood that the purpose of the drum and bell towers throughout China was to keep time in a very public way.Now choosing this particular book was not an accident, i have wanted to get into the massive corpus of Needham's work on China, and this was an opportunity to have a minor need driven learning curve. I was not at all disappointed in the book. It is literally an excellent example of how to do science, how to investigate a historical question, how to marshall facts and prove a difficult point.But the book is not for the faint of heart, or the mildly interested in horology, it is complete, tedious and not a Sunday afternoon light reading. Nor should it be, it is just as the author intended it, a scientific research book on the origin of clock building in China.From the introduction: &quot; It is generally allowed that the invention of the mechanical clock was one of the most important turning-points in the history of science and technology. Not only was it the earliest complex device, heralding a whole age of machine-making, but also its regular imitation of the natural motion of the sun and heavens fascinated men and exerted no small influence on their philosophy and theology.&quot; The key text which is studied throughout is _New Design for a Mechanised Armillary Sphere and Celestial Globe_ written in 1090AD by Su Sung. The clock was built, a high astronomical clock-tower more than thirty feet high, with sky observation points, moving globes and rings that would be analogous to the same object in the movie &quot;Dark Crystal&quot; with the planets in their various orbits whizzing around the sun.&quot;To sum up the matter, it is quite clear that one of the reasons why the early Jesuit missionaries were so much welcomed by the Chinese was for their interest in clocks and clock-making, hardly less indeed than for their skill as mathematicians and astronomers. ... In Ricci's time the Jesuit order was capable of attracting for its overseas mssions some of the best minds of Europe. It was a mobilisation of oecumenical idealism something like that which the League or the United Nations have now and then commanded in our own time.&quot; pg. 145It is the 9th chapter: &quot;General History and Transmission of Astronomical Clocks&quot; that i personally found the most fasinating, where Needham takes the details and builds the connections to general thinking and social structures. &quot;Such devices of scientific technology have exercised not a little influnce on the idea that the universe was a great mathematical machine whose workings could be comprehended by exact reasoning. Since astronomy and graphic representation are two of the most ancient of man's arts, it is no wonder that he should want to hold the cosmos in his hand by making a model of it--&quot; pg 179 &quot;This is no accidental feature of mechanical design, but an inherent part of the format of Chinese astronomical theory.&quot;pg 180 &quot;The question is also linked closely with the different modes of astronomy in the Hellenistic and Chinese cultures. In the West, a series of happy accidents occurred soon after the arithmetically minded Babylonians had communicated their astronomy to the geometrically strongly-developed Hellenic scientists. These accidents of physical fact and mathematical structure had the effect of directing the best period of genius towards the mathematical analysis of planetary motions rather than to any other part of astronomy.&quot; pg 181I understand that the big question for Needham was why did science develop in the West and not China, given the Chinese invention of all the pieces of what we consider the enabling technology. This book is my first study into the Needham body of writing and i look forward to working through the 12 volume set on Chinese science.thanks for reading the review, and i hope it inspires you to at least skim the first chapter and chapter 9."},{"Title":"Heavenly clockwork;: The great astronomical clocks of medieval China, (Antiquarian Horological Society.

The book begins in the sixteenth century with the Stotts family who are independent landholders. The father of the family is a an independent woolen cloth weaver. The Stotts's are contrasted to the Hardcastles who, also are independent weavers in the sixteenth century, but begin to engage other workers , through the putting out system, to work for them. The Hardcastles then, become incipient capitalists. By the 19th century the Hardcastle family has been knighted, given an estate, and have risen to become members of the aristocracy. The Stotts' on the other hand, have become proletarianized. As the factory system develops and the textile industry is born, machines transform the production of woolen textiles from a craft to mass production. The Stotts' have lost their independence and have become proletarianized mill workers.The mill owners, represented by Denshaw, rent their land from the Hardcastles and are subordinated to them in a class system which is represented by aristocrats, burgeoning capitalists and impoverished mill workers. The Hardcastles maintain their landed privileges no longer merely by renting land to peasants but by renting their land to the mill owners. Because they own virtually all the land in the community they gain their wealth and social position as a class, through rents rather than industrial production.While the Hardcastles have become aristocrats, the most recent member of the Stotts family, James, has managed to avoid becoming a mill worker. Since his own family roots lie with the mill workers, he becomes a political activist on behalf of the working class and engages in political activity to end child labor in the mills and bring in the ten hour day.Yet, despite his political activism, he becomes a food merchant and later the wealthy owner of a paper mill, after working hard and saving his pennies,as a good 19th century capitalist should do. He rises from his working class origins o become a wealthy man.Even as a mill owner his interests are threatened by the Hardcastles, who still own the land and control the prerogatives of renting it at will. James, a capitalist, who now believes in the free market, bcomes an activist in a political campaign to eliminate the feudal rights of the aristocratic Hardcastles. He becomes an advocate for the rights of the capitalist class to have a free market in land ownership.The book is not a great literary work, but is a good representation of the transformation of the class system. Three classes are juxtaposed against one another: the aristocracy, the emerging bourgeoisie and the workers. The book depicts the transition from aristocratic control to capitalist control, by showing how the economic and social relationships of the three classes change in response to the growth of industrialization. I think Hawksmoor is a good book to use in a history or sociology course, to educate students about dynamics of class and class conflict as capitalism emerges in England."},{"Title":"Hawksmoor","review":"The review shown below thorougly describes the content of Hawksmoor. However, there is so much more to credit this book that its social reportage. It is elegantly written in a manner that is understated and true. I was reluctant to take up this book but am so glad that I did. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about the early 1800's in England. More raucous than Jane Austen but perhaps more honest in its telling of what life might really have been like for the impoverished. The characters had dimension and depth. The story proceeded at a steady but unpredicable meter (with the exception of the unfortunate inclusion of unlikely first-sex pregnancies). I hope others will read this book and will enjoy its rich story-telling as much as I."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"This review is in reference to the original two volume set of Nansen's &quot;Farthest North&quot; published in 1897. The Modern Library abridged edition is drawn from that set.Nansen and 12 colleagues left Norway and sailed north in the Arctic Ocean above Siberia in 1893. Their purpose was to become frozen in the ice as it formed farther and farther south in the fall. Based on historical evidence from other attempts at far-north Arctic Ocean exploration, Nansen had decided that the flow of currents and winds in the Arctic Ocean were such that a frozen-in vessel that began above the Siberian Islands would drift northward with the ice across the North Pole over the next year or so. His goal therefore was to be the first to the North Pole. He planned for a expedition of as long as three years.These Arctic explorers' ship was a specially designed vessel, the Fram. Her construction was such that when trapped in the frozen ice, which had extremely variable depths and especially pressures, the ship would rise up above the swelling pack ice and avoid being crushed. The success of the ship's design was absolutely spectacular. This should be compared to the fate of the Endurance, Shackleton's ship (described in his book &quot;South&quot;), which was trapped in the Antarctic ice and crushed, more that 17 years after Nansen's memoir was published.Nansen's great success with sled dogs and sled designs published in the original memoir in 1897 adds credence to the relatively recent indictment (see Huntford) of the English Explorer Robert Scott who still disregarded the intense use of sled dogs in his 1910-12 Antarctic effort to reach the South Pole. Scott and four others basically die because of his ignorance/misunderstanding of the value of sled dogs, 15 years after Nansen details his successes with them on this expedition.Fridtjof Nansen's writing style is clear, interesting, and very engaging. He was obviously a first-rate, experienced explorer (having crossed lower Greenland in 1888) and yet, at the same time, someone who recognized that there is something special going on around him. He documents-via journal entries-his daily observations and feelings about the physical conditions, the people, and even the sled dogs born during the adventure. There are records of supplies, food, ocean depths, temperatures, drift direction and distances, wind speed, ice thickness, bear attacks, a fantastic two-person trek by dog sled, and beautiful and sometimes emotional details of the aurora borealis. The original two volume set includes photographs and drawings made from photographs taken on the trip. Also a fine set of maps clearly showed the route of the expedition. Some of these must be included in the Modern Library's abridged version.In comparison to the dry, guarded writing styles of Cherry-Garrard's &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot; or Shackleton's &quot;South&quot; this book is easier to read even though it too describes many terrifying situations and yet wonderful, hard-won successes. Nansen was just a better writer with more descriptive writing under his belt and possibly better initial plans for the book that would be produced from his experiences.This book is a must for readers interested in polar exploration. Period."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"I will only state briefly, that I have an abiding interest inarctic exploration and I find that this edition, while very useful,does not do justice to the 1897 original in that the many engravings and esp the color prints are missing. One must purchase a used book to get the whole flavor of the original."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"Modern exploration really began with Fridtjof Nansen and his Norwegian Polar Expedition. All who came after him benefited immensely from his experience. The primary characteristic that distinguished Nansen from most other explorers was that he approached all aspects of expedition planning with scientific precision. He started by reading accounts of previous expeditions in order to learn from the experiences of his predecessors. Nansen remarked in his diary that, to his surprise, most of the problems confronting him already had been addressed and, in many instances, solved by previous explorers: wear appropriate clothing, pay special attention to the food, select crew members who can get along, then keep them busy and entertained. In my book, Bold Endeavors: Lessons From Polar and Space Exploration, I suggest the Norwegian Polar Expedition as a model for modern space explorers. Nansen's systematic simulation, testing, and evaluation of every item of equipment and his meticulous attention to every detail and possible contingency set him apart from all previous and most subsequent explorers. But, most important, Nansen recognized that the physical and psychological well-being of his crew could make the difference between success and failure. Accordingly, he provided a well-designed habitat, insightful procedures, and exceptional leadership to a qualified and compatible crew. Roald Amundsen, the most successful of all explorers, wrote that, \\"The human factor is three quarters of any expedition.\\" Before Amund-sen, Nansen knew that human factors were the critical components of any expedition; in Nansen's words, \\"It is the man that matters.\\""},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"I share the wonder of others at Nansen's achievements in advancing the art of arctic exploration many important steps forward. This pioneer recognized that the \\"North Pole\\" was neither frozen land nor solid ice but rather, slowly moving ice. Nansen designed his ship the \\"Fram\\" to not only withstand the movement of ice but to use it to his advantage. He planned for several years of drift in arctic ice with no hope of rescue if things went badly. Before his voyage, he was dismissed (as other explorers before him) as a reckless nut case. On the trip, he occupied his crew with scientific study, ship maintenance, and occasional celebrations and treats. Nansen grew impatient with his plan, left the Fram to the care of his crew, and journeyed with one other crew member on a double-dogsled slog for the Pole. The two men mushed until blocked (300 miles from the Pole); heading home, they got lost when their watches stopped and they could no longer orient themselves on the map, GPS being unavailable at the time ;-). The two groups of explorers simultaneously arrived home by separate eventful journeys. This is a remarkable story of successes and misses.\\"Farthest North\\" combines Nansen's post-trip narratives of events with many verbatim daily journal entries. These passages, as in most diaries, are understandably highly repetitive and at times lack focus. (It's easy enough to skim until finding something more engaging.) I found Nansen's descriptions of the polar darkness lasting many weeks each winter and its effects on morale particularly compelling. Also well recounted was the nerve-wracking grinding and pressure of the ice upon the \\"Fram\\" with the underlying danger of shipwreck in the Arctic. I was also moved by Nansen's bitter frustrations at the forward-then-back progress north and at his exhaustion trying to move dog sleds across uneven tundra. The map of the journey is hard to read or to match with the text, unfortunately. Conversely, the trip's black and white photos that match faces to names add much to the book. This edition of \\"Farthest North\\" was abridged from an original two-volume set. I for one did not, however, want more text to read and would have appreciated additional editing. Even abridged and even as an historical document, this remains a very long book.One caution not mentioned in other reviews here to date: attitudes of Nansen towards wilderness and wildlife will likely bother some readers. Nansen's view of an animal could be characterized as, \\"Shoot it... unless it's a sled dog we need... at the moment.\\" Polar bears (including cubs), whales, fish, walrus, seals, birds, as well as non-wild sled dogs and puppies are killed frequently, every few pages on average, and without guilt (with the exception of a few favorite sled dogs whose demise did bother Nansen). One can rationalize a need for hunting because this well-stocked crew had to find additional food in a place where it couldn't be grown. But at other times, the killing seemed for diversion or because, in the case of the dogs, supplies were running short, and a faithful but hungry sled dog had one final service to perform for its comrades or master. In August 1894, Nansen noted with wonder and delight that he'd finally seen three &quot;rare and mysterious&quot; Arctic Ross' gulls, a species he'd been searching for. With no expression of irony balancing his happiness at his sighting, he gunned each one down, apparently ensuring that the species would be even more rarely observed in the future. These small birds, the size of snipe, would have had little food value. To readers who are sensitive to graphic descriptions of hunting that in today's culture may seem senseless, or to raw exploitation of animals for human needs, this book may be hard to take. Dog-training techniques are also notably unenlightened. One also misses crew attention to any need to carry out what was carried in to the wilderness. But these are objections in the context of current environmentalist values towards animals and wilderness-- values that have only come into prominence in recent years. The essential point to remember is that \\"Farthest North\\" reflects the attitudes of the era in which it was written and of the people who participated in this historic venture. As such, it offers a point-of-view and a look at cultural values of the 1890s that could not be matched by a modern third-person account of the trip. \\"Farthest North\\" is not the way we would choose to travel there now. To readers who can keep this perspective in mind, and can in fact appreciate the contrast and change in attitude towards wild places over the last century, the book is a journey they will be glad they made."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"I thought I was well educated, but just learned of this Norwegian scientist, explorer, statesman, and wonder why we Americans never learned about him in school. What a wonderful story of his attempt to reach the North Pole! As I am of Swedish descent I understand his understating his accomplishments. He doesn't see it as that unusual. It was just something he wanted to do and he planned it out carefully. This book should be required reading in our schools."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"If you are a fan of Arctic and Antarctic adventure stories then this is one you don't want to miss. The great explorer Fridtjof Nansen left Norway in 1893 on the Fram, a ship especially designed to withstand the pressure of the frozen northern sea. Nansen's intention was to drift, locked in the ice, to the North Pole. Eventually, he determines that his theory of drifting to his destination will not be possible, so he and another crewman leave the ship and continue towards the Pole by dogsled. The Fram continues drifting in the ice and Nansen and his partner have no hope of returning to the ship. The story unfolds over a period of three years and you can't turn the pages fast enough to find out what happens to Nansen and the crew of the Fram."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"This is not a typical tale a 19th century Polar exploration. Unlike the British and Americans who went head first into the Arctic, Nansen studied what went wrong before and acted accordingly.The Fram drifted as plan, no one died from scurvy or cold, they did not eat each other. The leader, well prepared, was listened to and respected. He was so well prepared that, in fact, on board the Fram, Nansen complained about the inactivity of the whole expedition, limited as they were by the confine of their ship.Once Nansen and Johansen left the Fram by sledge, they had a harder time but nothing cruel or harrowing. Nansen provides us with numerous details of his sledge journey north, details about what he saw, what he observed, what he felt. He is honest enough to sometimes point out that he did not exactly know where he was.Once you read Farthest North, you'll find that Robert Peary (especially) and Frederick A Cook own tales of North Pole exploration lacked details and authenticity.Nansen has set the \\"modern way\\" of Polar travel. Those (like Roal Amundsen) who listened to him where bound to succed, and those (like RF Scott) who sticked to the old ways where bound to die."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"Carney was right! this was such an interesting book! Written in the 1890s, you'd never know it, it is easy to read and understand...even as it was translated from Norwegian! Nansen was an absolutely amazing guy and when you consider what it was he was attempting, it is incredible and I am looking forward to reading his biography to learn more about my new hero."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"Skip the preparation section unless you are really interested in how many tons of coal or potatoes Nansen took along. Skip the final section by Sverdrup on his return from the ice unless you have trouble sleeping at night. The only part really worth reading is the tale of Nansen and his partner 'walking' home (close to home anyway) over the ice. Nansen wrote this from the comfort of his home but still has a casual attitude to this amazing 'walk'."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"Farthest North is a great read for lovers of arctic exploration novels of the 18th and early 19th centuries. Nansen became a national hero when he returned home, and to fulfill high demand for their story he wrote this book quickly; so it is not highly polished and at points can get repetitious. However, Nansen is a good writer, and he's able to convey a sense of what it must feel like to be in uncharted Arctic territory; plus the story reads fresh, as if Nansen wrote it while still on the Fram. Nansen explains his thought process behind the Fram's design and the decisions he made during their journey, which some readers might not like, but which conveyed to me a sense of Nansen the person. Because Nansen, the Fram, and its highly qualified crew were so very well prepared to undertake their journey, Nansen's expedition avoided a lot of the misfortunes and health problems that struck other Arctic explorers; therefore, this book is not for readers looking for an Arctic tale replete with mortal terror, but instead it provides an interesting contrast to those other explorer's experiences.Farthest North was written in two volumes, and unfortunately this Kindle edition ONLY CONTAINS VOLUME ONE, which leaves off before Nansen leaves the icebound Fram and sets out towards the North Pole. I had already found a free edition of Farthest North volume one, and after reading that version I bought this Amazon Kindle edition because I mistakenly thought that it contained both volumes one and two. However, this edition DOES INCLUDE NANSEN'S ILLUSTRATIONS that are missing from the free edition; therefore, I feel it is well worth paying the $0.99 Amazon price instead of downloading the free edition."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"If you like adventure, this one is for you.This one is in the same genre as Shackleton's Amazing Adventureand The Last Place on Earth, both of which I reallyenjoyed."},{"Title":"Farthest North","review":"I would strongly warn anybody thinking of buying this book (at least this edition)...I purchased it a few days ago, thinking I would get a great paperback (sold by Amazon, after all!), but when it arrived the cover was different then pictured here and the pages inside are indescribable...the best I can say is that someone found this book scanned online, then went to a local Kinko's store, printed it, and slapped a fairly decent cover to make it look like a good edition. Some pages were completely unreadable, with sentences breaking off in the middle of the page and continuing on the next one, while others had entire paragraphs composed of only question marks and exclamation points (and other special characters, as if someone had just slapped their hands on the computer keyboard).

Very disappointing, I was really looking forward to reading this book."},{"Title":"Approaching Quantum Computing","review":"There are a number of good books about quantum computing around. Unfortunately, because it has a number of errors, and because the explanations are not always clear, this is not one of them. I know somebody who, after reading this book's section on superdense coding and teleportation, ended up more confused than he started out. This is because not only is teleportation presented using a forest of bewildering 8x8 matrices (correct, but only useful if this is explained well), but the words accompanying these matrices are actually wrong. For example in superdense coding Alice is said to send Bob a quantum bit in a state described by a 4-dimensional vector. This vector actually describes the joint state of Alice and Bob's quantum bits, and there is no way to describe Alice's quantum bit alone. This is a very important distinction to make if you want to comprehend the material, and this book does not make it here. We also learn that in teleportation, \\"The transfer of quantum information appears to happen instantly, though Bob needs to first receive classical information regarding the result of Alice's measurement before validating his own result.\\" I'm not even sure what this sentence is trying to say. What does validating mean in this context?The definition of uniformity is wrong. The authors do not appear to understand the concepts behind this definition, or if they do, they are incapable of communicating these concepts to the reader.In the factoring algorithm, the second condition in the definition of order of r modulo N is incorrect. First it has a 1 in the right-hand-side, and the authors meant to put a 0 there. Second, this condition does not belong in the correct mathematical definition of order. And finally, they don't need this condition since they don't seem to use it anywhere. To make matters worse, Figure 5.10, which illustrates the factorization process for 21, shows 1 times 11 being equal to 16.To be fair to the authors, these errors have now been corrected in the errata, and I haven't looked at earlier chapters of the book, which may be better than the chapters I did look at."},{"Title":"Approaching Quantum Computing","review":"In planning a course on quantum computing, an instructor would want to cover the significant highpoints in the subject: Shor's factoring algorithm, Grover's search algorithm, Deutsch's problem, the hidden subgroup problem. I for one found that this book does precisely that. Students will want an accessible and attractive presentation. This book is beautifully presented, nicely organized, and pedagogically presented with motivation, clear explanations, and well chosen exercises.While the subject has a variety of facets, physics, math, computer science, this book emphasizes the last two. In a highly interdisciplinary subject, each author (or team of authors) must make selections. In selecting what to cover, the authors had the classroom and students in mind.More precisely the subject here is presented in the form of quantum gates, channels, and circuits. Yet, quantum physics and the foundations are not neglected.The graphic presentation (figures and diagrams) is done in a way to aid learning, and I expect that this book will be the preferred text in courses in the subject for some time to come.Advanced undergraduates will be able to follow the logical progression of subjects. Several special features in the book help: Exercises, an extensive and instructive glossary, historical insight, motivation, appendices (including key math topics, e.g., modular arithmetic and Hadamard transforms which perhaps may not be widely known), and circuit diagrams illustrating at the same time matrix factorization and the complexity of circuits.Contents: 1. History and background, 2. Rudiments of quantum physics as it is needed, 3. Qubits and computer science rewritten in the form of quantum gates, 4.

The structure of the text as a whole is comprised of long opinion pieces dotted with only semi-related 'steps' in the curriculum building process.If you are looking for a text to help methodically build a curriculum from the ground up, this probably isn't it. It's ok for a quick read-through, but certainly shouldn't be considered a 'textbook'. This is one of ACSIs self-published titles, and as such, lacks the editorial rigor it probably needed to tighten up the text as a whole.

What Brown did here in one fell swoop, though, was to permanently oust himself from The Beatles inner circle by revealing his second face on proceedings (particularly his dislike of Paul, who regarded him as a close friend even while he was researching the book), breaking confidences, dishing dirt and all the while failing to disclose to the band members and their friends what he was really up to while receiving their help, supposedly for a general sixties' memoir.As with all Beatles biographies, there are many glaring and embarassing inaccuracies which suggest a rush-job by co-writer Steven Gaines and I'm not sure if recent editions will have put right any of the incorrect dates, times and attributions but, in the end, none of that matters because the essential appeal of this book is to capture the excitement and pace of The Beatles' eight years together as an unstoppable phenomenon.Along the way, Brown paints not-so-flattering portraits of everyone concerned, (including himself, seemingly bitter that they didn't split up when his boss Brian Epstein died!) but there's no doubting the accuracy of the portraits (as if there could ever be a doubt that John was passive/aggressive and Paul was bossy/charming!) and the narrative is very well-formed; so much so that you may find this easy to finish in a single sitting.It's an essential Beatles biography because it's from the inside but it's also Brown's autobiography, deeply tainted with his own demons, and should be taken in that spirit."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"\\"The love you make...\\" is a good read but just be warned,if you're new to reading about the fab 4 it was NOT all peaches and cream.

I DO understand that Paul and John were the \\"Main\\" Beatles but still, without George and Ringo there would be no Beatles. They WERE very important to the Beatle sound IMHO. Plenty of drug use talk and talk about their love lives, homes as well as trials and tribulations of the business end of the Beatles that I found really interesting. Yoko doesn't fair well as expected and I can see why. It seems to me the business side ruined the Beatles more than anything else. Too much spending, too much money wasting by the powers that ran the business side. Egos got in the way a bit as well.At 52 years old I am still (and will always be) a Beatles fan.

The Love You Make is easy read that spans the Beatles's entire career from their beginnings in Liverpool onto their international superstardom, continuing through the years that followed their disbanding. The authors provide an insider look at their world tours, their personal lives, the relationships within their own inner circle, their experimentation with drugs and eastern meditation, the formation of Apple records, John Lennon's complicated relationships with Brian Epstein, his first wife Cynthia, and his second wife Yoko Ono, and the acrimony following the group's breakup in 1969. Good for fans who want to know more about the Beatles' personal lives, warts and all."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I was twenty-one years old at the time I purchased this book in 1984. I had accumulated a large number of so-called biographies and alleged \\"insiders\\" stories about the Fab Four. Read \\"SHOUT!\\" and \\"THE BEATLES FOREVER\\" - the list goes on and on. Keep in mind this was only a few years after Lennon's death, and the book stores were brimming with a wide variety of Beatle-related books, many published within weeks of Lennon's death. The problem with many of these publications is they were either churned out by unknown authors just trying to ride the wave of the post-1980 \\"Beatlemania\\", or by people who knew the Beatles for a very short period of time, who had taken the liberty of stretching these short encounters into a 200-page book.For those who don't know who Peter Brown is, he worked for the Beatles future manager, Brian Epstien, and later for the Beatles in the Apple Records organization. He was very much involved in the business and personal affairs of the Fab Four up until the very end. He is mentioned by name in the song, \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko.\\" He is the real McCoy.The book differs from many I have read on the topic in that the author tries to avoid overselling his involvement in the events he writes about, but rather tells the story of the people he knew and worked for. I found the book at times to be poignant in its portrayal of the Beatles, showing they were four young men caught up in an enormous wave of fame and fortune, and how they attempted to deal with it. This is not meant to be a \\"feel good\\" biography. It tells a story with a frankness, a frame of reference that only a few people on this earth could have had.The Beatles were interesting people. I have read thousands of pages of garbage on the Fab Four, some written by their own family members! There is a great deal more to be said about this book, but my strong recommendation is for you to read it to see for yourself. Peter Brown does the Beatles justice because he knows what he is talking about. Even after all of these years, this is still my favorite Beatles biography. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"It's been thirty years now since the Beatles split up, and yet to date there has not yet been written the *definitive* story of the Fab Four and their legacy. In this 1983 release, Peter Brown, a longtime business associate of the Beatles, gives his particuar slant on their saga, and the result is a highly engrossing book that anyone interested in the group should definitely read. Brown and ghost writer (?) Steven Gaines do a commendably thorough job of tracing the group's origins, rise, and demise, and along the way there are enough juicy tidbits and revelations to satisfy most Beatlemaniacs, past and present.However, it's only reasonable that no one book on the group will succeed in covering all aspects of their careers with equal depth and insight. Peter Brown was mainly involved in the band's business dealings, and it's in this area that the book shines most brightly. We learn much about Brian Epstein and his managerial style, and about the legal squabbling that accompanied the group's breakup. What is most glaringly missing is adequately in-depth discussion of the Beatles' musical evolution, including insights into how their &quot;sound&quot; was developed, how songs were arranged and mixed, and how each member of the band contributed to the finished product. Brown does provide a bit of this, but clearly the musical end of things was not his strength. I was also disappointed that so little was said about the work of George Martin, whose wisdom and skills were so vital to the group's success.It remains for someone else to write another Beatle biography (hopefully soon), one that will complement Brown's by focusing more on the music rather than the business end of the Beatles' all-too-short time together."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"just finished reading this book...don't get it...this is supposed to be shocking??? All this stuff has been told before. I don't think it makes anyone look particularly bad, just human. I don't understand why lots of people thought it made George and Paul look bad, or why they thought it was more favorable to John. I kept reading, thinking \\"maybe I haven't gotten to the parts yet\\", but got to the end, and never saw anything new. It was definitely not the best beatles book ever written. I've read a lot, and most of them say the same things. Why Paul and Linda bothered to get that excited about it, I'll never know. I think he says something about Linda being a photographer and rock and roll groupie....so what, wasn't everyone then? He did talk about Paul being a control freak, but also that John was not in any shape to take charge at the time. Everyone knows all this. Didn't learn a single thing new, but did enjoy the insight into Brian. He made a few mistakes, but I believe he genuinely loved them, and did the best he could. I do think it was wrong of him to involve Stigwood and think about selling his interests without telling them. Also, having them sign to add 9 years to his royalties without telling them was not good. I think he did feel guilty about it though, and that's part of the reason why he got so out of control near the end. He should have just sat down with them and talked to them honestly about it all instead. they could have worked things out. Someone should have locked John and Paul into a room and kept them there, until they had worked out their differences. John was correct in worrying about taxes (I guess similar to capital gains, a lot all at once), but I wish they did not let money issues ruin their friendship and everything they had meant to each other over the years. Thought the part where Paul calls John and they start yelling about taxes, Paul hangs up and intends to call John Eastman and instead calls John back again and says, \\"John, it's Paul, you won't believe what that f--ing a--hole John Lennon did now\\" and John says, \\"what are you talking about? I'm the f---ing a--hole, John Lennon! I laughed so much! John and Paul should have taken the opportunity to start laughing about it and how ridiculous everything had gotten, and they should have worked it out. I know that John would have normally found that situation very funny, but was too pissed off by the taxes to appreciate the humor! Overall, book was o.k., nothing new, but some of the stuff about Brian was interesting."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Very interesting read for any Beatles fan. It was believable because it showed the Beatles in both positive and negative aspects rather than being biased one way or the other. I just wish there was more detailed information about the post-Beatles years. But then again, this is a Beatles book not an Ex-Beatles book. Overall, it was a very entertaining read. Grab it if you can find it."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I read this book first when I was at the height of my Beatlemania and I don't think either hard-core fans OR the casual variety will be disappointed. This is an intimate memoir of the Beatles and reads like a novel, which I think makes it accessible and interesting to anyone. The portrayal of all of the four Beatles is quite sympathetic, and tries to understand rather than condemn some of their more controversial actions.It's quite accurate, and although occasionally it lapses into literary recreations of real events (be warned-the authors write that something DID happen with John and Brian on that trip to Spain, and describe events like this as the omniscent narrator that \\"sees all\\"-which despite being friends of the Beatles, they did not see everything), almost everything described in the book did take place, which I know because when I was 13 I took the time to read any account I could get my hands on, both first-hand and otherwise!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Just terrific! A real insiders view of the Beatles. The details from all the wives was terrific. The book is equally divided among the four guys, and each of them gets their shoes scuffed. What is so unusual about this book is that for the first time it gives the inside reasons why things panned out the way they did. The writing is moving in places, but I don't imagine the Beatles were very happy with Peter Brown for spillingh the beans."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Sure, it is billed as a Beatles book and the majority of the book revolves around the idea of the Beatles, but this book is not about John, Paul, George, Ringo or the music. I could not even finish the book because it was so maddening. The reader is expected to plow through pages upon pages of rambling about Cynthia Lennon, Brian Epstein, the Beatles' money and cruel tales of how awful the Beatles were. As a Beatles fan, I was appalled at how their legacy was treated in this book. Albums were summed up in a sentence (\\"Oh yeah, they released Revolver this year\\"), songs were NEVER mentioned and none of the excitement or sheer importance of the Beatles was given a glance. It was as if Peter Brown set out to write a book that would disprove their greatest. The Beatles are painted as royal jerks. Sure, they weren't perfect, but I don't think anyone is as cruel as they are written in this book. If you are a Beatles fan, or even an intelligent reader, I caution you to stay as far away from this book as possible."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This is the best Beatles book I've read Peter Brown tells it like it was and since he was there from the start of the Beatles rise to be the best band ever. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I've read tons of books about The Beatles. This one comes from a very reliable source close to the boys. There are so many fascinating stories and photographs in this book! I've heard many of the stories in this book from other people's perspectives in their own books. All the stories are the same but just from different perspectives. If you love The Beatles this one is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This book came out in the early 1980's and, to my knowledge, appeared to be the first major Beatles biography to truly remove the sheen off of the Beatles collective public image. I first read it ten years ago and it made a lasting impression. Although most of us Beatlemaniacs probably knew that the boys lived less than choirboy lifestyles, Peter Brown confirms every suspicion that we may have had with regards to the sex, drugs and hedonism that may have surrounded the band. For this reason, this is a tough read. Contrary to some other reviews, it didn't come across to me that Peter Brown had an axe to grind; I just feel he wanted to set the record straight as he remembered it. As a result, this is an engrossing book for all who appreciated the Beatles - not an easy one, but a worthwhile one."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"While I had a workman's knowledge of the Beatles and their story, being a fan of theirs for nearly twenty years, this was the first \\"biography\\" of the band I have ever chosen to read. Initially I was highly engrossed by Peter Brown's writing, for he has a clear, easy-to-read style that somehow manages to make even pages upon pages of business dealings and contract negotiations fascinating.However, as the story progressed I found myself growing less happy with this book. Mr. Brown clearly has little understanding and knowledge of the creative side of the Beatles' work, or musicianship in general. Therefore the reader is not going to learn very much at all about the creative process involved in Beatles' music, only how it was marketed (and for the most part, mis-managed). And while I have little doubt that many of the more \\"juicy\\" stories of the band members' excesses with drugs, sex, and vanity are true, Brown's increasingly snide attitude about these things and insistence on dwelling on these sordid details quickly turns the mood of the book quite sour. Though he claims to have \\"remained friends\\" with the band members through the years, I would certainly hate it if any of my \\"friends\\" were to write about me with the attitude and obvious contempt Brown seems to show for all the Beatles (save, to an extent, John Lennon.)There is also little evidence presented to back up many of his claims, so one is left to wonder about the truth of certain stories particularly revolving around incidents where Brown clearly was not present. Typos also begin to creep into the later chapters, making one wonder how much of it was rushed through to get to its clumsy, abrupt ending (and why this wasn't smoothed out for later printings).Still, I will give the book 3 out of 5 stars because it did keep me reading from start to finish and presents an interesting take on the behind-the-scenes, business-side of trying to manage what had been the biggest band in the world. But this is far from the definitive story of the Beatles, and I would caution every reader to take Brown's stories--and attitude--with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Probably one of the best rock biographies ever written. I read it (couple of years ago) in almost one go."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I've just finished reading this book for the fourth time in 20 years. It is an excellent, thorough, accurate, and sometimes painful look at the rising star and setting sun that was the Beatles. Brown and Gaines cover it all, including the pathos and pain that were woven into the Beatles' lives and, inevitably, the lives of those closest to them. This book is a biography, not a detailed account of the music they made together. For that I would suggest &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; by Hertsgaard, which is a meticulously documented discography of their music.The Love You Make may not make you happy in the end, but it will give you an insider's view that, up until its release, was unheard of for die-hard fans like me. Only now, with the advent of the volumnious &quot;Anthology&quot; do we have the Beatles' perspective. And that is not truly complete without John Lennon, is it? I highly recommend Brown and Gaines' book."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Growing up, The Beatles were demi-gods. My mother, having been born in 1949, loved Elvis and The Beatles. Early on I found favoritism towards Elvis as our first memorable family vacation was to Graceland. I liked The Beatles but did not find them attractive and charming the way others did. Their music was catchy but I didn't take much from it. As a teen I listened to everything from Rage Against the Machine to Petula Clark but never rested long on The Beatles. In my mind they matched with New Kids on the Block in my book. A part of memorable history but nothing more. In college, I became aware of Lennon's solo music but still didn't quite get it.After reading this book upon request from my mom I finally get it. Sure the book shows some unpleasant, disturbing, and upsetting aspects of the life as a Beatle but if it didn't it wouldn't be a true telling. It would merely exist as another edited fluff story for the public eyes. If, as adults, we cannot handle the \\"bad stuff\\" John, George, Ringo, and Paul did then we are still too disillusioned by the images on the front of our Beatles lunch box.Reading this book has given me a new respect for the foursome. There are aspects about each that I do not like but I am not one to judge. Brown's storytelling is as unbaised as can be when told from someone on the inside. If the story were told from someone outside then it would lack truth. While each Beatle had their flaws, it is commendable that a band under that pressure was able to stick together the way they did.This book made me a Beatles fan, it didn't enrage me. Having been born six months after Lennon was killed might have something to do with it. Perhaps if I were influenced by the media in the 60's I would feel differently but from a true outsider this book changed me. Instead of just humming to Love Me Do on the radio, I'm driving around belting out Yellow Submarine, Hey Jude, and I Wanna Hold Your Hand.This book is a must read for anyone who wants to look beyond the album cover image and can handle it."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"There are some very bitter reviews of this book out there. But consider this if you will: All of the people described in this book are - or were - very wealthy. If any of them were libeled, there would have been a lawsuit. Particularly with Paul McCartney! In fact, this book does NOT paint Paul in a negative light at all. No way. If anything, the author gives Paul the benefit of the doubt. This book also does NOT paint Yoko Ono as being evil. He describes the primary reason for the Beatles' breakup as having been John's heroin addiction. And the way he goes about it makes complete sense. I have heard George Harrison's report that this book is \\"utter rubbish.\\" Well, I can understand why he said that. It was always part of the Beatles' agreement to keep things quiet, and George was \\"the quiet Beatle.\\" More importantly, this book reveals some incriminating things about George's divorce from his first wife, about Eric Clapton's involvement, etc. Rather than confirm that he screamed at his wife, pushed her in a car and roared off, rather than confirm that only his first solo album was a creative success, why not call the whole book \\"rubbish?\\" If George had been libeled he would have sued. The book sold quite well, and George could have claimed quite a few pounds for himself. He did not. THE DOWN SIDE to this book is quite small, actually. The author DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE MAKING OF THE MUSIC. He does not describe George Martin in great detail, does not describe how Martin brought the best out of the group, how he liked THIS song the best, encouraged them to use horns on THAT song, etc. George Martin was considered the \\"fifth beatle.\\" But here Peter Brown calls somebody named Neil Aspinall the fifth Beatle, says Aspinall \\"was just as much a Beatle as any of them.\\" Well, why? The author mentions Aspinall many times, but never in great detail. That disappointed me, and together with the exclusion of George Martin's role in the music making cost this rating one star. Otherwise the book is fantastic."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This was the most amazing journey through the lives of the young Beatles, their experiences and their growth. Also a great social commentary on the sub culture, politics and fashion that the Beatles inspired. Even if you're not a great fan of the Beatles, this is a fantastic read! Best book I've read in ages!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I used this biography in my senior term paper in high school. I found it to be an interesting and easy read. A plus is that it was written by Peter Brown a close associate to the Beatles(he's even mentioned in the Ballad of John and Yoko)."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I first read this book in 1986 and found it very engrossing and a well written insider's account of what Beatlemania was really about behind closed doors. However, that's the problem. Today I look at the book as a &quot;tell all&quot; that makes the Beatles nothing more than greedy sex/drug addicts that created music on the side.If you read the book, then you know he is not too flattering about Paul's escapades. In a 1984 interview with Playboy, Paul &amp; Linda disowned the book and felt betrayed by Brown, whom they had once considered a good friend. The interview also says that Brown tricked them into spilling the beans, claiming he was writing a book on the 1960s music scene, and not The Beatles specifically. If you read the intro to the book, Brown claims he had &quot;full&quot; cooperation of the surviving Beatles and Yoko Ono, and that they willing let the cat out of the bag for the information that makes up most of the juicy details of the book. As a result of this book, you hardly see Peter Brown mentioned by any of the Beatles these days, much less anyone else. For someone who was also close to the band, you wonder why it's full of factual errors and such. And Brown tries to make it appear he was there 24/7 with all the Beatles. A lot of the material seemed to have been lifted off various articles and interviews done around the time the book was written, and re-written into narrative form as if he were there.Brown also clumsily ends the book with that poem John wrote Stu Sutcliffe in 1961 (&quot;I can't remember anything without a sadness...&quot;). However, that is taken out of context, since it only contains the first verse. If you read the actual full poem, it becomes full of Lennon's trademark &quot;color metaphors&quot; (if you will) that hardly fits his epitaph, since the book concludes with his assassination.Stick with Nicholas Schaffner's &quot;The Beatles Forever.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"...A Fountain Of Misinformation.\\"One of the things that I found the most agitating about this book is the fact that the author, Peter Brown, titled it after one of the Beatles' most profound lyrics, when he obviously doesn't LOVE the Beatles like you or I do. In fact, he seems to have an apparent axe to grind against most of the Beatles and their associates. Upon nearly every mention of Brian Epstein's, George's, Ringo's, and especially Paul's name, Brown manages to slip in a subtle (and occasionally blatant) put-down. John also gets his share of the smack, but it is far less vicious and accusatory. The reason for John's somewhat (for lack of a better word) \\"gentle\\" treatment, I believe, is because his tragic death occured when this book was about halfway finished, therefore making this book probably one of the first writings to have that \\"John was smart and always right and Paul was dumb and wrong about everything he did\\" attitude. Brown's favoritism towards John is too obvious (perhaps because John \\"immortalized\\" him in song), especially in the final three chapters where he discusses each of the Beatles' lives after the breakup--Paul, George, & Ringo share one chapter between them, while John gets a full two!Some of the more annoying characteristics of Brown's words include his selling himself and this book on the fact that he was an \\"insider\\" and building up his own importance. (\\"I told Paul to junk it . . . but Paul's ego wouldn't let him consider this.\\") The phrase \\"revealed here for the first time\\" also becomes quite irritating. The worst thing, however, is that most of his \\"facts\\" are completely or at least partially wrong! (I rolled my eyes quite often throughout this book.) The book reads like a fictional story rather than a biography. What I mean is, Brown retells the stories of events that happened as if he were there, which, for at least 95% of them, he wasn't. (For example, in his story of George's visit to Haight-Ashbury: \\"Out of the crowd came a guitar, which was thrust into George's hands. 'No...no, please,' George stammered, trying to return it. 'Play!' someone shouted in the crowd . . . George gave Pattie a sick look. He began to strum a few chords, but the acid made the cheap guitar feel like a lump of cheese in his hands . . . George insistently returned the guitar, with profuse apologies, and they tried to make a break for it back to the car. Angry hoots were heard as the mood of the rejected crowd turned malevolent.\\" I know it's been long documented that George had a bad time there, but there is plenty of literary and photographic proof that Brown's version isn't accurate.) Reading this book reminded me a lot of the kids in grade school who'd tattle about every little thing, usually making up lies. To give Brown his due, I do admit that his first-hand recounts of the terrifying incidents in Japan and the Phillipines which happened during the Beatles' final tour are excellent.Brown's strong point is obviously his knowledge of the financial aspect of the Beatles' lives, as he quotes quite a few figures throughout the book (how accurate they actually are can't be certain). However, when discussing their songs, lyrics, or phyches, he appears rather foolish. Unprofessionally for a biographer, he can't seem to keep his personal opinions to a minimum. (What I found most hilarious was that, towards the end of the book, he mentions a project comprising of video footage of the Beatles being put together by Neil Aspinall. Brown calls it \\"pathetic.\\" Well, 15 years later, this \\"pathetic\\" project turned out to be The Beatles Anthology...something much bigger and much better than Peter Brown's little storybook.)I rate this book 2 stars because, inaccuracies aside, it actually IS entertaining. However, believe in many of Brown's words and you'll end up feeling depressed, I'm sure, as he absolutely does NOT focus on ANYTHING positive. If you haven't read many Beatles books yet, this is definately not recommended. For an unbiased look at the Beatles, try Nicholas Schaffner's \\"The Beatles Forever,\\" which came out a few years before \\"The Love You Make.\\""},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"As the paperback cover states, longtime Beatle insider Peter Brown dishes out the dirt, National Enquirer style. Written with the cooperation of the Beatles, their wives/girlfriends etc., there was nonetheless a backlash when they read what went to print (though they didn't deny much of it) and he was forever cut from the Beatles' inner circle. Lots of information about the drug and sexual habits of those cuddly Liverpudlians, as well as the antics of manager Brian Epstein. Nice to know these things, but I think I'll just listen to their music."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Of all the Beatle books I've read, this is the most disappointing. Peter Brown gained immortality when he was mentioned by name in \\"The Ballad of John & Yoko\\", and I expected to get a good feel for what it was like to be inside the maelstrom of Beatlemania -- and for what the Fab Four were like in person. But Brown's portraits are one-sided and facile. John Lennon is described as relentlessly sarcastic and drug-crazed. We never see the warm side Paul and George often talk about, nor do we glimpse the creative man behind the songs. In this book, Paul is a sex-crazed skirt chaser, George an ignorant lout who is called \\"his lectureship\\" behind his back, and Ringo a lovable incompetant -- a \\"poor little man\\" who lucked into the bigtime, but was no longer good enough to play regularly for the band in the latter years. Brian Epstein is even more pitiable in Brown's descriptions, and we're told (without proof) of a sexual encounter between Epstein and Lennon. We're also told (again without proof) of an affair between George Harrison and Ringo's first wife, Maureen. Road manager Neil Aspinall also doesn't escape Brown's condescention -- his efforts to compile a Beatles retrospective from archival films is described as \\"pitiful\\" as he watched flickering images of his younger self during the heights of Beatlemania. (Wouldn't I love to be able to look at films of myself in my 20's cavorting with the Fabs!) The book is also full of inaccuracies, making me wonder if Brown ever actually listened to Beatle music. Sorry Peter, John does NOT say \\"I buried Paul\\" at the end of \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", he says \\"Cranberry Sauce\\"; and George does NOT play a \\"neo-Indian raga\\" at the end of \\"Rain\\". When you're presented with \\"facts\\" like this that you know are wrong, you're never sure how much else is right. Certainly, this book is not as sensationalistic or smutty as Albert Goldman's \\"The Lives of John Lennon\\", but then, Goldman wasn't pretending to give an \\"insider's view\\" of the band. After reading this, I can fully understand why Paul and Linda McCartney burned their copy in the family fireplace."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I'll freely admit that I enjoyed this book. It's a dishy, gossipy, tabloid biography of the first order, and I found myself staying up till 5 am to finish it.That being said, TLYM is not a particularly reliable history of the Beatles, and it's rife with glaring inaccuracies. Much information is presented as fact with no corroboration, and Peter Brown's credibility isn't exactly stellar -- as others have pointed out, the remaining Beatles and their associates were highly critical of the book, viewing it as a betrayal of trust by Brown. Still, even with the book's self-conscious sensationalism (the authors have an annoying tendency to hugely overuse variations of the phrase &quot;revealed here for the first time&quot;) many of the anecdotes are amusing, and the insight into the life of Brian Epstein and detail about the workings of Apple Corps. are interesting.Overall, this book is not the worst Beatles tome out there; certainly more biased accounts than this have been penned about the fab four over the years. If some of the more unlikely tales, as well as Brown's claim to ultimate insider status, are taken with a grain of salt, TLYM makes for an interesting diversion for any Beatles fan looking for more than just analysis of songs and recording procedures."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"WARNING: don't let this be the first Beatle book you read.Although the book is said to be about the Beatles, it's really about John, John and his first wife Cynthia, John and his second wife Yoko, Brian Epstein, more John, some Paul, Cynthia after her divorce, a little more John, and then those other two Beatles, George and what's-his-name. John is a drug-addicted maniac, but even while trashed on heroin he's still a better person than Paul, who is an ego-centric sap whose every song is \\"saccarine,\\" and George, who's boring and bitter. Oh, and Ringo...all I remember about him from the book is that he was incredibly spendthrift and really in the end was just lucky to be there. There is also a significant amount of the book dedicated to John's first wife, Cynthia, and their supremely awful relationship. Much of it was painful to read.I don't think a biography has an obligation to make the protagonists look better than they are, but this book seems to go out of its way to villianize people and make them look awful. Ironically, of course, the two people who come out of the book looking the best are John and Yoko, who just about everyone agrees were incredibly destructive individuals. I don't think it's a coincidence that Peter Brown was name-checked in a John Lennon song, and not a Paul or George song.On a positive note, the insight into Brian's life is the most complete of all the Beatle books I have read; some people complain the book makes him look awful, but in reality he did the best he could with his limited knowledge of how to manage a band. And there are plenty of fun stories about the boys...to have been mentioned by name in a Beatles song means that he was definitely in the right places at the right times.Although my guess is that because the original edition of this book was released very soon after John's death, the editors wanted more John content to appeal to the renewed interest in his life. However, decades later, the book is uneven and unfairly dismissive of Paul, Ringo and George. Paul really gets the shaft in this book...Lord knows he's not perfect but this book makes him look worse than Allan Klein, who is regarded by just about everyone as the devil himself. And Ringo and George don't really look bad...or good...it's hard to look like anything when you're given about a paragraph in every chapter, if that. Cynthia Lennon gets mentioned more than they do.And what about the music? Obviously Peter Brown wasn't involved in the music production side of things, but to only rarely MENTION their songs or anything about them seemed a little ridiculous. I don't want Billboard charts or technical breakdowns of the song structures, but some insight into the songwriting, their personal feelings about the songs, or the guest artists they brought in (Eric Clapton's guest stint on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is given a one-sentence mention; Billy Preston's guest appearance on the \\"Let It Be\\" album is totally ignored) would have been nice.While this book did have a lot of secrets and stories and other content unknown before it was published, that was years ago, and there are newer books on the Beatles that have all the information from this book, as well as more inside stories and more factual information about the music, and are more pleasant reads and are fairer to the boys. \\"A Day in the Life\\" by Mark Hertsgaard provides information about the boys and will fill you in on the musical side of things as well. And my favorite Beatle book so far has been \\"Magical Mystery Tours\\" by Tony Bramwell, a friend of the boys and eventual Apple employee, gives generous insight into the lives of the boys, while being honest and fair."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Of all the books about The Beatles, good, bad and indifferent, this to me is the most disappointing. Peter Brown was a genuine insider, able to see the interactions of the band members close up and to get a real feel for what made them tick. He could have written an insightful biography of the most celebrated group ever from a perspective which very few people could match. Instead, he chose to tell the story in the expose fashion of a British tabloid, full of lascivious drooling and implied moral deprecation. From the moment I read the first chapter, which deals with John and Yoko's first night together, I knew this was going to be a bumpy ride and so it proved.Brown's obvious lack of musical knowledge means that the really important aspect of The Beatles existence, their music, is barely touched upon and then in only the most elementary and banal way. Instead of using his privileged position to talk about how The Beatles' lives and experiences affected their music, he simply embarks on a long recitation of who did what and with what and to whom, as though the music was a sideline to the real story. As a result, I came away with no feeling that I knew more about what motivated and inspired the production of some of the greatest popular music in history, but more a feeling of embarrassment, as though I'd been peeking through a keyhole at someone in the bathroom.Not only that, but the book is totally unreliable on factual matters which a minimum of research would have uncovered. A few examples: the name of Cilla Black's first single, a Lennon/McCartney song called 'Love Of The Loved', is here called 'Love Of The Love'; the date of recording of The Beatles second single, 'Please Please Me', is given as February 1963, when it was already in the charts (it was actually recorded in November 1962); describing the famous airport press conference on February 7th 1964, which every Beatles fan has seen dozens of times, who said what is wrong in Brown's account. These matters (of which this is but a tiny sample), though minor in themselves, are readily verifiable and should be accurate in any serious study. It casts doubt on everything Brown says in respect of matters not so easily checked. Indeed, it's obvious from the context of some of Brown's descriptions that he's making up what he thought might have happened instead of what he actually observed.What makes all this doubly sad is that many people, including all the Beatles, their families, friends and associates gave freely of their time never, I am sure, imagining that a book like this would be the result. It's shameful that with an almost unique opportunity to write a genuinely informative book, Brown should have turned out this poor excuse for a biography. I'm not suggesting that the members of the band should be whitewashed; quite the opposite, as some of the music they produced was a direct result of their experiences, negative as well as positive. However, far too much of this book is written simply to titillate and demean for its own sake, with no thought of anything but selling more books to those who have no real interest in The Beatles, but like to read dirt about public figures.There's no love in this book and no interest for anyone who wants to learn more about the Beatles phenomenon. A sorry effort."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"First of all let me say, if you like reading about the Beatles, this isn't a bad book. That said, this is a bit salacious for my tastes. Brown carries an obvious torch for Lennon at the expense of everyone else. The phrase \\"revealed here for the first time\\" gets overused and gives the book the feel of a \\"Geraldo In Al Capone's Vault\\" tv spectacular."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Being a Beatlephile of the Highest Order, I have exhaustively read and researched my favorite topic, that being the four Beatles -- individually and as a group. While I know for a fact that Peter Brown was an integral part of their history, I can't help but wonder, whose lives he was observing. While his recounting of their basic history is, for the most part, anecdotally accurate, for someone who claims to have been a member of the coveted \\"Inner Circle\\" he frequently gets the facts completely wrong. From whence did he get his information? Certainly, these revelations cannot be from \\"eyewitness\\" accounts; there is much archival video footage that exists which proves him wrong time and time again. In this regard I found this accounting of the Beatles lives very disappointing. His personal opinions of his employers are, at best, tinged with a great deal of hard feelings and unabashed disdain. It is very easy for someone who relied on The Beatles for their livelihood to throw stones; they were, after all four average mortal men who, together, found a way to create incredible magic. That doesn't mean that the magic necessarily carried over into their personal lives as well, nor should it have been expected that it would. It's a pity no one bothered to proof this catastrophe before it was published. Spend your money on Spitz. At least he did the research."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This book, which I bought at a book sale,was interesting enough to read in two days flat, so I can reccomend in to anyone on that level. However, I've got issues with a lot of it. Firstly, the author, Peter Brown, is extremly subjective, to put it lightly. He likes some Beatles, and dislikes others, and makes it extremly obvious who he favors. According to the book, Paul's an arrogant control freak, Ringo's a talentless lout, and George barley figures in anywhere. The book focuses on John most of the time. There's also a lack of infromation on music and albums, most of it is personal, which brings up the question: How could Brown be aware of all this? I, personally, never trusted the contents of the book, after Brown stated John was the oldest, when it is common knowlege that Ringo is older. Also, the story he tells on how George got into the skiffle band completely contridicts what I read in the Beatles anthology. If you can deal with those issues, buy it. As I told you, it is extremely entertaining."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"It's interesting to hear Peter Brown tell his side of the story. I first read this book over 20 years ago, and recently read it again. While informative and interesting, I do find some of Peter Brown's \\"Dirty Little Secrets\\" about the Beatles to be unfair and distasteful. Brian has been dead since the 1960's and John Lennon has not been with us since 1980. Both Paul & Ringo deny some of the situations described in this book, and George denounced the book as \\"Utter Rubbish\\". And since a lot of the wild oulandish stories in this book are made about John (who obviously was not around at this book's first printing to comment), I'd say that both Brown & Gaines took advantage of John's absence and made one hell of a killing off of their \\"dirty little book\\". But what the hell, I read it...TWICE! So can you. Just don't believe EVERYTHING you read here. There were enough incidences of \\"Bad Behavior\\" admitted by the Beatles themselves in the \\"Anthology\\" series. So now, re-tooled for 2006, this \\"tell-all\\" book comes off a little lame. But it's still \\"back-stabbing good fun\\" is it not? Getting caught is much more sensational than a confession, isn't it? I quote from the same song (The ballad Of John & Yoko) In which John made Peter Brown's name immortal: \\"Christ, you know it ain't easy!\\" Thanks a lot Peter Brown, for crucifying our heroes. I always feel better when someone I love is slandered and smeared, don't you? God Forgive you Peter Brown."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Who knows how much of what Peter Brown says is true? It's clear that many of the anecdotes he relates have been discredited (i.e., John Lennon's one night stand with Brian Epstein), but this is still an entertaining light read for anyone who likes or loves The Beatles.The opening chapter makes you sad--Brown begins with Cynthia Lennon coming home from a weekend trip to find Yoko Ono casually counging around the house in Cynthia's bathrobe. You can almost feel how humiliated she must have been.Five stars as a good beach book, with the caveat that it's far from complete and not completely reliable."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the BeatlesThis book was first published in 1984 which is when I first heard of it. I picked it up in 1988 and read it through so often and thoroughly, I began calling it the Gospel According to Beatles, because it was like a religious book to me. That should tell you how entertainingly Peter Brown and (I'm sure mostly) Steve Gaines relate Peter's story of the Beatles.Sadly, so much of it is simply made up details based on some actual facts. Even worse, Peter Brown ends up (in my opinion) equating the \\"order\\" of the Beatles (John, Paul, George, and Ringo) with their worth as human beings and/or entertainers, John winning out even if it's only because Brown trashes him least.One of the butts of this book is Ringo, and who knows what the most friendly and fun loving of the Beatles ever did to Brown. I'll just say here that except on the songs where Beatles fans KNOW Paul played the drums, Ringo pounded the skins on every lick, and he was quite capable of coming up with great drums parts for some of the greatest rock songs ever written, thank you. Was he the greatest rock drummer ever? No, but he was a great drummer for the greatest rock band ever, and that says a LOT! At one point in the book \\"The Beatles Recording Sessions\\", author Mark Lewisohn stops to acknowledge that Ringo's flubs were SO rare in the recording studio, the other members would rib him loudly because he would occassionally fall to their level.The other butt is George. Religious zealots are easy targets because we're all imperfect, and it's hard to hold back when one of them doesn't live up to his own standards. Because of this (and because I don't believe George's religion anyway), I cut him a lot of slack where Brown tears him down. And again, George was not the best lead guitarist in the world. Far from it, but he was the lead guitarist in the best band in the world, and he came up with lines and solos that sound like they were composed perfectly for the compositions they fit into. That says a LOT!Those points said, don't bother with this book or most other bios. Watch The Beatles Anthology, read The Beatles Anthology, read the Beatles personal interviews and discover these men for yourself! They spoke well for themselves, but they were imperfect humans, so don't expect anything more. Anyway, it's the music that they made which makes us love them! The works still stand tall! Enjoy them and admire the imperfect people who made them as great at what they did! Then go write a song of your own and see how hard they worked!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This is one of my favorite Beatles books. Call it guilty pleasure, if you will. It was the first one I read that told the Beatles' story like a movie, where you could actually \\"see\\" what was happening to them. I read it when it had just been published. I couldn't put it down and I've read it more than once. I also remember the angry reactions it got from the most faithful fans. More than 20 years have gone by and most of the revelations contained here have been confirmed by other insiders. Even some names that the authors chose to change have been revealed (like the dentist who turned the Beatles on to LSD). Interestingly, Pattie Boyd has only kind words for Peter Brown in her recently published book \\"Wonderful Tonight\\". She never even mentions Brown's book, which Paul and Linda chose to burn without reading (and Linda \\"photographed it as it burned page by page\\", as she told Playboy).Why did Peter Brown choose to break his code of silence? Greed? Something personal? The ironic thing is that this book may have been the reason why Albert Gouldman went too far in his book about John Lennon. Someone had beat him to the real thing, so he had to \\"embellish\\" some stories to make them more scandalous. And the outcome was that he lost his credibility as a writer.If you feel that, as a Beatles fan, you should remain loyal to your idols, don't buy this book. But you will miss one of the best narrations of their story as it really happened."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This is the first book I ever read about the Beatles when I was 17, fourteen years ago. Since then, I have read dozens of books about the boys, but this one is truly hard to top. When I first read it, I thought the author must have sensationalized much of what happened, because the Beatles' story seemed so incredibly dramatic and juicy. But when I returned to the book several years later, I was struck by how accurate the book was. Although Phillip Norman's book, the one frequently cited as \\"the\\" definitive text, is essential reading, this is really just as good. Unlike Norman's serious book, Brown makes no bones about utilizing all of the juicy aspects of the Beatles' saga in a narrative that reads like a best-selling novel rather than a biography. I don't disagree that some of the details are a shade inaccurate and some notorious rumors are promulgated in this book, but isn't so much of the fun in being a Beatles fan in doing the detective work of reading all of the different books on the Beatles and figuring out for yourself how the events really unfolded? Furthermore, any mistakes in the book seem like the product of misinformation rather than maliciousness, and really, very little in the book is incorrect. Anyway, this book is the most readable of all the books on the boys, and as this is the one that instigated my almost religous obsession with the boys--whether that's an endorsement or warning is for you to decide--I highly recommend it. And my god, look at that fantastic new cover!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"When I first was introduced to the Beatles music, I loved it right away because of the sound and mood it gave. I was so impressed with the fab 4 that I went to the library as soon as possible to find out a little about them. I happened to come across the best Beatles story available. The Love You Make told each detail as someone living the story would see it...that's because the author did live it. The Peter Brown from 'The Ballad of John and Yoko' wrote the book. I was hooked till the end. Since then, I've read several other books about the Beatles, but none have come close to being as good as this one. If you want to know the true story of the Beatles, this is the book you should choose!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Whether or not you are a fan of the Beatles, this book is absolutely gripping. It reads like a juicy soap-opera of drug-addiction, bitching over money, sex scandals and the messy break-up. Beware though-I came away thinking that that Beatles and their entourage of wives, girlfriends, financers, and suck-ups were a bunch of jerks.Extremely well-written though."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This is an amazing book because it's written from the inside, with the help of the Beatles themselves and their wives and girfriends, so it's full of gossip. But it also seems pretty authentic that this was the way it really happened. John, Paul, George and Ringo became real people to me. The book was fascinating, it was like ten biographies in one."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This book is shocking, lurid, depressing. Quite why former Beatles confidante Peter Brown should want to turn on his employers by hooking up with slash and burn writer Gaines is not known to me. But, God help me, it's interesting. Good for those who can stand gossip, with all the pros and cons that entails."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Peter Brown, the Beatles' business manager after Brian Epstein's death, documents his recollections of all the events surrounding the Beatles' divorce. I can not help but believe that he has painted an accurate portrait. Brown had access to dozens of individuals that were connected to the Beatles in some way and that add the feeling of authenticity.I read the book every couple of years and it seems to be more powerful each time. It does not paint the Beatles, as individuals, in a very favorable manner, and it is a bit disturbing. However, if you want &quot;the story&quot; this is as close as you will probabally get."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I picked this book up on a whim at a used bookstore and I'm SOOO glad I did. I'm really not one to get hung up on the recordings of the Beatles as far as what they did when, what they used, how they recorded, etc. and I was glad this book didn't shove those facts down my throat. Mostly, it is a more human look at the four boys, and is at some times brutal. For example, after reading one portion, for about two weeks I strongly disliked John Lennon (who is my favorite Beatle!) Any book that can evoke such raw emotion is amazing. This is a must-have for anyone who wants to gain a better into the people behind the music."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"It seems as though many people have rated this poorly. I have to disagree. I've read many books about the Beatles and this is one of my favorites. I first read this after seeing the Beatles Anthology on T.V. when I was eleven years old. I loved this book. Reading \\"The Love you make\\" is a guilty pleasure like no other for any Beatles fan. Although there are inaccuracies it's a good read."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I cant beleive someone would put down the Beatles and Paul McCartney the he did."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"This book was excellent. I took great pleasure in reading this life story of the Beatles from beginning to end. The Beatles story is one not easily told to the truth. This story however was written by insider Peter Brown and has a good view of what it was really like being in their shoes. It explains how they lived, what they did, and why they made decisions that they may regret. Hopefully you will find this book as good as it is."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"...many of them by insiders and this one is no more or less revealing than the others. And it is clear that PB dislikes Paul, totally dismisses Ringo as a person and a musician, tolerates George, loves George's wife, and idolizes John, that is, until he doesn't. And for such an insider, there are some basic wrong facts, such as saying that Linda attended college in Colorado, when it was actually Arizona, and that the Beatles good friend Mal, was just an employee, when in fact all of the Beatles have said they considered him one of their closest friends. It gets a little old to read his \\"you heard it here first\\" stories...I don't know, maybe he was the first to print some of the items, but they have all been rehashed so many times, they are all familiar.It is not a bad book...I just wish he had managed to reign in his personal feelings a bit more, he sounds bitter; maybe Paul did not like HIM, so he determines to insult Paul at every turn, practically calling him a no-talent hack, which no matter how you feel about PM, this could never be true.All in all, it tells the story, if you don't know it already, and he does admit that John turned into a drug-addled fool toward the end, which no one could deny with a straight face. If Yoko didn't personally wreck the Beatles, heroin did, and she introduced John to that, so it amounts to the same thing. How John treated Cynthia and Julian can never be seen as anything but brutal and classless and at least PB agrees with this.Mainly, if you can overlook his repeated slurs against Paul, it isn't a bad book. But if you are a McCartney fan, you'll soon get annoyed."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"If (like me) you're dying to know which Beatle had the biggest package, which Beatle got the clap in Hamburg, which Beatle had crabs, which Beatle probably got fellated by Brian and which Beatle slept with which other Beatle's wife, read this book. Just make sure you read Bob Spitz' extensive biography \\"The Beatles\\", Geoff Emerick's masterwork \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\", Richard DiLello's \\"The Longest Cocktail Party\\" and watch the Anthology videos first so you can separate the fact from the fuzzy fiction.And if (like me) you've read at least three Beatle bios, you'll find all sorts of glaring inaccuracies in this book; dates and times are often mixed up, locations are occasions are sometimes wrong, and Brown is anything but impartial when talking about Paul, Linda and Yoko. It's all too clear that in Brown's mind The Beatles coldness caused Brian to overdose, John was a heartless fool for leaving Cynthia, Paul could do nothing right, Jane Asher was the ideal woman for Paul and he should have been shot for letting her get away, Linda was an talentless, ambitious groupie pothead who got lucky and Yoko was a talentless, ambitious, spiteful and vindicive Lady MacBeth who was guilty of prompting John to murder the dream of The Beatles. Oh, and Paul was being petty and vindictive when he made the agonizing decision to sue for the dissolution of The Beatles; after all, if he really loved the other Beatles he would have let them continue f***ing him for the seven years that were left on his contract while Apple rotted under Allen Klein's mismanagement.This book is an odd read. On one hand, you get the idea that Peter Brown was a man who loved the four Beatles and on the other you get the idea that he is a deeply wounded yet very gossipy survivor of the worst split in the history of rock and roll.(PS- I feel it is important that I clarify that I don't agree with Peter Brown; I believe that John, Yoko, Paul and especially Linda were and are beautiful people, and frankly Jane Asher seemed a bit too stuck up for Paul.)"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"When I bought this book, I hoped to learn more about the efforts that went into their making of the music. Part of the problem there is that the Beatles apparently didn't want people in the studio when they were making the music, but still I hoped that something would have been pieced together from interviews. Instead, the book is an unflattering account of the worst events in each Beatle's life (as well as the lives of their significant others). If someone knew nothing about the Beatles and read this book, he/she would surmise that these four guys are schmucks who somehow made a lot of money on their music despite being totally dysfunctional. That said, if you are interested in what a lousy father and husband the drug-addicted John was, what a hapless loser the religious fanatic George was, how the Beatles succeeded in spite of a no-talent Ringo, and what a ruthless tyrant the egocentric Paul was, this is the book you're looking for!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I would give this O stars if I could. Peter Brown describes events he did not actually witness and recounts exact conversations that he did not hear. Lies, distortions, exaggerations. And not a shred of insight into the music. Some people like to waste their money on garbage, though. But I don't. Glad I checked this out of the library first before buying it. It's not worth owning."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"I read this book three times through out my life. It does a really great job of making a reader feel as if they were right there, and actually know the Beatles. The author has no problem gossiping over the Beatles' use of groupies and drugs, which may seem kind of harsh to some, for someone who was a trusted friend to the Beatles. I am interested to know what all the \\"inaccuracies\\" claimed by other reviewers are."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Peter Brown gave an insider view of The Beatles' life, but he dedicate most of the book to John and Brian lives, leaving the other Beatles as fillers in the story. Even more, John and Brian always seems to be the heroes while Paul is almost always the bad guy. It is interesting to read as you get to know unkown details of their lives, but at the same, what we care the most, their music legacy, is rarely discussed in the book."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"For a short time, when I was 19, I lived with my grandmother. A few months ago, at 33, I went back to clear out her basement when she went to a nursing home and found this book that had meant so much to me in those far-off days when I was a spring chicken, rock and roll was god, everything was before me and the Beatles ruled my universe (well, them and Jim Morrison, the Velvets and other '60s idols). I picked it up and re-read it and almost cried thinking of those days past when this kind of information meant everything to me. How did John and Paul meet? How did the other Beatles feel about Yoko? Who turned the Beatles on to drugs? (The answer probably won't surprise you.) What was going on with Brian Epstein and John? What happened when the Beatles met Elvis? Read and remember. What a trip!"},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Peter Brown was one of the few guys who managed to make it out at the other end of the Beatles Blitzkrieg reasonably intact. In this book he shares his experiences and observations in a very matter of fact style. He takes on the whole Beatles madness in one felled swoop.The hard-core fan who has read everything out there on the Beatles might not find a whole lot of new information here, but for a beginning fan (or someone who has a moderate knowledge of the Beatles) Brown's book is one of the better historical assessments of the band. This is partly because Brown is not an ego-maniac or embellisher: in fact, the writing in this book is far from flowery. It is also partly due to the fact that Brown had such a long-time working relationship with the Beatles (he was witness at both John's marriage to Yoko and Paul's to Linda, and is one of the few people immortalized by name in a Beatles' song.)Brown essentially took over a lot of managerial duties after Epstien died and became a bigwig at Apple. In fact, he was so well respected by the Beatles that he was one of the few people to have survived Allen Klien's purges (at the Beatles request.)But enough about his credibility.This book provides an insider's look at the Beatles phenomenon. Brown has an intimate perspective on each of the four because he worked so close with them over the years and he is able to tap this wealth of nostalgia to give the reader a great overview of those fab years. He has co-written this book with another fellow, Steven Gaines, who does a decent job of holding the narrative together. I am always a little wary of books that are co-authored by someone (seems kind of wrong to me, like co-sex or co-taking a dump) but I suppose I can cut some slack to Brown seeing as he is not a writer by trade. Plus, it is hardly uncommon.A unique thing about this book, also, is that its author had a close relationship with Brian Epstien. What this book is able to offer, in addition to the regular biographical stuff on the Beatles, is a fair amount of insight into what made their manager tick. This aspect of the book reminds the reader what an important factor Epstien was in the success of the Beatles.So there it is. A little less snazzy of a read that Hunter's book, but a more thorough and well-rounded job. The right balance of detail and readability."},{"Title":"The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles","review":"Peter Brown is one of those Lennon named as pissed at The Beatles because their breakup meant the end of the gravy train for such as Brown, who was a late-comer as it was.This was originally rushed into print shortly after Lennon was murdered (as were so many others intending to capitalize) -- and, \\"coincidentally,\\" no longer able to respond to the dirt Brown peddles against him.

However, this book has become slightly outdated and is too narrowly focused on the cases of Africa.

Stanley Thompson, MD and James C. Folk, MD. Anyone faced with losing vision from macular degeneration the most common cause of blindness in individuals over the age of 50 will benefit from reading this book.Lee Allen at 87 Lee Allen's life was always about drawing and painting. He worked as a young man under Grant Wood. But during the Great Depression of the 1930's, he needed a way to survive so he took a job as an artist that was being offered by Dr. C. S. O'Brien in the Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Iowa. The unwritten deal between these two men was that Allen would, for the moment, put aside his aspirations in the fine arts and concentrate on becoming the best ophthalmic illustrator in the country. O'Brien asked Lee to attend all the lectures offered to the ophthalmologists in training, to take his work to national meetings, and to publish his findings under his own name in the ophthalmic literature, whether he had the appropriate academic degrees or not. Lee Allen took this contract seriously.In this book, a biographical sketch of Lee Allen reviews some of his many accomplishments and contributions to ophthalmic practice.When Lee was 78, he began to recognize the first signs of age-related macular degeneration in his left eye.

Born in Berdichev, Ukraine in 1905, Grossman rose to prominence and received national acclaim as a war reporter for Red Star, the official newspaper of the Red Army. Grossman's coverage of the Battle for Stalingrad was popular and well known. In fact, Grossman may have been the first reporter to tell the story of the Holocaust, beginning with his reports subsequent to the liberation of Treblinka in Poland. Prior to the publication (abroad) of Forever Flowing Grossman had seen his other major work, Life & Fate, banned by the KGB. In February 1961, a KGB Colonel, Vladimir Prokopenko came to Grossman's flat not to arrest Grossman but to arrest his novel \\"Life and Fate\\". Grossman's manuscripts, carbon copies, notebooks and typewriter ribbons were all seized. These events took contemporaneously with the authorized publication in the USSR of Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich. An explanation of why Grossman was perceived as more of a threat than Solzhenitsyn can be gleaned from the contents of Forever Flowing. (The story of the eventual publication of Life and Fate is best left to reviewers of that book.)\\"Forever Flowing\\" tells a simple, yet emotionally deep and politically nuanced tale. The story begins with the 1957 return to Moscow of Ivan Grigoryevich after 30 years of forced labor in the Gulag. (1957 marked the year in which the tide of returning prisoners of the Gulag reached its peak.) He arrives at the flat of his cousin, Nikolay Andreyevich. Nikolay, a scientist with less than stellar skills, has reached some measure of success at the laboratory through dint of being a survivor. He reaches the top of his profession only after those of his more talented colleagues are skimmed from the laboratory after purges (Stalin's last campaign - the Doctors Plot - seems to be referenced here) and other typical political campaigns. The meeting in the flat is entirely unsatisfactory for both parties. Nikolay is particularly upset (although he is not capable of figuring out why) as he sees his pale imitation of a life reflected through the prism of his cousin's 30 year journey. Grossman paints a vivid picture of Nikolay, more than a bit jealous that Ivan's light had always shone brighter than his own prior to Ivan's arrest. Nikolay suffers from the guilt of one who was not arrested and who is painfully aware of the choices he made to keep from being arrested. In that sense having Ivan sit across from him at the dinner table disturbs Nikolay no end because Ivan represents a mirror into which Nikolay can see only his own hollow reflection.Grigoryevich leaves Moscow for his old city of Leningrad, the place where he was first arrested in 1927. There, quite by chance, he runs into the person whose denunciation placed him in jail in the first place. Grossman here embarks on a discourse on the different types and forms of denunciation available to the Soviet citizen. It is a remarkable discourse that shows how many different ways there are to participate in a purge and how many ways there are to legitimize ones participation and/or acquiescence.From Leningrad Ivan travels to a southern industrial city where he finds work and eventually finds a deep and satisfying love in the person of his landlady, a grieving war widow. That relationship forms the centerpiece of what might be called Grossman's vision that love and freedom are two goals, not mutually exclusive, that form the essence of our shared humanity.The above summary does not do justice to the power and depth of Grossman's prose. Further, it cannot do justice to the literary and political importance of the work. Since the death of Stalin, the Soviet line had remained relatively firm - Stalin's excesses were the product of a disturbed mind that represented a horrible deviation from the theory and principles of Leninism. The USSR's best path is the one that returned it to the path created by Lenin. Khrushchev first enunciated this line. (Brezhnev never paid it much mind as his own administration marked a step back towards Stalinism in some respects.) Even Gorbachev's perestroika was based on the theory that a return to first-principles, i.e. Leninism, would save the USSR from destruction.Grossman did not buy into this line and Forever Flowing is noted for a remarkable attack not only on Stalin but on Lenin and Lenin's anti-democratic tendencies that had more in common with Ivan the Terrible than the principles of revolutionary democracy. \\"All the triumphs of Party and State were bound up with the name of Lenin. But all the cruelty inflicted on the nation also lay - tragically - on Lenin's shoulders.\\" Grossman may have been the first to make this leap and he paid the price for making that leap. (This involves the suppression of his Life & Fate.)Despite the horrors set out, quietly and without excess rhetoric, Grossman returns to an somewhat optimistic vision of mans search for freedom\\" \\"No matter how enormous the skyscrapers, no matter how powerful the cannon, no matter how unlimited the might of the state, no matter how vast its empire, all this was only smoke and mist which would disappear. There remained alive and growing one genuine force alone, consisting of one element only - freedom. To live meant to be a free human being.Forever Flowing (and Life and Fate) are well worth the time and attention of anyone with an interest in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Forever Flowing","review":"Grossman began writing this book in 1955, two years after Stalin died. It was completed one year before the author's death in 1964, but was not published until 1970. Framed as a novel, and written with great tenderness, &quot;Forever Flowing&quot; is primarily a history of the horrors of the Soviet state before, during, and after its Stalinist phase. Grossman's chapters recounting the huge famine of 1932, which was a government-enforced starvation of millions, particularly in the Ukraine, are matchlessly brilliant and profoundly moving. The entire novel is a tribute to human freedom. It also reflects the great courage of its author. In my opinion, &quot;Forever Flowing&quot; will become more widely read as time passes, and will become increasingly recognized as one of the greatest books of the 20th century. It is a true classic. The lucid translation by Thomas P. Whitney is excellent. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Forever Flowing","review":"This translation should not have been republished.

It is enlightening for those of us in the West to realize that, unlike the Germans after the fall of Hitler, the Russian people never had \\"closure\\" with their even bloodier past.

They aren't boring at all in the hands of Prof. Alan Tyson. Through painstaking analysis of the kinds of paper Mozart used, Tyson is able to do some fascinating detective work--including the redating of several works, and the finding that Mozart's Horn Concerto in D (K. 412) was not even completed by him, but was finished after his death by his pupil Suessmayr! Tyson also recovers some &quot;lost&quot; music from Mozart's opera &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot; and the ending of the Rondo for Piano and Orchestra, K. 386.These wonders are presented in writing that is sober enough to be credible, but is never dull. Anyone who loves Mozart's music will find a treasury of fascinating new finds and information in this book."},{"Title":"Mozart: Studies of the Autograph Scores","review":"Alan Tyson is an author who contributed the major part after L.Koechel in understanding of Mozart's way of work and chronology. If you know at least 5 Mozart's works and you like Mozartkugeln then this book is a right choice for you. You won't regret!"},{"Title":"Mozart: Studies of the Autograph Scores","review":"Alan Tyson's work on Mozart's autograph scores is revelatory. It is arguably the most accomplished scholarship in the domain since Girdlestone or K3 - and indeed, Tyson was so caustic towards the latter that he could almost be considered an Extinction Event. He does to Einstein what the K-Pg Meteor did to T-Rex and his mates.Style is dependent upon chronology. You cannot discuss the evolution of the former unless the latter is solidly grounded. True, Mozart dated many scores; there is also the famous Catalogue at hand; furthermore, Leopold drew up a rough list of his son's compositions from his boyhood. That being said, quite a number of compositions lack a date and this is obviously true of the fragments per se. Similarly, those works which Mozart wrote after 1784 for use among his friends were but fitfully included in the Catalogue (such as K 439b and the Notturni). And what of the gestation of various compositions? For how long were they in the oven? Sure, the Catalogue can provide us with an end-date but what does that really mean?Thankfully, Mozart had no overriding commitment to any one supplier of paper. He jumped from one to another every year or so - and in clumps. Each of them is imprinted with a different watermark. Einstein and an associate had breezily dismissed this line of investigation. Tyson took up the challenge. Myth-busting ensued - in spades.Remember how Einstein claimed that Mozart had reverted to some 1770 drafts from Milan, no less, when he commenced the first of the Prussian Quartets in 1789? Think again!Remember the old maxim from K 1 - no religious works after 1781 with the exception of K 427, K 618 and the Requiem? Think again. Not only that, Tyson links it back astutely to Mozart's machinations at St Stephen's Cathedral.Remember how K 1 assigned the Sonatas K 330, K 331 and K 333 with his Paris journey of 1778 as if they form some sort of a series with K 310? K 3 likewise affirmed this chronology. Think again! They date from 1783.Remember all the confusion that surrounds the \`first' horn concerto, K 412 / 514 where different orchestration is to be found in either movement. It ends here.Remember how it was claimed that Ein musikalischer Spa&szlig; (K 522, from 1787) was a Freudian comment on Leopold, it being the next item to be entered into the Catalogue upon his death? Think again. It was started at least a year beforehand.Recall how his last Piano Concerto, K 595, and his Clarinet Concerto are both regarded as being valedictory works from 1791. Think again - it is not as simple as that. The first movement of K 622 in its basset-horn guise could have been written four years earlier in 1787 whereas the Piano Concerto was well and truly commenced in 1788 - the occasion of the concert in March 1791 prompted Mozart to complete the fragment.Reader, to whet your appetite, here is a list of the chapters:New Dating Methods: Watermarks and Paper Studies.Redating Mozart: Some Stylistic and Biographical Implications.New Light on Mozart's Prussian Quartets.La Clemenza di Tito and its Chronology.A Reconstruction of Nannerl Mozart's Music Book.The Date of Mozart's Piano Sonata in B Flat K 333 (315c) - the \`Linz' Sonata?Mozart's \`Haydn Quartets'. The Contribution of Paper Studies.The Origins of Mozart's \`Hunt' Quartet, K 458.The Two Slow Movements of Mozart's \`Paris' Symphony K 297.Le Nozze di Figaro. Lessons from the Autograph Score.The Mozart Fragments in the Mozarteum Salzburg. A Preliminary Study of their Chronology and their Significance (what a chapter!)The Dates of Mozart's Missa Brevis K 258 & Missa Longa K 262.On the Composition of Mozart's Cosi fan tutte.Mozart's Use of 10-Staff and 12-Staff Paper.Notes on the Genesis of Mozart's Ein musikalischer Spa&szlig; K 522.Mozart's D Major Horn Concerto. Questions of Date and of Authenticity.The Rondo for Piano and Orchestra, K 386 (note: Tyson found the long-lost last pages of this work in the British Library).Some Problems in the Text of Le nozze di Figaro. Did Mozart Have a Hand in Them?There are no flights of fancy here. Tyson is no poetaster. It is, however, earth-shattering scholarship, written stylishly by a man who both loved and understood his subject. Moreover, not only does he correct the chronology - any nong can do that; unerringly, Tyson points out the implications.This is a fabulous book which I find near-impossible to put down whenever it comes to hand. True, it is a specialist recommendation. It is also a tour de force.And BTW: help the cause by checking your cupboards. The following autograph scores are missing:K 622 Clarinet ConcertoK 581 Clarinet QuintetK 425 the Linz SymphonyK 175 - the Fifth Piano Concerto in D - last attested in Berlin in the 1890s when its worth was well and truly known.And most of K 364, the Sinfonia Concertante, is likewise missing.It could help the old bank-balance too."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog Of Military Firearms: The Collector's Price and Reference Guide","review":"I found this to be a good reference.

It is quite obvious they were meant to supplement one another, yet they use different methods to catalog the various firearms. Standard goes in alphabetical order by manufacturer name, while Military is by country of origin and sub-catogarized by manufacturer--this can be tough if one is looking for a specific manufacturer, but don't know the country of origin.

Even as his work seeks to transform and undo some of the central concepts of Marx's corpus, Professor Read shows how the struggle between capital and labor assumes new forms as postmodern society becomes increasingly subsumed by capitalism. The author succeeds brilliantly in showing how Marx's problematic of class struggle is continually produced anew and points to the possibility of a new radical politics that accounts for our own unique place and time in history.Professor Read explains that the primitive accumulation of early capitalism extinguished feudalism and gave rise to the state, laws, and the nuclear family. This violent struggle continues into the present as capital colonizes the genetic code, for example, in a never-ending and evolutionary process that subsumes all material objects to its own ends. Similarly, the author demonstrates that as capital accumulates, subjectivity accumulates -- meaning, among other things, that humanity's immersion in the logic of the capitalist mode of production intensifies and its collective memory of a pre-capitalist history dissolves.As a consequence of this evolution, Professor Read argues that the \\"formal subsumption\\" of the factory model described by Marx has yielded to the \\"real subsumption\\" of postmodern society. Simply put, the locus of production (and conflict) has changed from the factory floor to society, culture, and life itself. In an argument that bears similarity to Antonio Negri's thesis in the bookEmpire, Professor Read shows how the production of \\"knowledge, desire and communication\\" has moved to the strategic center of capitalist production, suggesting that it is here that the struggle for liberation from capitalism might ensue.Thoroughly researched and persuasively argued, Professor Read's book is recommended for demanding readers who are interested in an original, thought-provoking and scholarly analysis of Marx and the relevance of his theories in today's world. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Micro-Politics of Capital: Marx and the Prehistory of the Present","review":"Few authors takes a genuine look at Marx in terms of modern (postmodern) thought like Jason Read does in this work. Most authors stumble in this capacity, unable to admit that they themselves are a product of their historical context. Here we view Marx with the benefit of modern theory, and not this de-contextualization that most authors seem to want to put us through. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Marx."},{"Title":"The Micro-Politics of Capital: Marx and the Prehistory of the Present","review":"This is hands down one of the best contemporary theorizations of Marxism that I have ever read! In the same way Marx inverts Hegel's speculative idealism to arrive at the premise of historical materialism, Read inverts Marx to show that the very distinction between production and reproduction (or materiality and discourse) is a false dichotomy that is always already contingent on the irreducible gap between history and the present. Read presents this argument both synchronically and diachronically through an ongoing Deleuzian inspired critique of Marx's distinction between capitalism and the primitive accumulation (i.e., identity and difference becomes difference and repetition). At the synchronic level, Read develops a number of Althusser's concepts--such as immanent causality, the society effect, and symptomatic reading--to show that any attempt to articulate a relationship between society and power requires, first and foremost, a representational investment in the concept of subjectivity. At the diachronic level, Read discusses what Marx described in the Grundrisse as the shift from the formal subsumption of labor to the real subsumption of labor. Arguing that this distinction materializes as the transition from the machine as fixed capital to subjectivity as fixed capital, Read shows how capitalism has become increasingly dependent on life itself to produce surplus-value. Rather than frame this transition as a process brought about by capital, however, Read traces the origin of this shift to labor's early victory over the workingday (and capital's subsequent emphasis on relative, rather than absolute, surplus-value). Read's project is thus consistent with the Italian tradition of Autonomous Marxism and maintains the Foucauldian axiom that resistance always precedes power.For anyone interested in the relationship between Marxism and poststructuralism this book is a must! It is particularly recommended if you are looking for a philosophical elaboration of Hardt and Negri's trilogy."},{"Title":"Cat's Collar - Three Erotic Romances","review":"These 3 stories were enjoyable and involved the metaphysical.

In part, it does this by looking at the recent past, and the various projections made then about upcoming mobile trends. These predictions are evaluated against what actually happened. A sobering comparison. A lot of hype happened in the 90s dot com and telecom era. And mobile computing spanned both fields. Resulting in massive overbuilding of telecom networks and overbidding for 3G licenses. Billions of dollars, euros and yen were squandered in those efforts.So one lesson from the book is that predictions are always fraught with uncertainty. Hopefully, this engenders some caution and humility amongst the authors of the book's papers, and in the reader.The book studies future mobile technologies and wonders how these might turn out. Useful research ideas. Though nothing I read here really seemed to be a gripping, Eureka-type vision."},{"Title":"Second to None","review":"The first part of this book is a dirge where everyone who is still left alive mourns the death of Richard Bolitho who was killed in action at the end of the previous book. And if the parallels between Bolitho and Nelson were not strong enough, we read the struggles of his mistress - and coincidentally of Nelson's mistress - to come to terms with her loss and what she should do next in her life.After the first 100 or so pages, we get to the base of this volume - and it is rather thin from a plotting point of view. Adam Bolitho is now the star of the show and he is captaining frigate in the Mediterranean. The coast of Algeria is hazardous to shipping and Algerine pirates have a base of operations with the Dey of Algiers. Bolitho manages to destroy several nests of pirates using tricks that have been described in multiple volumes of this series as well as the Hornblower series and others. Then, of course, there is a command shift and a new admiral comes on board who does not like Bolitho for historical reasons (the uncle, not Adam) and so we have the semi-normal situation of a blow-hard, know-nothing, but well connected admiral with the admirably feisty and always correct frigate caption bailing him out - only to have more resentment reserved for Bolitho.I rate this book only three stars because there is really nothing here. Adam Bolitho's adventures in the Med area repeat of Dick Bolitho's adventures. The naval engagements are told excitingly enough, but they are less believable than normal. The petty jealousies and revenge plays that keep intruding would be understandable in a small set of cases, but to have such happen in almost every book? Really? How could so many admirals be in command to hold back the worthy captains? Weren't all these admirals captains at one point and therefore know what their underlings are feeling? Also, we have the usual love affair where a woman spends one minute looking at Adam Bolitho and then throws herself at him disclaiming undying love - all the while being married to someone else. This has also been a repeated theme of too many books in this series. So, I'm disappointed to a certain extent and hope this was just a transitional book since the series has six or seven more volumes at the time of this writing."},{"Title":"Second to None","review":"If you like the Bolitho series this is a good addition.This is the first addition to the series after the death of Sir Richard and the series starts to focus on Adam Bolitho and his exploits.

Now it's Adam'sturn to carry on the Family seafaring tradition!"},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"Sword Of Orion is the start of new series by Lee and Miller, written for a new publisher. This often means a complete departure from previous work, and that does seem to be the the case. One can pick out echoes of some of their other stories, especially in the basic plot, which consisted of the heroes being chased from planet to planet, never getting a chance to catch their breath. But the book lacks the depth of either plot or characterization that is found in the Liaden novels. And really nothing much was resolved at all -- the characters just run and run and run and then they meet a new character while one of the former ones is lost.If they had ever stopped running long enough to start doing anything else, a few of the characters showed some potential to be interesting. The book is written in tight-focus third person, following the viewpoint of an orphaned teenage girl who is talented, somewhat street-wise, but still mostly innocent. She is also the only daughter of famous revolutionaries and possibly the key to resolving an interrupted revolution one way or another. But for all of that, she never seems to be more than an archetype. She's a role, not a person. A plot mechanism.Her best friend and proto love interest (who happens to be the son of the leaders who the revolution was fighting against) is actually a more interesting person. We don't actually see much of his character, but he does have a \\"real\\" feeling to him that the central heroine is lacking.Her (young) uncle is both a parent-figure and a sibling-replacement. He's also the most interesting character in the book, but since his neice doesn't understand him all that well, we don't get to do so either.And the final member of their quartet is an alien, but one of those annoying aliens who is alien just for color, not because his alienness plays any role in the story (so far). Another reviewer mentioned Star Wars, and it does kind of have the feel of that movie, where it seemed that the only purpose of the aliens was to show off the abilities of the costume designers.The book is smoothly written and it flows well. I picked it up while I was making dinner and didn't stop reading it until I had finished it early in the morning. And at the time I liked it a lot. But now, just a few hours later, it seems much less satisfying. Rather like eating a chocolate truffle -- very tasty but leaving you with a sense of transient fulfillment.I can't shake the idea that this would have worked much better if it had been a third the length and only the introduction to a complete novel. As it is, it reminded me more of reading a comic book, where the characters have all sorts of wild adventures but by the end nothing much has actually happened.Perhaps because of the age of the central figure this could be called adolescent fiction, but to excuse its lack of depth by saying it is written for teens is an insult to young readers. Instead, it feels to me more like Lee and Miller were concentrating so much on coming up with a new series that they forgot to make the first installment into an actual novel."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"Take notice of the dedication page please. This is, IMO, a Hardy Boy's In Space 'young adult' adventure. It should have been labled such by the publisher. I wonder if they were trying to suck in Liaden fans. If so, it may backfire on Sharon and Steve by causing new readers to think the Liaden books are similar.I've read all of their Liaden books, starting in 1988 with Conflict of Honors, one of the best. Take it from me, the Liaden books are in a class of their own. An exalted class."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"This was my first book from these writers: I have no idea what all this \\"Liaden\\" stuff is. All I have is this too-slim volume to judge... and I wasn't all that impressed!At first I struggled to get into the book. We've seen the rebellious teen angst heroine with a super-secret past thing before. The writing is strictly of the Trekno-babble \\"word replacement\\" variety (skate board == slide board, etc.). Then things got interesting. These writers *can* write...Alas, the characters never really develop and things get bogged down again. The aliens aren't very alien, just there for color and the plot is pure Heinlein juvenile--think Podkayne--only it ain't Heinlein. There are echoes/borrowings (not really homage per se) from other great books or series of the past. For example, the castle bit in the middle is reminiscent to me of Zelazny's Amber series; and those books that share the rapid shifting of worlds amid constant peril theme.Frankly (and when was the last time anyone said this about an SF book?!?) this book would have been better if it were twice as long. But there is talent on display here: its use in the service of this tired vehicle makes me sad. Perhaps the follow-on volumes will be better. In the meantime, wait for the regular paperback."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book because I love the Liaden stories and think Sharon Lee and Steve Miller are great SF writers. Unfortunately I'm having trouble with Sword of Orion, Book 1. I'm only 1/3 of the way in and I keep putting it down. Two things are bothering me. First, the teen protagonist, Jarel, is not working for me. There are hints that she will end up being rather brainy and interesting but where I am in my reading now (page 105) she's provoking a hostile reaction. If she doesn't wise up soon, I'll give her the TSTL rating and start cheering on the villains of the piece. The secondary characters, Uncle Orned, Erazias the alien and Kay the teen love interest, are also slow starters. Second, I'm disappointed in the writing. Where's the complexity I'm used to in the Liaden stories? The sentences are all short and composed of lots of one syllable words as if the attempt was to go after a Hemingway style as opposed to a more complex Fitzgerald style.I'll keep plugging away on this in hopes that it gets better further in, but I'm wishing I had waited until a few more of the sequels were published. I read most of the Liaden books in one big gulp starting with I Dare and Plan B and the universe was so rich, the characters so compelling and interesting, that I didn't mind that the quality of some of the other Liaden books taken individually was uneven.As an after-thought, I wonder if the new publisher and editor are to blame for this? Were they aiming for a J K Rowling style? Seems like, but Rowling's writing style is not the best model. Her stories work for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with her writing style which is not that riveting... a review waiting for another day and a different book."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"Fans of the Liaden Universe be warned; this is not your usual Lee and Miller. Written in a very unsophisticated style and with a plot that goes almost nowhere, this book does not capture the imagination or the intellect in the way that Liaden or Gem (where are you, Gem??) stories do. Buy it for your young readers, but pass it by if you are over 20. I didn't even finish it - a first for a Lee & Miller collaboration."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"I love Lee & Miller's \\"Liaden\\" books, but sadly, this novel did not live up to that level. I felt like the entire thing was \\"set up\\" for future books without much plot of its own and it had a very unsatisfying ending. I don't mind multi-novel series, but I do expect each individual book to be somewhat complete in and of itself. Also, I didn't identify much with the teenage main characters, but perhaps that might not be a problem for a younger audience."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"I was disappointed as this was Not up to this dynamic duos usual superb writing....this first book in a new series is more suited to the teen generation, skate board jargon and takes a few chapters to get going somewhere?

Those are worth waiting for."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"This book is so bad I almost didn't finish it. The story is juvenile, as are the heroine and her boy friend (at least they have an excuse -- they are teen agers). They're on the run, skipping from planet to planet, but the bad guys always seem to know where they are. Hmmm. Boyfriend is the son of a supporter of the deposed regime. Mom sends him off with a backpack and tells him to help our heroine. Do you think mom might have planted some sort of locator on son and is using him (without his knowledge) to track our girl? The girl's \\"uncle\\" is by far the most interesting character - and he's left behind at the end of this book. I will read the reviews of book 2 in this series before I spend any money on it."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"I have all Lee&Miller; books and until this one I never was dissapointed. No plot to speak about, no characters to be interested in, no logic even in what is there (the group keeps running from their enemies, they keep repeating to themselves that now finally they lost the \\"tail\\" and they are nearly immediately found - perhaps it is time to check for hidden bugs? Especially as one of the heroes is so called \\"licensed assasin\\" and should have thought about this?). In fact, everything that made Liaden series so wonderful, is absent. If I got this book without a cover, I would never have thought it was written by the same authors.An attempt to write a young adult S/F - all I can say, Heinlein did it better."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"While generally enjoyable, The Sword of Orion is OK in almost every way but never quite gets really good. Overall it reminds me of Heinlein's teenage books - though without quite the same innocence and bright edge of burgeoning space exploration. The characterization is fine - the people interesting enough, the plot is fine - but you're never surprised. I have tremendously enjoyed almost everything Lee & Miller have written - I suppose they can have a bad day. For Liaden fans I would say go ahead and read it so you can say you are truly dedicated fans. For those who aren't prior Lee & Miller fans I wouldn't start here."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"I love this book. I love their other books too.

This is not it - this isn't even equal to a spider-man book! Yes, it ends with a cliff hanger (actually it just ends abruptly) - but frankly I don't care! I will not bother with the second part of the series.There were very few plot twists - mostly they run and keep getting caught. These people are supposed to be supremely smart and have survived undercover as revolutionaries for years, but haven't been able to figure that the bad guys keep finding them way too easy!I would suggest not reading this book and instead go read the real thing (Liaden Universe) or some Linnea Sinclair."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"All the time I was reading this I kept thinking - \\"I know this plot! I've seen on kids TV adventure shows\\"....and that is what reading this book is like.The characters, while likeable, are mostly too young and too ill drawn to have much depth to them and the emphasis is on a cliff hanger ending so you will get the next book.I doesn't compare to the Liaden novels for world building and characters but if you don't mind a derivitive story its not too bad an outing for younger readers, though at times it seemed to drag."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"I am a devoted fan of the Liaden universe, I just finished re-reading I DARE, and then this!!.

In contrast, the cover, quality of paper & binding were well chosen.This book will not appeal to fans of the Liaden series, nor of the series beginning with The Tomorrow Log. It is not written for adults. It would possibly appeal to early adolescents, but there are a plethora of more interesting and more entertaining novels suited to that age group.I am suprised that these authors have produced this drivel.All in all, extremely disappointing."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"Jerel Termon is the daughter of two leaders of a successful rebellion against the Oligarchy - several powerful families ruling a section of planets in the Milky Way. In a final battle, both armies - including Jerel's parents - disappeared and no one knows what exactly happened. Jerel was then raised by Orned and taught to be always careful since there might still be members of the Oligarchy after her for being her parents' daughter. And when she's sixteen, Orned's fears come true. A colleague is murdered, Jerel is abducted and can barely escape with Orned, her friend Kay and later the help of other members of the former rebellion. It seems that Jerel is the key to finding the missing armies, which would disrupt the balance of power severely... This book is basically about the disruption of Jerel's peaceful life and the beginnings of her run from her enemies. It has a completely open ending and was supposed to be the first of a series named 'Beneath strange skies'. However, according to the authors the publisher hasn't shown any interest in continuing the series, so this seems to be it.I have read all the books published by Sharon Lee and Steve Miller up to now, and this is actually the only one I was ever disappointed with. It has lots of flaws, in my opinion, and not all of them can be excused with the fact that this is part of an unfinished series. The characters are often very stereotypical and flat, the one interesting character that shows promise, Orned, doesn't play that big a role, and you have several classical too-stupid-to-live situations, which is something that generally gets on my nerves. It's also quite boring since it's mostly a series of places where Jerel and company stay for a short time until they have to run again, and none of these places are developed to a point where they could get interesting. The same goes for supporting characters. I'm reminded of a mediochre action-movie, typical popcorn cinema only in writing. 'Sword of Orion' is a novel meant for young adults, a genre in which Lee and Miller usually don't write, which might explain why it's not up to their usually high standards. But there are many science fiction books for young adults that still have depth and interesting characters (e. g. by Robert A. Heinlein), so I think they could have done a better job. With it's general flaws and the fact that it's an unfinished series, I personally would recommend this book only if you're an avid fan of these authors and want to have every single book written by them. Otherwise I don't think it's worth buying."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"That's the only reason I can think of for not even finishing this story line. I don't mind serial books, and I really like cliff hanger endings, but everyone knows for that to work you have to at least finish ONE PLOT LINE within a single publication! This story is fun! But it ended with not one thing resolved, and that's just sloppy (or, more likely, greedy!). That is why 3 stars. They would have had a 4.5 stars for serving up of their usual fun space operas. Too bad they couldn't withstand the pressure to make money. Please, Lee & Miller, work on your priorities for next time! Otherwise, you will lose someone who's been with you since the beginning.

A few too many aliens talk like they just came off the set of the Dark Crystal, though."},{"Title":"Sword of Orion (Beneath Strange Skies, Book 1)","review":"The concept was good - scientists end the war, and save the revolution, by making the soldiers and space fleets of both sides disappear, tying their infant daughter into the technology that makes it happen.

With her assasin uncle, best friend and various alien beings, she flees through \\"wild gates\\" from planet to planet, trying to gain some control over her future - and the future of the world.But the characters did not have the depth usually created by these authors - I tried hard to like them, and had brief flashes of enjoyment, but the spark never kindled. The plot moved jerkily....too caught up in detail and technology in parts, time spent in scenes and characters that dead-ended and left me wondering, \\"What was that all about?\\" The story did not engage. Perhaps if I did not have such high expectations of Lee and Miller, I would have been more pleased, but I found myself skimming over entire series of pages.

Most people will never see a full production of these scripts. Live theater featuring new work by living playwrights is rare in most places.For those interested in truth and in drama, the full range of the American experience and the Asian Pacific Islander American perspective, from a sansei point of view, Fish Head Soup and Other Plays is the definitive published collection of Philip Kan Gotanda's work to date. Better yet, read the text *and* see the productions. If you can.Gotanda tells stories that describe and illuminate the truth about what it means and what it's like to be Japanese American, but cultural heredity is not a prerequisite or barrier to the book. His work challenges the &quot;truth&quot; of other recent writers who blur the line on what really carried over to the US of A when folks from around the Pacific Rim came to stay.The drama and humor are universal and poignant, un-stereotypical in the sense that the conflicts and human interest come out of relationships and dreams, not exoticized romanticism. The dramatic lines are not always gentle, and some are shocking. The humor is grounded in what makes &quot;other&quot; interesting and &quot;family&quot; familiar.It's a window on what's happening in Asian Pacific Islander America today."},{"Title":"Fish Head Soup and Other Plays","review":"Barring that, get this book. While all four of the plays, Fish Head Soup, Yankee Dawg You Die, The Wash and A Song for a Nisei Fisherman, are strong, stirring, beautiful pieces, perhaps the most powerful of these is Yankee Dawg You Die.

The animals in his stories talk, think, and experience human emotion, but they are still quite bestial. The lives of many forest animals are uncertain, violent, and fraught with danger, and no animal is guaranteed a long life. In \\"Pork,\\" characters I came to like sometimes died suddenly and randomly, or turned out to be rather vicious creatures. I also appreciated how well the author matched personalities with different kinds of animals. Each kind of animal - stoat, squirrel, mouse, etc. - had its own uniquely flavored personality. Nice stuff.Further, I liked the author's prose. His language is crisp, his descriptive phrases are wonderful, and he has an ear for dialogue.Still, these stories didn't really grab my interest. The stories were simple, and there was no real meat to them. There was nothing bigger in them than the small fables, adventures, and tribulations of forest animals.I can imagine someone disagreeing, and saying, \\"The animals are quite human, and the book's audience can relate to them in a meaningful way!\\" I agree to an extent; the audience can relate to the animals. But the tone and style of the stories, which are often like fables or storybooks, prevent the characters from seeming real, and make them lack the depth and meaning of real people and emotion.I don't recommend reading this if you really want to sink your teeth in to a book. Further, I don't recommend this if you're looking to be swept away, to be dragged and held down in a fictional world. While interesting in its own way, this book is not very compelling."},{"Title":"Pork","review":"GREAT BOOK, I purchased a copy of this for my kindle from Amazon as I had been searching for same for years, all good.

He had a lifelong interest in combinatorics and problem solving, as well as mathematical education. His enumeration theorem tells you how to count complicated combinatorial objects where there is a symmetry group involved. A typical example of a problem to which Polya's method applies is the following. How many different necklaces can be made from three red beads, two sepia beads and five turquoise beads. The answer is given as the coefficient of r^3.s^2.t^5 (bollocks, this thing doesn't accept HTML) in a polynomial called the configuration counting series, and a general formula for calculating this polynomial.Michael Keith's book describes applications of Polya's enumeration theorem to the combinatorics of chords, scales and keys. Throughout, the author deals with the cyclic group consisting of the twelve musical transpositions in the twelve tone equal tempered scale. Unfortunately, atonal music theorists such as Allen Forte and Elliott Carter all seem to use the dihedral group of order twenty-four obtained by allowing inversions. Nevertheless, the ideas described in the book can be applied just as easily in this case.This is a nice little book, attractively presented, and with more mathematics than music in it."},{"Title":"From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics","review":"Yes, every single mathematically distinct chord & scale (for standard guitar and piano tuning) is included here. They're all listed clearly, in order, in an appendix. The combinatorics math is included, in case you want to check it yourself -- or even learn how to do it! This book is brilliant, and EXACTLY what I was looking for. Thanks, Michael Keith! Laying down a definitive analysis of all the potential options provided by standard (12-tone equal temperament, diatonic) pop/rock/jazz/classical music theory. And offering some witty examples and asides as well.... Musicians who care about the mathematical (or philosophical) aspects of music theory will enjoy this book immensely. It will go right over the heads of everyone else, including most musicians. Keith also includes some interesting details. There's a mention of how Pascal's triangle and the Fibonacci sequence relate to the most commonly used musical chords. Also a brief discussion of the one guitar chord (in standard tuning) which is more dissonant than any other (on pages 62/63, with tablature notation.) This book richly deserves more attention from anyone who cares about innovation or originality in music, assuming he (or she) is not irrationally frightened by seeing the math spelled out."},{"Title":"Java Platform Performance: Strategies and Tactics","review":"The table of contents is deceptive, because all of the important optimization topics are covered, including the Java-specific ones. The problem is, most of these topics are not covered in any depth beyond a simple introduction. I like terse books and believe most books about computers these days are way too fat; my hats are off to Addison Wesley for controlling that tendency with well edited books in this series. This book is thin at 230 pages, but unfortunately, a lot of that is filler of the &quot;let me tell you what I'm going to tell you, tell you, and then tell you what I told you variety.The advice is generally sound, such as &quot;use a profiler to decide what to optimize&quot;, but all too often the advice stops there. One learns that linked lists are fast for deletes and array lists are fast for random access. But what if neither has the performance characteristics you need?I would recommend Jon Bentley's &quot;Programming Pearls&quot; for someone who really wants to get a feel for optimization through a number of tight case studies. The examples may be C, but they're insightful and more applicable to the problems you're likely to face than the ones encountered when writing the Swing or Collections classes themselves. Then go out and use a serious optimizer like Quantify, which is essentially what the authors of this book suggest. At that point, you'll wonder why the authors stopped their review of Collections with Sun's built-in implementations.The code for running mulitple programs and controlling class loading in Chapter 6, though I have not tried it, is interesting and something I'd not seen elsewhere. Other diversions, such as timers and threading in Swing are covered elsewhere. What would have been helpful is a detailed look at debugging threading performance, say through object, resource or thread pooling (an idea dismissed earlier for &quot;small objects&quot;).One glaring omission is a serious micro-benchmarking of basic operations. I found the comparison of speed when using final vs. non-final classes or methods to be startling in practice, and numbers here would help. Similarly, access times for hash tables vs. arrays, simple object construction times, floating point vs. integer arithmetic times, object variable vs. local variable access, etc. There are some wonderful micro-benchmark applets on the web with this functionality. What you'll learn is that up-casting takes forever, so any use of built-in collections/iterators for performance-critical operations will do you in.I found the constant sales pitch for the Sun HotSpot (TM) Virtual Machine a bit tiring. It concludes with a recapitulation of the marketing materials in Appendix B. It is alternately described as &quot;highly optimized&quot;, &quot;state-of-the-art&quot;, having a &quot;superior memory allocator&quot;, &quot;ultra-fast&quot;, having &quot;excellent multiprocessor performance characteristics&quot;, having &quot;agressive inlining&quot;, having &quot;excellent paging&quot;, etc. etc. The appendix devoted to HotSpot (TM) is particularly noteworty for its omission of any profiling information!"},{"Title":"Java Platform Performance: Strategies and Tactics","review":"Although this topic could be explored a lot deeper, this is a great book to get started on Java performance. I read it, cover to cover, in a few days on the bus, back and forth to work, and it's changed my approach to coding in Java.The first part on strategies is fundamental and cover concepts on performance. This is a must for anybody who wants to get started on the topic.The second part on tactics goes into details about spesific issues in Java, and because of the GUI / Swing background of the authors, it is mostly focused on topics related to that. If that's what you're working on, this is a 5 star book, but since Java is becoming more and more server focused technology, it's a little bit missing for people like myself who write Servlets and JSPs.Hopefully, there'll soon be a book that discusses performance in J2EE."},{"Title":"Java Platform Performance: Strategies and Tactics","review":"There are a number of things everybody 'knows' about Java. Bad things such as &quot;It's slow (but can be speeded up by calling native methods)&quot; or good things such as &quot;It doesn't leak memory&quot;. Unfortunately, like most things, the truth is more complicated.Wilson and Kesselman have done an excellent job of getting under the bonnet (or hood for those in the US) of Java whilst firmly remaining practical rather than theoretical.I bought the book because we suspected memory leakage problems in one of our applets but couldn't find much information on the subject elsewhere. The net result is that we've had our eyes opened to a number of issues we weren't aware of and have been able to tackle them with informed confidence rather than ill-educated guesswork.A particular bonus is the information on benchmarking. So often we find we develop solutions on the basis of ease of coding rather than performance (not always bad thing). What I've found now is that I have greater confidence in both trying out different solutions and then concrete evidence with which I can justify my decisions to others.Though not for beginners, I would reccommend this book as a good one for expanding your knowledge of how to deliver good, practical, faster and more robust Java. Being able to give sound background information on why you write a piece of code in a particular way is an important step on the way from being a developer to being a key developer."},{"Title":"Java Platform Performance: Strategies and Tactics","review":"The focus of the book is on tuning single user GUI (Swing,AWT) applications and as such, offers some good insight on this subject.

On the other hand, Wilson's book is starting to show its age.Wilson (the main author) has worked on Sun's Swing team and then on the performance team in the late 90's and that is where he draws his experience from.

Army G2 operative Captain Hugh North is promoted to major near the start of this tangle of interconnected mysteries set in and around prewar Singapore and the story gives us many glimpses of that city in its last days as part of the British empire. It also provides a sampling of what were probably the common attitudes and ideas of that time. In fact, part of the reader's enjoyment is looking back at these with the advantage of hindsight. Of course there's also the mystery-adventure itself to enjoy. I won't spoil the fun of discovery except to say there are puzzles within puzzles and several characters with both obvious and hidden motivations. Because of the colonial power structure in place at that time, the non-European inhabitants of Singapore are unfortunately just background figures. None are developed more than minimally and we're given no indications of what they are thinking or feeling. Too bad. Major North himself invites comparison to later characters such as Agent 007. Whereas James Bond can drive or fly virtually any vehicle, Major North has his forensic technician skills to rely on. Identifying a poison by a series of chemical tests and tracing it to a particular character is no problem for him, although it leaves the Singapore coroner amazed. Like James Bond, Major North is irresistible to most women and also like Mr. Bond, he can't resist any attractive woman himself -- at least for a while. Unusally for this type of story, particularly one written so long ago, at least one of the women characters is not just in the book for decoration, distraction, and/or rescue; she actually proves able to use her brain in a helpful way. Well done. So far, I've read seven of the author's Captain/Major/Colonel North novels and this is my favorite so far. Because there seems to be about twenty of these stories --and some others not featuring the same character-- I've still got a lot of reading enjoyment to come."},{"Title":"Singapore Exile Murders","review":"The SINGAPORE EXILE MURDERS is one of Van Wyck Mason's best Hugh North stories and one of his last books before World War II.THE BUCHAREST BALLERINA MURDERS and THE RIO CASINO INTRIGUE were both published during the next two years.

Rather than making it a purely scholarly research article the author traced and studied the heritage of different Yao tribes.Jess Pourrett went inside remote China, Vietnam, and Laos and found the links with the Chinese. It contains much samples of Yao's customs, ethnology with very convincing evidence about a mountain dwelling group left China sometime ago.Perhaps, the book can be added with linguistics. For example, a chart comparison of different tribal dialects on common objects, number systems will really make this book a more distinguished and more convincing they are separate from the the Han people. Samples of burial tomb stones,excerts of love songs etc are also highly treasured topics.The book in by no means comprehensive. There is more to be studied and researched. If there is more citations from authorative sources like China research sources, the origin of the Yao people from Yangtze Valley will be better understood. I am under the impression that Yao people might have been forced to leave.

The author has lived in southeast Asia for 30 years, and he \\"lives\\" the material. The text demonstrates a keen understanding of values, flavors, and exigencies of Yao life. However, the life of this book is in the 600+ photographs, which capture every part of Yao culture. They are split among 3 categories: modern photographs of Yao life, vintage photographs of similar scenes, and photographs of every piece of material culture a Yao person would need in life. The captions put the photographs in context, so that the book can be used for quick reference as well as for sequential reading. The straight-forward system of organization (for example, by the various components of the female costume) gives it added value as an \\"identifier\\" of a given textile or other object in hand. This markedly increases its value to a collector. For readers unfamiliar with the group or those observing them solely from a distance, this book is likely to engender an urge to get on a plane and journey to see Yao society up close.

The author Allyn Thompson, was a postmaster by profession, who led a group of a group of amateur telescope makers at the old Hayden planetarium in the 1940's to the time of his death in the mid 1950's. The book itself is an outgrowth of a series of articles he wrote immediately after the second world war which appeared in Sky and Telescope magazine. Though the size and focal length of the telescope he describes building (a 6-inch f8 reflector) is small by the amateur standards of the last 20 years, it is still probably the best size for a novice wishing to grind and polish the primary mirror themselves to start with. And it is in his step by step discriptions for making the primary mirror of a Newtonian reflector that this book excels. He tells you in a simple straight forward way the theory and history of the telescope, materials needed to grind and polish your own primary mirror, how to do it, how to test it (his discription of the Focault tester and using masks with it are in my opinion the still the clearest written for the beginner). He does not attempt to scare you away with horror stories of all the terrible things that can happen to you, turned down edge, dog biscuit ect, a flaw you find in the old &quot;ATM&quot; books I and II edited by Albert Ingalls. Thompson identifies possible problems, but then guides you through them with straight forward techniques. His &quot;button laps&quot; were a wonderful inovation for small mirror making and molds were widely available when this writer polished his first mirrors 30 years ago. Unfortunately nobody I know of today sells the molds commercially, but Thompson shows you how to make them yourself if you want to try it. As far as the mechanical construction of the telescope, the book is dated. Not many people today would use babbitt filled pipe fittings to make a mount, not since the easily built and more stable Dobson mount became the standard about 20 years ago for home builts (for a good book on that see Richard Berry's &quot;Build Your Own Telescope&quot;). But John Dobson was just starting to build scopes about the time Thompson died so he can't be blamed for never having seen one, he was on the other side of the country. All in all this book has held up well for something written 50 years ago. I wish I'd had a copy of it when I built my first scope. I didn't discover it till after I'd made my second mirror and I believe things would have gone a lot smoother had I read this first instead of using the old ATM books. It's too bad Allen Thompson isn't with us today to have updated the mechanical stuff, but as a mentor for your first mirror, you can't beat this book!"},{"Title":"Making Your Own Telescope","review":"This was my bible back in 1966 when I made my first mirror, an 8\\". At that time, there were a lot of things I just couldn't grasp as a sophomore in high school. However, with the help of a friend with lots of experience, I got over the rough parts and made a pretty decent mirror. I can't comment on the latest edition as I don't know how much was updated from that tried and true technology from so long ago. All I know is that the version published in the 60's was relevant and accurate.This is the book from which I learned at least one new vocabulary word, \\"tyro.\\" I had to look it up. The rest of the language was well explained including all the optical terms that are a regular part of my language today.If nothing else, this is a solid book to start out telescope making. It should be used in conjunction with other books on the subject to give you a more rounded view on making your first mirror. However, it stands on its own as a mirror-makers bible. It may not have the depth of math the Texereau book or a few of the others does, but it gets the job done. Worked for me. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Making Your Own Telescope","review":"A previous reviewer mentioned the most serious problem with this classic book, its outdated information. I would agree, but not sufficiently to reduce my rating to four stars. Amazon does not have a 4.875 star rating so I rounded up to five. A bright reader, good with their hands, could use this book as their sole reference to build a telescope using tools, raw materials and hardware scrounged from the city dump. Not easy, but do-able.There are three types of information in any book written by an artist: history of how their art developed in space and time, their perspectives on the artistic process, and a discussion of their tools and materials.Taking the history first, Thompson reveals a great deal of otherwise difficult to find knowledge about the development of telescopes in general and amateur telescopes in specific. Why do we make reflecting rather than refracting scopes? Why do we make glass mirrors instead of metal ones? Why don't some of the classical telescope designs work for the amateur? The introduction is very good and he takes the time to give a fairly complete story.Likewise, Thompson's discussion of his process is very good. He simplifies and explains the decisions one makes in producing a telescope and more importantly, the decisions one makes in setting up the tooling to make the telescope. He gives sufficient detail so that one can actually walk through his process and see why and how the parts fit together. Reading this book may be the closest the reader will come to building a telescope without actually doing so.Now the relatively weak area: Suppose we found a book on novel writing by a mid 20th century writer. We'd naturally realize the technology has changed and read and enjoy their perspectives on what brand of manual typewriter ribbon is best and the way to insert a carbon paper between pages. So it is with this book.It was written before the invention of the LED so his Foucault tester uses a light bulb and pinhole, and his math is used for a fixed-source device. So what? The principles apply, and if you happen to not be able to afford the extra dollars to build a Stellafane style Foucault device his design will work. It was written before Zip codes and most of the suppliers have disappeared. So what? It takes just a few minutes to run an online search to find others. The specific names and sizes of grit available on the market may have changed. So what? Pitch is now available pre-measured. So what? Thompson's writing style is interesting and readable. It is my strongly held contention that his presentation of even this outdated information is interesting and provides the reader a free perspective about what has changed in the world, not all for the good.Of course one does not want to just use a single reference unless they must.

As for the book, it has excellent detail on the art of grinding mirrors at home and testing them, and includes chapters on the other mechanical aspects of telescope building, such as equatorial mount construction, mirror mounts, tubes, etc. An excellant course for someone considering building their first telescope."},{"Title":"Making Your Own Telescope","review":"This book was interesting, and helped my 80 year-old father to take up a hobby that has always interested him. However, the information in the book is somewhat out of date."},{"Title":"North of Now: A Celebration of Country and the Soon to Be Gone","review":"As one who shares many of Mr. Wetherell's Luddite curmudgeony tendencies, I found these essays to be a brilliant verbalization of many of my own thoughts. His powers of description are exceptional and his arguments against the excesses of &quot;progress&quot; are a much-needed tonic against the trampling of decency which seems to be the unfortunately accepted byproduct of economic advancement. What allows this work to transcend many other works of the genre is the author's ability to rant against the destruction of much of what he holds dear while maintaining a sense of wonder and joy in all the joys the world still offers despite its flaws. Bravo, sir."},{"Title":"North of Now: A Celebration of Country and the Soon to Be Gone","review":"Somewhere Steve Martin says, &quot;Some people have a way with words, and some - no have way.&quot;W. D. Wetherell is one of those with a way. His newest book follows three novels, three books of short stories, and three previous collections of nonfiction essays, including [itals] Upland Stream and Vermont River. Wetherell's talent may accurately be called prodigious. For a young writer to have written so many remarkable books in a couple of decades begs the question of what kind of life fosters a literary sensibility in this age of the multi-media multinational mayhem.North of Now aims to explain the place of writing in this man's life, and to place the man himself in a world he sees as assiduously hostile to that contemplative practice which yields works of art.The book is praised on its jacket by Edward Hoagland as [ital] sui generis - one of a kind. There's no better way to acknowledge Wetherell's form and vantage point. Assembling the volume from a carefully sequenced set of meditations upon subjects such as &quot;Remembrance,&quot; &quot;Play,&quot; &quot;Village Life,&quot; &quot;Old-Timers,&quot; &quot;Wild Trout,&quot; and &quot;Genteel Poverty,&quot; Wetherell has written an anticipatory requiem for an existence many people in places such as northern New England still experience, day in and day out.None of these topics is pondered by Wetherell as though it were of merely private importance. He is able to take the preoccupations of an self-avowed eccentric and turn them like lenses upon changes that press upon all of us. The chapter &quot;Heavens,&quot; for example, is concerned with the diminishing darkness of our night sky - very few places on earth remain unbleached by glare from high-intensity lamps. This essay pivots upon the narrator's decision, at the birth of his child, to learn the names and shapes of constellations. Another essay, &quot;Gravity,&quot; muses on the insight that bodily actions as well as aging are forms of [ital] falling. Wetherell's narrator has a voracious passion for physical exertion, and in the process of describing such exploits as hiking, biking, back-country skiing, and canoeing, he meditates in prose upon the tactile, irresistible pull of the earth. No athlete, even in the flush of pounding pulse, can break free of gravity's grasp. Yet our society is obsessed with speed, as though it were possible to efface the weight of the actual burdens we bear.&quot;Reading&quot; and &quot;Quiet&quot; consider the possibility that - because the civilization around us, a civilization we've supposedly made, has devoted so much its efforts to consumption and destruction - we may be losing the capacity to concentrate, and therefore might be raising the last generation of readers and storytellers. Meanwhile Wetherell's detailed evocations of humans and animals, granite-veined landscapes and celestial expanses, are gorgeous reminders of those pleasures that reading makes intimate as no other medium can.Wetherell is staunchly circumspect, invulnerable to simplistic faith. Certain passages are downright morose, and the vehemence of his lament now and then veers into effusiveness (antidote to bitterness?) that is treacherous in a book so astringent in avoiding emotionalism. Perhaps I don't feel as anachronistic, myself. From my perspective, there are countless hopeful signs, visible or intuited, that large numbers of people are struggling with these very questions. Many people in wide variety of circumstances are attempting to re-connect with other people, with physical work and play, with community mutual aid.Trouble is, popular entertainment, including the publishing industry, titillates these widespread aspirations with a ceaseless flow of solipsistic self-help, personal &quot;revelation,&quot; and pseudo-spiritual folderol.Wetherell believes in his own tonics: no television, no computer, meals with family, and long spells of time in the woods, on the water, and in the solitude of his own mind. He is brother to Diogenes, the ancient Greek cynic who renounced civilized life and lived in a tub, climbing out at midnight to search with his haw lantern for an &quot;honest man.&quot; Writing this angry, lucid book was a defiant act, which ought to embolden readers to take more seriously the prospect that what we love, we may be losing."},{"Title":"North of Now: A Celebration of Country and the Soon to Be Gone","review":"The reviewer McConnaughey has it right on the money in describing Wetherell's boyish enthusiasm in nearly all things, even when expressing his frustrated regret. This, folks, is a top-10 book and if I were the benevolent God of the universe, I would deem it required annual reading for all my followers. The essay on reading should be burned onto the back of every school administrator's eye lids until the ridiculously-obvious point that kids should be in required reading classes from 1st grade until they graduate from college (with not one break in between) hits home. It is an absolute masterpiece and it comes with a pretty reasonable reading list too! It is a masterpiece among masterpieces; there is not one essay that does not snap your head back and pull from somewhere in your depths a resounding, &quot;YES!&quot;As if to punctuate that gap (chasm?) between Wetherell's teachings and the world at large, he will have no access to this praise by way of this medium! There is more than irony there.Good God Wetherell, keep writing. I'd snap my favorite flies into oblivion all day long for the privilege of spending it on the river with you! We'd have a lot to talk about, that preacher and this choir!"},{"Title":"North of Now: A Celebration of Country and the Soon to Be Gone","review":"Wetherell writes lovely descriptions of the things he loves -- many times I said: \\"Yes\\" out loud as he nailed the particular qualities of a sunset or a river or a particular turn in a season. But he throws down a gauntlet when he insists that the modern world is \\"degenerate\\" the suburbs \\"monstrous\\" and the human beings of this century in general inferior to their ancestors. He doesn't think about the issues he raises; he just asserts. A certain type of manners and charactere are disappearing, he claims. How does he know this? Because his grandfather was an admirable person. Organized sports are dismissed in a paragraph. Why? Because Wetherell and his friends had such a great time playing in the schoolyard when he was a kid. Reading and writing are soon to vanish and he knows this because ......... he admits that huge numbers of books are sold, book clubs formed, and so on, but he just somehow knows that \\"real\\" reading is vanishing. Apparently this is clear to him because he read so passionately when he was a kid. Suburbia is a degraded life; this is so clear he barely feels the need to explain it. He ought to ask himself why more than half the country lives in suburbia. No-one forced them to. The past hundred-plus years has seen a massive move from the kind of \\"authentic\\" country life he reveres, to cities and suburbs. Could it be that the old country life was far harsher and lonelier than he wants to admit? He seems to suggest that moral fiber is lacking if people like good roads and shopping nearby. I suspect that there were Indians saying something similar when the first Natives bought iron pots and pans from Europeans. I don't like the suburbs either, and I'd love some clear thinking about how they came to be. Wetherell isn't interested in thinking. When I got to that preposterous comparison between writers and buffalo hunting, I began to suspect why he doesn't want to think. He's writing self-mythology. The hero of the book, after all, is Wetherell, who had the guts to pursue a life true to nature, go the hard road and follow his dreams, in a place without good roads and nearby shopping. If his kind of life is disappearing, it only makes him a more romantic figure. Actually, he is an admirable guy in many ways, but I find his disdain for the rest of humanity, and anyone who lives differently from him, unbearable. He is a curmudgeon, and that's not such a good thing. A curmudgeon is somehow trapped in their own narrow view of the world, unable or uninterested in seeing things through the eyes of others."},{"Title":"A Suitable Job for a Woman: Inside the World of Private Eyes","review":"The book's title pays homage to P.D. James' 1972 novel, An Unsuitable Job for a Woman, featuring fictional female PI, Cordelia Gray. McDermid has written an entertaining book comparing and contrasting real, live female PIs in the U.S. and Great Britain with those created by mystery authors like herself. McDermid's book is replete with interviews with women earning their living as private investigators who share their techniques and attitudes and occasional invasion-of-privacy law suits.One of McDermid's chapter headings is &quot;Wonder Women&quot; in which she concludes that &quot;women do make better detectives.&quot; After reading A suitable Job for a Woman, I'm convinced!By the way, amazon.com is inaccurate in including Nevada Barr as a co-author. All she contributed was a page and a half &quot;Forward.&quot; So don't get sucked into buying the book for the wrong reasons; it's worth the price on its own merits. Certainly, McDermid is as good a writer as Barr and doesn't need any phony crutches."},{"Title":"A Suitable Job for a Woman: Inside the World of Private Eyes","review":"Good non-fiction read. I enjoy learning about jobs that most woman only think about doing."},{"Title":"A Suitable Job for a Woman: Inside the World of Private Eyes","review":"\\"A Suitable Job for a Woman\\" contains 16 chapters written in the author's pen (which incorporates various female detective's interviews) and 16 short episodes recorded directly from their voice. The book also contains 14 pages of an interview with the author Val McDermid, which reveals concisely her writing career till now. A short list of Val MacDermid's works is also included.If \\"A Suitable Job for a Woman\\" can be proud of anything, it is absolutely the fascinating depiction of the real female detevtives' world. It is utterly intriguing to listen to their episodes that range from a repo-man mission in Watts, LA to take back a truck, to finding out an old boyfriend for an aged, perhaps dying lady, which sounds like, the detective herself says, \\"a real Mills and Boon story.\\" It is also surprising to know that many of them are not only married but also got children and even grandchildren, and their ways of landing on the present jobs are as various as you can imagine. After reading these professionals' interviews, P. D. James' Cordelia Gray story does not look entirely fictional.However, this book has two shortcomings. One is that as the author didn't have any interviews with male counterparts, it is hardly possible for us to figure out to what degree these portrayed activities of them represent characteristics of \\"female\\" detectives. Some jobs they do must be done by male detectives as well. (And it is very regrettable that the writer didn't go further to interview these female detectives' husbands and children, whose viewpoints would have enlarged the scope of the book.) The other problem is that though the author succeeds in describing female detectives' diversity and professionalism, their stories go almost unchecked. It is obvious and understandable that they would not talk about their failed jobs, but the interviewer seems content just to listen to the episodes they are willing to talk about. If I might add another drawback of the book, the voice of Val McDermid sounds sometimes hostile to male detectives (with whom she didn't interview, as I said) to champion female counterpart. It is totally unnecessary, even damaging, considering the already impressive accounts the female detectives submit here.For all the author's previous career as a journalist, it is a book written by a fiction writer. If you're looking for P.D. James's scrupulous pen that could have revealed minutely every detalis of this unexplored world, you might be disappointed. Readable, well-written, but as a personal journal. This world deserves much more thorough research."},{"Title":"Release Your Inner Bitch: (Women Empowering Women)","review":"Rose Stadler draws upon her years of experience and expertise as a social worker and therapist helping women to deal with domestic violence in their lives. But Release Your Inner Bitch: Women Empowering Women isn't just another self-help book for battered women. Rather its message is that women of all ages, races, religions, occupations, and backgrounds can come forward and change the concept of the assertive woman as a \\"bitch\\" in the pejorative sense of that word. Indeed, this is a word that has come to be a derogatory or denigrating descriptive that permeates our gender biased culture. In Release Your Inner Bitch the reader will encounter the \\"robo bitch\\", the supreme bitch, PMS Bitch, and a whole spectrum of other bitch classifications that will enable the reader to have a new and healthier perspective about themselves, their lives, and their possibilities. Exceptionally well written by an especially articulate and knowledgeable author, Release Your Inner Bitch is a life-affirming, life-altering, life-enhancing, life-illuminating read. Also very highly recommended is Rose Stadler's historical novel, The Confederate (1413701914, $19.95)."},{"Title":"Release Your Inner Bitch: (Women Empowering Women)","review":"The previous reviewer apparently was upset by the book. Good. I like to get the juices flowing. She (he?)accused me of creating false women in the book. Wrong. All the submissions were done by the women who had discovered the inner bitch in themselves.

The reader wonders why Hutchinson chose to make the rural/urban comparison at all since in 1951-52 contact between the rural plantation(s) and Vila Recncavo was, per Hutchinson's own observations, tangential at best.Hutchinson also brings an unfortunate bias to this ethnography. Former slave holding plantation owners, as well as those he interviewed in the early \`50's, are excused by virtue of their 'humane paternalism'.

(Having just passed the CLEP hours ago, this is still very fresh in my mind.) But, while the book was better than nothing, meaning I don't think I could've passed the test without it, it seems very far off base as far as subject matter. The CLEP exams are changed every 6 months, so I can see there being some difficulty in keeping content fresh, but this is history we're talking about. How fresh does it need to be?Lots of black history questions were asked, while this topic wasn't covered in near as much detail as the test itself reflected it should have been.The first section of the book gives an overview of history from 1865 to present (2004), broken up into categories like Reconstruction, The Depression, World Wars, etc. But info isn't laid out in any sort of timeline, so I found myself jumping from info about the Carter Administration back to FDR and his New Deal, then back to the first George Bush. It made it more difficult to comprehensively read, what with all the past Kennedy's, Johnson's, Roosevelt's, Bushes, World Wars, etc. This back and forth frustrated me to no end, but perhaps someone else with a better grasp of history wouldn't mind. I would suggest a timeline of presidents from 1865 to present also.I enjoy history, but have never had a good teacher in school, and detest remembering details like dates and names. However, I made flash cards based on the 2 practice tests and their answers, and drilled relentlessly for 3 weeks. The problem was evident 5 minutes into the test, however. Only about half of what I studied was even questioned. The other 50% of the CLEP questions were on topics this book did not even address.While the 2 practice tests included in this book were helpful, and the explanation-answers even more helpful than the 'study guide' sections, I feel I would have been better prepared if I'd supplemented with another text book (it does recommend this, btw). Unless you know your history, or you graduated from high school recently, you might want to shop around, or supplement."},{"Title":"CLEP History of the United States II, 1865 to the present (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP (Test Preps)","review":"This book gives you all the information you need to pass the test, I passed with a 76 out of 80 after studying for 12 days, using only this book. The reason I did not give the book 5 stars is that the author makes several factual errors. One that comes to mind is saying that Sinclair Lewis wrote \\"The Jungle.\\" Uh.... Ms. Marlowe, that would be Upton Sinclair. There are also some apparent editing issues, as there are contradictions such as the text saying that there is no evidence that Hayes won the presidential election by promising to end reconstruction, then in the sample test section it states that such deal was in fact made. And there are several other similar kinds of mistakes. Not anything that would keep you from passing though, so, I still recommend this book as a single-source for passing the test. A tip: no fact or name in this book is too trivial to remember. Try to get as much in your head as possible.Update; 3/20/2007: I was suprised and happy to see that the author responded to this review and is very concerned about any errors. She is reviewing the material and will report any errors she finds to REA for correction. Thank you, Ms. Marlow for your committment to making this test guide the best that it can be.As a response to a couple of reviewers who complained that the guide didn't cover all of the material on their test: You need to apply some common sense and test taking strategy to the test. No book can cover all of the questions that might be asked. But, the answers to most of the questions on the test I took were easily deduced from material I learned in the book. For example, a test question might ask, \\"Who said the following quote:\\" and then list 4 names. Usually, all four people were discussed in the book. In a typical case, 1 name would fit exactly, perhaps 2 names were people who would never have said such a thing and the fourth name was a person who could reasonably have made the statement, but lived 70 years earlier. Don't expect the book to cover every quote that people may have said. In most cases, the test writers do not intend for you to know by heart who said what. They do intend for you to use logic and good judgment and to know enough about the major players so that you can choose the correct answer."},{"Title":"CLEP History of the United States II, 1865 to the present (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP (Test Preps)","review":"Book could, and should be improved by publisher.Half way through the test, I started thinking about \\"deleting\\" the results so that I could test again after getting better studying material.The book did not cover a lot of what was on the test.

I agree with one of the previous reviews that it is hard to prepare material for a test that changes twice a year, but we're dealing with history. The two topics that repeated themselves the most on my test that I had felt were not covered properly are black history, and pragmatism.My school doesn't assign grades for CLEP, just credit or no credit. I was surprised with my score only because by the time I had completed the 120 questions, I thought I had failed. I had to use a lot of reasoning skills to do as well as I did (which was barely above passing). This book can help you pass the test and receive credit.

Other sources say it was founded on May 1, 1954. There is a strong Christian element in Astara. This book of Astara, like many others deals with a lot of New Age subjects such as mysticism. If you go deeper into the symbolism of Astara you'll notice a seven pointed star with a lotus in the middle. This star represents the perfected man. The seven pointed star and the lotus is also tied into the Ancient Mystic Order of Melchizedek. Astara is very to the Rosicrucians, but more watered down. There explaination about the seven pole stars is very fascinating and kind of goes into the realm of astrology. But over all, besides for the symbolism and the knowledge of the pole stars, this book is still the basic New Age information dealing with karma and philosophy."},{"Title":"Lost Secrets of the Mystery Schools: The Coming of the Gods: Initiation and Rebirth (Astara's Library of Mystical Classics)","review":"I made the title of this review 'New Age Philosophy' but often things that are associated with the new age movement are really related to the very distant, even prehistoric past. The 'new age' part means we are going to rediscover that ancient knowledge.So far all of the books by Earlyne Chaney that I have read talk about the process of 'initiation' which was practiced in some form in very ancient Egypt and in Greece at various times. There were two forms of initiation which were the 'lesser mysteries' and the 'greater mysteries'.The initiation process was very mysterious and enabled the initiates to reach various levels of understanding of the mysteries and secrets which were given to the human race by the gods. Plato and Pythagorus travelled to Egypt and went through this process.She talks about the Oracle At Delphi which is associated with the god Appollo. Sadly the psychotic Roman emperor Nero had the priests and priestesses at Delphi buried alive because the pythoness informed Nero that his presence disgusted her. Her prophecy warning Nero to 'beware of 73' came true one year later however when Nero died and was succeeded by someone who was 73 years old.An interesting idea is that a great spirit or god merged with our sun to make it come alive or something like that. Earlyne believed the sun and the earth are living entities.She talks about the relationship between the mystery religions of antiquity and Christianity. Some people think that Christianity stole ideas from earlier religions and mythologies. But rather Christianity has some similarities with those other religions because they are all based on similar concepts and truths. Some people believe Christ and Melchizedek are the same person. The ancient priesthood in Egypt was part of the 'order of Melchizedek' as was Abraham.I don't think Earlyne thought much of the form of Christianity that we see today. Rather she seemed to yearn for those long lost days of old when the priests in ancient Egypt taught the initiates about the mysteries of nature and the universe.Earlyne felt that those mystery religions will rise again or perhaps merge with Christianity as we enter the Age of Aquarius in 2012.Jeff Marzano[...]"},{"Title":"Tomorrow, the Stars","review":"Don't expect a Heinlein collection, he's the editor.

I collect cookbooks from all over that focus on home cooking and this one is just right. I first took it out of the library and read it through, the pages are so nice, the weight of the paper, they are all four color. After the first reading I was ready to cook, which doesn't always happen. Some books are just better to read. I made enchiladas suizas, refried beans, and mexican rice and all came out great. There is something very nice and friendly about the tone, sometimes you read a cookbook and it feels like the author is trying to impress you with what a priveleged childhood they had. This lady makes you feel like she comes from a really loving family who loves to eat. I don't mind her substitutions, it all seems real."},{"Title":"The Mexican Mama's Kitchen: Authentic Homestyle Recipes (Authentic Homestyle Recipes)","review":"The recipes offered in this cookbook differ quite a bit from most Mexican cookbooks I have seen - rather than focusing on Tex-Mex cooking or on painstakingly authentic regional dishes, this author has a style of cooking that seems more European-influenced. The result is a unique collection of dishes - for example, Beef Tempura with Middle Eastern Sauce, small bites of shredded beef battered and fried, served with a spiced tomato sauce, or Pacholes, thin seasoned meat patties. I have tried several recipes - some of them are quite involved - but the results are worth it, subtly and richly flavored.I have taken one star off of my review because of some substitutions the author has offered. I notice that she lived in England, and perhaps as a result of this she lists feta cheese as an ingredient in her recipes - while most Americans can get their hands on authentic Mexican cheeses these days. Similarly, she recommends using canned corn instead of frozen or even fresh."},{"Title":"The Mexican Mama's Kitchen: Authentic Homestyle Recipes (Authentic Homestyle Recipes)","review":"A welcome contribution to the \\"Mama's Kitchen\\" series, The Mexican Mama's Kitchen: Authentic Homestyle Recipes combines classic and time-tested home recipes with the motherly tips and advice of an experienced cook, such as \\"When deseeding chilies, be as careful as possible.

I love Louis L'Amour (and have since childhood)and this is one of my favorites.

Jud Devitt has a contract to supply railroad ties to the Mexican Central Railroad. He is a ruthless man and usually gets his way. He meets his match in Clay Bell, the tall and straight owner of the Bar B. When various legal maneuvers fail to dislodge the cattlemen, it's guns and fists in blazing Western action. The disparate visions of those who develop the land and those who exploit natural resources drive the conflict. Louis L'Amour breathes new life into the familiar elements of the Western story. Although this novel was written back in 1955, the environmentalist vs. capitalist angle sounds familiar. A clash between cattlemen and lumberjacks is an unusual variation of the typical Western conflict. L'Amours novels and stories are a quick hit of colorful Wesyern adventure. They are good lightweight reading and a pleasant change from the plugged-in clamor of modern life. ;-)"},{"Title":"Guns of the Timberlands","review":"This book is in my top 5 of L'amour's works. The build-up to the climax is suitably gripping enough that I decided to finish the book in a single sitting.

His slender volume, Michael Broadbent's Complete Guide to Wine Tasting and Wine Cellars (1982) has long been, like they say about middleweight boxers, pound-for-pound the best book I've ever read about appreciating wine. When the wine auction scene arrived in Chicago in the mid-eighties. I can still remember attending some of the first few events at the University Club, sponsored by Christie's and conducted by the legendary MB. I was overwhelmed watching him lead auctions, but way too shy and in awe of him to introduce myself.Because MB is a wine tasting hero. He's quite possibly the most accomplished wine taster in the world, certainly when it comes to Bordeaux, and heir to centuries of Britain's dominance as the arbiter of European and thus the world's best wines. This book, Vintage Wines, is a compilation of tasting notes spanning his career. It presents notes on thousands of wines in MB's impeccable, staccato style in which he is often able to elucidate the innate character or value of a wine in a few succinct phrases, along with his 0-5 star rating system. It also weaves in wonderful details of vintages, wines, and people he has known and loved.Mr. Broadbent is a classicist, by which I mean his definition of quality predates Robert Parker's arrival on the wine scene. Inconceivable as it may be to many Americans, good wines were both made and enjoyed before Parker redefined the terms. Which is not to say that Parker adds no value to the debate, it's just that more modest authorities like Mr. Broadbent advocate a traditional style of wine making in which the individual character provided by soil and climate is given its expression rather than the creation of souless fruit-bombs. Finesse, breed, elegance, typicity, potential to improve with age, but most of all drinkability and compatibility with food are the hallmarks of great wines for Mr. Broadbent.Nothing illustrates the comparison better or helps you understand why you would want to consult MB's notes more than a look at the ratings of the same wines presented by MB's Vintage Wines, the Wine Spectator, and the Wine Advocate.Chateau Pavie, 2000. Very deep, velvety; tobacco-like, sweaty tannins;sweet ,full-bodied, charred and tarry taste. Impressive, but I much prefer the late Jean-Paul Valette's Pavie, which was so much more drinkable. For me. **. For wine competitions and our American cousins, (*****). (Michael Broadbent)\\"2000 Chateau Pavie (St.-Emilion): This is a super model of a wine. Super grapey, with red licorice and perfumed aromas. Full-bodied and very tight, with racy tannins and a sleek finish. Best wine of the hillsides of St.-Emilion. Lasts for minutes.\\" 95-100 Points - Wine Spectator, March 30, 2001\\"2000 Chateau Pavie (St.-Emilion): With no shortage of confidence, Gerard Perse feels the 2000 is the greatest Pavie ever produced. Premature you say? Don't discount the proprietor's rhetoric. A blend of 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc, and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, it is a backward, super-concentrated effort displaying an inky purple color, and a thrilling bouquet of minerals, black fruits, vitamins, and toast. It possesses a wealth of fruit, glycerin, and extract as well as high levels of tannin, and a finish that lasts nearly a minute. It will undoubtedly close down after bottling, and not be close to prime time drinking until 2010 or later. Anticipated maturity: 2010-2050.\\" 96-98 Points - Robert M. Parker, Jr.'s, The Wine Advocate, Issue 139Are they all talking about the same wine? Who is right? Only you can be the judge. While this happens to be a wine that MB doesn't much care for, you can get a good feeling for how his notes work. It's important to point out that he is definitely willing to call a spade a spade when he doesn't like a wine and the book has many such graceful and witty putdowns.Back to the book itself. The book is arranged by wine growing region, and while it touches all corners of the wine world, the pages devoted to each area are a telltale sign of where Mr. Broadbent's passion and experience lie. For example, here are the regions with the most notes, with pages in (): Red Bordeaux (150), White Bordeaux (46), Red Burgundy (58), White Burgundy (29), Germany (50), Italy (18), California (35). Each chapter starts out with a few paragraphs of background and then presents the notes, all arranged by vintage from the oldest to the most recent. Fortunately, the book was published in time to allow him to include some notes from the heralded 2000 Bordeaux vintage.I think it would be fair to say that Mr. Broadbent has access to and gets to taste a lot higher quality of wine than most of us, so many of the reviews are probably for wines that we will never see let alone get a chance to try. He starts each Bordeaux vintage with the first growths and the Burgundy vintage with DRC wines, such that if I bought a single bottle of each in one vintage it would cost more than I spend on wine in total in a good year.So that brings us to the downside of this wonderful compendium. What is it good for? If you're a die-hard MB fan like me, it's a treat to enter his world and vicariously taste yourself through his lifetime in wine. For others, it will prove valuable if you've got the money and inclination to buy great wines at auction (and avoid some over-rated clunkers). Even then, it's not by any means exhaustive, and if you're buying anything but the best of the best you can't always find what you want. For many of us it's a little like having your nose pressed against the glass, wishing that just once we'd get to taste (or even smell!) the 1945 Latour that MB has tasted and dutifully logged 28 times."},{"Title":"Michael Broadbent's Vintage Wine","review":"By Bill Marsano. We can divide wine drinkers into three classes. Ordinaire Joe, who'd rather drink wine than talk about it, is here advised to flee: This book will bore him stupid. The Wine Geek is just the opposite; for him wine is an excuse to prattle about clonal selection and hints of toffee on the nose. He'll love this book--will take it to bed with him. It is a gold mine of tasting notes covering many decades and innumerable wines from most regions of the world. The emphasis is on France, with Germany a distant third (there is no second), Italy a distant fifth (there is no fourth) and everybody else reduced to odds and ends. There's lots of stuff on champagne and port, too--a quintessentially British slant.Never mind: The author, Michael Broadbent, is British, and the British have always leant that way. He is also one of the Great Men of Wine: revitalizer of Christie's wine auctions since 1966, writer, advisor, globe-trotting taster and collector of anecdotes and memories. In Japan such a person is officially labeled a Living National Treasure.That makes this book of value and interest to the third class of wine drinkers--the Sub-Geek (or perhaps wannabe) who recognizes that his enjoyment of wine can be enhanced by a little more knowledge of its history and traditions, its lore and learing, its famous places and personages. There's a lot of that in this book, and it's always modestly and charmingly delivered. The reader must patiently winkle it out, however. It's all wrapped up in sidebars among those endless pages of tasting notes (about 500 of them) and is sometimes hidden inside individual tasting notes themselves.This is the sort of book that will grace a shelf for a long time. There's no possibility of reading straight through it, and that's the wrong approach anyway. This book sits and waits for those late evenings with a last glass and an inquiring mind. It is to be leafed through for the pleasure of Broadbent's company.--Bill Marsano is a wine and spirits writer who has won a James Beard medal and other awards."},{"Title":"Michael Broadbent's Vintage Wine","review":"This is indeed Broadbent's best work to date. He combines his 50 years of experience to rate wines from the 17th century to 2001 Vintages. Each page includes everything from average price to serving suggestions for dinner. This is a great book for the aspiring beginner as well as the seasoned expert."},{"Title":"Michael Broadbent's Vintage Wine","review":"Michael Broadbent is a justifiably legendary critic whose perspective is especially valuable in a Shanken/Parker-dominated world. This book is great.However, one word of caution on this book -- a non-negligible fraction of his tasting notes from old wines are likely inaccurate, because the wines in question were likely fake. Namely, Broadbent (and many other critics) relied heavily on a German dealer/collector named Hardy Rodenstock for samples of the oldest wines noted in the book (by which I mean pre-WWII and especially pre-1900). For example, if you look at MB's tasting notes on pre-1900 Chateau d'Yquem, it appears that one-third or more of the TN's are attributable to Rodenstock-sourced bottles. Rodenstock is now the subject of lawsuits filed by two prominent collectors, Bill Koch and Russell Frye, as detailed in a recent WSJ article. He is steadily developing a reputation as one of the bigger [...] in the history of the fine wine business. This is not to say that most of the old wines tasted by MB weren't genuine, but because Rodenstock was such a major source of old wines, it is now difficult to know which were fake and which were real.MB was likely a victim of Rodenstock's chicanery, pure and simple. But the responsible thing to do at this point would be to issue a new edition down the road with known Rodenstock-sourced bottles stripped from the book."},{"Title":"Michael Broadbent's Vintage Wine","review":"Even if you haven't / will not try most of the wines tasted by MB, the mere description of the wines in his unique British style will make your taste buds shiver.

It goes into the history of the design, the Navy's decision to adopt the deep-ring structure instead of the classical Zeppelin wire-braced ring design, and the development of parasite aircraft operations.It also covers the operational history, from the first tentative flights to the much more audacious oceanic missions. And it covers the losses, both the disaster that befell the Akron and her crew, and the loss of the Macon."},{"Title":"The Airships Akron & Macon: Flying Aircraft Carriers of the United States Navy","review":"I bought this book, used, for research purposes, and it was exactly what I was looking for and more.

But - that's what got me to purchase the book... it's not what got me to *Love* the book.Hannah is a superb writer that tells a wonderful story time and time again. After finishing this (paperback) book in the middle of the night I went running to my computer to find another book to download onto my Kindle app because I couldn't wait to get pulled into another story!

She'd carefully crafted a life to help her reach the lofty goals of a good job, love, marriage and children. In that order.

I'd highly recommend What We do for Love to anyone who enjoys women's fiction with a reality bite."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This book was such a worthwhile read. I was looking for a book and came across this on my Amazon account and thought I would give it a try. What a wonderful choice. It was one of those books that you feel sad when it is over as the characters are so well developed that you become immersed in the storyline. In the end, you feel like you are walking away from \\"friends\\" instead of just ending a good book.I always enjoy books that have some kinds of happy messages that are relatable and take you to a place in your heart that life sometimes scars. It is a beautiful story of love and family.Although the storyline is a little too perfect, it is nice to sometimes read about bad events that end in a happy outcome.I very much recommend this book for someone who is looking for an easy enjoyable read that will leave you feeling good."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Hannah is a wonderful writer. There is no denying it. I read the book briskly. And if you enjoy her style then I would say go for it. But it isn't on my list of books to run out and tell my friends they HAVE TO read this next. But if you're looking to get away into another world, definitely go right ahead and read this book. I just didn't finish it and think, WOW.

I just finished reading this novel and I have to say I couldn't put it down! I'm not an avid reader, so this book surprised me! The way Hannah writes constantly made me imagine I was right there in the scene of the book. I bought this book only to have read the back cover, never heard of Hannah, and to my surprise I am not disappointed. I would have never guessed the ending to play out like it did. This book taught me a lot about love, life, and second chances! I would definetly recommend this to any woman who has the desire to have a child!"},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I bought this book on a whim and could not put it down. I can not praise the author enough. She excels in creating an emotional journey through her characters that you won't easily forget. She delves deeply into her characters psyches and delineates every nuance of feeling that is felt. The things we do for love is a touching story about the feelings and emotions of every day people. She captures you and takes you into the hearts and lives of her characters with such conviction. The element of mystery woven throughout the story keeps you on the edge wondering what will occur next. I could feel every emotion that was portrayed in detail. The karmic bond between Lauren and Angela from the very first meeting displayed the evidence of a strong soul connection. Destiny created the delicate balance between love and compassion as it brought all the characters together to share in a beautiful ending where all was complete. I don't want to share too much of the story and spoil the surprise for other readers so I will end with my favorite thought from the book. Page 280 shared that for once Lauren felt as if she was a part of things instead of on the outside looking in. A feeling of belonging is one of the best one can experience. I have already purchased another on of Kristan Hannah's books to read, I love her writing."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Kristin Hannah has ruined me for other authors. Her books are so poignant. This is only my second read by Hannah. This is a wonderful story of family and the lack of family.

I don't do this often, but on this book I had to skip ahead and read a page towards the end just to make sure it ended the way I was hoping (it did!). If you are thinking about reading this book, do!

After reading her work, you wouldn't know that she started her career as a lawyer. During a difficult pregnancy she decided to pick up a project that her mom and she had started while her mom was ill. Her mom always knew her daughter was destined to be a writer, not a lawyer. Kristin's ability to portray realistic, well-rounded characters shines through again in The Things We Do for Love.Angela Desaria Malone lost her father, a newborn daughter and her husband (to divorce) all within a short period of time. After several failed attempts to have a child, Angela and her husband try the adoption route. Unfortunately, this too fails at the very last moment and proves to be a crushing blow to Angela. The grief of these losses has brought her life to a halt.Finally, unable to deal with her old life, she moves back to her family's cottage by the sea in West End, Washington, where she grew up. She hopes she will be able to figure out where her life should go from here. Mending a broken heart is not always easy but it's made even more difficult by her loud, but good-intentioned, Italian family who seem to show up on her doorstep whenever they think they are needed, whether Angela feels that way or not. In addition to dealing with her family, there is also a family business, an Italian restaurant called Desaria's, which is in danger of going under. Angela decides to user her advertising skills to jump in and try to help save it. Putting all of her time and energy into this new project helps her forget about her grief a little at a time.Lauren Ribido is a teenager with no family to speak of and is in danger of being evicted from the rundown apartment she shares with her basically absentee mother. After being laid off from her job at the local pharmacy, she plasters flyers on cars in the neighborhood in an effort to find work. Dealing with an alcoholic, non-working, almost non-existent mother, the boyfriends she brings home and the landlord's demands for their late rent are only some of Lauren's struggles. She has worked hard to get into the right high school and has big plans for her future, but the adversities she faces may keep her from reaching her goals.Angela needs a child to mother. Lauren needs a mother's love. Their meeting was meant to be. What starts out as an employer/employee relationship quickly blossoms into so much more and through various trials they find out how to truly fulfill each other's needs. Together they will both learn to trust and love again.The Things We do for Love is a heartwarming story with some expected, and some unexpected, twists.

I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is the 3rd Kristin Hannah book I've read (just discovered her this past year) & this is probably my favorite so far.

I really loved Angie and Lauren and don't blame Lauren for her choice in the end. I will definitely be reading more Kristin Hannah in the future!"},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"All in all, Hannah told a moving story of two women who filled the gaps in each others' lives. Hannah's writing style initially bored me, and I found myself annoyed with the emphasis on the main character and her issues for much of the beginning. I began to change my mind toward the middle of the book, but the predictable plot turn and cliche overarching message makes this a so-so read."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I stumbled onto Kristin Hannah's books as it was listed as a suggestion.

The last book I had read by Kristen Hannah (On Mystic Lake) had been a disapointment so I wasn't sure I wanted to bother, but my daughter had purchased it so I thought I would give her another try and I was pleasantly suprised. The book was a good length and easy to read. I really liked the characters and enjoyed the interaction between the noisy Italian family members. I thought the character of Angie was well developed and the auther did a good job of descibing the sometimes overwhelming emotions of grief and how the pain can change you, sometimes for the better as in Angie's case. Overall, Lauren was also a good character. I would like to have seen a little more depth to her, but appreciated how she changed her life despite the odds against it.That said, I was a little disappointed in the ending. I thought it was a bit of a compromise to keep both sides of the argument happy, but left me a little deflated.Overall, it was it was a good book and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Story line was okay but was disappointed with the ending. End of story was somewhat unrealistic; however, the author did a good job of building the story and then I felt like I was left hanging and expected a better closure."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The Things We Do For Love is another tearjerker written by Kristin Hannah. Angela and Conlan have been married 14 years. Their marriage dissolves under the disappointment of miscarriages and the death of their one week old daughter. Angela returns to her seafront home where she meets teenager Lauren whose bitter alcoholic mother doesn't care if Lauren lives or dies. Angela always believed a baby and baby alone would fulfill her but after getting to know and love impoverished and desolate Lauren, Angela begins to see the truth: you can love a child no matter what their age and be a mother to that child. This book also accurately portrays what happens to so many teenage mothers. The girl's life is drastically and permanently altered (sometimes for the worse) and the father of the child is, for the most part, unaffected. This is a sad novel so you'll need to keep the tissue handy. The characters are all likable so it's easy to care about them. The ending is sweet and poignant. I definitely recommend The Things We Do For Love."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. There wasn't much of a climax to it, just kinda kept going on and on. A bit predictable as well. Of course the teen living with her would get pregnant, it's kind of a given in a book like this.

I can't tell you about Angie without completely giving up the plot. All in all this book really tugs at your heartstrings, as both main characters are broken individuals when the book starts out. The plot was a bit predicatable, but if you don't mind that you shouldn't mind this book. I love Kristin Hannah, and The Things We Do For Love doesn't disappoint. Highly Recommended!

I cared about every character in this book especially the two women at the center of the plot, Angie and Lauren. Both women face their struggles with dignity and courage.

Bad things - the story of the book did not happen in the order it made it seem like on the cover. Typical Hannah. The jacket says that Angie and Lauren would go through this big thing and I was hoping it wouldn't be the cliche (I don't want to totally give it away, but you can get the clues from the jacket).

And then, it takes a dramatic turn that is both outrageous and nonsensical, not to mention totally inconsistent with the character we learn to love throughout the book. The end is a profound betrayal to the characters and the reader, that turns what could have been a beautiful story into a taudry tale of selfishness, betrayal and poor judgment. I don't get it. Kristen is usually so good at understanding how a character's actions affect the other characters in the book. Not this time.

This story personifies the age-old cry of injustice regarding people who want children and aren't able to have them, versus those that have them but don't want them or aren't able to take care of them. In a heartbreaking but spellbinding manner, Ms. Hannah expertly exposes the raw and ragged relationship between the young Lauren, with nothing but a bright and happy future ahead and her mother, whose life seems to be one of continual failures and disappointments. When Lauren seamlessly becomes part of a large and loving family through recently divorced Angie (who's desire to be a mother has left her emotionally spent), they each fulfill a critical need in the other, that is nothing short of heart-wrenching. I laughed, I cried, I didn't want it to end. I know it's a good book that I've just finished when I spend the next 2 days thinking through what would have happened next--had there been another chapter. I appreciate the writing style of Ms. Hannah and very much look forward to the next book of hers that I read. (I have two unread in the book case--ready to dive in!)"},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I enjoyed this novel, which explores the concept of motherhood in many different forms. First there is Angie, who wanted to be a mother so badly that it ruined her marriage. She undergoes several unsuccessful rounds of IVF, she pins her hopes on adopting a baby from a pregnant teenage mother who later changes her mind, and she experiences the heartbreak of giving birth to a premature baby, who later dies. All of this occurs before the novel begins; by the time we meet Angie, her marriage is falling apart and she's getting ready for a divorce.Second there is Lauren, whose mother is an alcoholic who takes little interest in her. Lauren lives in a dilapidated apartment but is determined to break out of the lower class by working hard at school. Then she becomes pregnant and all of her plans are called into question.Third there is Maria, who is Angie's mother. Maria is a rock, the Italian mother of three adult girls. Maria has a minor role in the story, but her presence is still important; she is the head of a big, noisy family, the kind of family Lauren has always dreamed of and Angie has always taken for granted.When Lauren and Angie meet, it seems they are both able to give each other some semblance of what they've always dreamed about. Angie immediately adopts the role of a mother, taking Lauren in when Lauren's real mother finally abandons her. Lauren, in turn, is made to feel a part of Angie's big Italian family. But the real challenge to their relationship comes when Lauren announces her pregnancy. Angie is suddenly confronted with envy towards the girl she's come to think of as a daughter. And Lauren isn't sure she wants to keep the baby. When she offers it to Angie, Angie isn't sure she wants to accept--can she go through heartbreak again if Lauren changes her mind?Ultimately, the question of what it means to be a mother is the central theme of this book. The different relationships between the characters are explored in detail, and those relationships become more and more complex as the story reaches its unpredictable conclusion. Anyone who is interested in the subject of motherhood will find this novel to be an enjoyable and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Angie experiences so much loss in her family and searches for peace.

If you loved, \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" you will love the family in this book.Angela DeSaria Malone befriends Lauren Ribido whose selfish and toxic mother abandons her. Lauren experiences the stark contrast between the large family craziness and Lauren's home life as she struggles to achieve her academic goals and learns that she can determine her own fate.Laruen's unexpected pregnancy takes her on a path where she faces her fears, her past, and discovers herself, truth, and true friendship. Angela also is taken down the path of healing her past and facing her flaws and fears.Great book, but have the tissue nearby. I will definately recommend this author."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and I will have to thank her. It was a great fast, easy read and a wonderful heart-warming story. I don't usually go for this kind of reading but I must admit that I couldn't put this one down. I actually read it in one and half days. I would highly recommend this but really just to women, I don't think a man would be interested."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Angie DeSario has found the bottom of the barrel - from the loss of her daughter, the loss of her father and divorce from her husband of 14 years, she's determined to find some peace in her life and returns home to the small town where her mother and sisters, a lot of memories and much needed healing await.Lauren Ribido is a teenage girl who can only count the love of her boyfriend as a blessing. When life unexpectedly throws twist after twist at Lauren, her mother abandons her and Angie seems to be the shining example of a mother she never had, these two women will help each other, hurt each other and most of all, become the family each of them has longed for all their lives.The story is heart-wrenching, with emotional viewpoints from both Angie and Lauren. This is the first novel of Kristin Hannah's that I've read, it definitely won't be the last. I could not put this story down, these two women, one young and with life full ahead and one not-so-old, but wise and saddened beyond her years, touched my heart. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've always been a fan of Kristin Hannah's books, but this one is the best by far. I was swept away by this story. I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, and yet hated to see my time with these wonderful characters come to an end. I'm recommending it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I don't know how Kristin wrote this story without crying her eyes out the whole time. But then, maybe she did. This has to be one of the sweetest stories I've read in a long time, heartbreaking in more ways than one, but the end results will warm your heart. They say most fiction writers base a lot of their story content on real life circumstances, and I know this can be true. Still, you wonder how one mother can be so heartless to her own daughter, while another woman can come along to pick up the pieces, and feel blessed just being able to do so. My hat is off to Kristin on this one, she's written a remarkable novel. And she's right...The Things We Do For Love...are too numerous to mention.I can't wait for Kristin's next novel. I totally recommend this book to anyone for their reading pleasure."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I am a huge fan of Kristin Hannah and once again, she has produced a winner. i could not put this book down - in fact, I read the final 200 pages in one sitting!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I have been a fan of Kristin Hannahs since she wrote On Mystic Lake but I must admit that her latest project is her best book to date.

If she'd let Angie and Con adopt the baby they'd all be one big happy family and that's what I wanted.Loved the depiction of Italian family life.

I read it on the beach and completely fell in love with the characters! I couldn't put it down. I always had to see what was going to happen next! I found myself waking up early in the morning to read a few pages before the new hubby woke up. I finished it on the honeymoon and my poor hubby woke up to me crying hysterically in bed. It was an amazing book and I've been recommending it to people ever since. This book and \\"Winter Garden\\" by the same author are my definite favorites of hers out of the many books of hers that I have read."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I enjoyed this book for the most part. I like the way Hannah's characters explore motherhood from different perspectives. The protagonist, Angela DeSaria Malone, 38 is newly divorced and traumatized. After several miscarriages and a daughter who dies shortly after her birth as well as a failed adoption attempt, Angela's depressions after these tragic losses sadly rang the death knell in her marriage. Her husband, Conor Malone felt that their marriage had been tabled because of Angela's deep depressions. As with so many of Hannah's characters who actually do travel, Angela returns to her small hometown of West End in Washington State. Most of Hannah's characters are like Evergreen State boomerangs - once thrown out into the world for travel and other reasons, sooner or later they return to Washington State to regroup and repair relationships. This book is no exception.Angie's co-protagonist is Lauren Ribido, a high school senior who has a perfect academic track record. She is the class of 2004 and aiming for a scholarship to USC. A brilliant student, she secures a scholarship to the prestigious Catholic prep school, Fircrest Academy. She lives in a very bad part of town with a single mother who, at 34 reminds her almost daily that having her [Lauren] was a mistake. Lauren's mother is Lauren's opposite number. She smokes, drinks, picks men up in bars and takes drugs. Their landlord, a kindly woman named Mrs. Mauk often lets them slide on the rent due to Lauren's ambitious drive to get out of the dingy apartment building and to start a new life.Lauren does indeed get blessed with a new life. Her rich boyfriend of 4 years, David, fathers their child. David is rich and is eyeing top colleges. Lauren is eyeing a possible scholarship. Prior to becoming pregnant, Lauren left fliers around town seeking work. Enter Angie, who eventually hires Lauren to work in the DeSaria family restauant. There, as is expected, Lauren shines.She and Angie bond, Lauren becoming and not unexpectedly so like a daughter to Angie. Angie fights like a soldier for her and even butts heads with some rather formidable challenges on Lauren's behalf.The DeSaria family are a delightful cast of characters, from the DeSaria sisters' mother, Maria, who is also a formidable character. She still confers with her late husband, called Papa. Papa adored Angie and favored Angie, much to her two older sisters' dismay.Angie has to repair her relationship with her two older sisters, left in tatters after she left West End to attend college in California and start a life far removed from the restaurant. She has to swallow her pride and face the music in her small hometown. One's heart goes out to Angie when she winces at the \\"kid talk\\" from her sisters and brothers-in-law. Angie's losses are like a shroud she wears until she meets Lauren.Despite Angie's good intentions to Lauren, including taking her in after the girl's own mother abandons her for becoming pregnant, questions arise. Is Angie doing the right thing? Will Lauren keep her baby? And will David stay in the picture? Will she disappoint Angie as another young mother did when she stayed at Angie's home?Love and motherhood, the ultimate love is the hub on which this story turns. Each character is richly drawn and is quite plausible. While complex on many levels, the conclusion seemed rather predictable. Even so, it's well worth reading.10cc's 1977 song \\"The Things We Do For Love,\\" which I never liked could easily underscore this book."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"To start off I am an avid reader who likes many different kinds of books and likes a variety of different authors. I just started reading this book two days ago and I couldn't put it down. I think that the message that Kristin has in this book is a very important one. I wish in many ways that I would have read this in high school.Although most of the book centers around the two main character's Angie and Lauren I liked how she intertwined the meaning of family within in the novel. Growing up being very close to my sisters it was nice to see the bond that Kristen created with the three sisters.Not wanting to give much away about the book I would say it encompasses three main values in my opinion: Family, forgiveness, and friendship. I would recommend this book to everyone I know and can't wait to read more from this author."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The book arrived in the expected time frame, in the advertised conditioned.

On the other side of town lives Lauren Ribido, a teenager, with a mother that cares more for her next drink than her daughter. In this book we find that life may bring our greatest wishes in a different package than we expect."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I had enjoyed the first book that I read by this author (Magic Hour: A Novel), but I thought that was mostly due to the subject matter (feral children). This book shared similarities in that it too was about families and children. And also that the family was so unrealistic.Still, it was an enjoyable and certainly escapist-fast read. I will most likely read more by her - though I doubt I will ever pay full price.In many ways, this author is reminiscent of Jodi Picoult - though on a more superficial, beach-read type of level.Still, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sappy, sentimental-type book."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I recently picked this book up from my local library. I liked it but I did not love it. It is a good read but I felt that the book was predictable. I pitied the young teen-aged girl character, Lauren Ribido. Sigh.

It's pretty long, but it became a true page turner around the last 100 pages or so. I felt that there was a lot of detail, which resulted in a rushed ending.

I was so delighted with Ms. Hannah's writing; I could not put this book down. Then the formulaic melodrama kicked in. I was so disappointed that this author resorted to the usual drama."},{"Title":"The Things We Do for Love (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"This is a poignant drama about the price we pay so willingly for love. \\"Angie longs for a baby dauhter. Lauren longs to know a mother's love.\\" Angela returns to her hometown of West Bend, 120 miles from Seattle to help her father reopen his restaurant. Colin, the journalist, drives her there in his BMW intno the Pacific Northwest.In fact, he is deserting her to a fate she didn't forsee. Not having been able to produce a baby, which they had so wanted for a long time, he is 'leaving' her. As she adapted to this change in circumstances, she finds a young pregnant girl, Lauren, there and decides that by taking her in and adopting the baby, she will have at last received a bit of her dream, albeit it without Conlan.\\"She got in the car, heading north on Driftwood and found Lauren with red and swollen eyes at the bus stop.\\" She changed what would have been her child's room into an oasis for Lauren. \\"The leftovers of her marriage were all here.\\" She reminises as her life took a sharp right hand turn. Conlan comes on a visit and sees the baby things; \\"I brought everything to the cottage for Lauren.\\" She'd entered into a Faustian bargan and it would take them all on a terrible journey; at the end of it, broken hearts would be on the side of the road.Her lost dreams may at last come true, but at what expense. This story is written with compassion and conviction. I wish I could have found an Angie in 1975 and I might have had my 'little girl' to help me in my older years. The boys won't.For sensitive women, no matter what age, the things they will do for love of a particular man is beyond description. She needed a baby to get her life back in gear with the man she loved. Lauren had an alcoholic mother and a boyfriend who had insisted on abortion. Once you have had one, you will be forever guilty of killing someone you might have loved.Adoptive families like Angie's and Lauren's can find plenty of practical information in books, magazines, and on the Web. Charles Dickens wrote about Little Em'ly who was adopted in DAVID COPPERFIELD. Barbara Kinsolver, Jacquelyn Mitchard, Joanna Trollope, Gretchen Moran Laskas, and William Kowalski have written novels about adoption of unwanted chidren. The author, Kristin Hannah, is married and has a son -- but, like me, she must have always wanted a daughter.

Kristin Hannah really missed an opportunity to write a genuine book about the pain and frustration of infertility.

Hundreds or thousands of images reduced in size and placed on a grid so as to create an impression of a larger, overall image. The 'tiles' used are selected for their color, shapes and shading within the image so as to most truthfully represent the relevant section of the larger image. What's more, the descriptive content of the 'tiles' is usually relevant to the larger image. Some of the best examples of this are the widescreen stills used from George Lucas's Star Wars in generating larger images of Darth Vader, and Yoda, and civil war photographs used to create an image of Abraham Lincoln.The book contains 96 pages with 28 full page photomosaics, and in addition often has enlarged sections of each image to show the smaller image content. Interspersed with the images are thought provoking quotes relating to the pictures, and an all too short introduction briefly describes how photomosaics came about. (Not technical enough in my opinion). The images are created in a 6 color printing process for exceptional quality resultsThis is is one of those ideas where I think to myself - 'I wish I'd been involved in this'. As the artist/creator Robert Silvers says - 'This is for lovers of pictures'. One of my main interests in computing is the generation of images by use of computers, whether it be popular methods such as fractals, ray-tracing or any other form of computer art. Even the 3D Eye auto-stereogram pictures are computer generated. (I assumed the dig on the back cover in respect of the fact that everyone can see photomosaics, was in reference to these auto-stereograms!)This concept of using pictures to create pictures seems simple on the surface and sounds like another easy money maker for someone along the line. Maybe it is, but the technology behind creating such pictures is leading edge and was performed by Rob Silvers as part of his Masters at MIT Media Lab. The amount of work involved in collating tens of thousands of images from all sorts of sources, and then analyzing each image as to color and shading content, underlying shapes within the image, and descriptive content of the images is immense. All sorts of tricks were used to speed up and improve the quality of the photomosaics produced.If I were to have this as a coffee-table book at a party, I would need one per visiting guest, and I would get a quiet thirty seconds whilst people got the gist of the book and then it would be the talk of the evening. (Maybe that's an indication of my guests rather than the book!)I would dearly have loved to have been involved at that exciting development stage of the (patent pending) technology, but sadly this book is likely to be as near to being involved as I ever get. Mind you it is hard, in any case, not to get involved with this fascinating book. I shall be putting an order in for my 1999 calender as soon as it comes out.This review comes from somebody who does NOT live in Boston, unlike many other reviewers!!"},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"The photomosaics in this book are the most superb that I have ever seen. The book provides close-ups, so that you may see each individual picture. The book has a wide variety of photomosaics, and the one that touched me the most was the AIDS Memorial quilt one. This is a fabulous for photography busts, and non-photography books alike. This is an amazing collection that can be appreciated by many people."},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"A great gift for someone who loves photography! I gave it as a gift, but enjoyed it so much I got one for myself."},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"Using a large number of small images to create the impression of a larger image is an art form that I find fascinating. In this book, Silvers presents 28 photomosaics, everything from classic artwork such as the Mona Lisa to images from Star Wars. For most of the images, a blow-up of a small section is included so that you can see the structure of the image.In general, the small images are of objects related to the large image. For example, the image of Bill Gates, for years the richest man in the world is constructed using images of paper money around the world. The image of Darth Vader is constructed using images from the Star Wars series of movies. I found this to be one of the most interesting collections of artwork I have ever looked through."},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"The quality of each and every mosaic in this book is stupendous. Looking at all the pictures is almost therapeutic. With the microscope provided, hours can be spent looking at the tiny pictures that create a beautiful scene from a distance. The amount of effort and time put into this book seems baffling, but the author's effort truly pays off."},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"You may have noticed ads or images that looked like Rob Silvers' Photomosaics and you may even have thought he was the author. As in any art forms, people try to copy and mimic what has proved successful, trying to catch the wave. This often fails and the public will need the time to learn to appreciate the differences and distinguish high quality work from pale copies. For instance Rob has perfected his technic to the point that he doesn't colorize the tiles in order to represent the desired overall shape. Not only does he look at the colors in the tiles but also at the shapes they contain, looking for the best match. What I loved about the book is that it really helps you learn visually about those details and fully appreciate the value of the work. I wish that a more elegant stock paper had been used for the cover of the book. Not to mention that the back cover is particularly unelegant with the use of large yellow type. The rest of the book supports a lot better the beautiful images."},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"This is a great book showing a amazing new visual concept, I rembered the amazing life cover, but I was suprised to see other amazing and original uses of this art. I also enjoyed the quotes describing some of the photos... nice intro to"},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"I got hold of a preproduction sample of Photomosaics and passed it around a bit at brunch. People would not put it down. They were grinning like 4-year-olds with a new fire engine.The printing quality is superb and the included magnifying glass lets you zoom down to the finest detail in tiles. The publisher has also broken out portions of each image so that you don't need the magnifying glass to appreciate the irony (e.g., a photo of Bill Gates formed out of scanned bank notes).Nits: as with so many photo books, the introductory and accompanying text is weak. Intelligent writing about photography is rare (see http://photo.net/photo/ for my reviews of some writings by Sontag and John Szarkowski's introduction to a Winogrand monograph). Photomosaics would be a better book if they'd chopped all the text and just shown the pictures. But it is easy enough to ignore the text completely and become absorbed in the photos. That's what my brunch guests did. Then they all tried to figure out how to buy copies as gifts."},{"Title":"Photomosaics","review":"just awesome...it was fascinating that something so overwhelming was even attempted.

Small in size and easy to take with, it is a must to have it handy. The committed authors have presented the details in a style enjoyable to all walkers including children.From the time of snow-melts and all the way to autumn, about 1500 species of native wild flowers bloom here. The authors state that this area has not been covered by marine waters or glacial ice, because it happens to be in one of the oldest mountain masses. Subtropical families of flowers from pre-glacial times continue to grow here.The book contains of approximately 140 color photos and short descriptions of wild blossoms including Botanical names. Directions on how to find them and the month(s) they bloom are also given.

Presented by The Americus Society, over which David Rockefeller is the honorary chairman, the exhibition which toured from 1997-98 was to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the Art Gallery of The Americus Society. The works featured by Maria Izquierdo are fine, mostly color with some black and white reproductions , exemplifying her masterful technique and exquisite eye for detail. The works cover the four decades in which she painted, the 1920's through 1950's with the 1940's being her most productive. You will see her circus paintings of which she was very fond, her self portraits, her unique Mexican cultural glimpses and her surrealist works. Her works are full of vivid displays of color that resulted in many dubbing her style more &quot;Mexican&quot; than her female contemporary Frida Kahlo. Besides the beautiful reproductions there are three essays that discuss approximatley 25 plates each. Of particular note is the essay by Elena Poniatowski who covers her late period in which Maria was working despite a series of health restricing problems. Ultimately these health problems sent her to the grave at an early age. She died one year after Frida Kahlo at age 53 in 1954. All of the essays are interesting, cover different times of her life and are very revealing . She was a woman much like Frida Kahlo, who was ahead of her times in terms of being independent, persuing an art career dominated by men and liberated from the restrictions tradionally imposed by society. As you read you can just imagine the interaction she and Mexican artist Rufino Tamayo must have had as they painted , lived and loved together. Her associations with other contemporary writers and artists, including Tina Mondotti, Antonin Artaud, Lola Alvarez Bravo and Frida Kahlo among others is also documented and her renowned parties discussed. She was woman of her age who set the stage for future generations to follow. An excellent book that is bilingual and highly recommended for art students. It comes complete with a selected bibliography for future and more extensive reading."},{"Title":"Reinventing Sunday: Breakthrough Ideas for Transforming Worship","review":"This new entry on the expanding shelf of books on worship seeks to provide inspiration and practical resources for those who regularly lead worship. Drawing on a wide range of traditions and practices, author Berglund hopes to support readers &quot;in breathing life into your weekly ritual&quot; (p. xvii).He brings seven assumptions to the subject at hand (pp. xvii-xviii):1. Worship should be offered to God as worship, not as evangelism or Christian education.2. Worship is what worshipers do for God.3. Worship leaders are not performers but prompters of those in the pew.4. Worship can transform our lives and make us more faithful.5. Worship should activate our whole self, including our bodies.6. God-centered worship expands our souls.7. Worship is a weekly mini pilgrimage, an adventure into the unknown.Robert Webbers emphasis on the fourfold movement of worship (gathering of the people, service of the Word, responding in gratitude, going out to serve) gives Berglund's handbook its structure, augmented by prelude and postlude.Each section expands on one of the assumptions and offers practical suggestions for worshipers and worship leaders alike. Berglund~ years of experience as a pastor and worship leader, supported by an undergraduate degree in music and training for spiritual direction, contribute depth and breadth to his understanding. He addresses the stresses and storms surrounding worship today.In one of the most valuable portions of the book, &quot;The Modulating Church,&quot; the author tackles the challenges of bringing a key change in worship to the congregation. His well-considered suggestions correct some of the market-mentality aberrations that afflict churches today. &quot;Is the motto of the church The customer is always right'? Worshipers are not clients. Churches are in the business of creating a new heaven and a new earth, not satisfying shareholders&quot; (p. 91).For a brief but current and comprehensive guide for those leading worship, one would be hard put to find anything more accessible and usable than this book. It has, in this reviewer's mind, only a couple of relatively minor flaws. An index would add to its usefulness. On page 8 the author employs a highly dubious etymology for the word innovate. To relate it to ovary/ovum--and therefore to fertility and birth--rather than to novum is a bit of a stretch.Rev. Joseph I. MortensenAmerican Baptist Churches of MichiganMidland, MichiganFrom &quot;Congregations.&quot; A publication of the Alban Institute"},{"Title":"Reinventing Sunday: Breakthrough Ideas for Transforming Worship","review":"Brad Berglund has written an extraordinary book. A man for whom creativity is obviously a part of his soul, he shares ideas that make worship come alive in the local church setting. A man whose stories prove he has searched his own soul, he places his ideas in the context of profound human experience -- sorrowful, tragic and humorous.The book brings focus and meaning to worship. Berglund has obviously reflected deeply on the nature and meaning of worship and gently guides the reader into his deep understanding of his topic. He opens doors of whose existence most people are unaware, and then he makes walking through them as safe and comfortable as coming home.Obviously, this man loves worship and loves people. Every page glows with enthusiasm for life and for his topic. His book, both simple and direct, is a joy to read because of its compactness, clarity and ready applicability.Drawing from a wide variety of traditions, he covers every aspect of worship. He shares more ideas than any church could apply in several years. The fun is in choosing which ideas serve your congregation best. An added benefit is the listing of other resources that he names throughout the text.This is a book first to read and then to reference again and again."},{"Title":"Reinventing Sunday: Breakthrough Ideas for Transforming Worship","review":"Product was as described and arrived on time.

The bow grip described in the volume is very odd, and yet, after digging up recordings of Spivakovsky's Paganini caprices, there's no doubt that he made it work and was a very successful, expressive player. It's a testament to the kind of experimentation and risk-taking that has always elevated violin technique.Yost's son has republished the works independently here, and I believe it will be quite a while before they enter the public domain."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"This was a very interesting book that looks at the deaths of four California Highway Patrol officers in 1970. The story is told in an engaging fashion that draws the reader in, in the style of The Onion Field. The background information is good, and paints a strong image. When describing the actual event and its aftermath, I was left wanting more detail. While I realize that it was not designed to be a true after-action report, I was still left wanting for some of the details. I would like to have seen a large section on the lessons learned from the event. All in all a good book, but there is more to be told."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I was looking for a factual acount of the Newhall Incident. The author's attempt at clairvoyance was of no interest to me. A more prophylactic discussion of the aftermath of the shootings, and the measures instituted by the CHP to prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again would have been far more interesting. The book borders on more fiction than fact. From my standpoint the book was disapointing."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I read this book while I was an explorer with the CHP. It has good background information and the stories of both sides of this conflict prior to the incident. It seems that it focuses more on the criminals, and what drove them to do it, but it lacks many of the officer safety innovations that the CHP developed after this incident. Everything from basic PMA to felony stops were revised because of this. While I was at the explorer academy, they stressed this incident to us over and over, and why we needed to be alert, in shape, and knowledgeable in out tactics as an individual, and as a team. Now I know why, after reading about the darkest day in the history of the California Highway Patrol. But the book is lacking, and could have been a bit better. A CHP PT instructor could probably give you an as good or better account of what happened."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, as Massad Ayoob's mention of it in his bookThe Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunneryon why speed loaders were mandated piqued my interest. All in all, I agree with what the other reviewers have said here: The author took quite a bit of liberty in conjecturing what all of the involved parties said, and what was going on in their minds. I'd hope that at least for the officer's background history he interviewed the family and friends of the fallen officers to get a feel for what they may have been saying or thinking during the different periods covered in this book and gotten their feedback. My paraphrase of a line the author may have said about one of the felons: \\"Davis looked out over the water, and wondered what the future had in store for him. Would he be going back to the slammer? [Bleep] no.\\" I would doubt that the author could have had interviews with the felons' families, because, as I understood it, they both came from broken homes. I'd best categorize this as \\"Historical fiction,\\" where the author took the facts that were known and then proceeded to take factual liberties with filling in the details. That's not to say that it wasn't an enjoyable read, though. I'd still recommend this as an entertaining piece. Just don't believe all that you read in here, though."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I read this book in one sitting of about 4 hours. It is an excellent book - well written with short, realistic chapters. I could not put it down and I have been haunted by it ever since. As a former California police officer, I remember analyzing this event in the academy. It truly did change how law enforcement agencies trained for many emergent situations. I also went to high school(Merced, California) with Walt Frago's little sister; so I also had a personal connection to this story.Although it is difficult to read, I highly recommend this book. I have always appreciated the men and women who guard our communities but this book helped me reaffirm that there is such a \\"thin blue line\\" between \\"us\\" and \\"them\\". God Bless these men and women who serve and the families of all law enforcement personnel."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I was 30 miles away the night of that tragedy, following the situation in real time on the radio, so the event was seared into my memory. The weakness of this book is the amount of speculative diagogue written of the killers leading up to that shootout. Whatever their motivation or their troubled background, they're just a couple more hardened criminals undeserving of the notoriety. I would have expected more from the CHP author about his fallen comrades and the impact on their families than was written."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I recall hearing of this event some years ago while watching a special about the California Highway Patrol. The special, I believe was the prelude for the TV series &#34;Real Stories of the Highway Patrol&#34;. Out of curiosity, I looked up the Newhall Incident online and began to become more fascinated about the shootout that left four young officers dead, and served as the catalyst for how that agency as well as many other departments around the country changed their tactics and procedures. Chief Anderson, a retired CHP officer who was closely connected with the four young officers presents a very poignant account of the situation and gives the reader insights into Officers Roger Gore, Walt Frago, Mike Alleyn, and James &#34;Skip&#34; Pence, as well as the criminals Bobby Davis and Jack Twining, from the officers' days as either young cadets at the CHP Academy or Davis and Twining's criminal pasts that soon led to its culmination, that is the events of April 5-6, 1970. Anderson writes an excellent Capote-esque account, yet shows sensitivity. I respect the fact that he waited at least twenty years or more before he finally wrote about this tragedy. For those who want to understand how police officers have to address situations and how an incident involving a colleague in uniform affects them all, this book as well others about the tragedy gives insight in how and why officers think the way they do."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"I read the book, and expected a detailed, historical analysis of this horrible event.What it was, was a novel format. .....\\"as he approached he thought\\"....Really ??

But the book read too much like fiction in that the author constantly expressed thoughts and ideas on behalf of the people involved in the incident. Since those people lost their lives that day, we can never know what they were really thinking. The book would have been more valuable if the author had stuck to the facts. He also went way overboard on the use of profanity which made for difficult reading and detracted from his attempt to draw a psychological profile of the perpetrators."},{"Title":"The Newhall Incident: America's Worst Uniformed Cop Massacre","review":"Excellent service and turnaround time!

Kennedy,","review":"oddly, you may be surprised about the kennedy's of massachusetts when you finish Whalen's work. It is possible that many have been quick to judge the family in a negative manner. Whalen, however, certainly points out Joseph Kennedy's very wonderful points including love of his family and gracious help for mankind. His charity for a man who wandered into his office off of the streets of Boston having just lost his son-and Mr. Kennedy buying the man a suit and paying for the funeral of that son-is particularly touching. Also of great interest to anyone interested in making a buck is how Mr. Kennedy made so much money in so many different arenas-sold out and took his profit on to the next venture-a sixth sense he had for making big money! author whalen points out this was almost always the case except his keeping ownership of Chicago's Merchandise Mart in the Kennedy name up, I believe, until currently-1998. Buy this work and then be prepared to not put it down for 48! ! hrs.! Of added interest was a historical look at how Joseph Kennedy got into B grade motion picture producing in Hollywood in the early days."},{"Title":"The Founding Father: The story of Joseph P. Kennedy,","review":"Back in AD 1964, the sordid details of Joe Kennedy's life were kept secret. So what you have here is a very incomplete picture. But, if you want to understand his stock trading or his ambassadorship to Great Britain, then this book is for you. But compared to Kearns-Goodwin and Kessler, this is very lop-sided."},{"Title":"The Founding Father: The story of Joseph P. Kennedy,","review":"Written soon after the death of JFK in 1963, THE FOUNDING FATHER offers a comprehensive portrait of the patriarch of the Kennedy dynasty. A dynamic person, quick on the uptake and with a cool business head, Joseph P. Kennedy enjoyed a highly successful career, as well as being a loyal family man, devoted to his nine children. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the book is the discussion of Kennedy's time as Ambassador to the United Kingdom; he became close friends with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and vigorously supported the policy of peacemaking with Adolf Hitler. This was Kennedy's biggest mistake; while endeavoring to protect US interests and keep them out of a war, he also failed to understand Hitler's desires to conquer the whole of Europe as well as Russia. It was not surprising, therefore, that Kennedy should not have got on very well with Winston Churchill. The book is both sympathetic and well-written - even though, at the time of writing, the author did not have access to many of the secret government documents pertaining to Kennedy's political career."},{"Title":"The Founding Father: The story of Joseph P.

Franklin was an incredible man, a polished diplomat and statesman, but also an inventor, scientist, writer and publisher. Franklin was also a pioneer in civics, creating organizations such as a city police force, fire department and organized street lighting and cleaning. The book closes with a list of his discoveries and inventions.They are too numerous to mention here, so I will restrict myself to the categories.*) Aeronaurics*) Agriculture*) Civics*) Education*) Electricity*) Heat conduction*) Hygiene*) Inventions (there are 9 listed)*) Medicine*) Meteorology*) Military*) Music*) Navigation*) Daylight saving timeNote that his diplomatic achievements, such as enlisting French support for the American war of independence, are not part of this list. Franklin also played a role in the convention that led to the creation of the American constitution.This book goes into his life and achievements in great deal and it fills a very important niche. If young people learn about Franklin's scientific achievements, it is often restricted to when he flew a kite and confirmed that lightning was electrical in nature. However, he did so many things, even after several centuries he still may be the most accomplished of Americans in terms of the breadth and depth of his activity. Young Americans need to learn more about this great man. There is an organization, Friends of Franklin Inc., \\"An organization dedicated to promoting fellowship, learning and the spirit of Benjamin Franklin.\\" It is a worthy organization honoring a very worthy man."},{"Title":"Delphi: What Being on Earth Is All About","review":"A wonderful book!

Based in the fictional city of Isola (with its eerie similarities to New York), McBain's conscientious cops spent thousands of pages chasing down every sort of villainous behaviour. From 1956 to 2005, readers were introduced to serial killers, money laundering, granny dumping and more.In Widows, something awful again happens to the perpetually-beleaguered Detective Steve Carella. This time, his father is killed. While that investigation (one of the rare cases that the reader follows outside of the 87th) is underway, Carella's squad tackles another murder, as a hormonally-supercharged man has been killed, leaving behind a trail of blond lovers, wives, ex-wives and daughters. Finally, Eileen Burke is joining the city's Hostage Negotation team, in one of the more interesting subplots.Widows is one of the more tonally-interesting books in the series.Horrible things happen to Carella, and the reader is still being exposed to the horrible things that have happened to Eileen. But the murder cases are both best described as darkly comedic. Tense, hysterical laughter; moments of tragic-yet-entertaining self awareness; bizarre characters; and even the occasional puppy.Although nothing 'nice' happens in Widows, McBain manages to infuse the entire book with enough dark comedy to keep the reader from contemplating suicide (as opposed to, say, Calypso or Lightning from the early 1980s)."},{"Title":"Widows","review":"Ed McBain readers will enjoy this novel.

But in WIDOWS, McBain tries his hand at psychology and demonstrates clearly that he's ill equipped to do so. I'm an avid Ed McBain fan, and I've read the majority of his 87th Precinct series. His work is excellent in the genre of hardcase noir writing. I've spent a lot of hours immersed in his novels and consider him among the 'greats' in police procedural stories. But I think he missed the mark here, causing me to recoil out of the story too many times. Fortunately, this is the only book of his that has done that so far, and I remain solidly a fan! In spite of my negative opinions of this particular book, I would suggest still that people buy it and assess it themselves.

While Lepre is an avid believer that the pyramids were tombs, the author presents here a large amount of very useful detail about the more popular pyramids such as those at Giza and Dashur, as well as many smaller or lesser known structures. The admirable plan of organization consists of part database, part review of previous historical treatment, and part on-site observations. In no other source will you find even remotely comparable information gathered into one place. The book is well illustrated and as complete as humanly possible.The texts for each of 42 known pyramid building pharoahs includes biographical information, such as various their names, dates of reign, available portrait imagery, and cartouche. After an article analyzing the known and unknown about each structure--presented in the standard Club Egyptology sequence--Lepre summarizes the structures in terms of available plans, interior and exterior photography, recovered artifacts such as mummy, treasure, and presence of a sarcophagus; then treats similarly information about subsidary buildings or satellite pyramids. Also included are mention of the Sphinx and closeby temples.Throughout the book, the text reaffirms the standard academic approach to the pyramids. Lepre, however, is fair enough to mention other explanations, and to show the inadequacies of all theories where possible. The chapter on pyramid construction is a bit disappointing in its assurance of &quot;this is the way things were done,&quot; but it's a clear report of the academic view.What makes this book intriguing for all those who look for the as-yet-undiscovered is the chapter &quot;Secret Chambers&quot; in the back of the volume which discuss many anomalous elements and unpursued mysteries. Lepre does, especially, treat us to exact descriptions and line drawings of very likely unopened chambers in or at the Great Pyramid, and the Red and Bent Pyramids at Dashur. Amazingly, as Lepre notes, there seems little interest among the controlling authorities to pursue these tantalizing and specific leads. Makes you want to rush right out to Giza with a forklift!Get this book and spend time with the whole text. Even though the later pyramids are scarcely comparable to early great ones, Lepre supplies a constant stream of information that integrates knowledge of, pardon the pun, the whole field.

Since then, I've been a reporter and writer for the Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and Fortune. After a request to teach a journalism class, I purchased the book again, and found that it still captures the essence of interviewing. The examples in the book are a bit dated (it hasn't been revised ), but the underlying truths are still very close to those I've experienced in many interviews throughout my career."},{"Title":"The Craft of Interviewing","review":"It is true that the basics of good interviewing haven't change much over the years, but they have changed some. And this book, while it was surely a must-read in the 70s, is so outdated that I found myself skipping the first chapter, then the second, then the third ... then much of the rest of the book. For example: there is a full chapter, and several pages scattered through the book, that talk about research techniques. This is pre-internet, pre-much-of-what's-out-there-today, and as a result, those 75 or so pages are useless. The same is true for the roughly 25 or 30 pages that talk about how to get an interview, and how to make a good first appearance. This is pre-email, and clearly pre-women's-lib. Many of the tips for women on how to get interviews and make sure they come out successful are down right offensive to women today. Fortunately, most female interviewers no longer have to rely solely on looking nice, batting eyelashes, and agreeing with everything their interviewee has to say. Yes, there are a few good pointers, but to buy and read an entire book for mearly a few pointers isn't necessary. There was nothing here that I hadn't seen elsewhere.

Most of journalism involves local newspapers covering local people, and despite how the internet has altered the speed and process of interviewing, good ol' gumshoe journalism still lives and breathes. That's why this book still matters 30 years after it first hit the college bookstores of j-school.A good interview requires knowledge, diplomacy, fearlessness, rapport, organization, and knowing how to separate and summarize it all for a good story. This book has chapters on all of this. One complete chapter, \\"Off the Record\\" discusses some interesting approaches and policies this misunderstood phrase calls for. As you build relationships with key sources, this chapter, and others, can assist you in seeing ways through the thorny challenges of integrity and journalism.Brady provides anecdotes about complicated interviews and interviewees. Even though these are with celebrities, the examples show the reader how to walk the line carefully and confidently.\\"The Craft of Interviewing\\" by John Brady should not be the only book you read, and probably not your first. I fully recommend it as both a classroom text, and as a personal edification book. Your interviewing will be better you apply what Brady suggests.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com"},{"Title":"The Craft of Interviewing","review":"I think there is a difference between a book being 'old' vs. 'out-dated.'Nowadays, no hard-copy book is going to be able to remain 'current' in terms of changing technologies, but this one was extremely helpful to me, very early on, in just thinking about the process of preparing for something unfamiliar to me at the time.I read it soon after college, when I was reading just about anything Writer's Digest put out. A few years later, I managed to talk my way into a Staff Writer's position with a small award-winning busines newsweekly in New Orleans. Given how shy I was at the time, I was pleasantly shocked at how well prepared and even comfortable I felt as I set up and faced my first interviews. And I attribute much of that to this book and this author.Years later, I still think much of the *thinking* here will translate well across the years and the technology, at least for those who like to approach things in terms of 'learning how to learn' vs. being handed a check-list. Interviewing has its practical and technical aspects, its nuts-and-bolts...but it's also an almost artistic experience in that 2 people can interview the same person and come out with very different results. This book helps you with a lot of the practical though sure, that's not going to include discussion of resources that weren't available back then. But it also goes well beyond that, helping provide the kind of understanding that can help you come up with something another interviewer might have missed, to get your anticipated questions answered but to stay tuned for those comments that lead to new questions. As for not covering e-interviews...gosh, why don't we just automate the whole process, people?BTW, I'm a female and don't remember anything in here about eyelash-batting. Maybe I'll have to re-read it. What I do remember is that I felt like he wrote for me, whoever I was, and that he gave me a strong understanding on which I could build. Since reading this book, I have conducted hundreds of interviews, not only for journalistic purposes, but also in therapeutic and research contexts. The greatest compliment I got, shortly after starting out, was from a much more experienced writer at our newsweekly, who overheard one of my phone interviews. He said \\"It sounded like you were having a conversation, with someone you've known a while.\\""},{"Title":"The Craft of Interviewing","review":"Funny, I don't remember the parts about batting eyelashes and such.

If you are looking for something like a cookbook where the specific questions you should ask and in what order are listed, you won't like this book. If you are looking to develop your own interview style and want to pick and choose from a variety of methods, then you will find Brady's book an excellent source of information. Brady covers everything from getting appointments to to research to notetaking to tape recorders to knowing when the interview is over. He shows how different people handle interviews over the phone or by letter. When you finish this book, the choice of what questions to ask and how you should go about the interview remain up to you, but Brady's book will have given you a solid base.Just about the only topic that is uncovered (due to the date of the book) is how to conduct an interview by Internet Chat.

I have not found as thourough a coverage any where else particularly on some of whites more obscure gambit variations. Schiller's reccomendation to avoid alot of theory in the advance variation was tempting (3...Na6). But I am a Caro player because I like a defense that can stand the test of time. I am not sure the &quot;Kavelek?&quot; defense will sustain itself with a forwarned and prepared player. Schiller's line against the Panov-Botvinick attack is not the most secure Karpov-NimzoIndian transposing defense. But then I am no Karpov and it is a bit more exciting of a line.

Against a dangerous attacking player like Tal, Botvinnik used almost exclusively Caro-Kann as black to combat Tal's king pawn opening. Botvinnik almost resorted all to French defense before the two matches with Tal. On the very first game of the first match, Botvinnk lost with his French defense, for the rest of the match he used Caro-Kann against all king pawn opening. The result was not in his favor (1 win, 2 loses and 3 draws), but better than the French. For the second match, in the first half, with Caro-Kann, Botvinnik got the score: 1 win, 2 loses, and 2 draws. He switched to the French and lost at once. Caro-Kann it was for the rest of the match, 1 win and 3 drawns.I played the Caro-Kann (before learning the statistics above) to avoid the troubled QB in the French, while the Sicilian requires lots of risks and fighting spirit. I got a good record against one player, he then researched and prepared some special line for me. Before I played him again, I played two other opponents whom the first player shared this special line with, they both beat me! The line was: 1 e4 c6 2 d4 d5 3 e5 Bf5 4 g4 Bg6 5 h4 h6 6 e6!

It \\"was\\" about Caro-Kann and \\"complete\\" (???). What else could I ask for more? I was disappointed, it has no mention of 3 ... Bf5. It's not worth the price. The book is just a collection of Caro-Kann games, with some well-thought and some not so well-thought ideas of the author. And your job is to sort them out. 7 USD for the book is reasonable price.Besides the Cardoza book's content is not high in quality, the format is not so good either. The two column format like Gambit book is much better. The font used in Cardoza book is hard too read, too large.

It a simple story, told in a straightfoward, spare fashion. Yet within the framework of this simple story lies a profund piece of work that has an impact on the reader that, like the most beautiful music, lingers long after the last note fades into the night.Makine, for those not familiar with his work, was born in the Soviet Union in 1958. He emigrated to France as a young man. He writes in French. (Music of a Life was nicely translated from the French by Geoffrey Strachan). At the risk of setting out what may sound like a hackneyed cliche, Makine's work for me combines the grace and elgance of the best French writers and the deep soul and conviction of the best Russian writers.Music of a Life is set out as the re-telling of a conversation had between two strangers on a train moving slowly west from Siberia sometime around 1958, the year many thousands finally won their release from the labor camps that dotted the Soviet Far East. Two men sit together. One older man, wearing clothes that mark him as someone just released from the Gulag strikes up a comnversation with his fellow passenger. The story is set out in the voice of the other passenger. As the train moves on the older passenger and the narrator exchange slowly. At some point the older passenger, Alexe Berg, slowly sets out his life story.In 1940, the young Alexe, a classically trained pianist of great talent and promise, was preparing for his debut recital. On approaching his family flat after the dress rehearsal he sees a pre-arranged symbol indiccating that his parents, supposedly dangerous members of the intelligentsia, had been swept up by the NKVD (pre-cursor to the KGB). Alexe makes his escape and finds himself hiding out in the Ukraine in 1941. The devastation of the Nazi invasion of the USSR in June of that year engulfs the Urkaine. Alexe comes upon the body of a dead Soviet solider, a peasant, and assumes the dead soldier's identify. Although this provides him some protection from those who might still seek his arrest, Alex realizes quickly that he must maintain this identity at all costs.Alexe makes it through the war in one piece and, in fact, finds favor with a Soviet general, who keeps him at his side as an aide de camp during the rest of the war. Alexe's survival remains dependent upon his being thought of as a simple peasant. After the war, Alexe finds work with the general's family. The general's daughter takes a liking to the young 'peasant' soldier. Alexe becomes enamored of the daughter. The daughter, whose piano-playing skills are somehwat limited, if earnest, decides to teach the young peasant Alexe a few simple tunes on the piano. These lessons lead, inexorably, to the book's climactic moments.The book leaves the reader (or at least it left me) contemplating the choices and compromises we sometimes make with life. It left me contemplating the question as to how much of myself would I compromise, how much of myself would I keep hidden in order to maintain some small amount of freedom in an unfree world.As I noted at the beginning, this is a simple story, simply told. Yet, as with music, sometimes even simple combinations of notes creates a beautiful mosaic of sound. Makine has done this with the graceful combination of notes that makes up his Music of a Life."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"This story, told in shockingly clear photographs, details the life of a man, ravaged by the war and Stalin's empire, who chooses against what moves his soul in order to save his body. The book is short, but that's what makes it beautiful. The plot is purposefully underdeveloped in writing; Makine provides the reader with pictures of a time and place, gives them a little knowledge about a man, and leaves the rest to the reader. In this way, Alexei Berg remains mysterious, a shadow, someone who could have been merely part of the homo sovieticus introduced by the narrator in the beginning of the novel. Instead, however, he becomes - in the mind of the narrator and the reader - someone real, someone with a past, but someone who could be one of the a hundred people waiting, silently, on the floor of a cold station, for the train to Moscow.This is the triumph of this novel - not the story itself, but that the story is not Alexei Berg's in particular, but a story of human spirit in general."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"A train station like a dot in the snow-covered expanse of the Siberian plains. People, thrown together by chance, patiently waiting hours for the delayed train to Moscow. Reflecting on the crowd as a collective sample of \\"homo sovieticus\\", the narrator singles out some individuals. He describes them in minute detail, bringing them alive for the reader. Suddenly, a piano tune, played elsewhere, breaks the multitude of muted night noises in the waiting room. For the narrator, the music transcends place and time and reveals a glimpse into a different, luminous reality... Following the tune through the station, he comes across an unlikely pianist. Rough, deeply scarred hands hardly touching the keys, then hesitating, confusing a note - and the pianist weeps.This chance meeting of two strangers in the night frames like a picture the extraordinary and deeply moving story of Alexe Berg, the pianist. Alexe grew up during the years of arbitrary detentions and executions of Stalin's reign of terror. His parents, suspects for a while, seem to have averted the worst. The old violin, played sometimes by a family friend, since executed as a traitor, is thrown into the fire by the father in the hope of avoiding a similar fate. To Alexe's ears, the exploding strings make the sound of staccato played on a harp. This sound is engraved in his memory forever. Yet, on the eve of his debut concert, their time has run out and he must flee to escape his own certain arrest. To survive he follows the road west, hides, and, as last resort, takes on a dead soldier's identity. Creating an imagined personality, always conscious of dangers to his double life, he joins \\"his\\" unit on the frontlines in the war against the Germans. Not surprisingly, Alexei's attempts to drown his previous self, that of the high-spirited young pianist on the verge of success in Moscow, only succeeds so far. After the war ends, memories of the past start re-emerging. He can no longer pretend without difficulty. What happened to his parents? Visions of a life not lived lead him to confront his two realities. In the end, it is the piano and the music that heals and at the same time exposes him. By accepting the consequences of his \\"crime\\" he recovers the connection to his former life and his inner voice of music.Makine does not need many words to convey the intricacies of his hero's experiences. Using the precise, yet detached, language of an observer, he succeeds in conveying the reality of the Stalin purges, the horrors of war... the challenges of a generation, represented by Alexe, that is caught in a life beyond its control. His intention is not to give his readers a grand epic of the man and his time. Rather, like a sculptor crafting a relief, Makine chisels out small pieces, highlighting minute details in some parts and using broad strokes in others to create his masterpiece. It succeeds also by drawing on the reader's understanding of the context, his empathy and power of imagination to visualize what is hinted at but not spelled out.\\"You can never describe the life of another person\\" Makine said in a recent interview, each observer will interpret it based on his own understanding. The \\"perfect novel\\" is beyond description, he asserts, the reader should loose himself in it, observe and contemplate its meaning and, at the end, emerge transformed. Music can have that same quality as it carries the listener beyond the present reality. With \\"Music of a Life\\" Makine is living up to his own definition.The relative brevity of the story should not be seen as a disadvantage. On the contrary, this is a highly charged and emotional story. A thin layer of \\"objective\\" reporting by the narrator only obscures for a short time the underlying intensity and the author's deep concerns for his country and its people. This is a treasure of a book, to be read more than once. This review refers to the original French version. Others have commented on the excellent translation into English. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"Years ago, the celebrated Russian logician Alexander Zinoviev coined the sarcastic phrase Homo Sovieticus to explore how a new species with a specific mindset evolved as a result of the Communist system. In Andrei Makine's exquisite and dreamlike novella, the reader learns about this new species through the person of Alexei Berg, a one-time brilliant young pianist.Not unlike Coleridge's The Ancient Mariner, he happens across the narrator who is enduring a transportation delay with \\"human matter, breathing like a single organism, its resignation, its innate disregard of comfort, its endurance in the face of the absurd.\\" Together, they manage to get aboard an archaic third-class coach, where Alexei weaves his story to his new friend.Alexei's parents are arrested by the pre-KGB for being part of the \\"rotten intelligentsia\\" during Stalin's reign of terror in the 1930s, just as Alexei is posed to make an eagerly-awaited solo debut. Knowing his own arrest is imminent, he flees to his fiancee's father's home, waking up in the middle of the night convinced that he is about to be betrayed. After hiding briefly in his uncle's barn, Alexei scours the bodies of dead Russian soldiers to find one who is close to him in appearance. He assumes that soldier's identity and enters the war \\"indistinguishable in the column\\", cloaked in his disguise.In taut, lyrical, beautifully-paced notes, Makine traces Alexi's survival trek, and with an extraordinary economy of words, captures the terror of striving to make it through the Stalin years. The sparse portrait of a man caught up in a forgotten life is described thus: \\"He told himself that in this life there should be a key, a code for expressing, in concise and unambiguous terms, all the complexity of our attempts, so natural and so greviously confused, at living and loving.\\"There is, of course, a denouement scene: creativity, in Makine's world, is indestructible and survives in whatever spare soil it is planted. This exquisite elegy of loss - a multi-note symphony to the indestructibility of the human spirit--reaches a crescendo that is beautifully realized and will not soon be forgotten."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"Music of a Life: A Novelis a poetic masterpiece, a beautiful novella of intensity, strength and economy. With dreamlike lyricism and bold metaphor, it is tale within a tale, a journey within a journey, the riveting and evocative story of twenty years in the life of a classical pianist turned soldier in Russia during the end of World War II.His name is Andrei Berg and his story is told by an unnamed narrator who is marooned in a train station during a snowstorm in the Ural Mountains. While stranded in the waiting room of the icy train station and scorning the other travellers who engulf him ~ the \\"homo sovieticus\\" ~ the narrator hears and is pulled toward the brief stirrings of a piano keyboard. Following the sound of the music down a long corridor to a storage room, he discovers an old man, the aged Andrei Berg, sitting at a grand piano and producing the sound that drew him. Thus Berg and the narrator become acquainted, end up travelling together and Berg reveals his story.Berg's life story is a heartrending and harrowing tale of survival. It is a haunting tale of the Russian experience from World War II through Stalinization and the later de-Stalinization. Through the narrator's reflection a complex and layered epic unfolds ~ an epic of good and evil, peace and war, love and loss, loyalty and betrayal, resignation and rebellion, endurance and resistance.Makine has written an emotional, lyrical elegy with great precision and a brilliant economy of words. This moving novella is less than 110 pages but it is rich with atmosphere, characterization, action and imagery. It is a marvel, a masterpiece ~ and deserves to be read again and again."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"This is really a treasure of a book. A musician is forced to assume the identity of a dead soldier in Russia during WWII to save his life. It's a tight, taut lyrical little novel that can be read in an afternoon. To say too much about it deprives the reader of the magic that awaits them, so I will just say this: read it. If you like historical fiction you will be enchanted by this lovely small treasure."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"This novel is lyrical, wonderully written, economical with language, and deeply emotional. In this age where post-modern writers craft 700 page monsters that are in dire need of editing (of course there are wonderful novels this size, but mostly written before 1970), here is an intimate tale that is excatly as long as the story requires. With all due respect to the two reviews below--ignore them and you won't be sorry. Their criticism reminds me of Salieri's critique of Mozart's work in Amadeus--&quot;sire, there are too many notes&quot;--to which the proper response here is the same--&quot;too many, there are just the right amount&quot;. The writing here is wonderful, straightforward and most of all, lacking attitude and artifice (for another writer similarly talented, try Ha Jin). Buy it."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"Beautiful novella about a delayed train journey in the Soviet Union in mid-winter, the journey itself, and its outcome at its destination Moscow. Stuck in an ice-cold railway station in the Ural mountains with a crowd of waiting passengers, the writer of this tale goes in search of a chair to sit on. In the station's attic he sees an old man passionately playing a piano without touching the keys, crying while playing. They greet, acknowledge each other.When the train finally arrives, the old pianist whistles from a distance to indicate where there is still space: in a 3rd class compartment, newly hooked onto the train. This is when the book really takes off: the pianist tells his life story during the days before the train reaches Moscow. The nameless raconteur arrives in freezing Moscow at 06:00 in the morning. His onward connection leaves shortly before midnight. One man does not follow the weary, limb-stretching crowd of passengers to the exit. It is the pianist, who takes him under his wings. A remarkable ending follows.All essential data and details are withheld and are for curious readers to discover. A warm, outstanding piece of writing and a grand read!"},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"Do not let this book's brevity fool you. In so few words, it tells a story of a life time, and gives a panoramic view of the strange age that he lived in."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"Andrei Makine told an engaging story of a character before, during, and after the war. It was told from a third person point of view, which I didn't really care for, and think the story could have been better told if it was told from first person. Makine did an excellent job taking you to the place by his descriptions. He paints a very vivid picture with his choice of words, and uses an extensive vocabulary. I enjoyed the story. Although the story was short, it got the point across very well. Great story, but did I enjoy it enough to read it again, no."},{"Title":"Music of a Life","review":"Our narrator (name unknown) is waiting in a snowbound train station in the Urals when he encounters a peculiar man silently running his hands over the keys of the grand piano upstairs. The next morning, on the train together, he learns the man's name -- Alexei Berg -- and his story. When Alexei was young and living in Moscow, he was on his way to becoming a classical pianist. And he was engaged to be married. But on May 22, 1941, two days before his first solo concert, he was on his way home to his parents' apartment when a neighbor hurried past warning him not to go back. The secret police had come. And so he fled. After his fiance's family betrayed him, he took the identity of a dead Russian soldier and spend years fighting in the Soviet army. He was befriended by a General, taunted by his daughter, cast adrift without name or family ... but he has never forgotten his music.Despite a very real poignancy, MUSIC OF A LIFE is far too short (109 pages) and undeveloped to be a truly satisfying novel. As I read I kept thinking that if Makine had spent more time on his plot and allowed it room to grow, the story could have been a winner. All the necessary elements -- danger, love, loss and rediscovery -- are present. Yet they're crammed into a few spare paragraphs and the reader is mostly told things, not shown them, between great jumps in time and place. Makine has obvious talent for description, for picking out the forgotten snapshots of life and portraying them as something strangely beautiful, but in this effort at least he lacks the ability to create an impression strong enough to last.I wish I could recommend this little book because I really wanted to like it, but in truth I found MUSIC OF A LIFE only a rough draft, not a finished symphony, and so I can't."},{"Title":"The Supreme Court in Conference (1940-1985) : The Private Discussions Behind Nearly 300 Supreme Court Decisions","review":"I only read a few chapters, on \\"one man one vote\\" decisions, and skimmed a few others, so this is not a full-scale review. Despite the editor's ingenuous but severe left-wing slant, both in his selections and in his comments, this is still a valuable book. It reveals in a way that no other work could, what really went on behind many of the key Supreme Court decisions that re-shaped American politics, government, and life. If you believe that personalities don't influence history, or that the Court is above politics, this book might correct your misapprehensions. One palsied hand resting on the Supreme Court bench has wrought revolutions deeper than any mob."},{"Title":"The Supreme Court in Conference (1940-1985) : The Private Discussions Behind Nearly 300 Supreme Court Decisions","review":"This is the best book I have read.

The recipes are old (1905) and some of the terms are different. When telling you how much butter to use, she says \\"butter the size of an egg.\\" She says use a \\"saltspoon\\" of salt. She calls a recipe a \\"rule.\\" There are lots of good sounding recipes and I am definitely going to try many of them. In fact, I have one going on the stove right now.

It is the story of a charity hospital for children, in particular the ward for \\"incurable\\" children and it's head nurse, Margaret MacLean, who was at one time a patient there. The story takes place during one day, May-Eve, which also happens to be a day that the hospital trustees come to visit. During this visit the trustees decide to close the incurables ward in favor of an additional surgical ward. However, on May-Eve, fairies walk the earth and take a hand in the decision. It is a book of its time, rather sentimental and with an obligatory happy ending, but for all that an enjoyable, quick read. You can't do better at the price, free as a public domain book.Ruth Sawyer is better known as a children's author. Her best known work is Roller Skates, which won the Newbury Award in 1937."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"Finally, after a year and a half in law school I have found something that feels real. Professor Williams' book addresses all the unspoken assumptions and rules that frame and defines the study of law. Her voice is the first that I have heard or read which captures the frustration of existing in a world of law that is so unapologetically deficient of humanity. The book reveals the rich and thick veneer of denial that surrounds and protects those privileged by the law. She dissects the silent and invisible plague of racism that infiltrates every aspect of the law. She forces discomfort on herself and the reader in order to reach some greater knowledge or understanding.It is the book's refusal to conform to traditional forms of legal discourse that helps to powerfully illuminate the inherent limitations, oppressions, and inadequacies of the law. The narrative form brings to life the messy complications and nuances that inhabit not just law, but our relationship as individuals, and as a nation, to race and gender.Perhaps it is the vulnerability laid so bare, or the familiar voice of madness creeping so closely, whatever the source, the voice in the book was one of the most powerful I have heard in years. It is so refreshingly honest and brave, a book I am very grateful to have encountered."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"I recently had the pleasure of re-reading this remarkable book. Over the past half-century, it is no doubt one of the most important books on race published in the United States. The author blends autobiography, keen visual observations, analysis, and heart into a powerful journey through the landscape of American race relations. The result is utterly convincing: the convergence of the &quot;personal and the political&quot; moves each reader to examine his or her own relationship to the subjects at hand. While most race books pontificate, this one eases the reader into examining some very difficult, indeed painful questions. Williams, a writer of great skill and elegance, has pulled off a miricale in the field of race writing, an enduring masterpiece that has changed the way we think and talk about race in America."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"This is an extraordinary book. Through the use of a wide array of reasoning and writing methods, Williams makes it possible for us to get a glimpse of the dangerous and contradictory legal world that ethnic minorities must negotiate to survive. It may be a bit of a stretch for people unaccustomed to thinking outside the box as well as those unfamilar with literature and literary theory. But the insight Williams offers is well worth the effort. It also provides members of the privileged class with the unusual &amp; valuable experience of not being the central focus of the text. A fabulous experience for readers with an open mind!"},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights is a wonderful exploration of race and the law in modern society. In a whirlwind of impressionistic strokes, Williams beautifully illustrates the mutually constitutive nature of bodies and rules. Her elegant prose leads the reader to contemplate the law from a place where subject position is everything, and the false security of formal equivalence and abstract monetization are the very currency of oppression.Though her writing style may be off-putting to those in search of a formal treatise on race and the law, and her fragmented invocation of the personal as a starting point for inductive work is sometimes difficult to follow, the impressionistic quality of the text is also one of its great strengths. In the end, a deeper meaning is conveyed through this sometimes schizophrenic free association than could be done through any more formally-structured argument.Keep an open mind, and read everything twice. You won't regret the effort."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"I am the commenter on the review titled, \\"A Widely Read Manifesto of Regressive Race Relations\\"'. So if youre going to base your decision on that individual's negative review, PLEASE reference the comment!Now that that is out of the way, this book is amazing. If you want details, reference the comment. Otherwise, just trust when I say if you are a prelaw/law student who aims for an ethic approach to understanding the limitations of the law, then you must give this book a chance.. and even if youre not aiming for an ethical approach, just read this lest you become hollywood's (/traditional) caricature of a lawyer.Patricia Williams' writing is very very very layered, poetic and illuminating. Her words evoke both beautiful and tragic imagery. Therefore, you're going to have to read her chapters more than once. But, trust me, the time is well spent.The part of this book that I enjoyed the most was the personal dimension that Williams allows. Reading her book is almost like reading her journal-- her innermost thoughts exposed and analyzed. I was definitely blown away by her ability to draw you in-- personally, I was quite emotionally invested as I neared the later chapters.I above all admire Williams' strength to lay bare her most vulnerable experiences and thoughts in the hopeful attempt to shed light on the complexity of being."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"There is a lot to complain about regarding race and civil rights and this author questions how far we've come.We have NOT arrived, she reminds us.She is a downer and does not leave much hope, yet, somehow it is energizing to read."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"I have read her 'Diary of a Mad Law Prof.' in The Nation with considerable interest. I really don't think she is one of the brightest bulbs in contemporary Black discourse, and I gladly turn to bell hooks and even Cornell West when I want some heady discussion of racism and the white attitudes that persist in this society. Williams seems to me one of those well meaning people who unfortunately have produced a somewhat simple-minded book, and yet it could serve as a useful corrective to similarly simple-minded books from the conservative side of things, especially Shelby Steele and co. Overall, this book has little to teach anyone actively involved in changing attitudes, but it is a fair attempt nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"I can't even speak about Williams' ideas because her overly-affected, wouldbe-poet style obscures any real thought. No wonder this book cost me only $.50. Awful. Just awful writing.This book is hardly about race, but is rather a tome of self-indulgent ramblings."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"A great deal of discourse has come out of the use of this book in my law class on the interaction of law in society, but I find it's use counter-productive to the forward-thinking goals of most academic institutions. Prof. Williams cannot seem to make up her mind on anything. She attacks Marxist lawyers, while at the same time advocating an affront to the bourgeoise, especially those without black skin (whites, Hispanics and Asians are all vilified to some degree in this book). While masquerading as a socialist activist herself, she then advocates a very right-wing goal of keeping each other in our respective racial boxes to keep order, even refusing to accept that she herself can be at once black, female and educated -- these three identities always appear separately for her. Her book is a regressive look at the future that denies the possibility of progress in race and gender relations. She is sadly unable to employ the power in her rights and instead prefers to wallow in a viscious cycle that refuses to recognize nuance, and prefers rather to assume racial categories, because they are simpler. Very few new ideas are presented in this racist, ethnically intolerant and misandric text and it is hardly worth a read, beyond the fact that it may come up in discussion."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"Williams style is more of a problem than her substance. She uses numerous anecdotal stories, told from one side, some of which are dubious in truth, and rare questionably-derived statistics, to demonstrate an invisible undercurrent of racism from whites against blacks, and these are the issues she addresses best. Her style could perhaps best be described as varying between insightful and incoherent, with I'm afraid more of the latter.Williams argues in the beginning of her book against generalization, that \\"reconceptualizing from \\"objective truth\\" to rhetorical event will be a more nuanced sense of legal and social responsibility,\\" (p.11) then proceeds to generalize and polarize whites and blacks and generalize about numerous other issues throughout the book:\\"White women are prostitutes; black women are whores\\" p. 175\\"To say that blacks never fully believed in rights is true\\" p. 163\\"Blacks are thus, in full culturally imagistic terms, not merely unmothered but badly fathered, abused and disowned by whites.\\" p. 163Argues would probably be a bad choice of word, for logic is the study of arguments, and Williams is neither consistent nor logical. In style, Williams is neither clear nor concise, and in one word, rambles."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"What a dreary tome. Ms. Professor Williams has a unique ability to obscure the most obvious and trite revelations in pedantic and turgid prose that she thinks is thrillingly poetic because the words are long-winded and flowery. and that's when she's making sense, which isn't very often. the rest of her writings tend to be either outright calls for more preferences for her preferred friends camouflaged as courageous iconoclasm, or just plain idiocy posing as intellectually daring originality. Sadly enough, if Thomas Kuhn is right, we'll have the likes of Professor Pat around for another couple of decades. (But hey, if you have the money, you can always sign up for the Nation's annual cruise and talk about the revolution with Pat and the gang for a mere 8 grand or so....)"},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"Patricia Williams uses convoluted analogies to illustrate her assertions that greatly detract from her book. She openly admits that she is a legal collectivist in the traditional sense with a strong belief in maintaining group rights, group priveleges, group responsibilities, etc. Famous legal collectivists in the past have included VI Lenin, Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, General Mengitsu, General Pinochet, Idi Amin, and Mao. They also were fervent believers in group rights, group guilt, and group punishment. The Nuremberg Race Laws (1936) in Germany are a fine example of legal collectivism taken to its logical extreme."},{"Title":"The Alchemy of Race and Rights.","review":"Williams is a lawyer, and in the book she tries to publish her essays in law reviews. Her essays are very emotional and more than lacking direction. she even says in the essay &quot;The Death of the Profane&quot; that she tries to write in a poetic style. A bit too poetic and emotional. Her opinions are valid though. This is all based on the filters of her perception, her experiences and beliefs, mostly misguided beliefs. I know she really believes what she writes, I hope others can see that it isn't always right. I think her writing should have been in a drama review, not a law review. It's bad she doesn't admit to the rascism she has towards others."},{"Title":"Controlling Reproduction: An American History","review":"Assistant Professor of History at Georgia Tech Institute, Andrea Tome's recent work is a compilation of primary and secondary source documents from the ongoing reproductive rights battle.

The ultimate purpose of the compilation was to truly give the readers as much information as possible instead of intentionally/unintentionally censoring their natural information thirst.In addition to already standard information on reproductive rights (primary source documents from landmark court cases and secondary articles from established researchers such as Petchesky), Tome includes interesting information which will be undoubtedly bizarre to many people who had previously considered themselves relatively educated on the issues.Because I had only previously heard the term \`Lysol douche' in reference to illegal abortion, and knew (for example) wire coat hanger manufacturers did not encourage alternate uses of their product in open advertisement, I was completely dumfounded to discover the Lysol company formally encouraged women to apply the substance upon their \`delicate membranes' until the 1960's. I have not personally met anybody who admits to this procedure, and am not sure I would really like to either.Contraceptive advertising restrictions only allowed companies to address such issues in terms of \`feminine hygiene' and the company (smelling desperation and fear) exploited the climate, and American society's imminent trust in science. After all, if a \`prominent' European female physician was enthusiastic about the substance herself, you knew it had to be good stuff.Ironically later research by others proved the people in such copy were merely actors hawking the company's products and there was no concentration which the disinfectant was considered safe for intimate cleansing. Douching also paradoxically increased conception chances by washing the sperm into places where it could fertilize the egg and/or drastically alter the body's natural Ph balance.Like the aforementioned advertisement, any perspective of reproductive history (reflecting the issue itself) is fraught with double meanings and dubious contexts. Because it forces consciousness the American ideals of freedom and democracy have not always accepted women (and some would argue continue to do so) the historical evidence is often hotly contested---especially by those classified as anti-abortion.Another distinguishing feature of Tome's volume includes the voices of those opposed to reproductive rights. Innately easier for both sides to only include those perspective with which they only agree, the inclusion is a serious step in expanding policy arguments. Still despising what they stand for, I am now able to dissect their own words and place the arguments more firmly in tandem with a specified time.Conversely because even \`progressive' voices are as much a product of their time as more conventional voices in an issue debate, it is dangerously absurd to presume the arguments for either side are timeless. Unlike the 19th century feminists who campaigned against abortion, medical surgery is now antiseptic in America and the infections which do arise are proactively treated with antibiotics. Were these same women alive today, they could just as easily be taking up the banner (as did Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger who originally campaigned against abortion from her experiences treating illegally-induced complications) and revering their courses."},{"Title":"Controlling Reproduction: An American History","review":"I am in Dr. Tone's class at Georgia Tech and when I first realized that she had her own book on the required reading list I was not looking forward to it.

Still despising what they stand for, I am now able to dissect their own words and place the arguments more firmly in tandem with a specified time.Conversely because even \`progressive' voices are as much a product of their time as more conventional voices in an issue debate, it is dangerously absurd to presume the arguments for either side are timeless. Unlike the 19th century feminists who campaigned against abortion, medical surgery is now antiseptic in America and the infections which do arise are proactively treated with antibiotics. Were these same women alive today, they could just as easily be taking up the banner (as did Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger who originally campaigned against abortion from her experiences treating illegally-induced complications) and revering their courses."},{"Title":"Wild Heart: The Story of Joy Adamson, Author of Born Free","review":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to raise orphaned wild animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards? Wild Heart, by Anne E. Neimark, is a biography of Joy Adamson, who spent most her life helping animals. She rescued animals, wrote books about the animals she rescued, and founded many wildlife preserves. She also painted many pictures of plants and animals. She became most famous for her book Born Free, the story of how she adopted three orphaned lion cubs, especially Elsa, who she helped to live in the wild again. Through Born Free she taught people new things about lions that they did not know before. For instance, nobody thought Elsa could survive in the wild, \\"By November 1958 Elsa was spending many days and nights in the brush, obviously able---- against all odds given by animal behaviorists---- to survive.\\" From this book I learned about the remarkable life Joy Adamson had.I thought Wild Heart was a mediocre book. In the beginning, the book told the story of a person named Friederike. Little did I know this was Joy Adamson's real name. It confused me because it didn't explain this until late in the book. The beginning talked mostly of her life as a child which I found very boring and unclear. In the middle, the author talks about Joy's several marriages. It also talks about her painting plants a lot, but it goes into way too much detail. \\" She painted the blue-green delphinium, the ruby red everlasting, the scarlet gladiolus, and the giant, tree-sized groundsel with its golden flowers poised like praying hands.\\"The end of the book was a lot more interesting to me because it is about the adoption of Elsa and the other cubs, and about all the other animals she adopted. The book reaches its climax during this part especially when she first adopts the cubs because it was a life changing decision. The book also told how she made such a big difference for animals by establishing many wildlife preserves, and raising interest and awareness about orphaned animals, suggesting ways we can help. \\"...she launched Elsa Wild Animal Appeal in Africa, a charity to help animals living where they were unwanted by human beings; she also set up the Nature Conservancy Committee to issue grants from her royalties. She hired an animal rescue team and bought them a truck...\\" Her books led to many donations and other good things for the animals.Overall, the book was not the best. I would recommend finding out a little bit about Joy Adamson before reading this book. It would have been helpful to know a general description of her life because then the unclear parts would make more sense. Also, if animals and plants do not interest you, do not read this book. The story of Joy Adamson was very interesting, but I found this book to be boring and unclear."},{"Title":"Wild Heart: The Story of Joy Adamson, Author of Born Free","review":"I enjoy the simplicity and ease of purchase at Amazon.

It describes the Indians as a native and potent force, without condescension or romanticism.

Extremely well-written account of life on the plains and mountains among the Dakotas (named \\"Sioux\\" by the French, we learn), mountain men, and an amazing assortment of characters, all described in intricate detail. I've rarely read a book, from any era, which conjures images as vivid as this one does. This account is a \\"can't put it down\\" narrative. Learned a lot of interesting annecdotes. For example, Parkman describes a scene of mourning in which the Indians, in their lamentations, sound like they are saying \\"hallelujah,\\" which apparently, along with other \\"coincidences,\\" lead the founders of the Mormon theology to conceive the \\"absurd notion\\" that the Indians were descended from the Lost Tribes of Israel. This is a fascinating, contemporaneous comment on the then-early Mormon church. Having read other accounts of life on the frontier and of the trappers/mountain men, I was also interested to read of the same locations, incidents and battles, told from different perspectives, but clearly referencing the same events, locations and people. True, verified history, unvarnished as it would be by later historians.If you like this genre, be sure to read William F.

You get the sense that the author is not some distant, stuck up historical figure but rather that he is alive and speaking and joking directly with the reader across a 160 some year chasm. A little reading on the Francis Parkman will enhance the experience."},{"Title":"The Oregon trail,: Sketches of prairie and Rocky mountain life","review":"In April 1846 Francis Parkman, a 23 year old Harvard Law graduate from Boston, left Fort Leavenworth (now Kansas) with his \\"friend and relative\\" Quincy Adams Shaw on \\"a tour of curiosity and amusement to the Rocky Mountains\\".They had a small \\"French cart\\" known as a \\"mule killer\\", a team of mules, a tent, and a \\"miscellaneous assortment of boxes and barrels\\", some horses and guides and companions familiar with the territory they would be travelling through.Although he was the scion of a family of wealth and standing, and although he had entered Harvard at 16 and graduated with honors and had already taken the Grand Tour of Europe, he was no tenderfoot. He had always lived from time to time on the 3,000 acres of wilderness his maternal grandfather owned near Medford Massachusetts; and he was at home around the campfire in the woods.This experience would become invaluable. In the next five months Parkman and Shaw and their companions would sit around a hundred campfires as they traveled several thousand miles over the great High Plains using the rivers as their highway. They went up the Platte and crossed what is now Nebraska to North Platte where the river divides into to two extensive river systems - the North Platte which drains most of southeastern Wyoming - and the South Platte which drains the area of Wyoming around Cheyenne and virtually all of northeastern Colorado - Fort Collins, Denver, and Colorado Springs almost south to present day La Junta .Having gone up the North Platte as far as Ft. Laramie Parkman left the party and lived with the Ogallala Sioux for more than six weeks, traveling with them to the Black Hills of South Dakota and thence back to Ft. Laramie from whence the party went down the South Platte as far as La Junta where they met the Arkansas River flowing east and north and up which they traveled back to Ft. Leavenworth and then down the Missouri and the Mississippi to St. Louis; and then it was overland back to Boston where they arrived on or about the first of October 1946. It turned out to be much more than a trip of \\"curiosity and amusement\\". They were lucky to get back alive and unharmed. (There were hostile Indians. There were surly and dangerous travelers. They were thrown from their horses more than once. Parkman was so sick part of time he could hardly sit his horse.)Much more than \\"amusement\\" would meet the on the trip. They would meet the first immigrants to Oregon along the real Oregon Trail. (Not impressive, he writes.) They would meet the wagons of the Mormons westering from Nauvoo. (They were okay.) The would meet Mountain Men, trappers, mule skinners, soldiers (a \\"motley lot\\") on their way with General Kearny to the War with Mexico which had just been declared. The would meet factors, frontier storekeepers in Ft. Laramie and Bent's Fort east of La Junta on the Arkansas. And above Parkman would meet and live with the Indians - the Ogallala Sioux. He would live with them for more than six weeks, traveling, camping and hunting the buffalo; and his written descriptions would preserve for posterity their life, customs and appearance before they were affected by the white man's ways and alcohol and eventually penned up on their many Reservations This is not to say that they appeared to him as \\"noble savages\\". Not at all. He had little use for them and would write\\"For the most part a civilized white man can discover very few points of sympathy between his own nature and that of an Indian. With every disposition to do justice in their good qualities, he must be conscious that an impassable gulf goes between him and his red brethren Nay, so alien to himself do they appear that, after breathing the air of the prairie for a few months or weeks, he begins to look upon them as a troublesome and dangerous species of wild beast.\\"When he got back to Boston in early October 1846 he turned to his extensive journals and, with his memory refreshed, wrote up his experiences. The results were published the next year (1847) under the name \\"The Oregon Trail\\" and these experiences are now available to us with the same sense of \\"being there\\" and the same freshness that must have existed when he first put pen to paper 165 years ago. The book is a masterful verbal documentary on the Great Plains, their weather - for example the smell and quiet just before the sky blackens and the wind picks up and the thunderstorm breaks with indescribable violence, It's about the Indians and the way they lived, about the flowers in springtime on the Great Prairie, about the oppressive heat of summer, the flies and the mosquitoes, about the antelope and the prairie dog villages, the rivers, the hills and far away buttes, the long horizons, the big sky and the sense of great space. Had Ken Burns, the great documentary filmmaker, lived at that time we would see in his filmed documentary exactly the same things that Parkman saw and described so accurately in his book. Then there is Parkman's description of the buffalo hunt: Remember the great scenes of the buffalo hunt in Dances With Wolves? (It won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1990.) They are right out of Parkman's Chapter on The Buffalo Hunt. Same for the movie's scenes of the Sioux Camp where Lt Dunbar first meets the Sioux You don't have to read the book to see the world of 165 years ago. You can go to the movie. But the book covers more ground and is the more preferable.If I were to find any fault or faults with the book it would first be the fact that there is certain \\"sameness\\" in its many chapters. The next one is often much like the one you just read. So you can skip some. But, then it all comes with the territory. That's what the Great Prairie is - a lot of \\"sameness\\" for a thousand miles. Next I would fault the title. It's not about The Oregon Trail. The trail is at best a minor part of the book. The book is truly the account of a journey. It's really about how things were on the Great Plains in 1846.Parkman went on to become one of the most prominent American historians of the 19th century, writing particularly about the French in America. However, in this book and without any authorial or scrivener's pretense Parkman has written a beautiful readable even lyrical - but accurate - account of how things were there and then. You don't have to read it in a hurry. Take your time. Go to your computer and dial up a map and follow where they are - or were - with their cart and mules. Think about it. Look up some pictures. This is not a book for speed or controversy. It is not a book about problems or politics. It is a beautifully written book about our America, about our history, our people, our experience and about travel and our country and it sets the standard by which all other similar books should be compared. It is an American Elegy"},{"Title":"The Oregon trail,: Sketches of prairie and Rocky mountain life","review":"I chose this book to read on my Kindle because it was free.

Its biggest accomplishment, however, is in the very act of showing how sometimes we don't see what's under our eyes for a sort of mental laziness.Russell forces us to move away from this laziness and reconsider what we take for granted about ourselves, and does so with his enjoyable style. He seems to possess the rare skill of finding the minimum amount of words and concepts needed to explain (and solve) the problem clearly and accurately. He will never forget to define precisely all the terms needed in the discussion, or to question the limits of the premises in order to understand the scope of the conclusion.In each chapter he considers a facet of what we call mind and explores it both from the point of introspection and of external analysis of observable behavior. Introspection gives use informations impossible to obtain with other methods, and it is what gives meaning to the problem of mind in the first place, but it has the intrinsic problem of an instrument trying to measure itself. So Russell keeps on correcting this \\"view from the inside\\" and the delusions it can create with the stick of behaviourism and objective observation.On a less technical side, I highly appreciate the intellectual honesty of someone who can freely use the words \\"contrary to what I once stated\\".The only minus I can think of is that after one has understood the method of analysis employed he can probably predict how it will be used by the author to investigate the remaining items of his enquiry. While I was reading the second half of the book I often found myself anticipating his reasoning, and thinking that those last chapters could have been thinner. However the author's highly readable prose makes this a very small problem, and I suggest this book to everyone interested in the subject (anyone should be!)[A NOTE ABOUT BOOK READABILITY: Amazon merged on the same page the reviews for the paperback and the ebook, so please notice that the review below which warns you about the unreadable format of the book refers ONLY to the kindle version.

Today we can follow in real time the activity of the brain and nervous system for any mental activity, or motor activity as for that. So a great number of pages discussing the difference between a sensation, purely at the level of the contact of some sensorial organ with an outside stimulus, and an image which is a mental representation of what the stimuli are bringing in, or of some mnemic, in other words remembered or recollected, representation in the mind can clearly be solved. Thinking of something or seeing something are very similar but different, just as doing something and seeing someone doing something are very similar but not exactly the same thanks to mirror neurons. And we can \\"see\\" the brain working today.In the same way he spends a tremendous amount of time demonstrating the existence of the mind, of a specific mental level of brain activity. But today that is no longer something to be discussed in such length because thanks to the tremendous progress of medical imagery we know that the brain can work without any outside stimulus, on a stimulus that comes directly from inside, thought, recollection, imagination and so on. But Buddhism is more advanced on the subject than that because they consider that there are six senses in man: the five sensorial senses we know that receive the stimuli from outside and the mind that processes these stimulated sensations to analyze them, recognize them, classify them, identify them, etc, but also, because it is a meta-sense, the possibility to do the same with abstract notions that cannot be at the origin of a physical sensorial stimulus, and of course all other mental or brain element that activates the brain, because the brain can work on its own like an autonomous or semi-autonomous organ (dreams, abstract or artistic activities, etc.).He thus would have been able to come to a clearer notion of knowledge, something that is acquired and accumulated by a subject within some conditions and a context, most of the time collective. But strangely enough Russell neglects, if not rejects, the subject as an essential entity. The learner, the speaker, the hearer, the individual that receives the stimuli through his/her senses and then processes them, the individual that acquires some knowledge through a threshold of the acquisition of knowledge that is his or her own with motivation(s), cognitive strategies and cognitive styles, with the desire to learn or the refusal to learn. These mental dimensions are all motivated by the context of the subject and his own experience, and his experiential history.That's the word that is missing essentially: experience.If we consider the individual in his experience of the world in which he has five physical senses and the mind, a meta-sense in the brain, that receives experiential stimuli all the time in a situation where he has to learn to become autonomous when a new born and independent when autonomous, if we take the individual in that context he is not an abstract subject but he is an experiencer. If we taker language he is a hearer or a speaker, eventually a writer but when Russell brings together hearing, speaking writing or reading, there is something wrong in his vision of language. Writing and reading are the results of a late invention in the phylogeny of language in humanity, and a late learning in children, and has little to do with oral language. We do not speak what we write first, but we speak first and we eventually write what we have spoken or what we are thinking with our mental voice.He would have then enriched his vision with that set of concepts he does not use. Matter the way it is defined by physics is a construct but that does not in anyway permit anyone to say that matter is a mental imaginary entity. Matter is what is outside us and it does not need to be seen, heard, touched or whatever to exist. We can only experience this material world through our senses in a situation of extreme need and feebleness for several years. There is no escaping that. And it is this extreme inferiority that forces humanity as a whole and each child to communicate, hence to learn a language, hence to learn a lot of things and increase their mental powers. Then the rest is social and no longer individual. If the new-born was to be an absolutely individual being it would not survive twelve hours. That social dimension of the mind is not taken into account properly, neither phylogenetically for the human species with the emergence of modern man and homo sapiens, not psychogenetically for each new-born.\\"All psychic phenomena are built up out of sensations and images alone.\\" That's a good conclusion but tremendously short of the real situation. The very first experience of a new-born and even of a foetus over 24 weeks are going to be engraved in the brain and mind of that new-born and will build all his attitudes, motivations or de-motivations, learning experiences or learning refusals during his whole life. Then sensations and the mental representations a person may have in his mind going back to the first three to five years of his/her life are a lot more than just plain sensations, mnemic sensations, images, mnemic images, or whatever. They are most of the time unconscious and embedded in the brain at a very physical level, even in the architectures of the dendrites of the neurons that have grown along with this experience.I will not comment on what he says on language. He had not read de Saussure, that's obvious but today we are far beyond his very nave definition of the word as if Semitic languages, isolating languages and agglutinative, synthetic or syntactically analytical languages could have the same definition of a word, which are in fact roots in Semitic languages, frozen categorized parts of speech (very badly called like that) in isolating languages, and fully syntactic words in all other languages with different levels of realization of the syntax on the word (agglutinative) or around the word (the others). Paradigmatic and syntagmatic dimensions are essential for the various basic elements of our articulated languages, an other word, articulation, that is never used. Our languages have three articulations and we cannot economize on these facts.An important set of lectures though more for the historical approach of the :mind in out western society. We must also keep in mind that many languages do not have a word equivalent to \\"mind\\" in Europe and the West because \\"mind\\" is typically English and other languages have given some Christian or religious values to the words they may use to designate the physical and psychological dimension of the brain's functioning.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Analysis of Mind","review":"Why is it that page numbers are so often left off when a book is converted to electronic format?

Scots is a form of English and varies from location to location. It is not Gaelic although it was partially influenced by Gaelic. I found this dictionary to contain most of the words I wanted to look up along with another Scots/English dictionary, but Glaswegian is a complex slang which is spoken fast and may contain words used within families and neighborhoods. A better book would involve a dictionary of the Glasgow Patter and there are several being published."},{"Title":"Zoo Animals (Baby Genius)","review":"DK Publishing has joined forces with Baby Genius to create entertaining books for babies. These books combine Baby Genius' philosophy with DK's amazing photographs and designs. Baby Genius is a leading producer/publisher of classical, instrumental and vocal CDs and videos for young children.In this book, children are introduced to the world of wild and exotic animals. Fun words and full-color photographs will delight babies and hold their interest.Zoo Animals is a sturdy 16-page book that can be enjoyed for years. The photography is so good you can almost imagine reaching out and touching the page and actually feeling the leopard's fur or the petting the tiny tiger cub's fur. The photography is simply stunning.This book contains pictures of leopards catnapping, giraffes sticking their tongue out (really funny), baby elephants drinking at a water hole, Zebras smiling, turtles swimming under water, baby tigers hanging out together all in a row and a group of lemurs with stunning amber eyes.On the left side you find one animal with the name in large print. Then, on the adjacent page, you see three photographs of the animals in their natural habitat.Highly recommended for the amusement value alone. Some of my earliest childhood memories included seeing a giraffe and elephant at a zoo. This is a book babies and toddlers will enjoy and a trip to the zoo will enhance the reading experience.Also look for:Baby Animals: Colors, Numbers, ShapesFour Seasons~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Zoo Animals (Baby Genius)","review":"Nice pictures, but the text is a little funky.

I am excited to look for more books by this author, his books leave me with a desire to seek out more of his captivating stories. I like the way he can tell more than one story in this book and have them all fall together masterfully.This author was born in London in 1899 and died in Australia in 1960. He was an aeronautical engineer. He served in both WWI and WWII. He left the Navy as a Lieutenant Commander.In 1948 he became disillusioned with the UK and moved his family to Australia. In the 50's and 60's he was one of the world's best-selling novelist."},{"Title":"The Chequer Board","review":"Nevil Shute is best known for &quot;On the Beach,&quot; his novelabout nuclear war, and, more recently, &quot;A Town Like Alice,&quot;which was made into a TV miniseries. At least half a dozen of his other novels are equally wonderful. My paperback copy of &quot;The Chequer Board&quot; is worn out from reading, rereading, and lending, and it is time for me to replace it with a hardback. His account of relations between black American soldiers and the English during World War II is particularly touching, and is a bit of history that was unfamiliar to me."},{"Title":"The Chequer Board","review":"What would you do if you had but one more year to live? Battle-wounded Capt. John Turner decided to use his year seaching out three buddies what had been in the military hospital with him -- each in a terrible jam -- and perhaps give them a helping hand. You'll meet snobbish Phil Morgan, the pilot who hated foreigners, yet deserted his wife to live with a Burmese maiden; Duggie Brent, a young commando, who had to unlearn the horrible teachings that made him an unintentional killer; and Dave Lasurier, the shy Negro G. I. who got into bad trouble -- and found his way out with the help of an understanding woman. John Turner's search for these three takes him to the far corners of the earth and into one strange experience after another until, in the end, he has changed from a petty opportunist into a man with truly great understanding, a man without fear of death. Only the author of PIED PIPER and PASTORAL could have written this powerful and touching novel, a story the critics have recommended \\"heartily and without reservation!\\" Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Chequer Board","review":"Nevil Shute's Chequer Board is just what it's title indicates: a checkerboard of characters, places and lives. All are sought out by one man who knew them all only briefly and now, that he is close to death, he wants to &quot;see how they are doing.&quot; The novel came out in the late 1940's and refers back to World War II and how four men who survived the crashing of a plane returning from North Africa get on with their lives. Mr. Shute's writing is crisp and lively, his characters come off as very real and each of them touches the reader in his own special way. If you can ever find it, definitely pick up this book and let Nevil Shute take you on a wonderful ride tha you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"The Chequer Board","review":"I read this book 15 years ago and I still feel nostalgic when I think about it.

I laughed and cried with them as they struggled with life and death in World War II. The totaly unexpected trip to Burma by a main character was a thrilling and suspenseful endind to a completely enjoyable book. Hours had passed but I couldn't put it down. I certainly had a crying good time!"},{"Title":"The Chequer Board","review":"John Turner has a health condition that will end his life. How will he spend his last days? Working? Spending time with his wife despite his troubled marriage? It's easy to empathize with Turner as he ponders his options while plugging along. Ultimately, in the limited time that remains before his death, Turner decides to locate and assist three servicemen who befriended him while he was laid up in a hospital during the war. He feels the need to do something positive with his last months of life and relishes the opportunity to repay the kindnesses they showed him.Turner's account of the servicemen's stories is enriching and frequently moving. Although Turner's quest leads him to the three men, the story focuses on two of them: Phillip Morgan, who married a Burmese woman and adapted to her culture; and Dave Lesurier, a black American soldier who was persecuted and unjustly accused of rape by white members of the American military. Morgan's story gives Shute a chance to compare British and Burmese cultures, philosophies, and political organizations. While Morgan's story is fascinating, Lesurier's is more powerful. Some American readers might think Shute went too far in painting members of the American military as racist (although, to his credit, he introduces an American character who is not) while portraying the white residents of a British village as accepting, and indeed embracing, the wronged soldier. I thought the story had the ring of truth but I'm not an expert in the racial attitudes that prevailed in small English villages during World War II.In each of these situations, Shute addresses dynamic issues of culture and bigotry with sensitivity and insight. Unsurprisingly, Turner learns as much about himself as he does about his old friends, ultimately making his journey one of self-discovery. To some extent, the novel is about clearing the path for death. He returns to his wife a better man than the one who left on his journey.In prose that is characteristically quiet and graceful, Shute tells an end-of-life story that is sad but uplifting. The Chequer Board is a very impressive work."},{"Title":"The Chequer Board","review":"This book is a very intriguing story of four men involved together in a plane crash nearly at the end of WWII.

Book four had already been in circulation for over two years and at 25, I considered myself well above the normal reader age. However, once I picked up the first book in the series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was (no pun intended), spellbound. I spent the rest of that long summer weekend reading the remaining books. Since then, I have read each book in the series at least 20 times apiece. Somewhere in the middle of all the reading, I began to jot down notes, questions and observations I made- little items that I wanted to ponder afterwards. Questions such as: Why did Professor Dumbledore so prize the individual merits of courage and \\"sheer nerve\\"? Did Hermione and other female students ever experience gender discrimination at Hogwarts? What defined the social structure of the wizard world (surely one exists as is evident by the influence of the well-to-do Malfoy family)? What is it about the Harry Potter books that have such universal appeal? And most importantly, what lessons can be learned?Shortly after Pottermania began, several books appeared on the market dedicated to analyzing the phenomenon. Some addressed broad themes, while others disseminated every detail of the book, trying to decipher each and every meaning of every word of J.K. Rowling's works. Among these is Harry Potter's World: Multidisciplinary Critical Perspectives, a collection of essays written by professors and graduate students.Harry Potter's World: Multidisciplinary Critical Perspectives is by far the most comprehensive book of this genre. Edited by Michigan State University professor Elizabeth Heilman, the book is comprised of numerous essays separated into four perspectives: Cultural Studies Perspectives, Reader Response and Interpretive Perspectives, Literary Perspectives: The Hero, Myth and Genre and Critical and Sociological Perspectives.As a graduate student pursuing a MSEd in Curriculum and Instruction, this book has been a wonderful guide for me and enriched my understanding of the many facets of curriculum study. Not only does it provide unique interpretations of the series, but it also stimulates critical reflection and offers deep analyses of the boy wizard the world has grown to love.While it is appropriate for college and graduate-level classes, anyone interested in exploring the cultural phenomenon of Harry Potter should read and will benefit from this. You will never look at Harry Potter the same way again."},{"Title":"Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter (Pedagogy and Popular Culture)","review":"That was often the comment I received when I wrote my senior thesis last fall about the Harry Potter series. Specifically, I wrote a feminist criticism of the series exploring the ways in which Hermione resists and reaffirms gender stereotypes--\\"Miss Smarty Pants,\\" \\"The Damsel in Distress,\\" etc. Although I am a huge fan of this series (even my dog's name is Muggle), I couldn't believe that I was the only adult concerned about issues of gender, class, and so forth in the books. So imagine my delight upon finding this book...until I realized it wouldn't be published until January 2003, and I was presenting my thesis on December 13, 2002. Not only is this a well-presented and organized collection of essays from a variety of perspectives, but it is also edited by the outstanding & very generous Dr. Heilman. I wrote personally to her about my paper (and dilemma), and she provided to me the working & yet unpublished copy of her essay dealing with gender issues. Luckily, the book was released ahead of schedule so I was able to cite from her published version. My own experience with this book aside, I highly recommend it to Harry fans who would enjoy thoughtful academic discourse on the series."},{"Title":"Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter (Pedagogy and Popular Culture)","review":"While this book is much better than some Harry Potter books out there, because the articles are scholarly and well-informed, I didn't like it. Most of the articles are written from a sociological or \\"cultural studies\\" perspective. If you like that kind of thing, then you will like this volume. If you like psychological, allegorical or symbolic readings, then its not the right book for you. Most of the essays are on broad issues and don't go into the books in great detail. I found the academic scholarship to be very repetitive and predictable at times, with many people expounding the same ideas of what \\"postmodern\\" is.

Fandom about any creative work has its place, but when I want to wrestle with the ideas generated by a pop-culture phenomenon such as the HP books, I want to do it in the company of writers who've given that phenomenon a good hard look--appreciating what's good while not shying away from what might provoke debate.This book provides exactly that. Unique among the twenty or more books on HP I've read so far, its content is consistently smart, grounded in solid knowledge of literature, and well-argued. The writing by all authors included is clear and lively.

Besides, being a huge fan of Steve Yzerman since he first came to Detroit in 1983, I'm always on the lookout for new books about him and the Red Wings. I was not prepared to be sorely disappointed.This book is awful. It's poorly written, poorly organized and definitely not worth the money. In the acknowledgements, Mr. Morrison states that he sent a copy of the transcript to Steve Yzerman, hoping to get his okay to call it an authorized biography. He didn't get it and it's no wonder - this book is a disaster.I own several books about Steve and the Red Wings, and I would recommend any of them over \\"A Wing and a Hero,\\" including Bruce Dowbiggin's \\"Of Ice and Men,\\" even with all its inaccuracies. If you'd like to read a well-written, authorized biography of Steve, get Shelly Lazarus' \\"Hockeytown Hero.\\" Yes, it's written more or less for kids, but it's good and probably the best Yzerman biography out there.I've given \\"A Wing and a Hero\\" one star, only because Amazon.com's system won't let me give it less than that."},{"Title":"Wing. . . and a Hero!: The Steve Yzerman Story","review":"I would have bought this anyway, just because I collect all Yzerman things. That's the only reason.I was extremely disappointed. It's obviously just a compilation of everything he could find that had already been used. I don't think I saw anything in the book that I didn't already know. The kids he talks about in the book are ones 'like' the children Yzerman visited. It's pretty obvious the guys never actually spoke to Yzerman or the kids he visited. The only pic of Yzerman that I can recall is a small black and white that I've seen several times before. I think he was just trying to use Yzerman's name to sell his book.I would recommend any other Yzerman book over this one.I prefer 'Heart of a Champion' myself."},{"Title":"Wing. . . and a Hero!: The Steve Yzerman Story","review":"This book was very inspiring and it is good to know that there is still a hero out there in the likes of Steve Yzerman. I really enjoyed reading A Wing And A Hero and would recommend it to other readers."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"I may have had a slightly older edition of this book since the last dates refered to were 1995 and Amazon lists this as 1997. ...Ardagh doesn't hesitate to put forth his own personal opinions, which are very British. But it takes an outsider eye to write a book such as this that looks at the general character of a people and their changing history. An insider would find many things, such as the casual mixing of classes, not worth mentioning. But to an outsider, those are the very things that set the Irish apart as a people.As a reader from the United States, his use of pounds and constant camparisons to the British political system weren't very helpful, and his use of the term \\"wetback\\" was disconcerting. I'm not sure he meant it to be a colorful word or an offensive word. However, Ardagh clearly loves Ireland and has spent plenty of time there. He shows political trends and the changing role of the church unflinchingly -- complete with all the scandals. I remember reading about Miss X, a 14-yr old rape victim who was stopped from going to England for an abortion, when it happened. What you get from this book that wasn't in the U.S. Newspapers was this mixed reactions of the Irish people. Ardagh makes it very clear that although there are generalizations that can be made about the Irish, they are certianly not \\"One Voice.\\"I also appreciated the 100 pg chapter on Northern Ireland. He managed to write about \\"the troubles\\" without taking sides other than that of anyone who wanted a lasting peace. He did defend the British role in a way that reflected his native heritage, but at the same time he openly admitted that some of the actions of the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary have fanned the fires. I understood and respected the more recent British approach in a way I hadn't before. I had not been aware that the IRA and UDN were both involved in vigilante activities in their own communities, and that extorting collection money was common practice. I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was. For some reason, I thought the paramilitary groups spent their time and energy on each other and didn't have time for these sideline, ganglike activities.It was also interesting to read the postscript that was written during the ceasefire and peace attempt during John Major's premiership. Ardagh had spent many, many pages talking about different Irish-led ventures that brought Protestants and Catholics together to foster peace. I found myself asking, with so many people working towards peace, how come it isn't happening? And the description of the Mid-90s peace attempt sounded so similar to the more recent attempt under Tony Blair & Bertie Ahern's premierships, that it was both interesting and frustrating. I followed the last round very closely, as an Irish American yes, but more because \\"the troubles\\" is my first memory of war. I remember my father answering questions like \\"what is a hunger strike.\\" I remember watching buildings in London coming down on the nightly news. But I wasn't old enough to connect the two. I was eager to see a war that had been in the background all my life, wrapped up and ended. Alas. When I was reading Ardagh's hopeful postscript, I wanted to throw the book against the wall because I knew the violence still continues.In summary, worthwhile read, but there are probably more current books available. And I still hope for peace in Northern Ireland."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"The Ardagh book has been in my collection since it came out. I found it very intelligent and fair in its depictions of Ireland. It presented a good overview and Ardagh seems to have a sense of affection for the country. He has a good grasp on the role of the Catholic church in Ireland and,all in all, was respectful of others' beliefs although he was puzzled by them I travel there often and only wish that with the tremendous social and economic changes, almost upheavals, which have occured in Ireland in the last 10-12 years that he would do an update on the book. This book, although outdated today, is well worth reading for the insights which can be gained."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"Highly Recommended!John Ardagh has written a number of highly praised books on modern European societies, and this book is as good as the others. Once you read an Ardagh book, you will walk away with a good understanding of what really makes a country tick. Please realize that this is not a history book (although it does provide the necessary historical background). If you need to know ANYTHING about modern Irish society, look no further. &quot;Ireland and the Irish&quot; is a complete and unbiased profile of a rapidly changing nation."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"I found the book very informative, providing a great deal of background to contemporary Irish politics and cultural life. Just what I was looking for. The story of the Irish constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion was an eye-opener. If the Republic of Ireland, being 90% anti-abortion, had such a hard time with the issue, how can people in a more socially divided country like the US think they can institute government control?"},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"This book, perhaps uniquely, attempts to present a comprehensive study of modern Ireland, covering every live cultural and political issue in the country ranging from the conflict between Church and State, growing secularism in Ireland, Irish Gaelic versus English, town planning legislation, the increasing centralization of Irish government, taxation and welfare policies in Ireland, etc. But this book is fundamentally a work of journalism rather than cultural study, and derives most of its conclusions from interviews with people in Ireland rather than serious efforts on the author's part to immerse himself in Irish culture. It is also marred by embedded British prejudices: Ardagh, for example, claims that government in Ireland is far more centralized than in Britain, even though Britain (where local taxes are collected by the London government and then distributed to the local councils) is one of the most centralized countries in the world. Ardagh also compares Ireland to other European countries such as France and Germany but totally ignores North American contributions to Irish heritage--such as the diamond-shaped, yellow-background warning signs on Irish roads, or the role official bilingualism in Canada plays as a model for attempts to make Ireland a fully bilingual Gaelic/English-speaking country.The language issue illustrates most of the shortcomings of this book. Ardagh dismisses Irish Gaelic as an unimportant feature of life in Ireland, and in so doing fails to observe nuances in how bilingualism functions, or rather fails to function, in Ireland: for instance, he fails to observe that (unlike in Canada) the Irish names of many government agencies and other organizations are often very free translations of the English names--for instance, 'Failte go hAontas mac Leinn' does NOT mean, 'Welcome to Queen's Student Union', as he seems to think. He contents himself with merely dismissing the Irish names of government agencies as &quot;strange.&quot; He also fails to observe that while official bilingualism is in theory mandatory in the Republic, it is often not followed in practice even on government sites; and finally, that while in the Republic Irish is distinguished from English on road signs by a different typeface and capitalization rule, in Catholic districts of Northern Ireland it appears on some signs according to rules developed for bilingual signage in Wales (same face and capitalization for both languages). Ardagh is also insensitive to the role Irish Gaelic plays in the policing issue in Northern Ireland--he does not seem to understand, for instance, why a Northern Ireland police force with a bilingual name would be preferable to the current Royal Ulster Constabulary. He says Irish is a &quot;difficult language,&quot; but seems not to have realized that much of the difficulty comes from the rules surrounding eclipsis and changes in consonant quality, which reflect a concern with how the language SOUNDS when it is spoken and are responsible for giving Irish its musical qualities. One gets the impression this book would have been much improved if Ardagh had bothered to look in an Irish grammar, or even purchased an Irish dictionary so as to check some supposedly &quot;bilingual&quot; signs.Finally, this book is dead to the simple &quot;poetry&quot; of life in Ireland--for instance, Ardagh does not observe (as others could) that anti-clericalism has not taken root in Ireland in the same way it has in other Catholic societies, such as Mexico, because the Irish clergy has been careful to reserve the &quot;best stories&quot; unto itself--the telling of parables is a very common device in Irish homilies and in a country such as this, which is very sensitive both to narrative movement and the sheer sound of words, it is an extremely powerful one.As an introduction to the economic problems facing Ireland (both N.I. and the Republic) I suppose this book is necessary--but otherwise it is a dreary, lifeless compilation."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"I think some of the Irish protest too much! As a South African working in Ireland I found the book a good source of information about Ireland, and especially the recent history of the country. It also confirmed a lot of things I had noticed myself, for instance that the Irish are lacking in a sense of tidiness. I have to agree, though, that it is not very engaging. I also found the author's use of conversations with normal people as evidence of trends or widely held views excessive and, at times, irritating.Also, the book probably needs to be updated to take the effect of the Celtic Tiger on the Irish way of living into account. The country seems to be in the grip of materialism. The author also glosses over the issue of alcohol abuse. It seems to be a very real problem among students and young working people, but most Irish seem to view it as charming and part of their culture."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"As with other books of the Ardagh series on Europe, this book is useful to all those who are totally ignorant about Ireland. However, Ardagh's prescritions for Ireland and its future are all modernistic. Basically, he hopes Ireland will abandon its cultural past and join the grim narcissistic future that is in store for the rest of the modern world. Traditions are to be gladly abandoned. After reading three of Ardagh's series now, I am sure he is not a good man. His future world is a vulgar, crass, materialistic one in which a New Class and theuraputic state takes care of the citizen's needs and desires. I am sure he is a fan of the Clintons and the Blairs and Ireland's Mrs. Robinson."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"Though the book is a somewhat useful read, Ardagh does not like much of the Irish past especially Ireland's social conservatism. He seems to say that Ireland's future can be bright if the Irish only reject their past. Since the publishing of this book, Ireland has lept into the future by electing Bertie Aherne Prime Minister. Mr. Aherne has dumped his first wife and family and openly lives with a girlfriend. Mr. Ardagh must be grinning from ear to ear."},{"Title":"State housing policies for the 1990s","review":"This book is nothing more than an insult to the Irish people.

It would have been nice if Ripple, Mr. Charlie, and a few others were included. None the less, the book has given me many hours of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Grateful Dead Anthology","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews which made it sound a lot better than what it really is, a guitar fake book. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed and felt the need to write a review so others don't make the same mistake I did.When I got this book, I had to double check to make sure I didn't get the easy guitar version of the book. It has regular sheet music with open chords over the top. As one user previously commented, these aren't even the real chord forms they play (Bob uses some non standard forms). For the few songs I looked at, they were even incorrect with the open chords. For example, Sugaree is B-E. They show it a 1/2 step up (don't believe me, watch Jerry play it on you tube). For Franklin's Tower, they miss the G chord in the transition (it's A-G-D, not A-D). I'm sure the list could on if I'd take the time to go through it.It doesn't have any tab. So if you're looking to learn the riffs that make the song sound right, you're out of luck. This book is really what they call a \\"fake book\\". A previous person stated they show Phil's bass parts, but once it again, it is in standard notation.I bought this to learn how to play Grateful Dead songs, and this doesn't cut. If you want to strum some chords that will sound alright over the song, then it will work, but if you really want to play some Dead, then look on the internet, they do a much better job. No signature riffs, no unique chord formation, no Jerry's style.Needless to say, I'm returning the book."},{"Title":"Grateful Dead Anthology","review":"If you are a dead-head and love their music like me, this book is for you. Lots of great music and the lyrics. Want to play the dead music? This book is for you. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the music is not in tablature which would have been great for many guitar players."},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"Look at a map of Australia. The interior of the continent will be marked with rivers, lakes and localities. But if you go there the rivers will be dry, the lakes just salt and the localities just a handfull of people. This collection of first impressions by the first Europeans to see this wide brown land reveals their awe at the beauty and terror of the alien and essentially empty landscape.Drawn from journals, diaries and archives, these pieces convey the struggle for survival of Europeans in an environment where they were physically and culturally at a loss. The descriptions of early contacts with Aboriginal Australians written by the explorers themselves contain valuable insights into attitudes which informed the initial gropings for understanding across a vast cultural divide. As such they provide a sobering backdrop to inform us of the factual, cultural and emotional origins of the reconciliation movement in Australia.Flannery lets the pieces speak for themselves with minimal introductions to set the scene. The result is a readable and moving story, and good history at the same time."},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"This is an anthology of excerpts from Australian Explorers journals ranging from early sixteenth century European Explorers to Australians in the early 20th century. Flannery's introduction for each provides an excellent, concise biography and set up to each explorer's excerpt. In many of the excerpts, an explorer faces death and disaster. The most intriguing initially was Charles Sturt writing of his attempt to find the mythical lake in the center of Australia. He brings a boat, experiences weather so hot it bursts a thermometer his party carries, they suffer from extreme scurvy, and Sturt's desire to be the first to reach the center of Australia. The second explorer I read in this collection was Ernest Giles. His except focuses on an expedition with his assistant Gibson, who goes for help and manages to get lost, and then Giles slowly makes his way back to base camp. Reading The Explorers fascinated me enough that I wanted to read more about specific explorers like Giles, but also about Australian explorers in general."},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"My only criticism of Flannery's book is that it ends. I found myself wanting to read more of each story. But within a moment of turning to a new chapter, I was engrossed in another adventure. The Explorers is an outstanding selection of historical pieces and a fine example of the editor's art. First-person accounts like this truly offer a window into the minds and times of the people and places involved. (I recommend &quot;Eyewitness to History&quot; for those who enjoy this book.)"},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"What possesses a person to set off into the trackless wastes of Australia, with the almost certain knowledge that death lies waiting to welcome them into his scrawny arms?Reading this book gives you some of the answers and some of the idea of the pain and suffering undergone by these explorers (and in some cases the hapless Aborigines coerced into seeking water).There are some amazingly good writers within these pages, quite unexpected when you consider that many of them were ex-convicts or self-taught (and comparing them to some contemporary American explorers); there are some delightful descriptive passages and the occasional bout of whimsy, especially the anecdote of how 'Rocket' got his name - I was in hoots!An excellent read, which encouraged me to order several old copies of explorers' accounts.Thoroughly recommended!"},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"When I studied history for matriculation in New South Wales back in 1958-1959, there was no subject available to me called \\"Australian History\\". The two history subjects available were Ancient History and Modern History. Modern History was, in fact, the history of modern Europe. These days, it seems inconceivable that the school system at matriculation level back then could completely ignore the history of Australia, and the history of its nearest neighbours. Although the European settlement of Australia is relatively recent, the Aboriginal history of Australia covers millennia. The former received scant attention in earlier school years, the latter, none at all. (One presumes that Australian history is now accorded the place it deserves in the school curriculum, and receives a fuller and more balanced treatment). Because of this background, I found Tim Flannery's book of enormous interest. The meagre Australian history once taught consisted of drawing maps of the routes taken by explorers, and little else, or so it seems to fading memory. Tim Flannery relates his own experience: \\"The men were just names, their journeys snail-trails across paper. No attempt was made to bring exploring to life, perhaps because the inconvenient details about Aborigines and barren wastes would have simply got in the way of the main message: that the Europeans had triumphed\\". We are indebted to Tim Flannery for redressing the balance in this book, in the course of which we can read some superb writing that would otherwise be hard to come by. Some Australian history may be dull, but the history of exploration, as told by the explorers themselves, is instructive, exciting, and still relevant."},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"This book consists of brief excerpts from journals, letters and diaries of those foolish or brave enough to push beyond the known world along Australia's seaboards.These explorers demonstrated unfathomable foolishness, unquenchable curiosity, bullheaded ethnocentricity, and, in too few cases, a passion for discovery for its own sake. As a reader you will be horrified, entertained, and enlightened by their adventures and misadventures.I just returned from a trip to Australia and took this book along with me to read. It was perfect for a visitor with little knowledge of Australian history beyond Hughes' &quot;Fatal Shore&quot; (another great read)."},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"This book provides some wonderfully illuminating insights into the minds of the early explorers of this vast continent.

Listening to him talk about it makes me want to read it too!"},{"Title":"THE EXPLORERS, STORIES OF DISCOVERY AND ADVENTURE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN FRONTIER","review":"Australia's small history makes a book like this diffifult to stay interested in. Of course, we are a lucky country fortunate enough to have prospered from these fine explorers and Flannery captures this brilliantly. But there is a time when the discoveries of a new animal or native remind the reader of how quickly one can lose their mind to something else as one can't help but take it for granted or compare their countries history with one far greater and more enlightening from a place such as Great Britain or America. However, Flannery is aiming to make Australian history sit right up there amongst the cream of the crop for a rich past - we as the reader know this isn't possible but feel a sense of pride in what these explorers did to help develop our free and thriving country. The author does not have much to contribute within the book. He writes a few brief footnotes or may stretch himself to an introduction of a small to mid paragraph for each. Yet, we must remind ourselves this is a history book so there is not much room for creativity. I suggest this book is worthwhile for someone passionate or interested in the Australian history, but if you are made to read this whether it be school or uni do it in sections. Otherwise, you will find it tedious. In the end you will find it rewarding - especially (as an Australian resident) when you next visit Botany Bay, Cape York or wherever it may be.......you will stop and think at just how lucky we are."},{"Title":"Secrets Of The Sicilian Dragon (Chess Books)","review":"The Sicilian in general (and the Dragon in particular), is known as a sharp tactical opening. So along comes a book which attempts to teach you the general ideas that seem to occur again and again. Instead of endless waves of mind-numbing brilliant tactical moves, the authors present a list of ten concepts that Black should keep in mind throughout the game. I still remember how my eyes lit up during an OTB game when I realized I could sacrifice the exchange on c3 (idea #3).The authors are clearly pro-Dragon, but they do make the effort to present the themes that White should pursue. There is a second list of nine themes for White, one of which (attacking the King along the h-file) has changed the way I approach going after the castled King.Be sure to note that this book, in keeping with its &quot;idea&quot; approach, does not attempt to analyze lots of lines. It presents the concepts and expects you to try them out over the board."},{"Title":"Secrets Of The Sicilian Dragon (Chess Books)","review":"Too many players go through the opening simply by memorizing several moves without understanding why those moves are meaningful.This is an excellent book for understanding the ideas behind one of the most complex and entertaining opening lines available to today's tournament player: you'll not find lengthy (and boring) variations to study and repeat from memory in your games but you'll learn which are the plans that come with the Dragon variation. This is surely the best first step any player should take when learning this (or any other) opening line. Once you know how the opening works, then you'll be able to move to an advanced Dragon book filled up with lines and use it for further study and reference (and then you'll be able to see those lines in a new light and really understand them!)."},{"Title":"Secrets Of The Sicilian Dragon (Chess Books)","review":"The Dragon is a excellent counterattacking opening for Black to include in his/her repertoire. However, by focusing EXCLUSIVELY on thematic elements of the Dragon and not including any theory, this book will leave Black players at a disadvantage against opponents who know their opening theory. I strongly recommend Winning with the Sicilian Dragon 2 by Chris Ward because it includes a nice mix of thematic elements along with the theory that is necessary to know when one is playing the Dragon. All in all, a good general overview, but a waste of money."},{"Title":"Secrets Of The Sicilian Dragon (Chess Books)","review":"This book show you positions, ideas and some games.

Overall he got a plus score on me. I also read some games of Fischer beating the Dragon (I feel good), then Sierawan poked fun of the Dragon (feel better), and Karpov killed Korchnoi's Dragon (feel the best). Then Kasparov is successful with the Dragon. Now I have mixed feelings about the Dragon (together with bad experience in the Dragon, I lost many games with either color!!!). I hoped to find a book to improve my score, And this book is not a long term work. It could provide a list of plans to use when you play white or black, but not deep analysis, only good for quick fix when playing speed chess. Buy book from GM writers is better choice, they have their record to back it up. 7.50 USD is OK for this book."},{"Title":"Classics of the foreign film,: A pictorial treasury","review":"With trepidation, I approached 'Cinemabilia' bookstore on West 13th Street in N.Y., on that 1984 (?) evening. And there it was: a 1972 soft cover reissue of the 1962 classic, to make up for the treasured and much-abused original that I had misplaced inexcusably upon moving a couple of years earlier.Parker Tyler (1904-1974), author, art critic, poet and movie chronicler ('Kenyon Review'). His choices and elegant commentary of 60-plus foreign-language classics from 1919 to 1961 remain faultless and merit serious consideration by any foreign-movie lover.Among several well-known features, there is also commentary on movies not familiar to me at the time: 'Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie' ('The Italian Straw Hat'); 'Potomok Chingis-khan'' ('The Heir to Genghis Khan' or 'Storm Over Asia'); 'Zemlya' ('Earth'); 'Le Sang d'un Poete' ('Blood of a Poet'); 'L'Age d'Or;' 'M&auml;dchen in Uniform;' 'The Three Penny Opera;' 'La Femme du Boulanger' ('The Baker's Wife'); 'Dead of Night;' 'Que Viva M&eacute;xico;' 'Don Quixote;' 'Marius;' 'Fanny;' 'C&eacute;sar;''Ecstasy;' 'Poil de Carotte' ('The Redhead'); 'La Maternelle' ('Children of Montmartre'); 'La Kermesse h&eacute;roque' ('Carnival in Flanders'); 'Die Ewige Maske' ('The Eternal Mask'); 'Things to Come;' 'Olympia;' 'Detstvo Gorkogo' ('The Childhood of Maxim Gorki'); 'The Dybbuk;' 'Pygmalion;' 'The Stars Look Down;' 'Dies Irae' ('Day of Wrath'); 'Les Enfants du Paradis' ('Children of Paradise'); 'Stairway to Heaven;' 'Monsieur Vincent;' 'Fr&ouml;ken Julie' 1951 ('Miss Julie'); 'Orph&eacute;e' ('Orpheus'); 'The Man in the White Suit;' 'Times Gone By;' 'The Seven Deadly Sins;' 'Il Cristo Proibido' ('Strange Deception'); 'Picwwick Papers;' 'Ugetsu;' 'The Importance of Being Earnest;' \`L'amore in Citt&agrave;' ('Love in the City'); 'La Notte;' etc. But for Mr. Tyler's comments, it is doubtful that I would have sought out those titles not in English; several of them now unavailable.Perhaps under his influence (too young for Agee and G. Greene), I became an admirer of the writings of critics and movie enthusiasts Dwight Macdonald, Robin Wood, Stanley Kauffmann, Hollis Alpert and others, while keeping up with esteemed - if less provocative - writers Pauline Kael, John Simon, Vincent Canby, Clive Barnes, Richard Corliss, Richard Schickel and/or of other celebrated reviewers (with Crowther, Shalit, Siegel, Osborne, Lyons, Reed, Roeper et al not in contention - peace).Reputable critics have since published worthy books on the foreign-movie field. And yet, 'Classics of the Foreign Film' remains my reference source, for style and substance, notwithstanding the many remarkable foreign movies of the last fifty years that are understandably missing. If anything, although the titles of a hypothetically updated re-issue might now number one-hundred, it is doubtful that, on hindsight, any titles here would have been excluded.To continue treasuring Parker Parker's book is to champion his thoughts and contributions."},{"Title":"Introduction to Molecular Medicine","review":"I bought this book since a University offered me a Molecular Medicine postgraduate class. The truth is I find the book too basic, but I gave it four stars because even though It's simple, It has a very good order and few but very well searched examples.

It is difficult to go into detail but a portion of what is supposed to be on the CD is not on the CD at all. I was very disappointed at this. I sent an e-mail to Barrons letting them know about this flaw, etc. but they were not even concerned enough to reply - which says a lot. I let the bookstore (from where I purchased the book) know about this flaw and they said they had had a lot of other complaints about the very same issue - so BEWARE. I was also told Barrons had not returned their e-mails or calls on the same matter. Really bad. Other than that, and Barron's lack of concern, this book is very good for grammar and vocabulary. My only other comment would be that some of the reading exercises in the 9 tests are extremely difficult and probably more representative of something an extremely advanced student would be capable of.

The framework story unfolds at a painfully slow pace and the adventurous part of recruitment, training and life of the Geste brothers in the Foreign Legion is not broad enough.Too bad, because the French Foreign Legion, shrouded in the myth of secrecy and adventure, fascinates many to this day (including myself) and deserves to be object of a more suspenseful novel. The Foreign Legion garrison heroically defending Fort Zinderneuf against the Arabic attacks is undoubtedly the most memorable image of Wren's story. It is at the heart of the adventure for which the book is famous and Wren deserves the credit for the idea. But he spends too much time on minor characters and inconsequential dialogue. The characters are awfully stereotypical (the cunning and deceitful Italians, the brutal and primitive Germans, the noble and chivalrous English, the lighthearted and nave Americans and the greedy and egotistical French - oh brother).Maybe many book reviewers are influenced by the great movie from 1939 (with Gary Cooper and Ray Milland). It is pretty true to the novel but focuses on the part of the story I was looking for and is well paced. In Wren's book, you have to read through more than 100 pages of turgid story telling before the Geste brothers even get to the Foreign Legion. Its longwinded explanations and speculations on the characters' motivation and the possible outcome of the inherent intrigues seem terribly old fashioned for the 21st century reader. This shortcoming of Wren's story telling ability diminishes the enjoyment of the book. Wren is no Alexandre Dumas who can write a novel of 1400 pages (\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\") and still make it easy reading."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],H={key:0},L={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",L,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,P)):b("",!0)])}const E=u(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-886db481"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/42.md","filePath":"guide/42.md"}'),D={name:"guide/42.md"},j=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(E)]))}});export{q as __pageData,j as default};
