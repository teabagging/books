Penciled by Jeffery Moy the scenes and character are some of the best drawings within the Wildstorm Comic series. The coloring has an almost fluid like feel that give the characters extreme depth that conveys emotion and suspense very well. The characters attitudes are spot on with the actors performances in the TV series and the story itself is very compelling.Full of suspense and action the story tells the tale of how Voyager's elite struggle against the Borg and losing members of the crew to assimilation. Packed with unending danger the characters are forced to reach deep and come up with the courage to battle a new evil enemy that threatens the entire galaxy.Anyone who is a fan of either the Borg or the Voyager team would do well to pick up this issue.STAR TREK: FALSE COLORSWritten by Nathan Archer Star Trek: False Colors attempts to build upon the conflict between the USS Voyager and the Borg. Many fans of the TV series are well aware of the history between the two enemies and the gains and loses by both sides. Seven of Nine is a gain for the Voyager family and as in the show this comic tries to expand on her torn feelings for her human family and that of the Borg collective. Although the penciling and inking done by Jeffery Moy and W.C. Carani respectively is good but not great the true faults with this issue lie in the story. The tale itself is inline with many told within the Voyager franchise but it doesn't really add anything to the Voyager Vs. Borg story arch and there is little in the way of depth that compels the reader to get emotionally involved.The scenes are very well done although there isn't much that makes the scene's pop from the pages. The characters are well drawn even if Tuvok's forehead is larger than the actors. Seven of Nine carries much of the story and the action is good but the story is pretty short. It would have been nice to get some history and more depth from the enemies. But all-in-all this issue is just OK, I say skip it.ALL FEEDBACK IS APPRECIATED. THANKS AND GOOD READING."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Calculus of Variations","review":"Good books on the calculus of variations are not thick on the ground, and this one is pretty good. It is organised around explicating Hamiltonian mechanics, but with mathematical rigor and clarity. Why not 5 stars then? Some proofs skip a lot of steps. There are not a lot of examples. The typesetting is from 509 years ago, with equations and so on in the text not on a separate line. There are few diagrams.If your interest is in physics this is a FAR better book to choose than Sagan."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Calculus of Variations","review":"Thorough, concise, enjoyable and CHEAP book on the Calculus of variations. One of the few mathematics books that is simultaneously rigorous and entertaining. Illustrated with many examples and applications, drawn from physics and engineering. The proofs are brisk, though there is enough there to guide you on your way to complete understanding. A DEFINITE read for any mathematician or scientist!"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Calculus of Variations","review":"This is a very good introductory text to the calculus of variations. I have also read similar texts by J. Gregory, C. Lin and by M. Denn, and I prefer this book. I am not a mathematician and I find this treatment more accessible than Denn, but more rigorous than Gregory & Lin. Previous reviews have noted that the author is not as explicit as he could be in all of the proofs and I concur, but as a result I find the level of rigor to be ideal for an introductory text. To disagree with a previous review I find the typesetting to be good and there are plenty of figures."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Calculus of Variations","review":"Have you ever wondered about the shape of a hanging string? Or the surface of water in a spinning bucket? Or why E=mc^2? With this wonderful gem of a book, practical questions like these are answered in enjoyable prose and with a deluge of interesting examples. This book explains the calculus of variations, a theory coming from certain problems in integral calculus( involving minimizing certain expressions involving integrals) that turns out to have many practical applications. Charles Fox starts with simple considerations(deriving-with calculus- the result that a line gives the shortest distance between two points) and builds up to complicated considerations, like relativity and the least-action principle, using a vast variety of interesting practical examples to both illustrate the theory and show why it is useful. With a fantastic writing style, interesting topics and a vast class of practical problems, this book is a must-read for any person who wants to solve practical engineering and scientific problems!"},{"Title":"Lifeline","review":"While moving and artfully written, this work highlights some of the simple joys and experiences of family life and love.

First published in the early 1970s, it explains feminism and the women's movement in ways that teenagers can understand. I read this book along with others, written for adults, while forming my first feminist philosophies when I was only 12. I had already seen from my mother's story that the life plan of marrying a man, having children and expecting him to take care of you for the rest of your life was a dangerous one that didn't work for all women, and I certainly wanted something different for myself. GIRLS ARE EQUAL TOO gave me some inkling of what I was going to be in for; true, there were many women fighting for me to have a better life than my foremothers had, but the struggle was something I should never take for granted. Today the book is a bit dated, but it's still full of a good deal of timeless information and well-presented feminist philosophy.Today's generation could benefit from having a book similar to this, updated for modern times. Teenage girls today tend to assume their equal rights as human beings are all taken care of. They don't realize how much is still left to be done. They're also really vulnerable to the societal message (cloaked in the guise of \\"do-me\\" feminism) that they are primarily sexual beings and that there's nothing wrong with using their looks and bodies as just another tool in the struggle to get ahead. This book sends a different message: Your rights shouldn't be taken for granted, there are some you may think you have that you don't yet, and that it's far safer and more reliable to use your brains to get ahead, rather than your body and your sex appeal. In a world in which girls are being sexualized practically from the cradle, that's a more needed message than ever."},{"Title":"Venice for pleasure","review":"This book features wonderful history and walking tours in Venice, shared by a writer with a tremendous love for Venice the city. The author hopes that this trip you're making is just one of many, so you can spend more time sitting at an outdoor restaurant, rather than rushing to the next museum. You can always catch that museum on another trip--stay outside and soak in the romance of Venice itself. I have taken this book with me on my several visits to Venice, and try to follow his advice. You'll want to have another &quot;standard&quot; guide to the city, but don't forget this small gem."},{"Title":"Venice for pleasure","review":"What a strange and wonderful little book!Venice for Pleasure is essentially four walking tours told in a charmingly conversational style by an author who is clearly in love with Venice. Stopping in a Venetian cafe to read a passage is like having a friend leaning over your shoulder to recall the local history and gossip, point out fascinating details that you probably wouldn't have noticed, and make you smile with his dry wit.We did all four walking tours and thoroughly enjoyed Links' companionship along the way; I can't recommend it highly enough if exploring Venice on foot is your aim. We also found the directions infallible.Please note that this isn't a conventional guidebook, so you shouldn't expect logistical information."},{"Title":"Venice for pleasure","review":"My husband gave me this book for Christmas before we went to Venice and it was a great help planning our trip.

Of course, it's better to read it in Venice and wander through the alleyways and along the canals in the company of the author, but its charm and humour is such that sometimes I pick it up and read it just for fun.

Instead of taking the word of experts on HG, we get his speculations first hand.The book starts out innocuously describing how turning a \\"steam pump\\" on its side we now have a steam engine. He makes some good points against the wisdom of the time that ideas come together at just the right time to create just the right answer to a problem. From her he speculates on how mechanized transportation will change society. HG is just warming up as he now speculates on government, military and social conscience. He used a term \\"the new republic to describe his future world.I may have to take his work on many of the subject but I can relate to his military references. It took the Vietnam War to shake the military up enough to make HG's speculation on an educated well-oiled military that we have today. It was the generals of the time the generals of the Vietnam era that realize that we needed just about everything HG predicted from technical advances to intelligent soldiers to the concept of \\"Land, Sea, Air\\" warfare.Some of his speculations are a met strange or maybe just a tad different. It looks like he thinks that democracy will be exchange for the rule of technocrats. Moreover, he is not too sure of the future domination of the English language.In any event, this book is well worth reading as it is the core of HG's views of humankind.The Time Machine, Literary Touchstone Edition"},{"Title":"Wedding Crafts: 40 Charming Ideas for a Unique Personalized Wedding","review":"If you are a Romantic who likes tradition you will probably like this book.

The eleven chapters full of family memories and daring adventures are stimulating to all readers. The stories were told in very much detail and the facts presented in this biography were all truthful. The fictional stories presented allowed the reader to further connect with Earhart's life. The book starts when she was just eight years old and knew that flying was her passion. Even though her first plane was made out of cardboard, it never crushed her dreams of one day flying a real airplane despite her gender. She always had an inner passion to be a pilot. The book then moved on to tell a fun family story where Earhart has an outer space experience, she saw Halley's Comet. It then focused on Amelia's life as she grew up. She became a nurse's aid right after high school in Toronto because she felt sorry for all of the wounded soldiers. This is where she saw a man doing daredevil tricks on an airplane that frightened all of Amelia's friends but not Amelia. She later went to an air show with her father where Amelia was a passenger on a real airplane. She loved the experience and decided to take flying lessons despite the high costs. After she had gained experience, she was asked to fly across the Atlantic on a plane named The Friendship and she was successfully the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean. On May 20, 1932, Amelia decided to fly across the Atlantic alone without any co-pilots. This was very dangerous back in that time period yet despite the dangers she was successful and became a heroine. Soon after this victory, Amelia and her friend Fred decided to try something that no one else had done before and fly all the way around the world. As a result, they lost their lives living the adventure she had always dreamed of. She was a fighter and her story is still an inspiration to all women. Like she always said, \\"Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failure must be but a challenge to others.\\"This book was a great read but I did not think that the pictures were beneficial to the story. I would have liked if the author had put real life pictures in the story rather than black and white rough sketches. I think that it would have made the story more personal for the reader. Overall, this is a great read and I would recommend it to elementary teachers to share with their students.According to the National Council for the Social Studies Standards, this book focuses on two important standards that elementary students should study. The first is standard number three, People, Places, & Environments. This book is focused on an important historical figure that made and changed history for women everywhere. The second standard that directly connects to this piece of children's literature is standard number four, Individual Development & Identity. This standard allows the students to make personal connections with the historical events or people. Students can make several connections with Amelia's story such as: family life, trips on an airplane, love of danger, strong drive to be adventurous, the list goes on and on. This book meets several of the social studies standards required for elementary age students and I would recommend this book for third or forth grade students.This book review was written by Kristin Rosen"},{"Title":"Myths, Mysteries & Legends of Alabama","review":"Myths, Mysteries, and Legends of Alabama doesn't tell ghost stories, but there's plenty in the book to shiver about, no matter the weather.

Mrs. North is an invalid and Betty and Senator North spend a good deal of time alone together and in the halls of Congress as their love blossoms. In the meantime, another senator, Robert Burleigh, also falls in love with her. Assuming things are hopeless between her and North, she accepts Burleigh's proposal of marriage. But, of course, does anyone doubt what happens next? Mrs. North dies, leaving the door open for North and Betty to love honorably and marry, which they do. Atherton is good enough a writer to keep the romance between North and Betty from becoming sordid (Betty's having a very sensible and trusting mother helps greatly). Some scenes are a bit hard to swallow, as, for instance, the life-like dream North has where he encounters Alexander Hamilton and they debate the fate of the republic. But Atherton also has some very clever things to say about the workings of Congress: how Senators are endlessly \\"tormented by lobbyists\\" and tempted by bribes is particularly apt. Her dialogue is her strong suit, and the novel as a whole is not bad at all."},{"Title":"Growing Fruit in the Upper Midwest","review":"Home and commercial growers in the Upper Midwest (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the Dakotas) face major challenges in getting steady crops of quality fruit. Tree fruits, berries, and the like are better adapted to warmer areas. Most commercially available cultivars are not well adapted to the cold climate in and around Minnesota.In this volume, Gordon combines the history of fruit growing in the area, basics of culture, and hardiness history of major varieties. This last piece of information is not available in any other source I have seen and by itself is worth more than the purchase price of the book to anyone contemplating a new planting of fruit trees, vines, or bushes.Hardiness information is broken down by regions within each state, providing a more detailed look at the winter survival characteristics than can be gained by USDA hardiness zones alone.In addition, Gordon provides some interesting historical ancedotes and cultural information. The cultural recommendations are the same as for other parts of the country, by and large, but the information is useful to the beginner."},{"Title":"Growing Fruit in the Upper Midwest","review":"This is a horrible little book that borrows material liberally from Cooperative Extension bulletins from Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

I especially loved the way that she managed to work a great deal of history and basic information in without making it seem that way. For those who haven't read it, this is the story of a trip that the author and her daughter make through Madagascar. It is funny, interesting, and fun to read. I especially appreciated the way that Murphy generally managed to avoid the condescending view of people in Third World countries that becomes so obnoxious after awhile. I also appreciated the way that she was honest about mistakes that she made and seemed quite able to laugh at her own errors. Much of the information seems accurate as well; when I was most of the way through the book I read most of another book giving a basic overview of Madagascar, its history, culture, and etc. and the majority of it fit very well with what Murphy discribes here (the differences could probably all be explained by the fact that this other book is several years newer).

The author is a veteran Irish travel writer who takes her teenage daughter on a hiking trip across Madagascar. This book is simply loaded with all kinds of interesting history and lore. Excellent travel writing, bibliography, map, loved it."},{"Title":"Muddling Through Madagascar (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"The first book that I read by the very peripatetic Dervla Murphy wasIn Ethiopia with a Mule. It is an account of her 1000-mile trip across the highlands of Ethiopia, in 1967, solo, save for the mule which carried her belonging. For many of us, that would have been THE impressive idiosyncratic achievement of a lifetime. Not so for Ms. Murphy, who sees an obscure place on the globe, and has to go there, and savor it, usually via unconventional means. I gave the Ethiopia book only a 4-star review, since I was annoyed that throughout the long journey she was incapable of loading her own mule, and always had to rely on the \\"kindness of strangers.\\" That flaw in her travel mode was not present in this book... in fact, she seemed to \\"double down\\" in terms of challenges... at the age of 51, in 1983, instead of being accompanied by a mule, it was her (beloved) 14 year old daughter! Ah, that all teenagers might have such an experience.Just the first chapter, an excellent history of the island, is worth the purchase price. It was the largest fertile area of the world that was uninhabited until the arrival of Malayo-Polynesian groups around 900 AD. Various African groups came thereafter. Then the Portuguese showed up in 1500, and then the English and the French showed tepid interest for a few centuries. Only well into the 19th century did the London Missionary Society get serious in sending missionaries, who are often the advance wave of colonists, as all too many colonized have learned. In 1896 Madagascar officially became a French colony, which was its status until independence in 1960. The human settlement and interactions there have been historically unique, but what truly sets the island off, in terms of uniqueness, is its flora and fauna, with numerous species found only there, and nowhere else in the world.Murphy wrangled a visa, and an all-important \\"permission letter\\" of the \\"to whom it may concern\\" variety from the embassy in Paris. She and her daughter flew there the cheap way - via Aeroflot and Moscow, arriving in the capital, Antananarivo, mercifully called \\"Tana.\\" The newly independent government's push for autarky means that few things work well; and many things don't work at all. Imports are virtually non-existent. And in particular, for a traveler, the roads are abysmal; in some cases they are passable only on foot. And for sure, the buses don't run on that very alien concept: \\"time.\\" Rather, they run when they are full... and don't break down.In what seemed to be a couple of months, they covered a large part of the southern two-thirds of the island. The central highlands are the most populous, and the town of Antsirabe (the \\"Vichy,\\" that is, the spas and mineral springs, of Madagascar) seems to be the most viable and enjoyable. They went to the western coastal town of Tulear, but stopped to see the lemurs on the way, in the Parc National d'Isalo. Due to the lack of accommodation, they camped there. They checked the guest book, and there was only one page of names spanning a decade. (I checked on the internet, and there is now a very nice looking lodge there.) One of the \\"gutsy\\" (or crazy?) things they did was camp in the wild on several occasions. From Tulear they had another epic journey by vehicle, spanning days, across the southern part of the island, to Fort Dauphin. And then it was back to Tana, and beyond to the coast, with broken vehicles along the way, and a fairly vigorous hike at the end.Murphy is a keen observer of all, and has strong descriptive powers. She also carries a fair load of erudition, and weaves it into her account. The people, though poor, and in a daily struggle for so much that the \\"civilized\\" west takes for granted, seem to be happier, and certainly kinder to the stranger that she and her daughter are. Yet, and Murphy specifically makes this point, the island is no Rousseau fantasy. There is evil and unhappiness there also.She has been criticized for being too \\"new age.\\" I didn't see that in particular, but I did feel she was a bit reckless in the treatment of her own health, particularly after being cut with a knife. In terms of her observations, I've marked many a passage, one of the best being: \\"The distortion of human relationships, rather than the building of Holiday Inns or the sprouting of souvenir stalls, is the single most damaging consequence of Third World tourism.\\" Murphy also quoted extensively from Dr. Alison Jolly's naturalist workA World Like Our Own: Man and Nature in Madagascar, which is a book I've owned for 30 years, and have yet to read. Murphy's push will finally remedy that deficiency. Overall, 5-stars."},{"Title":"Muddling Through Madagascar (Transaction Large Print Books)","review":"Even though this book was written a number of years ago much is the same, especially the roads in the south. Impossible to describe, but Ms. Murphy does a great job. She also describes the lovely kind people.

I have yet to encountetr an author who can produce such consistent work. If you have liked any book in the Chung Kuo series, you'll love this one."},{"Title":"The Broken Wheel: A Chung Kuo Novel","review":"This second novel is as rich as the first. Wingrove is truly a sci-fi force. The characters are vividly portrayed, both good and evil, and the complex plots and subplots are a true delight for me, a fan of this genre. Wingrove seems to be able to keep a story alive while not causing the reader to lapse into incredulity. Devore is up to his usual tricks, with a few powerful allies, and the members of the T'ang are slowly losing power as the Seven is struck by assassinations and dissent. Events in this novel -- the allegiances that are forged and the ties that are broken -- will surprise some. I can see where some people might be intimidated by this series because of its scope and length but to anyone who is looking for a mixture of superior, intelligent science fiction with a soap-operatic yet action-oriented feel, then this series fits the bill...bar none. In addition, there is a welcome emergence of very strong female characters in this novel that continues into the third novel of the series. Be forewarned, however; the sheer number of characters can be frustrating if you haven't read Chung Kuo first."},{"Title":"The Broken Wheel: A Chung Kuo Novel","review":"Broken Wheel continues with the spellbinding quality of its predecessor. As if you actually are in The Great City yourself! What I do find strange, however are the passages in the Domain and frankly I skipped all the parts in which Ben Shepherd had sex with his own sister.Also certain historical facts seem a little bit &quot;off the wall&quot;.For instance, there's an edict that controls technological development, yet when it comes to technology needed for the story line, it seems that &quot;any goes&quot;(when it comes to GenSyn-Hoes). Other than that it is even more exciting than The Middle Kingdom since it promises the wildest changes to come to the imaginary society of City Earth or Chung Kuo.Can't wait to read the sequals!!"},{"Title":"The Broken Wheel: A Chung Kuo Novel","review":"Another example of psycho-fi - characterized by unpleasant characters, ruthless power plays and rampant paranoia. Superior practicioners of this flavor of sci-fi include Frank Herbert and CJ Cherryh. Wingrove has penned a compelling saga weakened by a lack of endearing characters - at least any that live very long. Maybe that's just an honest reflection of the rather vicious society he creates - where good guys die young (and painfully) while slavery, racism, brutality, incest, pedophilia, treachery, and murder abound. If, like me, you prefer stories that give you someone to identify with, this one's going to be tough going. And yet it's intriguing - and I'm still reading."},{"Title":"The Broken Wheel: A Chung Kuo Novel","review":"When I first read the first novel in this series about 15 years ago, I was mezmorized by the images that this talented novelist's descriptions and imagination invoked. I reread it a couple of months ago and found it just as compellingly written, but the rampant sexual cruelty (mutilation as a sexual release, derived from rape)and perversion (pedophiles rejoice! Underage children perform your twisted wishes here) planted very unpleasent images in my mind, and did nothing to advance the main story. I labored on, because the bigger picture aspects of the book were so compelling.This series began as a political thriller in which a group of powerful outsiders were organizing to overthrow a corrupt, stultifying, racist oligarchy. The vast majority of humanity was trapped in a class system that ranged from servitude to subhuman. The outsiders hoped to completely upend the social order and destroy the ruling class. This was the basic theme of the first book and it seemed to be continuing in the second. But when I was lead into another of the author's twisted detours in which a highly intelligent, high functioning and well brought up brother and sister (underage; of course) decide to take their relationship to new heights (graphically depicted by the author) it was time for me to move on.To bad. This was a good story. We did not need the sexual torture, pedophilial sexual slavery, incestuous relations, gang rape of a mother in front of her child.....I'm quite certain that I'm forgetting some nasty stuff as well.Perhaps after a little couch time, the author may want to give it another go."},{"Title":"The Broken Wheel: A Chung Kuo Novel","review":"This book provides a great illustration of the fact that ownership of another human being dehumanizes everyone concerned. There's a scene where a young newlywed prince--a nice guy for the most part--is worried about the welfare of the two young maids he owned during early adolescence. So he sends an emmisary to check on them. The two girls tell the emmisary that they're lonely for the prince and miss him badly. You see, during the previous volume, &quot;The Middle Kingdom&quot;, they had &quot;initiated him into manhood&quot;, quite affectionately explaining to him; &quot;That's what we're here for&quot;. In the process, they both fell in love with him. Neither girl (they're sisters) is jealous of the other. They don't even resent his new bride--the way they see it, they had both played a part in a necessary rite of passage for the kid. In this book, he admits to himself that the reason he cares about their welfare is that he loves them as well. What's the best thing he can do for them? He plans to give them their freedom, as well as a substantial dowry. They can't have him, but they'll never be anyone's property again. That's what's so cruddy about slavery--when master and slave care for each other as people, but all that &quot;the system&quot; depicted in this story allows is a &quot;semi-requited&quot; relationship. I felt so sorry for all three of these young people. It's too much of a temptation to chalk it all up to the alleged Oriental &quot;lower respect for human dignity&quot; and forget that we in the West have our share of it in our history. There's a lesson in this for HUMANITY, period. However human society &quot;advances&quot; or &quot;regresses&quot; in our future, we damn sure don't want to go back to something like that."},{"Title":"The Broken Wheel: A Chung Kuo Novel","review":"That's the best way I can think of to describe it (even if Shogun is about Japan, not China).

So, Price Hal becomes King Henry V and this leads to the next play of that name.The wonderful Falstaff is also on glorious display. This is also the play with the famous tavern scene (Act II, Scene IV) that can be read endlessly with new enjoyment.Everyone has his or her own take on Falstaff and his treatment at the hands of Henry V, but I dislike it even though I understand it. Prince Hal and his transformation into Henry V is not someone I admire a lot. Nor is Falstaff's manner of living, but his wit is so sharp and his intelligence so vast that it is easy to still delight in him.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the &quot;Complete Plays&quot; you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much! Plus, the individual editions are easier to read from and handier to carry around."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"First off, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed Part I and absolutely adored Henry V. Having said that, I found Part II to be enjoyable, yet perhaps leaving something to be desired - like more action. Falstaff and Prince Hal both come off as somewhat disingenuous and calculating Machiavellian individuals. Disappointingly, Falstaff speaks poorly of Prince Hal while unwittingly in his midst. Conversely, The Prince of Wales prematurely takes the crown before his King Henry IV's death as well as disassociating himself with Falstaff after he is crowned King. These instances, along with others throughout the play, show the self-serving tendencies of both characters.However, we can proudly witness the maturation of the young King from wild & dissolute young Prince Hal into one of the most revered monarchs in English history, King Henry V. Part II remains an intriguing play due to its paradoxical nature, yet unfortunately rarely acted out today. Now that I have read Henry IV(I&II;) for the first time, I gladly move on to one of my personal favorites, Henry V. I recommend both parts(Folger editions) for all Shakespeare enthusiasts - they have given me greater insight into the young Henry V - when he was more concerned with downing a pint of ale rather than downing the French at Agincourt.2 Magnificent Quotes from Henry IV Part II -\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\\" - King Henry IV\\"He hath eaten me out of house and home.\\" - Mistress Quickly"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Believe it or not, Shakespeare's funniest play will be found in the Histories section of your Complete Works. That's not to say this is a comedy, but the group of characters gathering at the tavern represent the Bard's supreme comic achievement. Falstaff and the future King Henry V will have you laughing out loud. However, in the serious main plot, which picks up from the previous play, Richard II, the Percys are leading a rebellion against the usurping King Henry IV. The rebellion continues into the next play, but the Battle of Shrewbury marks an important point in Henry's reign, and serves as a fitting end to Henry IV Part 1. The play is a complete unity unto itself, but I recommend you read the complete series (Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, Henry V) in order to get the most out a very exciting and entertaining cycle. I usually recommend the Arden editions, but in this case the Oxford is superior. David Bevington is clearly one of the top editors in the field, and his notes help smooth over the rough spots in the text, especially the comic scenes which really need to be seen or heard to be fully appreciated. In that respect the Arkangel Audio version of the play is excellent."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"One of the more influential Shakespearean histories. Because of the inspiration it provides for any latter work involving a young male with 'daddy issues' (like \\"The Lion King\\") this play has had enduring power.The Prince of Wales, Hal, son of King Henry the IV is being thrust into power as his father dies. Conspiracies and the Crusades, a hysterical hostess and Falstaff, and the elevation of profanity to a high and refined art all add character to this play. I would argue that it is almost as much comedy as history.The most moving aspect of the play is Prince Hal understanding the reality that his father's death is thrusting upon him. From trying on the crown as his father lies unconscious but not dead to disavowing the rogues he had been a delinquent with, his growth is unmistakable.A very moving play and one of the more rewarding histories.E.M.

Hotspur has allied himself with several principal figures including his uncle the Earl of Worcester, his brother-in-law Mortimer the Earl of March, Lord Douglas the Scot, and Owen Glendower, a Welsh chieftain with a vivid mystical imagination -- he is so egotistical that he insists an earthquake that occurred the day of his birth was a divine proclamation of his importance -- and a desire to usurp all of Wales from the king.While he is preparing for war against the rebels, Henry IV laments that his own son Henry (Hal), the Prince of Wales, is a shameful libertine living the high life in London and consorting with a gang of scurrilous miscreants. Indeed, Prince Hal's idea of fun is robbing people, and his best friend and accomplice in this activity is Sir John Falstaff, who turns out to be not Hal's peer but a middle-aged man. In a character transformation of an abruptness that can only be described as magical, Hal becomes a serious young man determined loyally to defend his father's kingship from Hotspur's assault after he receives an earnest lecture from his father about the dangers of acting irresponsibly as a public figure.Not enough can be said about Falstaff, who is undoubtedly one of the most richly realized characters in literature. He is fat, lazy, cowardly, yet boastful, but not in the same way Owen Glendower is -- Owen really believes what he says; Falstaff is just trying to make himself look better than he actually is, but fools nobody because he prevaricates and embellishes without bothering to remember his previous lies for the sake of consistency. You probably know somebody like this in real life -- especially if you're ten years old. Falstaff's piquancy, in fact, so outweighs the stature of the other characters that his absence is sorely felt in the scenes in which he does not appear.Most of all, Part One of \\"Henry IV\\" is a play of contrasts personified by Prince Hal and Hotspur, who incidentally is also named Henry. In their confrontation on the battlefield, it seems unlikely that Hal, who wasted many of his best days living as a rake, could conquer a seasoned warrior like Hotspur in a swordfight. But there wouldn't be much of a tale to tell if not to show Hal triumphing after his resolution to change his weak habits, and the play ends with the conviction that, despite his past mistakes, he would make a noble king himself."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"This is about Folger Shakespeare Library.

There's no question that Shakespeare fully appreciates military valor. The last play in the four part cycle, Henry V, testifies to this, not least with the famous \\"Once more into the breach\\" and \\"Band of brothers\\" speeches.But Shakespeare's greatest literary creation is perhaps the lovable rogue Falstaff. Falstaff is a Shakespearean fool, an anti-hero, a lovable villain. He voices opinions that no one would dare tell others. He can do this because he is a fool and isn't taken seriously by the king and princes above him. But audiences listen approvingly to his wisdom, and Falstaff thinks honor is for losers.\\"Thou owest God a death\\" says his friend Prince Hal as he leaves.\\"'Tis not due yet\\" says Falstaff left alone with the audience. \\"I would be loath to pay him before his day. What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honor pricks me on. Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on? How then? Can honor set a leg? No. Or an arm? No. Honor hath no skill in surgery then? No. What is honor? A word. What is that word honor? Air - a trim reckoning! Who hath it? He that died on Wednesday. Doth he feel it? No. Doth he hear it? No.\\"King Henry IV faces a revolution led by Henry Percy known as Hotspur. There's no question that Hotspur is noble, valorous, courageous and of course honorable. Henry IV wishes that this Henry in fact were is own son, rather then the rakish prince also called Henry. This Henry Hotspur is full of fire and verve. Yet as honorable as he is, he fights on the wrong side and dies. There lies honor, vindicating Falstaff.Certainly Hotspur fights for a cause: he believes Henry IV to have usurped the crown, but he values martial honor above all, even above the deep love he feels for his wife. If a war serves a greater purpose, then the men who fight deserve our esteem, gratitude and respect. Honor is honorable. But if a man fights only for honor as an end in itself, he is a fool and in a just ordered world, he will lose.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"This edition offers a strongly theatrical perspective on the origins of The First Part of King Henry IV and the history of its interpretation. In their introduction the editors clarify the play's surprising, decentralized dramatic structure, questioning the recent assumption that the drama focuses on the education of Prince Hal. They call attention to the effects of civil war on a broad range of relationships. Falstaff's unpredictable vitality is explored, together with important contemporary values of honor, friendship, festivity and reformation. (by Abe)Oxford World Classics are sturdy and beautifully laid out. I love my hard copy of this classic. Kbooks says: \\"During Shakespeare's lifetime, Henry IV was his most popular play.

Readers will also find detailed commentary on individual words and phrases, and selections from Shakespeare's sources."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"In the previous installment of Shakespeare's \\"Henriad\\", \\"Henry IV Part 1\\", we waited to see if Prince Hal would shake the corrupting influence of Falstaff and prove worthy of the throne. In \\"Part 2\\" we get to chew our spinach twice. Hal still stands at the same crossroads, Falstaff still tugging at his ankles.For me, that's the weakest element of \\"Henry IV Part 2\\", the warmed-over central plot. What makes \\"Part 2\\" terrific anyway is just about everything else. Structurally, \\"Part 2\\" is shambolic compared to \\"Part 1,\\" almost two stories entirely with Hal and Falstaff brought together only once, briefly, before the end. But individual scenes of the play shine with first-class Shakespearean luster, and \\"Part 2\\"'s thematic quality is singularly complicated in a way that confuses initially but rewards a second reading.Hal is still the prince, and still in poor odor with his father despite his heroics in \\"Part 1.\\" He must find his own way to glory while a civil war rages. Meanwhile, Falstaff schemes to take advantage of both the war and his friends for the sake of filling his gut.In the idiosyncratic way of this play, we begin with neither player onstage, but rather \\"Rumor, painted full of tongues\\", who sets up an opening scene featuring the rebel Earl of Northumberland, who as it turns out will play no major role in the proceedings and will leave in Act 2. It's like Shakespeare is playing with our expectations. Then he does the same to the characters. Time and again, we will see them tripped up by \\"smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs.\\"Only Hal seems immune with his simple maxim: \\"Let the end try the man.\\"While Shakespeare worked hard to keep Hal at the center of things in \\"Part 1,\\" the character doesn't seem as well-integrated into the story here. The rebellion is dealt with this time without Hal taking an active part, or even being on stage. Falstaff carries the narrative bulk of the play almost entirely on his wide shoulders, his mischief providing amusing counterpoint to the cold-blooded realpolitik around him.Falstaff is helped this time by a supporting cast all his own, including slatternly Doll Tearsheet and Mistress Quickly, the latter of whom introduces the phrase: \\"Do me, do me, do me\\" to the lexicon of Shakespearean quotation. The humor is more ribald here than it was in \\"Part 1\\", and more morbid, too. The first Falstaff joke is that he had his urine tested and the urine is found to be in better shape than its owner.These episodes, and another where King Henry IV soliloquizes about his lack of sleep (\\"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown\\"), are wonderful enough when read in isolation, enough to not mind that these story pieces never quite come together. The play's two masterstrokes both involve sharp reverses from what we have been led to expect, and though I feel the first is set up much better, they both leave an imprint on you while reading and line up with the message of \\"smooth comforts false\\" we were given at the start.A bridge between two better plays, \\"Henry IV Part 2\\" has its own special qualities and is very much worth reading - so long as you don't read it out of order."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" was one of Shakespeare's greatest successes in his lifetime, and has remained pre-eminently popular to this day. But each century has had its own version of what it is about.For Elizabethans, it was Falstaff and his merry pranks. For the 18th century, it was Hotspur and his proud nobility. More recently, the pendulum swung back to Falstaff, but this time as a tragic exponent of relativistic realism, a clown who understands his place as cosmic punchline.But as David Bevington points out in his introduction to my Bantam edition, the real central figure is the guy who encapsulates the best of both Falstaff and Hotspur, young Prince Hal. In \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\", he is the dissolute heir to the throne, living the fast life of drink and crime (petty and otherwise) with the dubious aid of his pal Falstaff, a fat coward who lives only to fill his purse and gut. Can Hal break out of his seeming tailspin and aid his father, the title character Henry IV, before the king loses his throne in a civil war?Bevington's point is Hal represents the true center of this play, the character for whom Hotspur and Falstaff represent opposite ends of an ideal monarch. Not for Hal the opportunistic legacy of his grasping father, \\"this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke\\" as Hotspur calls him, not without cause, early in the play. Hal must be his own self-made man, pulled from disparate parts, and \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" shows him at the start of his rather Machiavellian journey.\\"So when this loose behavior I throw off/And pay the debt I never promised/...By so much shall I falsify men's hopes,\\" he declares, less as a cunning rogue a la Shakespeare's Richard III and more as a cagey modern-day spin-doctor aware of how unsteadily his father's kingdom rests.Philosophy aside, \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is a worthwhile reading experience because it is packed with so much fun. You have low comedy, battles, court intrigue, and fast-flowing dialogue with sharp twists and turns. \\"I can call spirits from the vasty deep!\\" brags the mystical Welsh rebel Glendower, to which Hotspur replies: \\"Why, so can I, or so can any man. But will they come when you do call for them?\\"Others seem more inclined these days to gravitate to Falstaff. I enjoy Falstaff's comedy, and his undeniable relativism sets him up as an Elizabethan figure more grounded in the 21st century than the 16th (\\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" is set in the early 1400s, but was first produced around 1597), but as a personality he's about as callous as they come, at one point collecting a bunch of wretches to die in war so he can collect money from others who would have gone in their stead. Hal actually seems more attracted to Hotspur, the figure I find more compelling. Hotspur's an idealist, but entirely too mule-headed for serious statescraft. He's undone not so much by his enemies but his allies, including his shifting uncle and irresolute father.Hal here combines Hotspur's sense of a higher mission with Falstaff's pragmatic commonness to launch himself as a political man. \\"I'll so offend to make offense a skill/Redeeming time when men least think I will\\", he says early on. It's ironic how much more at ease Prince Hal would be in our era, running for office, than in his own, where the crown, if not attendant legitimacy, could be inherited. This is one of many things that makes \\"Henry IV Pt. 1\\" such a timeless pleasure."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing.

Royalty is allowed moments of glory: Henry IV in his berating of Hal and Hal in his response and in his speech banishing Falstaff. Hal is given to some complex emotions when he picks up the crown lying next to his dying father. Northumberland surprises with a sudden spark, punning \\"Hotspur, Coldspur?\\" at the news that his son may be dead.Falstaff continues to be a magician creating reality from words. (This may be the main reason he is so fun to be around). Enigmatically, this corrupt liar, coward and a thief through and through manages to remain appealing. By contrast, our opinion of John of Lancaster is immediately sunk with the singular unseemly scene in which he cons the rebels.Of course, Falstaff is not as much a black magician as Richard III, who in a course of one speech, convinced Lady Ann, whose husband he killed, to be romantically interested in him. Falstaff's magic is not as sinister, but in it he is similarly effective, as when in a course of a short conversation, he convinces the Hostess, who is asking him to repay what he owes her, to lend him more.His prose does not make him as elegantly spoken as some better versed Shakespearean characters, but it is nicely of a piece with his remarkable internal freedom.Falstaff is fascinating: deeply flawed, he is appealing well beyond his deserves.

In 1 \\"Henry IV,\\" King Henry IV stopped the rebellion by Hotspur, Worcestor, and Vernon. But his enemy Northumberland remained a threat. This brings us to the 2 \\"Henry IV.\\"Despite the title, the real star of this play is Falstaff. One minor complaint I have is that while Falstaff could probably handle the play, some of his scenes do get too drawn out. Moving on, Northumberland reappears, and he is of course sad over the death of his son Hotspur. (Slain by Prince Henry in 1 \\"Henry IV.\\") We also meet the Arch Bishop of York who becomes an enemy of Henry IV. The Arch Bishop delivers a striking passage that emphasizes that the past and the future always seem better than the present.In Act 2, we quickly learn that Falstaff has built up some debts and he is neglecting his duties to the king. (Big surprise!) Prince Henry is a back stage player for the early part of the play, but rather than being close to Falstaff (as he was in Part 1), he bitterly rebukes Falstaff for his lifestyle. Also, Prince Henry does express concern over his father's failing health. But he is afraid he will be thought of as a hypocrite if he shows it.Interestingly, a woman named Doll begins to find Falstaff attractive. King Henry IV does not enter until 3.1, and we can see that the rebellions have taken their toll on him. He can only talk of the tribulations of royalty. It is even possible that he feels he deserves these sorrow and afflictions for stealing the crown from Richard II. (Richard II's consolation prize.)Later, Falstaff gathers his men together in a well drawn comical scene. Westmoreland and Henry IV's son Lancaster defeat the rebellion of the Arch Bishop of York, Mowbray, and Hastings in a less than honorable way. But this is not an invention of Shakespeare's. It did happen.In 4.3, Coleville surrenders to our favorite rogue Falstaff. It is comical when Falstaff comments that Lancaster is so uptight because he doesn't drink. But the sad part of the play returns soon enough.Henry IV's health fails, and he can not enjoy his victory. (This does constitute a small consolation prize for Richard II.) Some people dislike Henry V for banishing Falstaff, but Henry V had little choice. The actions of Falstaff (as comical and lovable as he is) are downright criminal. Though, Shakespeare promises us that he will return in another play.

This play is clearly the dramatization of a struggle for a kingdom, but it is equally the story of Hal's wild and reckless youthful adventures with Falstaff and other disreputable companions.Shakespeare did not write his plays about English kings in chronological order, but these plays do have a historical unity. It is helpful (but not essential) to read the tetralogy Richard II, Henry IV Part 1 and 2, and Henry V in chronological order. Whatever route you take, I highly recommend buying a companion copy of Peter Saccio's &quot;Shakespeare's English Kings&quot;, an engaging look at how Shakespeare revised history to achieve dramatic effect.A wide selection of Henry IV editions are available, including older editions in used bookstores. I am familiar with a few and have personal favorites:The New Folger Library Shakespeare is my first choice among the inexpensive editions of Henry IV. &quot;New&quot; replaces the prior version in use for 35 years. It uses &quot;facing page&quot; format with scene summaries, explanations for rare and archaic words and expressions, and Elizabethan drawings located on the left page; the Henry IV text is on the right. I particularly liked the section on &quot;Reading Shakespeare's Language in Henry IV&quot; and Alexander Legget's literary analysis (save this until you have read the play). The fascinating article &quot;Historical Background: Sir John Falstaff and Sir John Oldcastle&quot; adds a religious dimension to the play that I had not previously noted.The Bedford Shakespeare Series provides an excellent study text (edited by Barbara Hodgdon) titled &quot;The First Part of King Henry the Fourth&quot;. It is a little more expensive, is about 400 pages, and provides a broad range of source and context documentation. It would be excellent for an upper level course in Shakespeare. The context documentation is fascinating and informative; it ranges from the Holinshed Chronicles to Elizabethan writing on Civic Order to detailed cultural studies of London's diverse populous. Other chapters address the OldCastle controversy and the &quot;Education of a Prince&quot;.I also like the Norton Critical edition (edited by James Sanderson), &quot;Henry the Fourth, Part 1&quot;, particularly for its extensive collection of literary criticism. The essays are divided into two parts: 1) the theme, characters, structure, and style of the play and 2) a wide variety of interpretation directed toward that roguish character, Sir John Falstaff."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"When rating Shakespeare, I am comparing it to other Shakespeare. Otherwise, the consistent \\"5 stars\\" wouldn't tell you much. So when I rate this book five stars, I'm saying it's one of the best of the best.As a matter of fact, it isn't unusual for Shakespeare's \\"histories\\" to be more interesting to the modern reader than either his comedies or his tragedies; they fit the modern style that doesn't insist that comedies must have everything work out well in the end, or that tragedies must be deadly serious with everyone dying at the end, as was the convention in Shakespeare's time. Thus, this book has a serious plot, real drama, and blood and destruction, yet still has many extremely funny scenes. And as Shakespearean plays go, it's a fairly easy read, although in places the footnotes are still neccessary. The only caveat I will make is that one needs to remember not to consider Shakespeare's histories particularly historical; they have about as much historical accuracy as the Disney version of Pocahontas. Treat them as excellent stories based (very) loosely on history, and you'll do fine.It's a real shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare was writing that his plays are no longer accessable to the masses, because that's who Shakespeare was writing for. Granted, there is enough seriousness to satisfy the intelligensia, but there is generally enough action and bawdy humor to satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they could understand it, and this book is no exception. Unfortunately, once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. I don't think I'll hold my breath waiting."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; shows King Henry IV dealing with complex problems: England is in the midst of civil unrest, as the Percy family, angered by their treatment after unwittingly helping Henry IV ascend to the throne, threatens to depose the monarch. At home, Henry IV is despairing over the development of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Prince Henry consorts with thieves, rogues, and scoundrels - his scandalous personal relationships seem to threaten the King's peace of mind more than the state of his kingdom.Aside from these larger concerns that frame the play, &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; deals more with Prince Henry than it does with the monarch of the title. Throughout the play, Prince Henry is seen more amongst the rabble commoners than attending to matters of state. He is guided in his licentiousness by the enormously funny (pun intended) Sir John Falstaff, whose schemes and drunkenness are more innocent and endearing in Part I than they become in Part II.Falstaff's reckless and conceited behaviour casts a shadow over the entire play, symbolic as it is of Prince Henry's moral dilemma and of the precarious state of the nation. Falstaff instantly calls to mind Kenneth Grahame's magnificent Mr. Toad from &quot;The Wind in the Willows,&quot; and is Toad's direct literary forefather. Falstaff is the most interesting and dynamic figure in &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; and certainly the most memorable character in the play.Prince Henry discovers that his responsibilities outweigh his fondness for Spanish wine, and is called to lead the King's army against that of the arrogant 'Hotspur' Percy, himself a rising political force. Their confrontation, brilliantly scripted and enacted, is central to Shakespeare's entire Lancaster-York saga, and should be read closely and with special attention.Of the two parts of &quot;Henry IV,&quot; Part I is by far the best and most flawlessly executed. The King's problems provide an adequate backdrop for the development of Prince Henry; 'Hotspur' is an excellent antagonist (with the whole Percy family offering a great contrast with that of the King); and Falstaff performs his role without dominating the play, as he tends to in Part II. Shakespeare does not need my praise or endorsement, but his &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; blows me away. It is absolutely fantastic."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Henry IV remains one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, even though the tragedies and comedies get far more attention and seeming appreciation than do the histories. As an English major, I examined Henry's (Hal's) character, and I focused on his development from a somewhat foolhardy young man into a self-assured, even manipulative prince. It is hard to say which of these Hal truly is, or if he is a little bit of both.At the beginning of the play, Hal spends his free time cavorting around with his friend Falstaff (who provides all of the laughs in the play and is cited as one of the best comic characters in all literature). In the first act we already see hints in Hal's sololiquy that he may not be as carefree as we are led to believe, and that he might betray friends like Falstaff to be the prince that he is expected to be. Read on in &quot;Henry V&quot; to see just how much of a polished politician Hal becomes--his battle cries and his &quot;once more unto the breech, dear friends&quot; is masterful in its persuasiveness and ability to induce his countrymen to fight.Hotspur serves as a nice counterpoint to Hal in &quot;Henry IV.&quot; Hotspur is the hothead and Hal makes his decisions calmly and rationally. This almost inhuman rationality comes into play again in &quot;Henry V&quot; and makes you long for the seemingly carefree Hal.All in all, &quot;Henry IV&quot; is a great read and quite an interesting character study--I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"To get as much as you can out of this play, you MUST read &quot;Richard II&quot; first. Shakespeare deserves much credit for making the villain in &quot;Richard II&quot; (King Henry IV) the hero in this play. It is in this play that King Henry IV realizes political gratitude is short lived and Richard's prediction of Henry IV's trials comes true. Not only does King Henry IV realize that his seizing the crown came with consequences. but he also has to deal with his riotous son (the eventual Henry V). 3.2, where King Henry IV confronts his undisciplined son is quite memorable. Besides all this, Shakespeare introduces us to his comical Falstaff. So we have an interesting turn of events, dramatic confrontations, scenes of war, and comical touches. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Of all Shakespeare's histories, Henry IV, part I is the best. It is the first of three plays that examines the ascension of the great King Henry V. Here, we see a young Prince Hal as a troublemaker and a &quot;royal pain&quot; (pun intended), who hangs out in taverns with drunkards and derelicts. But we also see a young man who realizes his destiny and knows that the time will come when he will have to be a strong king for England's sake. The play is more than just one person's rise. It examines English society in atime of great instability and civil strife. It examines the role of family (fathers and sons, brothers, and uncles and nephews). This play is a reflection of Shakespeare at his finest and everyone should read at least this play, whether or not they love Shakespeare or not. It is worth the read. (and it is a rather simple read, too.)"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them. He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character. These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories. There are more comedic parts in them for one thing. The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V). We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development. He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible. King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler. He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II. In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death. The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry. The play leads us to \\"King Henry V\\". Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader. Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V. It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Having just completed Henry IV Part I, I must say that I came away delighted and impressed with Shakespeare's genius once again. Shakespeare's ability to intertwine the arduous dichotomy of the impcomparable comedy of Falstaff and the meaningful history of Henry IV, Prince Hal, & Hotspur is impressive to say the least. It comes as no surprise that this was one of Shakespeare's most popularly staged plays during his day and enjoyed an unusually long stage run.Falstaff is undoubtedly the most infamously famous literary comic character in the history of English literature. The scenes of him being robbed by Prince Hal, feigning his death, stabbing the already deceased Hotspur in the leg while claiming victory, and his employment of beggars as his foot soldiers galvanize the comic aspect of the play and make for a hilarious & farcical sublot. Interestingly, in the bar in Eastcheap, Prince Hal alludes to his future persecution of Falstaff when he is crowned king.I strongly recommend Henry IV Part I to all Shakespeare aficionados seeing as I deem it in the top five of all Shakespeare's works along with Hamlet, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, & Henry V. Now on to Part II. Adieu.\\"The better part of valor is discretion.\\" - Falstaff"},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"Shakespeare's &quot;Henry IV Part II&quot; concerns the triumphant decline of King Henry IV, and the ascension of his son, Henry, Prince of Wales, to the throne as King Henry V. As in &quot;Henry IV Part I,&quot; Part II's main action concerns the attempts of the King to suppress civil strife, which is manifested once again in threatened rebellion. In &quot;Henry IV Part II,&quot; the rebels are led by Scroop, the Archbishop of York, the most powerful religious figure in England. The Archbishop's involvement &quot;turns insurrection to religion,&quot; thereby hoping to gain popular support and enlistment in the army against Henry IV.Henry, Prince of Wales, as the next in line to the throne, is expected to take a hard line against these threats, and lead the charge against the rebel forces. However, as in Part I, Prince Henry is nervous, as a young man will be, about accepting responsibility for himself, much less for an entire nation. A frivolous youth, he associates with the common folk in bars and taverns, led in his debaucheries by the notoriously comic Sir John Falstaff. The dichotomy between Prince Henry's father figures, the frail, but courageous King Henry IV and the robust, but cowardly Falstaff sets up the scope of the choice Prince Henry must make. His choice, he comes to realize, will affect the course of his country.The forces mount as the play moves forward - the King's army is ordered, well-equipped, and led by formidable generals - the Archbishop's army is made up largely of untrained citizens. The meeting of the armies' leaders in the Gaultree Forest of Yorkshire is the emotional and tactical climax of the play, and handled with dramatic precision by Shakespeare.The growth of Prince Henry, the shaping of his mind, his relationships with his noble father and brothers, as well as those with his low, vulgar drinking buddies, forms the focus of &quot;Henry IV Part II.&quot; Through five deceptively simple acts, Shakespeare illustrates the birth of a man and a king, and points the way to domestic peace. This is a play I enjoyed very much indeed, and would recommend reading alongside &quot;Henry IV Part I&quot; for maximum effect."},{"Title":"The first part of King Henry the Fourth (The \\"Pocket Falstaff\\" edition of Shakespeare's complete works)","review":"This is the play where the Percy rebellion begins and centers around the Achilles-like Hotspur. Eventually, Hotspur (Henry Percy) and Prince Hal (Henry Monmouth - later Henry V) battle in single combat.We also get to see the contrast between these young men in temperament and character. King Henry wishes his son were more like Hotspur. Prince Hal realizes his own weaknesses and seems to try to assure himself (and us) that when the time comes he will change and all his youthful foolishness will be forgotten. Wouldn't that be a luxury we wish we could all have afforded when we were young?Of course, Prince Hal's guide through the world of the cutpurse and highwayman is the Lord of Misrule, the incomparable Falstaff. His wit and gut are featured in full. When Prince Hal and Poins double-cross Falstaff & company, the follow on scenes are funny, but full of consequence even into the next play.But, you certainly don't need me to tell you anything about Shakespeare. Like millions of other folks, I am in love with the writing. However, as all of us who read Shakespeare know, it isn't a simple issue. Most of us need help in understanding the text. There are many plays on words, many words no longer current in English and, besides, Shakespeare's vocabulary is richer than almost everyone else's who ever lived. There is also the issue of historical context, and the variations of text since the plays were never published in their author's lifetime.For those of us who need that help and want to dig a bit deeper, the Arden editions of Shakespeare are just wonderful.-Before the text of the play we get very readable and helpful essays discussing the sources and themes and other important issues about the play.-In the text of the play we get as authoritative a text as exists with helpful notes about textual variations in other sources. We also get many many footnotes explaining unusual words or word plays or thematic points that would likely not be known by us reading in the 21st century.-After the text we get excerpts from likely source materials used by Shakespeare and more background material to help us enrich our understanding and enjoyment of the play.However, these extras are only available in the individual editions. If you buy the \\"Complete Plays\\" you get text and notes, but not the before and after material which add so much!

Falstaff is funnier than ever. King Henry IV's younger son Lancaster is a very striking figure. While his father is ill, he commands the forces against his father's enemies. 3.1 where King Henry IV contemplates the consequences of the crown he usurped from Richard II is quite moving. The scene where Lancaster crushes the last of his father's opposition is quite chilling. I can not overestimate Shakespeare's genious in how he handles Henry IV in this play. In &quot;Richard II&quot; his ambition and cruelty for the most part never ceased. In &quot;1 Henry IV,&quot; he showed himself to be a competent (and even likeable) king. In this play, he clearly regrets and suffers for his actions against Richard II. (Even if we remember his cruelty in &quot;Richard II,&quot; it is hard not to feel sorry for him at this point.) The scene where King Henry IV has his final talk with the eventual Henry V is one of the most moving passages in literature.

Hayden Christensan can play Alexander Campbell."},{"Title":"Where Are Poor People to Live?: Transforming Public Housing Communities (Cities and Contemporary Society)","review":"Scholars and interested parties critical of the presumptions and practicies of HUD's infamous HOPE VI program have often had a byzantine research path to follow. Part of the blame falls on the lack of institutional memory at HUD (referenced in the Zhang and Weismann paper in chapter 2 of this book), but serious critical insight into this program has been a long time in coming. Given the considerable impacts this program has had and continues to have on urban ethnic and racial minorities, that is a major public administration shortcoming.Using the ongoing Chicago \\"Plan for Transformation\\" experience as a springboard, this volume furnishes the best one volume treatment of ongoing American public housing \\"transformations\\" currently available. This book is highly informative; in addition to containing chapters on the historical context of 1990's \\"transformation,\\" the book also furnishes analysis of what the demolition of public housing actually looked like on the ground, who stood (and stands) to benefit from the gentrification engendered by the demolition of high profile public housing, and also contains some excellent critical analysis of the \\"new urbanist\\" premises that were built into the HOPE VI program in the early to mid 1990's.This book is a much-needed critical antidote to the architectural determinism of much of the \\"smart growth\\" and \\"new urbanist\\" dogma still seeping out of this country's leading urban and regional planning schools. One noteworthy example: New Orleans, post hurricanes Katrina and Rita.Armed with the information this book contains, advocates and activists nationwide should be able to stand on more equal footing with the well compensated \\"consultants,\\" professors, and graduate students that were responsible for the demolition of many historic public housing communities around the United States.Note: This review refers to the paperback edition of this book, which is considerably more affordable than the hardcover version. The binding of the paperback edition is pretty flimsy (pages are already falling out of my almost new copy), but the lower price makes that acceptable."},{"Title":"In search of Scotland,","review":"In the Lion's Mouth: Gisi Fleischmann & the Jewish Fight for SurvivalJerusalem Journal: Adventures in a Desert LandscapeSmokestacks and Black Diamonds: A History of Carbon County, PennsylvaniaNeed a vacation but can't get away? Pick up a book by the great British travel writer H.V. Morton. It is guaranteed to lift you out of your mental doldrums and take you places.Morton, who lived and worked in the 20th century, continues to have a significant following today--in fact, his readers have formed an international Society, the H.V. Morton Society, which any enthusiast may join. (This enthusiast has.)\\"In Search Of Scotland\\" is the Morton book I first encountered. It had a page or two, right at the beginning, that I found dull--but after that I was hooked. Morton depicted the romantic and tragic country of Scotland in such a way that I felt I was there, seeing things through his eyes. He introduced many of the people. He made me laugh. He made me cry. He made me buy other books by him.Try him. He is a writer who, if you let him, will become your friend."},{"Title":"In search of Scotland,","review":"I have to say at the start that I've read and reviewed maybe a half-dozen H.V. Morton books, and I've yet to find one that's not well-written, interesting, and entertaining. But as with any author, some books are better than others. I started reading \\"In Search of Scotland\\" right after finishing Morton's wonderful \\"In Search of England,\\" and I have to admit I found \\"...Scotland\\" something of a letdown.I've been trying to decide why exactly that is, and I think it may simply be because \\"...England\\" was a diverse, you might say, book, with a wider variety of personalities, encounters, and generally interesting things to do and see. It may be, too, that Morton was more familiar with England and so could write about it more broadly and confidently. One of the things I found most surprising about \\"...Scotland,\\" in fact, was Morton's discussion of how unknown most of Scotland -- particularly the Highlands -- still was to the majority of English people, even as late as the time Morton was writing (1929). Scotland was in many senses a foreign land, making \\"In Search of Scotland\\" Morton's first piece of \\"foreign\\" travel writing (all his previous books had been about England, and mostly about London).While parts of \\"...Scotland\\" dragged for me, there were still many times when Morton's descriptive skill shined through, and the reader comes away with a strong sense of the role history plays (or played?) in the average Scot's understanding of himself and his place in the world. As with so much of Morton's writing, it would be fascinating to know how much of what he found still remains, eight or so decades later."},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"This is an excellent book to get, when you want to go to the next level of grilling. Reading it is a hoot, you can almost hear him talking his way through the book. What I really like is that this book is not just about grilling, but also includes lots of complimentary dishes that go well with it. Check out the last page for the pie, you will see what I mean. Still trying to balance out the timing on how to run two grills, but I'll get it down. Best part I really like is the added commentary on what dishes to serve together, great choices!!"},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"This isn't a review, but a tip for those that wanted to get the book \\"Grilled to Perfection\\" by the host of Licence to Grill, Rob Rainford.

Happy grilling:)"},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"The recipes in this book are delicious and fun. There are several recomendations as to what dishes go well with others, and the explanations on grilling techniques are useful to even the most experienced grillers. A must-have, for anyone who loves to cook on the open flame!"},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"I don't really know how to give this book a fair comment. I have found it a little bit simple in the variety of culinary methods being taught in this book. But it's fair to say that the recipes does works."},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"I was looking for a cookbook by Robert Rainford the chef and host of the show License to Grill. Typing in his name pulled up this book. Me, silly person, did not pay attention to the other name listed. I figured Christopher Schlesinger was a co-author. Duh! Anyway, if you're looking for a book by Robert Rainford this is not it. Boy was my husband disappointed!"},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"As mentioned in my review of the same authors &quot;Thrill of the Grill&quot; book, I was misleading into buying this book. This book was touted, along with the first book, as being &quot;the two best books written on BBQ&quot;. Being a BBQ man, I decided to order both books. This book is even more feable then the first book when it comes to BBQ. The only BBQ recipe I remember is BBQ duck or something odd. There is a section on boyscout/hobo dinners cooked in aluminum foil, which is interesting for the fact that its never talked about in cookbooks. Maybe because most authors wont bother to write about cooking methods as simple as wrapping piece of meat and cut up vegetables in aluminum foil and throwing them in a campfire. Whats next, recipies on microwaving different kinds of frozen burritos? Like the original, this is strictly about exotic and weird carribean grillings, which most american BBQers or grillers wont care much for. However, either in this book or the first, I found a great recipe on grilled vegetable soup. So, I guess it does have a redeeming quality to it. But one good recipe does not make a good cookbook."},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"How many cookbooks can you really say you've tried 80% of the recipes and they're ALL GREAT? Company coming try Neo Post Modern Polynesion chicken or how about Grilled Halibut with Fried Green Apples, Bacon and Horseradish Sour Cream...This is the only cookbook I can say that about. WOW...I'm buying the rest of their books!...and about the pepper crusted steak my fellow reviewer noted above...use that cup of pepper, the blue cheese complements it. I have made that dish several times and always to raves!"},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"This book really lets you take grilling beyond burgers, dogs and steaks -- even if you have limited experience. The recipes are easy to follow, and the course combinations allow preparation of complete meals that work well together. Every time I have referred to this book, I have found at least one (and usually more than one) recipe that was right on target. It is limited on color photos, but I have not found this to be a problem since the text is quite descriptive and well-written. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"Schlesinger and Willoughby did it again. After Thrill of the grill they came out out with another grilling/BBQ bible! Continuing what they already did in earlier books,they dazzle the reader/homecook with easy to make recipes. Very subtle recipes intermingle with hot and fiery ones. Another forte of the authors are the side dishes. Try them and you'll be surprised. So get out the grill and light your fires! The book will give you plenty of recipes to awaken your griller-instincts!"},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"Chris Schlesinger and John Willoughby put together a very readable, enjoyable, and practical group of cookbooks. License to Grill is the best. I've used so many of their recipes that I'm now cooking &quot;their way&quot; almost without the cookbook. I've also had the pleasure of having dinner at the East Coast Grill in Cambridge, MA on several occasions. &quot;Ya gotta go there&quot;.....because the menu changes often and they do great &quot;grill&quot; things with liver (of all things), all kinds of seafood, and veggies.Without a doubt, License to Grill &quot;does&quot; it...for dinner parties, everyday, or those &quot;special occasions&quot;."},{"Title":"License to Grill","review":"Great for purests - charcoal only.

However, I tend to use the recipes themselves as &quot;ideas&quot; rather than follow the recipes to the letter. Some of the ingredient quantites seem almost absurd. For example, a recipe for pepper-crusted steak with blue cheese butter calls for 1 cup (!) of cracked black pepper and and a half-cup of kosher salt for 4 steaks. Use a little common sense, adjust the recipes accordingly, and you'll get good results."},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"I couldn't frickin' believe anyone gave this book less than 4 stars! Well, the humor is a tad dry, but this has to be Sandlin's best. This book is like that girlfriend you love just because she's a basketcase, you know? You'll love all the characters."},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"After reading the Gro Vont trilogy I needed another Sandlin fix. While not on par with Skipped Parts or Sorrow Floats, this book is still more entertaining and worthwhile than most. Its characters are idiosyncratic and at its best, this book creates scenes that rank with the best of Sandlin's tragically comic tales. Probably not the best book to be introduced to Sandlin with, but it is worth a read from those that are familiar with and enjoy his other work."},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"i have never felt so in touch with a book as i did with this one. i laughed &amp; cried--especially when the end came and i had to put it down. there is so much depth in sandlin's characters, it's almost hard to see it if you aren't looking in the right place. i love this author, i have to go out &amp; read his other stuff if it's as good as this!"},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"Never read Sandlin before and wasn't expecting something so well written. This draws you right in and holds you there. You watch it unfold as you read it. Killer character development. Lana Sue is a work of art. Have ordered five more of his books."},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"In Western Swing, Sandlin revisits Kelly Palomino, the main character of his \\"Sex and Sunsets.\\" Although Kelly now goes by the name of Loren (KP being a pen name of Loren, now a full-time author) he retains many of the same hyper-romantic, if misguidely so, character traits.This time, the story shifts between Loren's viewpoint and that of his wife, Lana Sue. Both are charmingly dysfunctional and find themselves in situations that provide for melodrama and warped comedy. Once again, the main strengths lie in Sandlin's distinct voice and offbeat humor. The casual way his characters talk about everything from violence to insanity to statutory rape might be off-putting to some readers, but to me at least, it all seems pretty harmless and awfully funny in Sandlin's capable hands.On the whole, this isn't quite on par with Sandlin's best work, its far from his weakest. It will be a hit with fans of Sandlin's other work or anybody with a taste for offbeat literature."},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"I've read all of the Sandlin books available, and I find this one to be his best. As in all of his writing, I find myself laughing out loud many times, and realizing that many of his stories could very well happen. There are 2 main characters in this book, one male and one female...and the narration bounces from one to other. Once ya get past that, and figure out which one is talking, it's a rather kewl way of seeing both sides of a really interesting couple. Better hang on...it doesn't get much better than this!!"},{"Title":"Western Swing","review":"I'm giving this one four stars, which is hard to do for a Sandlin book. But I think it's less to do with the writing than the fact that I've met these characters already in the second and third parts of the GroVont trilogy and like them better. Still, Western Swing is an excellent gateway drug to the rest of Tim Sandlin's collection. Sandling continues his theme of whispy men who need saving via strong women with commitment problems. If I had editorial power over this work, my only suggestion would be to kill the epilogue or at least revise it. After the dramatic mood swing from funny to depressing to ludicrous, it just didn't fit, that is unless you are the type who likes those &quot;where are they now&quot; moments at the end of Animal House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"Comic artist Joe Matt's first comic strips are collected in this fantastic volume. Included is an intimate look at Joe's nervous world of girl troubles and toilet humor. Joe dicusses his perosnal relationships and how he destroys them, exlains how to move one's bowels with absolute stealth and includes a how-to guide for cheap skates. This is by far some of the best comic strip work out there today, but be warned, Joe Matt is R. Crumb inspired so be ready for this raw peep into Joe Matt's private life."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"At first I wasn't so sure about Joe Matt but he's really grown on me. He's so painfully honest about himself that it's amazing. Especially the story where he beat up his girlfriend. That was shocking that he included it in his comix... most would edit something like that out. He has a wonderful grasp on the stuggles of long-term relationships - and he manages to keep it pretty damn funny at the same time. His more recent comics about his problems(?) with porn are wonderful too. Any man who isn't embarrased to print a 10 page comic of himself dubbing his friends' porno movies is a saint in my book. Wonderful."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"I loved this book. Joe is being more honest than most of you might believe. I grew up in that &quot;small suburb of Philadelphia&quot; directly across that street from Joe, and I have to tell you that the stories are real. It was like reliving my childhood reading Peepshow. That underground fort across the street from 7-11...my older brothers helped build it. He was as germ-phobic, and nerotic in real life as he is in Peepshow.I am however disappointed that my brothers and I never got a mention in the book."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"Joe Matt collects pages of his early comics work from when he started in 1987 up to 1991. The strips chronicle his neuroses about masturbation (something readers of his other books would know only too well), his troubled relationship with his girlfriend Trish, his obsession with saving money, comics, as well as snapshots from his past at high school, art school, summer jobs, his family, former girlfriends, and how he came to meet Chester Brown and Seth.\\"Peepshow\\" being his earliest works, they show how he started out writing tiny panelled one-pagers and slowly developed into a more confident artist/writer trying different styles, larger panels, longer stories until by the end of the book Joe is putting together pages and pages for a narrative rather than relying on the one page format.It's different from his other books as it's more bite-sized though the topics are great. Joe's obsessions are trivial and he knows it but he makes them fascinating for the reader not simply through embarassing sheer honesty but by telling them well. He's a born storyteller and simple stories about a fight with his girlfriend Trish over a shiatsu massage can be spun out over several (large) pages and be the stuff of high drama.Also if you're a fan of other Drawn & Quarterly artists you'll be interested in Joe's meetings with Chester Brown (Yummy Fur) and Seth (Palookaville) and how they became friends, and how they lived in the early '90s. Also Seth contributes a 2 page strip as an afterword, explaining a few things about Joe Matt that doesn't portray him in the best light (but then neither do Joe's own strips) but is still very funny.It's a great comic book from a great comic book artist whom I wish would get over his insecurities and put out more books like Seth does. A fun read and very enjoyable, \\"Peepshow\\" is brilliant."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"Great, great stuff. Joe's writing and art really brings you into the story and gets you attached to his (seemingly bizzare, pathetic) life, makes you feel sympathy for what he and his girl are going through. The characters are wonderful. His life, his relationships with his friends, girlfriend, relatives--all interesting and, as he presents it, fun.I read a lot of \\"indie\\" (D&G;, Fantagraphics, etc.) comics so I'm sorry I had to come across Joe in a used bookstore. He should be up there with Bagge, Seth, Bechdel, and all those other great autobiographic comic artists.Please buy this book and encourage him to write more. Also, so he doesn't have to color superhero comics anymore."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"Peepshow is Joe Matt's brilliant debut--and it has all the growing pangs a great comic should have: It's sometimes awkward, squeaky, and the inch by inch panels are sometimes a pain to squint through. But this is great stuff. Smart, unafraid, dirty, and hilarious, Matt tells the story of his background, personality and new relationship with girlfriend Trish. Most are one-pagers, with \\"filler\\" cartoons on Boob the cat, but there are extended episodes without the requisite \\"punchline,\\" most memorably on how he struggles in resisting porn and masturbation, both of which Trish doesn't approve. (Sorry, I can't be euphemistic. If you don't want to read about a white kid from Philly masturbating, this comic is probably not for you.) Best of all is the guest comic by Seth at the back of the book that turns the autobiography on its head. Seth confirms and tells you Matt's actually worse than how he presents himself!This is NOT sentimental stuff--this isn't Jeffrey Brown--but it isn't offensive, and thankfully there isn't much nudity, either. I definitely don't recommend this for your kids (with a title like Peepshow, who would?). And unlike another reviewer, I'd say intelligent women with a sense of humor would love this too. Unlike Matt's later work, his adolescent despair doesn't bog this book down. Peepshow is unexpected, frank, coarse and fun."},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"I found this book very worthwhile. I originally bought it, and after browsing through the inside, I was about to immediately return it (found the art tiny and unappealing). I decided to read it anyway, and found that I enjoyed it alot. This book contains a bunch of B&W; vignettes and stories about the author and his girlfriends. He is painfully honest and the flow is awesome (think: Crumb, Clowes), but there is one problem. I only buy graphic novels so that i can re-read them forever. After first reading, the binding began to rip, and the first two pages fell out.Love the book, but if I can't re-read it (because spine falls apart), goodbye!"},{"Title":"Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary Joe Matt","review":"The problem with taking Harvey Pekar's comic works as a guide and trying to do the same thing is that it requires a huge talent--you must do it exactly right for it to work. Joe Matt shows us how it ISN'T done.Pekar chronicles his own life, warts and all. Joe Matt can't see past the warts, and has come to the erroneous conclusion that simply recording his problems and fears equals *A*R*T*. It ain't that easy!Pekar, although he writes about himself, also pays attention to the people around him. They're forever saying things that you find yourself remembering. Joe Matt's view of life is adolescently centered on himself, and everyone around him is reduced to shallow caricatures. Yes, he is self-aware of this, but that doesn't make the end result worth reading."},{"Title":"Dreadnought (Starwolves series, Book No. 4)","review":"I thought this book was as good as the others in the series.

I read it and would cry and cry at the absolute sweetness of the poetry. The people who wrote these pieces totally and completely understood what I was feeling during my pregnancy -- the bliss, the aprehension, the anticipation. After I had my boy, I picked the book up again, and now a whole different section of the book made me cry. Then he turned one, and the book hit me again. Now 4 years later, I just bought the book for 3 of my friends, 2 who are pregnant, and one who has a 1-year old. They are all sobbing. They are not sad poems at all, quite the contrary. They are full of real moments of unadulterated preciousnesses, that force one to sit and fully feel the love we have for our children and for pregancy and for every little quiet personal moment.

I ordered it online and was surpised at it's oversize (sorry...no ruler handy for that info). It's an acceptable size for display and browse, even though I bought it thinking it would be more in-depth and textbook sized.The choice of realist artists was diverse yet kept to a very American mid-century view. I particularly found the African-American imagery compelling. These are the children of the Ashcan school artists, and some of the works (and accompanying short-page, but concise explanations)are generally unknown. Many are of stiking social commentary.If you are ready to go beyond Edward Hopper for mid-century American Realism you will greatly enjoy this book.

The Dalai Lama's wonderful optimism shines forth as he paints a picture of civilization of compassion and true love for our fellow humans. But this is not a hollow sermon with only the hope of peace held out in front of us. It is instead a prescription for beginning the long journey toward converting ourselves to fuller, happier human beings. Through personal stories and experiences the Dalai Lama shows us the way to re-think our position in the world. Despite protestations to the contrary though, the Buddhist philosophy and teaching is pervasive throughout. Yet there is never a lack of respect for other spiritual paths. A path is set before us with definitions for Ethics of: Restraint, Virtue, Compassion, and Suffering. We are given a clear understanding of the role ethics plays in society. World religions are taken to task for providing yet another reason for propagating hate and/or separating ourselves from others. We are also left with an appeal for - &quot;Love for others and respect for their rights and dignity, no matter who or what they are: ultimately these are all we need.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This book is a great read!!! First, the language is very simple, it's endearing, and very easy to get into.The greatest part about the book is it isn't Buddhist-centric. Although the Dalai Lama is a the most prominent figure in Buddhism, the book isn't about Buddhism. The Dalai Lama extends his views on ethics and virtues to encompass everyone; Christian, Buddhists, Muslims, Atheists, ect. You do not have to be a practicing Buddhist to gain something from this book.The Dalai Lama believes that the stability of the entire world depends on good ethical conduct. He fears that with growing secularization of modern or industrial society, that people around the world are lacking in virtue. He realizes people are pulling away from religion, but hopes to find a way that good conduct, and ethical behavior that goes beyond religious authority,will be adopted by more people of the human race.One of the most interesting things I took away from the book was his view that people of modern society avoid suffering at all costs. Of course people want to pursue happiness, that's natural. But, he argues that for all the privledge and advancement of these societies, they still suffer, but in different ways. We as modern societies suffer more psychologically and emotionally than less developed societies. Although I am no expert on psychology, I can see this to be true. I know people with so many riches but suffer with anxiety and depression. We have to except that fact that we all suffer. That's what I love about Buddhism. Everyone suffers. Everyone hurts. Embrace this, and find ways to make your life more enriching. By doing good deeds, by developing positive and healthy human relationships (which the Dalai Lama believes modern societies struggle with), and attempt to foster a positive method of thinking. According to the Dalai Lama, this will not only benefit you and add to your happiness, but will in a small way benefit society over all. These are very simple, but can be very difficult. I liked having these ideas reiterated with the eloquence of the Dalai Lama. We all have a part to do."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"As a professor of ethics, I highly recommend this book. Unlike many books on ethics the respected author takes a deep look at the interior aspects of what it means to be human; the essential component is what is left out from many books on this subject.If you're looking for a totally academic approach to ethics, this is probably not your book. For me the strongest point is the \\"look inside\\" of humanity. While some of the Buddhist teachings certainly dominate his thought, there is no doubt this can be a book for any reader who is open minded about what it means to have peace on a personal level as well as global. This book is highly readable and unusually fresh and understandable.

The answer, in His Holiness' mind at least, is a resounding &quot;yes&quot; and in this book he articulates a clear philosophy which cuts across lines of religion, class and creed and provides a guidepost to improvement of both self and society. Indeed, the thesis of the book is that the two are inextricable.Although the words are clear, His Holiness is not selling spiritual fulfilment in 12 easy steps. But the words are important and should be heeded. I would recommend this for anyone interested in His Holiness or His message, or anyone who asks the question &quot;how can I be a better person?&quot;"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"The Dalai Lama provides a basis for a universal set of ethics, transcending specific religions. His views are insightful and valuable as the US and the world struggle with morality in a multicultural and multi-religious environment.I recommend this book for anyone interested in ethics and morality."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This book has raised my consciousness. It has given me a new, broader perspective to look at the world through. He does not recruit for Buddhism, on the contrary, he presents a system of ethics that is spiritual, but not religious. I would recommend it to anyone, religious or not."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed many parts of this book and would recommend it to many people, I would not recommend it to everyone. I have given it a 3 star rating because of two main reasons.1) The Dalai Lama fails to provide convincing arguments to those who don't already have views similar to his (i.e. that selflessness and non-violence are essential values), which is why this book will not appeal to those who need his advice the most. Compared to the Dalai Lama, I found M.K. Gandhi could make much more compelling rational arguments to convince skeptics of the necessity of being compassionate.2) The title is misleading. I expected that the Dalai Lama had done much thinking about the modern world and wanted to propose his solutions to its major problems. I was very interested in learning what wisdom he had come up with. Instead, most of his thinking has revolved around traditional south Asian philosophies. Although these philosophies apply perfectly to the modern world, he did not show this well. Indeed he did not make any special effort to describe how the current problems could be resolved using these philosophies.Here's a brief synopsis of the book:In the first of three sections, the Dalai Lama explains that ethical conduct does not require adherence to religion, so long as one realizes everyone's right to be happy and not to suffer. He also argues that everyone desires to be happy, but that only those who manage to reach an inner peace that is independent of outside circumstances (such as wealth or poverty, political repression or freedom, sickness or health, etc.) can truly increase their happiness. He also makes a good argument for how happiness is easier to attain when we're shown compassion by others and how we can also help make others happy by showing them compassion.To show that it is in our interest to make others happy by showing them compassion, he makes a rather complex philosophical discussion on how our interests are connected to other's interests so that our happiness is connected to other's happiness. I don't know if it's just me, but I found this part very complicated and not very convincing.In the second part, he describes how each individual can develop this caring and compassionate nature. By restraining negative emotions (anger, envy, etc.), we avoid disregarding others and we end up reducing suffering both for others and ourselves. By developing compassion for all, even for those who would harm us, we can further develop virtues like forgiveness, humility, generosity. By dealing properly with unavoidable suffering (like aging, sickness, etc.), we can even strengthen our ability to have compassion and restrain our negative emotions, so that suffering may provide a good opportunity to learn.In the third section, he tries to apply the principle of compassion to the level of society. There isn't much new there and he doesn't provide much to convince those who don't believe what he believes, it therefore sounds more like political correctness: care for the environment, care for the poor, care for peace, etc.If you think like the Dalai Lama you will love this book, since he teaches you how you can become a better person. If you don't think like him, this book will fail to convince you and you will not learn any of the lessons he is teaching in this book. It's up to you to choose."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"How can we be happy in today's materialistic, competitive world? Not by amassing more wealth and possessions, according to the Dalai Lama. He recommends that we focus on internal, spiritual issues: we need to recognize our connectedness with all human beings, learn to restrain anger and other negative thoughts and emotions, and develop patience and compassion for others. For the way to be happy is by being a good, ethical person. This is useful advice that can help anyone who takes it seriously. But self-change is difficult; considerable effort and will are required. Getting ahead by pulling other people down is widely accepted in our society, and those who most need the Dalai Lama's advice may be the least likely to read this book and follow his teachings."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Although I found this a bit slow to get going, with the opening couple of chapters surely rather obvious to most of us in the Western world these days, this is an excellent book. The Dalai Lama carefully puts forward universal principles that can inspire all humanity in the direction of fundamental personal happiness.Some Buddhist terms are used (e.g. \\"nying-je\\" = the supreme emotion of love and compassion, \\"chi-sem\\" = universal consciousness), but the author is far more interested in embracing ALL religious and non-religious perspectives. \\"Whether or not a person is a religious believer does not matter much. Far more important is that they be a good human being\\". His approach is practical too. There are countless everyday examples of possible moral and ethical choices, with clear observations and comments on the consequences. An awareness of the fundamental interconnectedness of ourselves and those around us is a major theme.Through the application of moral principles to a very broad range of human experiences, the Dalai Lama inspires a practical, intelligent, spiritual awareness and sense of responsibility in the reader. The approach is balanced, rational and compassionate. Great words to be absorbed and acted upon."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I listen to these tapes once a week and find something new and helpful in them each listening.

The Dalai Lama presents a real-world message; not some kind of ivory towered fantasy of shiny happy people that I was half expecting. The Dalai Lama does not pretend that humans are naturally benevolent and philanthropic. His thesis focuses upon the age-old &quot;pursuit of pleasure/avoidance of pain&quot; incentive embedded in our psyche. The needs of a healthy society, he postulates, are dependent upon all of us living our lives with others in mind. That, and the fact that living ethically satisfies our personal values system of basic morality.I found the concept of divorcing spirituality from religiousity to be exceptionally refreshing. He does mention his Buddist beliefs, but maintains that all religions have merit; a concept frequently missed by a great number of religious writers.The book is sparked with wry humor and anecdotes that made me feel like I was listening to a kindly old grandpa telling parables to children. Not exactly the voice one might expect from a spiritual and political leader. The pace of the book does meander, but in a charming kind of way, like a nice scenic drive.I think this book should be required reading for high school kids, world leaders, teachers, parents, CEOs and well, OK - every literate person on the face of the earth. I plan to buy a couple more copies and send them to my friends and family!"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"These days when we've got Christian fundamentalists trying to convert us to their way of thinking or taking control via the election system, it is so incredibly refreshing to read the Dalai Lama's words of compassion and love and tolerance for others. He does not wish to convert. That is not his agenda. He is considered the 14th incarnation of the BUDDHA OF COMPASSION and that tells one a whole lot right there. His agenda, if he has one, is to help his persecuted people in Tibet and maybe help the rest of us find a way to lead better lives despite all of our surface differences. Just imagine what the evening news would be like if we all adopted those principles and really tried to live each day by them, regardless of our religious or non-religious affiliations?"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"How can we be happy in today's materialistic, competitive world?

I have been a student of Western civilization from Homer through Freud, and I have been a student of Buddhism for over ten years. I found it quite interesting that the structure of this book shares a pattern with western philosophies in that it starts with the definitions and builds a framework from there. The Dalai Lama rather carefully defines happiness, religion, and spirituality, and shows us how each fits into a spirituality-based ethics. I have been eager to see how he continues to build the structure of this ethics. While he does say his wish is to separate this from Buddhism, what I have read so far is Buddhist philosophy through and through. There are analogies familiar to me even in my path of Zen in the US, such as mistaking a coiled snake for a rope, and concepts, such as &quot;afflicted emotions&quot;, which are central to an understanding the Four Noble Truths. He takes a very complex Buddhist concept, dependent origination, and gives what may be the best teaching I have had. I think it is a massive undertaking, to formulate an ethics that can be independent from any particular religion, yet is based on spiritual tendencies. He strips away the ritual, dogma, myths, and he skillfully shows us where our spiritual impulses arise from. We all just wanna be happy. I am hoping to share this book with friends, as I am curious what sort of reaction a person would have who does not have a background in Buddhism. Much of his rationale makes sense to me because I have experienced it in a living practice, but would it be as acceptable to an atheist? I don't know."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Mere words cannot describe the influence this book will have on our society. Simply because it already has had a positive effect with me. If the Dalai Lama hoped for at least one reader to listen and understand, he has.I have been a student of philosophy, psyhcology, religion, history, current events, and any other body of knowledge that is stimulating. This book discusses all of those bodies.He is not imposing his moral values on the reader. He is not trying to convert the reader to Buddhism. His goal, I believe, is that humanity, or at least a few people, will become Aware of the path societies are headed. We are all part of the whole. We all have a universal responsibility.The Dalai Lama's ideas for a better world, idealistic by his own admission, make sense. I believe it is possible. Perhaps, humanity needs a wakeup call for this to happen, but the potential is there.The Dalai Lama is one of the most straight-forward, empathic, tolerant, loving human beings.Let us all at least listen to what this fellow human has to say. It will get you thinking, that is for sure- about yourself and the world around you."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Criticism has been made that most people who most need this book won't read it because they aren't receptive to the message, and I imagine that's true. However, this book's influence goes beyond those who read it and are affected by it, because those people will hopefully be more consistent in behaving ethically, and this will influence many who don't read the book.Again, this sort of criticism is typical of the type of thinking many have when listening to a sermon or spiritual talk: &quot;Too bad so and so isn't hearing this!&quot; Don't worry about the people not reading it. Read it to get full benefit and allow it to influence your thinking and actions. If you come across a stumbling block, a statement you disagree with, pass over it so that you don't miss more important points.Of course, this book was written before the events of 9-11-01, and our perspective is bound to have changed since that awful day. Hopefully though, we are still open to respect of political and religious differences. This is the bottom line. We are to use our ability to love so that it extends to all people, even to those who belong to nations who are on bad terms with us.If you read this book just as a book as philosophy, it will have failed in it's purpose. But if you take the core message to heart and allow yourself to be spurred to resolve and action, it will have succeeded.Any normal reader will find little loopholes, areas of disagreement, but centering on the larger picture will be more effective by far. Introspection and self examination followed by self discipline are called for along with reaching out to others with love."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I now realize that H.H. the Dalai Lama possesses great insight into the ethereal realm.

Regardless of an individuals point of view, or religions notions, or lack there of, this book is for anyone who believes in sensibility, human rights, and a higher state of consciousness."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"The Dalai Lama reaches past religious boundaries in this call for a new ethics practical for peoples of all beliefs, religious and secular. Although religions have provided ethical instruction in the past, they are losing their hold. Therefore we need an ethics which does not depend on religions, one which is at home in both religious and secular contexts. This he seeks to provide in Ethics for the New Millennium.To begin, the Dalai Lama urges the need to ground all actions in positive mental states. These states are not unique to any one tradition, but are common to all religions and philosophies. Qualities like love, compassion, patience, forgiveness, and so on are common to all. Actions arising out of these positive states, he claims, are automatically ethical. In contrast, those arising from negative or \\"afflictive\\" states may be ethically questionable. So there is a pressing need to cultivate positive mental states and let actions flow from them.This stance is grounded in \\"our basic sameness as human beings... we all desire to be happy and to avoid suffering\\" (p. 4). The Dalai Lama shows how we are all connected and interdependent, and concern for others is the best way to promote our own happiness. Ultimately, positive mental states and concern for others lead to the greatest happiness for both others and ourselves.Because of this basic fact, the Dalai Lama calls for a \\"spiritual revolution.\\" He distinguishes this against religion, which is concerned with faith claims and metaphysics. In contrast, spirituality is concerned with \\"those qualities of the human spirit--such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony--which bring happiness to both self and others\\" (p. 22). Cultivating these qualities does not require recourse to any religious or metaphysical belief system. It only requires spiritual practice consisting of \\"acting out of concern for others' well-being\\" on the one hand, and \\"transforming ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so\\" on the other (p. 23). The revolution called for is thus one of character development.To begin this development, the Dalai Lama appeals to our natural capacity for empathy, and urges its transformation into compassion. This alone is not enough, however. We also need discipline, in order to deal with negative states and emotions. These obstruct our aspirations to happiness. Just as concern for others ensures happiness for ourselves, so too does harming others harm ourselves. So, we need some level of discipline. While some may say this denies personal freedom, the Dalai Lama argues the opposite. He says that negative emotions like anger enslave us. True freedom lies in voluntary restraint.In addition to compassion and discipline, we also need wise discernment and a number of other important qualities. The Dalai Lama explores these in turn. In the process he has frequent recourse to Tibetan terms and proverbs, which he explains clearly and without obtuseness. Far from being idiosyncratic, these serve to flesh out the Dalai Lama's personal perspective while inviting the reader to meet him halfway.The Dalai Lama's discourse roves over many topics and looks at the problem from numerous angles. It acknowledges various limitations and avoids extremes. And yet there remains a nagging question: are good intentions really enough?The book never quite surmounts this problem. The Dalai Lama addresses it in a disclaimer: \\"This is not to say that all we need to do is cultivate spiritual values and these problems will automatically disappear. On the contrary, each of them needs a specific solution. But we find that when this spiritual dimension is neglected, we have no hope of achieving a lasting solution\\" (p. 24). So it is clear that good intentions are not enough, but without them we have little chance. Ethics for the New Millennium provides one half of the solution. The other half awaits us.Thus far the book reminds us of common truths, often overlooked yet vital to happiness. But important as they are, they are hardly controversial. The controversial part comes in the chapter entitled \\"Peace and Disarmament.\\" This is where the Dalai Lama lays out his concrete vision for military disestablishment. Committed to non-violence, he believes world peace is an achievable goal. This is not peace not in the abstract, but in the concrete. War may seem justifiable by many and various arguments, but ultimate it comes down to suffering. \\"Although paradoxically the aim of most military campaigns is peace, in reality, war is like fire in the human community, one whose fuel is living people\\" (p. 203). So, we need to consider disarmament. Of course, we cannot simply lay down our weapons in a day. Yet somehow we must find a way to do so by gradual process. He proposes a number of ways forward, including \\"zones of peace,\\" which are essentially demilitarized zones between nations. He believes the United Nations can play a role, but it has limitations. Nations are represented, but their people are not. Perhaps what we need is a \\"World Council of the People,\\" which could represent people when their governments fail to serve them. Through such strategies, the Dalai Lama believes in time world peace is possible.As for religions, the Dalai Lama is optimistic for their place in years to come. They can \\"play a leading role in encouraging people to develop a sense of responsibility toward others and of the need to be ethically disciplined\\" (p. 220). The biggest obstacle to religion's continued relevance is the tendency to devalue others' religions. The best solution is dialogue. There is no need to say all religions are essentially the same, or to create some new \\"super\\" or \\"world\\" religion. We only need to learn from each other, and set a good example by developing good relations with other faith traditions. In this way, religions can find an important place in the new millennium.Overall, the book puts forward an inspiring vision. The writing style is less that of a precise philosopher than of a gentle grandparent. Some views seem naive, particularly the way other religions are portrayed as essentially concerned with the same positive values. While this may be true more or less, it obscures differences which lead to disagreement and conflict. Another naive view is the claim that actions arising from positive mental states are automatically ethical. Surely a great deal more is required before we can call an action \\"ethical\\" in any meaningful sense. The Dalai Lama begins to address this in the chapter on discernment, but does not fully develop the idea. Yet despite these faults, the book manages to inspire nonetheless. Ethics for the New Millennium offers plenty to contemplate.The greatest strength of the book is its unerring faith in humanity. While suffering is granted as a matter of course, human goodness remains a real possibility. This, in spite of great conflict. This faith is demonstrated in the willingness of the author, himself a religious leader, to recognize and even advocate a place for the secular. Ultimately, peace does not lie in sectarian division, but in our common humanity.\\"For whereas the fundamental questions of human existence, such as why we are here, where we are going, and whether the universe had a beginning, heave each elicited different responses in different philosophical traditions, it is self-evident that a generous heart and wholesome actions lead to greater peace.\\" (p. 120-121)"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I was a little surprised when I was reading along with the audio book that it skipped some portions of the book.

There are no confusing parables here, just core truth."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"The Dalai Lama considers the state of the world in relation to ethics with a fine-toothed comb. (I am currently borrowing \\"Ethics for the New Millennium\\" as an abridged audiobook from my local library. This is a tape I will repeatedly listen to until its due date...) The Dalai Lama is such a sweetheart! I love how he perceives the world, suggests solutions and alternatives to global and ethical dilemnas, and remains optimistic about the future. He believes that we are a people who want to be happy while avoiding suffering. He acknowleges that we do have a dark side that we must keep in check and subdue; but to counter this dark side, the Dalai Lama believes that people are mostly gentle by nature and can return to that natural state with discipline and guidance. We deviate from our better nature when we try to find happiness the wrong way or in the wrong things, and thereby only feel transitory illusions of happiness that may cause harm to others. As a pop song claims, \\"If you want to make the world a better place, take a look in the mirror and then make a change...I'm looking at the man in the mirror, I'm asking him to change his ways...etc.\\" The Dalai Lama is definitely in favor of the need for personal growth and an inner revolution for everyone.The Dalai Lama doesn't go on at length about idealizing this planet or how great it is. He says it is where we live, and therefore, we must take good care of it and encourage global stewardship. The actions of one country will impact the whole world (think about jet streams and imported and exported food). We literally are in this world together; think about what that means. I love how he disparages concepts of Group Identity and other separatists ideas. Black, white, whatever, we all have feelings, and our common ground and goals far outweigh any cultural differences or bitterness over history's mistakes. Also, no one's self-worth or sense of identity should be forged at the expense of another person or ethnic group.Like Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" this is a must-read for every person on the planet. We can agree with the Dalai Lama theoretically, but we must go the extra mile to learn how to apply these ethics (that promote happiness and prevent or curb suffering). (I'm preaching to the choir when I say that I need to learn how to better transform these principles from theory into practice, especially when it comes to managing my emotions and curtailing my feelings of anger and disappointment.) Even in small ways, we can make things better for each other and ourselves. I love when the Dalai Lama observes that when we are promoting others' happiness, we feel happiness ourselves. He repeatedly stresses how interconnected and interrelated we all are. We depend on each other, we need each other.I'm so sick of over-the-top pessimism and unrealistic nostalgia for the past. As a Universalist, I believe the best of times are in the future and the worst of times are in the past and the immediate present. I remember a lyric from a U2 song (\\"Zoo Station\\"/Achtung Baby) that says, \\"time is a train, makes the future the past.\\" I love that the Dalai Lama points out many positive trends in today's society. He's pleased-as-punch that reconciliation and compassion are buzz words, even in politics and businesses. He also is pleasantly aware that the current global marketplace is very dependent on international cooperation. On a related note, I love when I buy chocolate, tea, and coffee that is not only organic, but is fair-trade certified. No one needs to be exploited for the greed of shareholders. Profit is okay if it is accrued ethically, meaning no sweatshops, no needless, man-made hell imposed on innocents (read \\"Fast Food Nation\\" to learn about the consequences of unethical business practices. Like the Dalai Lama, the author of \\"Fast Food Nation\\" points out how we are only nickle and diming ourselves to do it the wrong way; with redirection in energy and ethics, we can do it the right way without unnecessarily harming employees or the environment).To wrap up, please read this book or listen to it as an audiobook. The Dalai Lama knows what he's talking about...take notes and learn."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Very few religious leaders speak deeply about ethics in a manner that allows people to think deeply as a result. Too many religious leaders are authoritarian in their edicts about morality or lax because gaining converts and their money is foremost on their minds. (Yeah, I'm a little cynical.)In this book, Ethics for the New Millennium, HH the Dalai Lama is the answer to the overly authoritarian and the insipidly lax. In it, he answers the question that lazy, greedy, or selfish people inevitably ask: Why should I live an ethical life? To them, living ethically implies being taken advantage of by the less ethical. They're wrong. Living ethically leads to being happy. You don't, however, have to be stupid to live ethically.This book is divided into three major sections:1. The Foundation of Ethics - in which the Dalai Lama describes how we are all dependent on each other, from our dependency on our parents when we were children to the interconnectedness of the global society. He concludes by discussing the most important emotion that we can express: compassion. Compassion and ethical action leads to happiness.2. Ethics and the Individual - in which the Dalai Lama discusses how people can increase their compassion and thus their happiness in life. He says that to increase compassion, we should restrain those factors that inhibit compassion, and these factors are the source of unethical conduct. Also, to increase compassion, we should encourage love, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, humility, and so on. Sounds good to me.3. Ethics and Society - in which the Dalai Lama makes the natural extension of living an ethical life as an individual and lays out routes to help change the world. Because every act has a universal dimension, because all things are interconnected, ethical discipline, wholesome conduct, and careful discernment will lead to a better world.I'm not a Pollyanna. I don't believe that the whole world will be better if I act ethically, but I know that I feel better when I follow the teachings of the Dalai Lama, and I like the effects on my family. I don't let people take advantage of me financially or personally, but that is a matter of respecting oneself. Extending the hand of compassion, however, makes one a better human being, and that makes you happy.I'm putting this book back on my nightstand to read a little of, every night.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"It would appear that the forced exile of the Dalai Lama has awakened a sleeping giant. His Holiness has learned much in the intervening years and now passes on his observations to the world. This is a book that can be of extreme value to the world. The book crosses all religious lines. Those of good will can readily see this and can expand the truths and dimensions of their own beliefs. All that remains is to put the good into action."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"The spiritual integrity and thoroughgoing goodness of the author shine through this book, with the astonishing result that the reader feels more compassionate after reading it and therefore(!) happier."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, is certainly not a literary artist, but he is a brilliant struggler for Peace. &quot;Ethics for the New Millennium&quot; is one of his many &quot;outcries&quot; for an ethical system which demands a re-evaluation of our society, a setting of new higher goals in which interdependency of everyone's action will lead to a better world. The task ahead requires discipline, development of spiritual values (love, compassion, generosity, tolerance), and a firm belief in the natural-born goodness of human beings. It is a message not only to be read but upon which action is demanded, a message much needed in our society and not to be considered utopian. May the reader enjoy it and share with the writer his hopes for an ethical improvement worldwide."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Ethics for the New Millennium is explicitly a nonreligious work, though it does present several key ideas that come out of Buddhist philosophical tradition. The goal, as stated in the preface, is to present an approach to ethics based on \\"universal\\" rather than religious principles. Presumably, these are principles that persons of diverse religious and nonreligious backgrounds would agree upon. Despite the title, this is not a technical or heavily philosophical work. Much of the book has a common-sense, anecdotal quality to it. While I enjoyed the stories of the Dalai Lama's personal experiences and his unique sense of humor, I must say that some of the cases he makes would be greatly strengthened if he presented some statistical data or findings from modern sociology, psychology and science. The Dalai Lama confesses that his own knowledge of modern (Western) secular thought is still limited, so much of his teachings probably reflect the Buddhist philosophy in which he has trained. Throughout the book, he introduces us to a number of Tibetan terms which do not have simple English equivalents. Several of the key notions presented in the book will probably be unfamiliar to the average Western reader. Of course, this is part of the attraction of the book.To explain his motivation, the Dalai Lama begins by making the personal observation that, while the poor living in less developed countries with traditional cultures may be suffering physically, they often seem to be happier than those with greater material wealth living in more developed countries. His Holiness is careful not to romanticize \\"old ways of life\\" and he does not advocate primitivism or rejection of science and technology as a solution to the world's problems, but rather a \\"spiritual revolution.\\" By this he means the adoption of the emotional disciplines and alternative worldview laid out in this book as a means of addressing disharmony in modern life. He says \\"My call for a spiritual revolution is thus not a call for a religious revolution. Nor is it a reference to a way of life that is somehow otherworldly, still less to something magical or mysterious. Rather, it is a call for a radical reorientation away from our habitual preoccupation with self\\" (p23). The Dalai Lama does a remarkable job of presenting this ethical system in simple language.Christian readers may interested in the brief allusion to the \\"Fruits of the Spirit\\" (pp 22-23) which are discussed in a non-religious context. His Holiness acknowledges an admiration for Christian teachings developed in part through his friendship with a Cistercian monk some time ago. Even more interesting might be the chapter entitled \\"Ethics and Suffering\\" for those who wonder how persons with a non-theistic viewpoint cope with suffering and loss. An important clarification of the notion of karma is given as well. It is one of the best chapters in my opinion, though too short.This is a very tolerant and pluralistic work with regard to religion. Polemics against religiously motivated bigotry, violence, and dogma seem to be entirely absent. The final chapter \\"The Role of Religion\\" is very insightful, but adroitly steers clear of controversy. The Dalai Lama acknowledges that people can lead happy ethical lives without recourse to religion, but is concerned that, with the rise of science and secularism worldwide, there may also be a rise in moral relativism. This book is intended to provide an alternative. My favorite quote: \\"These may seem unusual statements, coming as they do from a religious figure. I am, however, Tibetan before I am Dalai Lama, and I am human before I am Tibetan.\\"The more philosophical part of the book, entitled \\"The Nature of Reality\\", introduces the idea of dependent origination. This sort of organismic, interconnected view of the universe may require several readings to grasp, but leads naturally to the doctrine of \\"no self.\\" This is the clearest and simplest explanation of this doctrine I have found so far.The recurring theme of the book is this: our happiness depends upon the happiness of others. Here is another interesting quote: \\"As we have seen, given the complex nature of reality, it is very difficult to say that a particular act or type of act is right or wrong in itself. Ethical conduct is thus not something we engage in because it is somehow right in itself. We do so because we recognize that just as I desire to be happy and to avoid suffering so do all others.\\" Afflictive emotions (anger, greed, hatred, pride, etc.) destroy our ability to make rational decisions, so we should practice restraint. Emotional responses can be shaped by worldview, and practice. The same is true for cultivating virtues. Anxiety and stress are often a result of lack of perspective. This is a very practical book that offers guidelines for changing how we react and how we feel.I am a little concerned, however, with some statements made about science throughout the book, though these are not by any means central issues. The Dalai Lama tends to refer to \\"radical materialism\\" when talking about science from time to time, and I find this an unfortunate choice of words given the common connotations of the words \\"radical\\" and \\"materialism.\\" Philosophical naturalism would have been better. He also says \\"my concern is rather that we are apt to overlook the limitations of science. In replacing religion as the final source of knowledge in popular estimation, science begins to look a bit like another religion itself\\" (p 11). It is not clear, just what, if anything, His Holiness suggests should be the final source of knowledge. The book is not heavily philosophical and so does not discuss epistemology (theories of knowledge). A recurring theme is the important role of practice and discipline; so perhaps in this sense, knowledge alone is insufficient to create the kind of disposition advocated in the book.Little is said about economics, but readers may well wonder if the compassion and altruism advocated here are compatible with the workings of free-market economy which is based on competition. His Holiness again admits that his knowledge of economics is limited (p195), but he suggests \\"the relationship between empathy and profit is necessarily fragile. Still, I do not see why it should not be possible to have constructive competition. The key factor is the motivation of those engaged in it. ... But when competition is conducted with a spirit of generosity and good intention, the outcome, although it must entail a degree of suffering for those who lose, will at least not be too harmful.\\" It is not pure altruism, of course, that he is suggesting, but rather a form of enlightened self interest (p127).On the whole, this is a positive, feel-good book that I enjoyed reading, with lots of practical suggestions for ethical living that are phased in clear, simple language. It forms an interesting contrast with other more confrontational bestsellers I've read recently that also seek to create change."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This is an eye-opener for all those who believe that ethics and morals can just be dismissed or trodden on. HH makes it quite clear that we cannot expect to survive the onslaught of technological advances and increasing comfort-based living without knowing HOW to live, first and foremost, and what our values must be."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"In the final chapter of his book, Ethics For the New Millennium, the Dalai Lama encourages all to 'use the present well.' We cannot turn back the clock and fix the past; we cannot predict the future; all we can do is try to live the best and happiest life possible in the here and now.While not an avid reader of non-fiction, and not overly enthused with supposed 'feel-good,' or 'self-help' books, this was neither. In 'Ethics,' the Dalai Lama has written a fascinating, wonderful, enlightening read. It is neither 'preachy' nor demanding, rather a guiding light of sorts, a hint at how to more easily come by happiness on our own, that we have the power to make our lives of a better quality.The Dalai Lama is not a healer. He does not possess mystical powers to 'fix' our lives. Neither is he a deity, although a Tibetan Monk living in exile. However, his words of peace and harmony, and a possible method for achieving those in our lives by simply 'using the present well' and 'doing unto others' is a source of inspiration and tranquility.While occasionally naive in the belief of a deep down desire of all to live a life that is happy and free of suffering, the Dalai Lama's perspective is indeed refreshing. His takes on world events, war, religion, sex, and the daily lives of all people, regardless of race, creed, location, or religious faith, is amazing, perhaps attained in his world travel as a lecturer and provider of spiritual elightenment.While never pressing the Buddhist belief and way of life, a simple view of it is offered. The suggestion is then made to adapt your own beliefs and values, and religious teachings, into a conscious effort to live your life to its fullest; to treat others around you with dignity and respect, thereby enriching your own life.Touching upon all aspects of life, how we treat ourselves, how we treat others, and how we treat the earth itself, Ethics For the New Millennium is a wondeful read, and a treatise on happiness that I will draw from for my own peace and serenity for years to come."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"In his essay _Self-Reliance_, Ralph Waldo Emerson observes, 'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' This seems an appropriate way to describe one of the feelings invoked while I read H.H. the Dalai Lama's _Ethics for a New Millennium_; much of the message felt as if it was intuitive and deceivingly simplistic. Recognizing the sameness of people. Alleviating suffering. Practicing compassion. Yet on closer examination, it is clear that the practical application of these truths in daily life requires rigorous effort.At least by Emerson's standard then, _Ethics for a New Millennium_ is a work of genius. One that gently reminds us of the proper way to treat others, and shows us we already know the way. It is also a call asking us to recognize the need for a modern, common secular ethic which transcends dogmatic differences. The proposal is that by practicing individually the compassion for others we inherently know is the best way to live, and which is espoused by most world religions, we might inspire others to do the same. A skeptic may dissent, but it seems clear to me that this approach can do little harm, and has great potential for good.While being an instructional text, I found the tone of _Ethics for a New Millennium_ conversational. One of my favorite parts of the book was a glimpse of the author as human being. In discussing his interest in watches, watch repair, and his watch collection, the Dalai Lama shows that he is much more a human than an icon - thereby providing an example of the sameness of all people.However, I feel I got more out of this work after first reading _The Art of Happiness_ by H.H. the Dalai Lama and Howard C. Cutler. _Ethics for a New Millennium_ is primarily a theoretical outline, with a chapter or two that can be somewhat challenging. _The Art of Happiness_ is written largely by a psychiatrist, and is based upon his interviews with the Dalai Lama and watching him at several speaking engagements in the United States. While presenting much of the same conceptual material, it does so with more examples from the everyday lives of individuals.In short, _Ethics for a New Millennium_ is slightly more discourse than illustration, while _The Art of Happiness_ is slightly more illustration than discourse. For a newcomer, I would suggest reading them in the order I did; _The Art of Happiness_ and then _Ethics for a New Millennium_."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I think this is one of the better books, addressing all important ethical, moral ideals for this century...It was just what I needed in a time when I was diagnosed with a fatal disease.

Although I gained some insight in a number of areas, I didn't find the agruments compelling enough to reach someone who isn't already familiar with the ethics. As a book which is supposedly aimed towards people who aren't already familiar with applying some of the concepts in their life, I found the treatise too difficult to follow. There were not enough practical suggestions, implementations or meditation suggestions to help someone really find what to do.As a philosophical treatise explaining the logic of ethical and compassionate behavior, I found it was too drawn out and read like intellectual acrobatics. I am an admirer of HHDL, and I have read some of his other books, but found this one did not really hit the mark."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This is truly a beautiful book.

The healing art that I practice is called The Way of Beauty and with it I have helped cases of everything from migraines and insomnia to infertility, strokes, and ovarian cancer but the art that the Dalai Lama practices could be called the way of happiness and it works on our spirits and our hearts. He is an incredible man with a beautiful perspective on life.Read this book, it can change your life as it gently shows you ways to improve.

For me, therefore, the book was a bit difficult to get through (something that could have been said in one sentence, was carried out for 2-3 paragraphs - this could be due to the translation). Most of what he discussed seems to be common sense - ideals that most of us want to achieve in order to establish a more peaceful existence. I wasn't overly blown away by anything he wrote, although I was amazed at the calmness that reverberated throughout his words. The man seems to have no anger within him, and in that sense, reading this book has a rather calming effect; but for some reason I had a difficult time getting through his long-windedness, at times I found myself skimming in order to get to his next idea or topic."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Ethics for the New Millenium is an awesome book.

There is nothing in this book that hasn't been available to us for many years through western spiritual tradition and it fails for the same reason those traditions do.The heart of compassion is not a philosophical concept,it is a felt experience.It can only become a way of being in beings who have achieved a degree of balance and integration in body/mind/spirit.

That means accepting the idea of free will, which is critical to the justification for the prevalence of violence and torture under Judeo-Christian(JCM) rule. (Buddhism too has faults, although this one may be less significant; Communism we all know; of others I know nothing.) Free will means that anyone who does bad things must be a tool of the devil, and should therefore be punished severely as a lesson for others to obey those more esteemed in the hierarchy of their religion. Conversely, those who do good should be rewarded by their Supreme Being and revered by us. Thus we can have in the US a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; who, without hypocrisy, can advocate ever harsher punishments (even for victimless &quot;crimes&quot;), more deaths, more guns, tax benefits for the rich, a &quot;Christian Nation&quot;, etc. The doctrine may destroy civilization, but it is a mere article of faith without a shred of evidence or any viable proposed mechanism.The cycle of repression, war, and genocide will never be broken so long as the doctrine of free will reigns supreme.BTW, &quot;His Holiness&quot;, however fine a person he may be, is no holier than you or I. Few more obvious beneficiaries of good fortune can be found anywhere."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"While I admit it takes lack of humility to criticize the writings of such an important world leader, I cannot say the book made the profound impact on me it seems to have made on others.His message is loud and clear: Follow &quot;the golden rule&quot; and the world will be a better place to live in. I do not wish to dispute this gem of wisdom when it comes to everyday dealings with people. I do, however, think his application of this on the international political level is misguided, wrong, and quite frankly, none of His Holiness' business.He does not seem to recognize that war is not a manifestation of a lack of compassion in people. Rather it is the only means ever known to man for oppressed peoples to gain dignity and to ensure the conditions for their continued prosperity. Americans who pride themselves as such would certainly be hypocritical to disagree with this viewpoint since it is only with past successes in war that America is what it is today and it is only with the worlds largest nuclear arsenal can it ensure its position going forward. This is as much a fact of the human condition as our vital organs and biological functions. Remove any of these and we cease to be human. Even the Dalai Lama admits that this is an unsolvable paradox.The view that everything and everyone is interconnected is a truly inspiring perspective, as is the recognition that we all want to be happy and avoid suffering, but sometimes short term suffering needs to be endured in order to achieve longer term lasting happiness. War is one example. Another is NOT providing aid to impoverished nations. By giving bits and pieces of food and medicine to poor countries we are alleviating suffering for a few people for a few moments but are prolonging the suffering of entire populations for generations to come. This perspective is almost purposely ignored in the book, giving the impression that the true purpose of the book is akin to that of any major religion -- ie to instill guilt on the masses to keep them focused on themselves so they don't consider threatening the world's power centers --taking care, however, to leave out the hocus pocus not because of any new revelation, but because the falsehood of any hocus pocus can be easily verified by schoolchildren with the advent of modern telecommunications.If you, the prospective reader, can sympathize with my comments, save your time and money and watch about an hour of CNN International. The message is exactly the same."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Put the needs of others before yourself. This is the key point that is stressed in this book.For the past five years or so, I've put myself through tremendous mental and emotional stress - trying to be overly competitive in the workplace, focused on making as much money as possible, and achieving numerous material possessions such as a nice house and car. While I've been successful at achieving these things, I've also been incredibly unhappy.In the first chapter of this book, the Dalai Lama describes his perception of Western Life - that the pursuit of selfish material gains often leads to mental and emotional stress (precisely my predicament).Although many of the concepts in this book are both simple and obvious, I believe anyone can learn to become a better person by following the guidelines presented in the text - and hopefully become happier as well."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Despite being a book by the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, this is not a religious work. Nor is it spiritual or a plea to act against the miserable state of Tibet. It is as void of pretence as a scientific book on ethics. Well, which is what it is: a scientific, sociologic book on ethics.But the Dalai Lama manages to make more from it. He is teaching the reader on his subject, not by preaching or swaying, but purely by illustrating and logic. He doesn't use easy language the entire time, nor does he put everything in metaphor or make a thrilling story of it. Yet, there is something between the lines of exposition with which he manages to instil on the reader that he speaks words of wisdom and truth.I could find only one word that describes this text accurately: convincing. This is the sort of book that, upon finishing, needs to be read again - purely out of angst that the lesson you have just received, might dissipate with time. It leaves you feeling that with a little patience and devotion, you will be a happier, warmer person.This book needs no preaching or swaying, this book will make you stand up and act out of own impulse.

The Dalai Lama masterfully articulates some of the most important principals that are set forth by the Buddhist religion into understandable everyday language. When these principals are applied to one's life the effects are dramatic and carry incredible impact. He makes a point of the fact that this life is a journey and that we must continually be mindful of these principals. He quite skillfully is able to breakdown what can sometimes seem like a hectic and empty existance into very simply understood terms. Pointing out that all humans have two main desires; to acheive happiness and avoid suffering. He goes on to give seemingly simplistic, but often overlooked guidelines in order to acheive these two main desires. He links many of these thoughts with superb logical reasoning.

Their arguments were brilliant, intricate, innovative and often too convoluted to be understood by those who do not hold a theological degree.His Holiness the Dalai Lama has given us something new in the field of ethics. He has provided us with a thoroughly accessible system of ethics. More over, His Holiness' writings are as valid for atheists and agnostics as they are for theists.

His Holiness gives practical yet powerful ideas on how we can all pull together to insure a better future for humanity. The third chapter on the Buddhist concept of dependent origination might be a bit hard for some to get through, but it is well worthwhile.

To live life daily without judging one another. To live simply, so that one does not need to feel anxious about many things. To let go of pettiness and look at the bigger picture. In the movie \\"Casablanca\\" (set during WWII) in the last scene, Humphrey Bogart says to Ingrid Bergman's husband, Paul Henreid, I will paraphrase: \\"Our lives that encompasses the three of us is small compared to the needs of the world\\". St. Francis of Asissi also leaves us with his legacy, of love and peace. \\"Let there be peace on earth, and let it begin with me\\". Even though we are a small voice in a loud world, every one of us can make a difference by following these universal truths that the Dalai Lama and other prophets have practiced."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Looking back over the last 5,000 years, it appears to me that all religions have focused on the preservation of their own particular brand of cultural and social ethics under the name of religion and by and large have ignored the more important and universal spiritual ethics that underlie all religions. The same can be said of many New Age courses that have sprung up like mushrooms all over the globe, where the emphasis appears to be more on gaining power and getting what you want out of life as opposed to an inner spiritual evolvement. This has bothered me for some time. However, reading the Dalai Lama's &quot;Ethics for the New Millenium&quot; was like a breath of fresh air and a home coming where I can rest my own inner beliefs which up until now, I have not found an example of in any other author. We teach our children dogma, we teach them ritual, we teach them salvation in one form or another, but do we ever teach them simple spiritual ethics, for example, don't steal. I don't mean the obvious, as in stealing someone else's possessions, I mean theft on a more personal scale, as in stealing somebody's time, somebody's energy by either moaning and bringing them down with our own sorry tales or getting other people to do things for us when we are too lazy to do it for oursleves. Or, in the name of frienship, inviting a whole lot of people to a dinner party, not because they are truly our friends, but because we ourselves are bored or want to look popular. It is to these inner disciplines that the Dalai Lama looks and it is about time too. If more people adopted the principles he advocates in this book, there might just be a chance for peace, both in the microcosm of the family unit and in the macrocosm of the world at large. The void, the emptiness that many societies try to fill with a hamburger, might instead be filled with inner serenity and confidence as opposed to frutration and depression."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Having read with great interest a lot of the Dalai Lama's other books, I found this one easily the most compelling. The language is simple and direct which has the effect of making some very complex ideas easy to understand. The Dalai Lama emerges as someone with a thorogoing understanding of human nature. But whereas his image is generally of someone who is limitlessly patient and benign, in this book he clearly shows that he has both depth and edge.The Dalai Lama makes a very clear connection between human happiness and what he calls inner discipline. He also makes clear that it is not really meaningful to speak of compassion except in the context of self-restraint. This shows that Buddhism is much more than the feel-good religion it is sometimes taken for in the west. It also shows that Buddhist ethical thinking is much closer to traditional Judeao-Christian and even Catholic social teaching than one might suppose. In fact when this is taken on board it becomes much easier to understand the Dalai Lama's near insistence that people stick to the religious tradition of their own culture.One of the most remarkable things about this book is his assertion that each of the major faith traditions are effective means of attaining human happiness. Stranger still for a major religious leader is his statement that, although religion is helpful, it is not actually essential if we are to be happy. What is essential is that we develop what he calls our basic human qualities. The first of these are love and compassion, but he also talks a lot about patience, tolerance, generosity and humility - each of which presuppose a degree of self discipline.It is tempting to write the Dalai Lama off as an oddity - especially given the way he seems all too ready to cosy up to celebrities. But reading this book, you begin to get the feeling that there really is something going on inside his head. In none of his other books have I been able to detect the intelligence, the cogence and the incisiveness that is so obvious even through the sometimes mangled translations when you see him in the flesh.As a would-be Catholic I can also say that the Dalai Lama's spiritual teachings are as relevant as any from within my own tradition. Is there any way the Pope could make him a Cardinal!?"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Every single person, and especially those with the power to harm others through their corporate or government roles, should read this book.The Dalai Lama begins by recognizing that religion is no longer providing an ethical compass for the majority of us, and ends by recommending a world parliament of religions (just as some believe a world parliament of cultures is also needed to represents nations without states).At it's most fundamental, this easy to read and very practical book is about obeying the Golden Rule--or a variation of the physician's rule, &quot;first do no harm.&quot;This is not a book for mantra lovers. At its most strategic level, the book focuses on the fact that the problems facing nation-states and entire societies cannot be solved in the absence of ethical restraint. Technology and law enforcement can address deviants in the minority, but not a majority that chooses deviance as a routine lifestyle.This is the first book I have encountered in my religious reading that actively respects all other religions as well as personal ethical systems apart from religion. In essence, the Dalai Lama calls for each person to restore their spiritual base, either by honoring their chosen religion, or by adopting a personal ethical philosophy that is consistent with the generic teachings of various religions.At a very personal level, as I read this book I saw clearly how my competitive and confrontational instincts, honed over a half century by a &quot;dog eat dog&quot; culture, have in fact hurt me and hurt others. I was reminded by this book that a Nobel Prize has been awarded to those showing that trust lowers the costs of business transactions--Fukiyama managed to get an entire book out of that one word. Reflecting on this book, and its measured discussion of how each of us simply seeks happiness and avoidance of suffering, caused me to reflect on how often each of us reduces the happiness of others and impose suffering through rudeness, harm by omission (not sharing useful information) and in other more aggressive ways.On a global scale, and very consistent with other social science works on the complexity and inter-connectedness of the world, the book clearly addresses the urgent need for major world powers to understand that our existing life style and its damage to world resources is both unaffordable and suicidal. This book on ethics applies to Nations and to organizations, not just to individuals. It is a very elegant &quot;dummy's guide to survival in the 21st Century.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I love the way the Dalai Lama writes. &quot;Ethics for a New Millennium&quot; reads beautifully and quite accessibly. I did have to put the book down once in a while though to fully take in the implications of what the Dalai Lama has written. This book is about ethics which the Dalai Lama thinks are important for all humans in our wish and quest to be happy and to avoid suffering. The book is not about magical solutions or about Buddhism (no magic, no mystery, as he puts it). However, a number of Buddhist concepts are explained in the book, because it seems the Dalai Lama cannot find their exact equivalents in Western thought.In the first chapter, the Dalai Lama critiques Western civilisation in the most lucid and convincing ways. He speaks of the anxiety, uncertainty, and frustration that plague Western people's minds and causes them to suffer mentally and emotionally even though they live in relative comfort and technological advance. To his mind, this gap between outer appearance and inner reality implies confusion regarding morality and what it constitutes.The Dalai Lama does not dispute the importance of Scientific enquiry but if we were to go to a nuclear physicist, he says, and say: &quot;I am facing a moral dilemma, what should I do?&quot;, he or she would suggest we look elsewhere for an answer. Science is unable to tell us how we ought to act in a moral sense.The Dalai Lama calls for a spiritual revolution. The essence of this spiritual call is acting out of concern for the well-being of others. But it also entails changing ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so. Thus, in essence, he calls for compassion, a lot of it. But why? Why should I become compassionate? Because by becoming so, I become more at peace with myself, happier, less prone to suffering. However, it is not easy to become compassionate overnight. So, he recommends a number of ethics that can help us so that we become more readily disposed to show compassion.The first ethic is Restraint; and to put this quite vividly, I shall use an example he gave: the undisciplined mind is like an elephant! If left to blunder around without control, it will wreak havoc. But the best description was that if we do not restrain our selfish, negative thoughts, we effectively alienate ourselves from ourselves!The second ethic is Virtue; this is quite simply really. Just give lots of love, be patient and tolerant, forgive, and be humble! That's all. No seriously, there are a couple of tips to help you do that.The third ethic is Compassion. This is a kind of motivational goal; a higher spiritual state in which compassion arises without any effort, is unconditional, undifferentiated, and universal in scope.The book extends to beyond these three ethics to societal ethics, and it also contains a chapter on Peace and Disarmament. Also, the early part of the book dwells on the nature of our consciousness.This is the first book I have read by the Dalai Lama and is probably not going to be the last. If you're searching for some inner peace, I certainly don't think this book would harm it. But try not to read it all in one go!"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Those familiar with the Dalai Lama's writings will see much that is familiar here. The concept and practice of compassion is presented as the foundation of ethics, and there is a great deal of discussion of how to implement a compassionate (and therefore ethical) lifestyle. However, this book should be very carefully read because there is a lot more to it than that.It is easy, given the Dalai Lama's easy, conversational style of writing, to miss some very, very important concepts. Nearly every page of this book offers a startling insight - but you have to take your time, slow down, and notice what is being said. It is well worth the time.One critical point is raised in the book that I wish had been explored in greater detail. The Dalai Lama expresses the opinion that the dominant culture of &quot;unlimited economic growth&quot; is a serious problem for all of us, both on a personal and societal level. Unfortunately, the unlimited economic growth model is something that is rarely, if ever, questioned today. Companies make money, and so do their shareholders, by growing - by selling more cars, more oil, more land, more whatever than they did last quarter. If they don't, the stock price goes down and heads roll. The problems with this economic model are so obvious in terms of the damage it inflicts on the planet and us as its inhabitants - yet we seem unable to even recognize it as a problem.This book deals with serious problems. It forces us to look at our assumptions and behaviors as individuals and as a society. Yet it does so in a way that is ultimately hopeful - the Dalai Lama is apparently a born optimist. And I would feel a lot more optimistic myself if only there was more than one of him."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This book has plenty to offer in a material world. The most important is that people have to knock off the my god is better than your god nonsense. If you cant't fathom the edge of the universe it isn't likely you can fathom god. But read this book then read Tears of Blood / A Cry for Tibet by Mary Craig...Then Get your self on line with savetibet.org or call 1-888-tibet now and understand the entire struggle of this david against the most brutal goliath the world has ever known. The best part about the Dalai Lama as David is that he doesn't even use a sling shot only truth and honesty to win his battle."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Rather like dancing in a new club to strange music you've always avoided, there is always a bit of shame involved in coming to terms with yourself. And it's almost a cliche that this is what Eastern Philosophy does to us out here in the West.Nevertheless, within 30 pages, the Dalai Lama has created with precise and accessible language, a framework for understanding those things that seem ever to torment us: the divide between religion and spirituality, the mystery of causation and existence, the quandries of material progress and scientific achievement amid depression, stress and anxiety. You'd hardly believe such things could be negotiated so quickly and effortlessly, but that is a Western sucker's bet, and this genius of a man has done that and so much more.I hesitate to give any further clues as to what he writes so clearly. Yet I can assure you that upon completing this book you will feel so much more a part of the world of humanity, that you might even be ashamed at your previous distance. That sounds hokey, for sure. But then isn't there always something reassuring about the hokey?I loved this book. Now I feel like going out and dancing with strangers."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Don't let the simplicity of this book overshadow the power of its message: \\"When the driving force of our actions is wholesome, our actions will tend automatically to contribute to others' well-being. They will thus automatically be ethical.\\" With the courage to point out that religion is not a requirement for ethical behavior, the Dalai Dama discusses virtue, compassion, and our spiritual connection to the world. He does so as a simple and honest man without holding himself as holier than anyone else. Describing how humans can make a constructive difference on the planet, he appeals to people to tap their highest potential and to go for their personal goodness, despite the social currents that discourage one from doing so.This is a book about discovering your ethics rather than just acting out cultural norms. If you appreciate simplicity of style and communication based on real substance, allow me to also recommend \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. In an age of widespread doubt, these two books are refreshing reminders that the principles underlying a fulfilling life are both simple and practical."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This is only the second book I have read by His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, and I could not put this one down! While it is recognized that what is being discussed in this book is really nothing new, the Dalai Lama has presented the ideas in such a way as to make them seem new. And yes, while the book does contain a Buddhist flavor despite the attempt to stay away from any particular religious thought, one still should applaud the effort. And that is another item that makes this book so refreshing - the ability to discuss spiritual (not religious) and/or ethical concepts without the narrow-minded approach of My-Way-Is-The-Only-Way.I think that this presentation is especially important for US culture. We need to get away from the self-centered &quot;Me&quot; way of thinking, and move towards &quot;We.&quot; To stop being so selfish and start taking other people into account. You don't need a bible or someone shouting from a pulpit to tell you how to be kind and giving. It's a part of our human nature, and it's a bit of common sense thinking."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"The Dalai Lama proposes a spiritual revolution. This I found interesting. I found even more interesting his definition of spiritual: &quot;Thus spiritual practice involves, on the one hand, acting out of concern for others' well-being. On the other, it entails transforming ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so.&quot;The Dalai Lama points to a neglect of our &quot;inner dimension&quot; as the fundamental cause of the disharmony of our societies. And so this book, and his call for a spiritual revolution, is a &quot;call for a radical reorientation away from our habitual preoccupation with self. It is a call to turn toward the wider community of beings with whom we are connected, and for conduct which recognises others' interests alongside our own.&quot; He is not claiming that all we need to do is to cultivate spiritual values and then these societal problems will automatically disappear. He acknowledges the need for specific solutions to each of our problems, but &quot;when this spiritual dimension is neglected, we have no hope of achieving a lasting solution&quot;Reading his wisdom and his clarity on matters that I intuit, but can't speak of with such certainty, brought a sense of relief and peace. It is an easy read, in the sense that his language is simple and clear, but it is tough in that he reminds us of the discipline and commitment it takes to develop our character and disposition to act out of concern for others, and make the rest of our life as meaningful as possible."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Great book for every one to read!!!!!!It makes the perfect gift to anyone."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This book is a nonjudgemental approach to ethics. I have incorporated it as a text for my ethics course for helping professionals because, although the Dalai Lama acknowledges his Buddhist beliefs, he approaches ethical issues from outside the framework of any one particular religion or culture. This makes it an ideal perspective for working with or relating to people from all backgrounds. The lessons are simple, but profound."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I had to read this book for an ethics class, and found that it offered many good points regarding society's behaviors as well as some tips to living more ethical lives.

For another interesting book on the subject, try &quot;The Lone Ranger's Code of the West -- an adventure in values and ethics.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Simple, straight forward argument for compassion and tolerance, the christian protestant or catholic, the atheist, the jew or gentile can't or rather shouldn't have any problem with this. Lovely and uplifting read."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"The ideas that the 14th Dalai Lama suggests in this book are excellent, but the main problem, as always in the case of ethics, is that the people who are most likely to read this book are the ones who are least likely to need this advice; and the ones who most need to follow these suggestions are those who are least likely to bother. The approach is here is purely ethical -- there is really no talk of religion, and this makes the book equally applicable to Buddhist, Jew, Hindoo, Jain, Parsee, Christian, Muslim, Wiccan, Satanist, Setian, Santerian, agnostic, atheist and so on. The idea he uses is that regardless of one's religious or philosophical persuasions, that everyone is seeking after happiness, and that certain forms of conduct are more conducive to one's own happiness as well as to the happiness of others. One of the primary things that he emphasises is the state of one's heart and mind in the performing of any deed -- in law this would be called motive or intent, and for practical purposes, it could be called &quot;goodwill&quot;, but the Dalai Lama chooses to introduce some rather unhelpful Tibetan terms instead. The measure of the morality of an action is based upon the goodwill and intent of the person performing the action. Thus any sort of action that a person performs, to be purely ethical, must be accompanied by goodwill and the intent of non-injury to others. This requires also not returning evil for evil, so in effect, what he is doing is merely restating Kant's categorical imperative in a much less intimidating and accessible way, but he does not seem to realise that the purging of all ill-will and lack of compassion and love from a person's heart is really a lifelong task which most people never are able to fully accomplish. Loving your enemies, having respect for others regardless of their actions and feeling a sense of goodwill towards all are wonderful concepts, and make great ideals to strive towards, but to put them into practice is very difficult. To change the state of one's heart is no small undertaking and it is something that requires continual vigilance, self-possession and effort -- especially when one is under pressure to do the exact opposite by one's natural instincts. As always, we know what needs to be done, bu how exactly we are to do it -- how we are to put it into practice in our daily lives -- this is the problem, and it remains unsolved here as always. The Dalai Lama himself is a good example of what he is suggesting -- despite most of his friends being butchered by the Chinese during the invasion and takeover of Tibet, and being forced from his homeland, he seems to have no sense of hostility or hatred towards the Chinese . . . but this is something that occurs within the heart of the individual . . . how many of us in similar situations would be able to react in the same way . . . even if we wanted to? Emotions are not usually subject to reason. This book is great for forming a sort of ideal to live by, but then again there is a huge difference between ideals and praxis, and the uniting of the one with the other requires a mastery of the self, and not merely a set of rules to follow, and that is a very tall order. A good read, but offers no real solutions as all solutions are within each and every one of us -- and for his ideas to work, people have to make momentous efforts to apply them within their own lives -- not just a few here and there, but all of us -- and that is now, as it has always been, the real problem of ethics. The people who read books like this are already trying to master themselves, and thus do not need such books. Those who cause most of the hurt and strife in the world will not even bother. Still, the best any of us can do is to change ourselves. As Gandhiji once said: &quot;You must be the change that you wish to see&quot;. But it is still much, much easier said than done."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"In our pop-culture, push-it-in-your-face, do-what-you-can-get-away-with world that seems to lack structured ethical institutions that are widely respected, this book describes the effects that create unneeded suffering among our species, and all sentient creatures.But most of the book optimistically explains the cause & positive effect logic behind ethical behaviours in different areas of human endeavour. These things need to be said, although they can't be contained in a pop-culture sound bite. He builds his case carefully, logically, and with practical suggestions. You just have to look around to see the validity of his message. Bless him."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Gotta love the Dalai Lama - he has much to speak of and tell the world. We should all listen to his perspective on ethics. We all need ethics in our lives. The Dalai Lama is very wise and peaceful - a wonderful role model. This book is an enlightening read; it is informative and causes one to think about his words and ponder their own lives and actions. I read this book for my college Ethics course. It was a great book that took us throughout the course material throughout the quarter. Interesting concepts arise, and no doubt you will be thinking hard after reading this book. Not a bad thing at all! We need more Ethics in this world we are living in."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"In Ethics for the New Millennium, the Dalai Lama introduces a new way to consider ethics, very different from the views of Kant, Mill, and Socrates. It is a passionate explanation that says we do not need to consider a deity or religion to understand that it is compassion that should drive our ethical behavior. A compassion for other sentient beings who seek to maximize happiness and minimize suffering: a core Buddhist teaching. After setting this foundation, the Dalai Lama then expands upon the idea, giving us examples of how we can implement these strategies into our lives as individuals and then what changes would help ease this process in society. The overhaul will not be quick and easy, but when it is applied to your life, it has the potential - he guarantees it will - to increase your happiness; not with material happiness that lasts only temporarily, but spiritual happiness that will last for the rest of your lifetime."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This was the first book that I have read by the Dalai Lama and I am intrigued to learn much more about Buddhism. This book was wonderful. It was so easy to read and follow. It really struck a chord with me.

This is one of those books. It is not a book about Buddhism. It is not a book about religion. Yet I am confident that most people will find the core values of their faith in these pages. \\"Ethics\\" is a book about morality. It teaches the reader how we benefit individually from living our lives in an ethical manner as well as how society as a whole benefits. And it describes how society suffers, and we suffer, when our actions are immoral and self-serving.The Dalai Lama starts off his book, appropriately, by discussing the foundation of ethics. What is the foundation of ethical behavior? On what basis do we judge an act to be ethical? And how does our lack of ethical behavior not only affect the happiness of others but our own happiness as well? I feel that any discussion of ethics must address these questions, and the Dalai Lama provides sound answers. He then follows this first section with several chapters devoted to ethics for the individual, specifically addressing virtue, compassion, and restraint. The discussion continues with a discussion of ethics and suffering, and finally a chapter on ethical discipline. In the last section, the Dalai Lama addresses ethics and society, covering such topics as universal responsibility, peace and disarmament, and the role of religion in modern society.In the beginning of his book, the Dalai Lama calls for a spiritual revolution. He then goes on to describe what he feels each of us must do, individually, to bring about such a revolution on a global scale. And it all boils down to ethical behavior at an individual level. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the study of morality and how it affects each of us and the world as a whole."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This book is not a religious statement. The Dalai Lama is one of the worlds most pragmatic visionaries. His advice and insights are down to earth, practical and greatly needed. His most important advice may be to never think a problem is to large or that you are to small to help. In short this is a book everyone and anyone should take a look at. It is not about the horrors of Tibet but a simple straight forward world view. Best of all it does not preach and the Dalai Lama counts on his readers being able to think and adapt what he has to say.

Now 8 months into the new millennium, most people's lives haven't changed much. The result has been, depression, frustration and for many illness, some terminal. Giving up as if the millennium had let them down. As his holiness states so wisely, in his practical yet powerful book, the human spirit and happiness must come from the inside. Only when we have caring and compassion and a desire to help others will our lives be different.

The most profound was the revelations regarding what every person is looking for in terms of happiness.

Remembering that we are all connected and we should always remember that considerations should extend beyond our visual range."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Reading this book is like sitting with a friend who shares the benefits of a great deal of his insight. It is a little lengthy, and could be easier to read, but its contents overshadow any drawbacks.It is obvious that the Dalai Lama has spent a long time studying human nature and philosophy, and this book gives everyone the opportunity to share in that knowledge. I particularly enjoyed the discussion on happiness; that some activities bring pleasure only because they are transitory. And the example that the pleasure one derives from the finest meal lasts only until the next time they are hungry.An excellent book."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This is the latest of books written for the general public by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Forced to flee his homeland in 1959 when China invaded Tibet, he has lived in exile in India ever since, and has been exposed to other religions and the modern world.This book has one simple message: compassion for others is the key to saving the world. A person doesn't have to be religious to do this. Indeed, there have been many abuses in history by people professing to follow one religion or other. The message he brings, however, is directly to individuals and it is call to move away from self-centeredness and care about others.The book is a beacon of hope because it makes the reader feel that a better world is possible. He recognizes also that we are not perfect, but holds up the concept as these ethical values as a goal to aspire to. Its all about basic human goodness and striving to be a better person.The way to enjoy this book is just to get into the flow of it. It's not an easy book to read because it lacks a lot of anecdotes. There is no dialog. And the paragraphs all seem the same size and say essentially the same thing. It is easy to be bored. But the message is so important that is it is worthwhile pushing on, feeling the tone of his words, and his message which, essentially, is the way to save the world."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I went to his gathering in Portland where he shared the contents of this book verbally in a distilled form. Much of the talk was identical to passages in the book. He recommends that the religions have tolerance and respect for each other. He shares an ethic that is fairly modern and shows how much he has changed since his earlier times. The message is very basic, many liberal philosophers have advocated the same thing. It is good that the Dalai Lama has put his voice in support of such views. I do feel that, mere ethics is not enough, we need the practice of meditation for our hearts to transform and to become sensitive enough to see where we are not compassionate with each other, so that we can let go of the three poisons of the mind and become free. I found such a transformation and its necessity was not emphasized that much in this book. Perhaps he wanted people to get this more important point from other books he had written. I also personally would like it if those ethics included animals and not eating them, a point that I feel Guatama Buddha emphasized. I would have also liked if he emphasized how important the feminist movement has been to have women included in those ethics. I gave it three stars rather than five, because although the message is good and positive, it seems to lack something for me. I do not get the feeling that such a message by itself is enough to shift the planet. I think more is needed."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Though self-consciously idealistic and at times maddeningly general, this book is profoundly insightful. What makes this palatable is that the Dalai Lama concedes his Buddhist biases, and then offers a framework for approaching to the worlds' problems (all of them!) that is independent of religion. Noting the danger of religion reinforcing self-centered notions, he references the common ground found in all religions, \\"overcoming suffering through the practice of ethical discipline and cultivation of love and compassion,\\" and advocates that we learn to reconcile our faith (or atheism) with the multiplicity of other possible faiths.In the first of three sections, The Foundation of Ethics, he highlights some of the world's problems, and questions material wealth as a solution to happiness, noting that material things may in themselves cause anxiety, frustration, and discontent. Though the humor was completely unintentional, I laughed at his recounting of visiting the home of a wealthy family and noticing the stockpile of meds in a medicine cabinet that happened to be ajar.The second section, Ethics and the Individual, functions sort of as a self-help book, though it's pretty insightful in a ways that sound obvious only once you've thought of it in the context of a given problem. For example, he notes that most people assume \\"discipline\\" is something that you impose against your will, but points out that \\"ethical discipline is something that we adopt voluntarily on the basis of full recognition of its benefits.\\" Later, he cites Shantideva and the central truism of Bodhisattva- basically, if you're confronting a problem that is solveable, then you must learn to immediately find the means to act on it; if the problem has no solution, then it's best not to worry about it.The final section, Ethics and Society, is by far the most ambitious, but also the most inspiring. The Dalai Lama notes that children in today's society are brought up to acquire knowledge, but not to learn compassion. The negative impact of this, he says, can be aggressive competitiveness toward peers, greed, and scorn for the less fortunate. Astutely, he attributes this to the historical separation of learning compassion outside of school in church- whereas today church has declined and schools haven't picked up the slack. Realistically, he suggests that schools address this gap by offering students substantial practice in ethical debate and non-violent conflict resolution. He suggests that \\"On seeing his parents wrangling, a child that had understood the value of dialogue would instinctively say, \\"Oh, no. That's not the way. You have to talk, to discuss things properly.\\"The Dalai Lama's biggest challenge is that he places on each individual some level of accountability for the corrupt leadership we so often blame for our problems. \\"When people possess healthy values, and where they practice ethical discipline in their own lives out of concern for others, the public officials produced by that society will quite naturally respect those same values.\\" The easiest criticism of the Dalai Lama (and my own, before reading this book), is that he is too idealistic. His answer, which unfortunately isn't that well backed up, is that ideals are \\"the engine of progress\\", that it is a mistake to always try to be realistic in politics as history is full of examples of positive changes driven by idealism."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"Honestly, who's going to give the Dalai Lama less than five stars? Few people in history have been more admired or deserved more respect. This man has been forcibly removed from his homeland and stood helplessly by as it has been systematically raped by China. Through it all, he has never wavered from the fundamental precepts of Buddhist teaching. He has shown nothing but compassion and respect to his oppressors and is rightly venerated by a world community in awe of his forbearance and strength of character. The Dalai Lama is a remarkable example and when he speaks about ethics, people listen.Fortunately, I can give him five stars and maintain my intellectual integrity, because this is an excellent book. It is a simple and open discourse about how to develop and follow a moral compass in the modern world. With lucid and earnest language, the Dalai Lama outlines the fundamental ideas of a system of ethics based on compassion and the cultivation of constructive emotions. The ideas in this book are not new. They amount to a principle that has become so time-worn that it has almost (unfortunately) clich&eacute;. To make the world and more peaceful and loving place, start with yourself.No magic here. But from a Nobel Peace laureate with such stature, the clich&eacute; is transformed. These principles, coming from the pen of this man, demand to be listened to.This book is an excellent guide to the \\"right\\" way to live, as well as a meaningful non-sectarian introduction to the tenets of Buddhist morality. It is also a persuasive appeal for each and every one of us to foster moral discipline, compassion and respect within ourselves. If you have not been exposed to the Dalai Lama's writings, this book good place to start. If you have, this book is among the most commendable of his works."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This book was written at the time of the change from the 20th to the 21st Century. The Dalai Lama used the change to the new Millenium as a call to ethical and spiritual reflection and to an awakening to a new, informed inner life.The book is eloquent and compelling. The Dalai Lama's command of English is somewhat limited, and the text undoubtedly was subject to substantial editing. But the sincerity and power of the book shines through, as does the Dalai Lama's modesty. It is something of a rarity for a book to sound the call to spiritual renewal while refusing to proselytize or to promote a specific creed.The Dalai Lama promises repeatedly that his book is concerned with ethics and spirituality rather than with Buddhist tenents. There is nothing in this book, for example, that even suggests the reader take up a meditiation practice. Although there is a substantial treatment of the difficult Buddhist teaching of Dependent Origination, the Dalai Lama makes good on his word. The book can be read and appreciated by people who are secular -- without a religious faith -- and by those who are committed to a faith tradition other than Buddhism.The Dalai Lama's basic message here, I think, is that all people strive to be happy. In the West, we tend to equate the pursuit of happiness with materialistic success. This goes part of the way to happiness but has difficulties in terms of the anxiety, competitiveness, and insenitiveness to ourselves and others that it creates. The Dalai Lama's answer, in common with much religious and spiritual writing, is to look inward. What is important is how the Dalai Lama elaborates his teaching in this book.The Dalai Lama insists that spiritual renewal requires a commitment to ethical behavior. There are two levels to this. The first, more basic level, is to act in a way that doesn't bring harm. This is a seemingly simple teaching, but one difficult to put in practice in specific situations. The second level is to aim to be other-directed rather than self-directed in one's actions. This means acting with patience, generosity, compassion, nonviolence, empathy, thought for the other person, rather than for oneself. For the Dalai Lama this second level underlies all spirituality and religious traditions and is more fundamental than any metaphysical or faith issues. People can disagree on the latter or not hold any religious position at all.After developing the foundations of what he sees as ethical and spiritual behavior, the Dalai Lama offers suggestions for the individual's redirection of him or herself in terms of restraint, virtue, compassion, and the relief of suffering. Again, I was struck by the modesty of the teaching and by the Dalai Lama's claim that spiritual redirection can be independent of the individual's commitment or lack of commitment to a religous creed. The Dalai Lama emphasizes at one point that &quot;we are not talking about Buddahood here&quot; but rather about how any individual can aim for ethical and spiritual redirection.A chapter in the final section of the book discusses &quot;the role of religion in modern society.&quot; The Dalai Lama explains his own commitment to Tibetan Buddhism but insists again that such commitment is unnecessary for the individual to redirect energy to the ethical/spiritual life. In fact, in this book the Dalai Lama discourages religious conversion but urges the reader to remain in his or her own faith and work within it. He maintains that all religions teach the same basic ethical and spiritual precepts while their metaphysical or faith commitments differ. He offers a plea that people from different faith traditions learn that they can learn much from each other while maintaining their own belief system. He reiterates that people shouldn't force themselves to have a religion at all if they are committed to a secular worldview.There is a great deal of wisdom and simplicity in this book. It may be valuable to those who want to consider redirecting or better understanding themselves."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"This work, much like his others, is comforting and enlightening. His Holiness has such a disarming and realistic view of the world and the way in which we should relate to others. Being part of the Western World and a capitalistic society, we can all use a little love, compassion and confirmation of our true interrelatedness with other people and creatures around us. Without bias and speaking from the heart, His Holiness the Dalai Lama encourages us to shed the skin of bigotry and learned hatred and tap into the core of our compassionate heart. Believing in yourself and your own thoughts instead of what is engrained into our subconcious and ruling mental compartments is crucial (and not superficial or cheesy) if we are to truly make a change in the world. Love comes back to the giver tenfold.Peace,Brynosaurus"},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"In this short volume the Dalai Lama speaks more clearly than ever before. &quot;Ethics&quot; is much more than a self-help book: it is a tablet on which we are guided to alter our perceptions, to not be afraid to repair our injured selves so that we can emerge from his words a more significant member of the cosmos of which we are a part. Rarely has &quot;compassion&quot; been so tenderly taught.This is a book to keep by your bed, to be read and re-read over a course of time to let your mind and dreams absorb the simplicity of the wisdom of this remakably gentle man."},{"Title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","review":"I recently watched the movie &quot;7 days in Tibet&quot; which inspired me to buy and read this book. EXCELLENT! His Holiness delves deep into the root problem we as human beings faced today. The book is centered around our loss for the human spirit which entails basic caring and concern or lack of it for the people who surround our lives. His approach is very practical and he is openly honest about things that he himself should do but fail to do as any normal human. I highly recommend this as a guide to regaining our senses around us as human beings."},{"Title":"The Book of Common Prayer [shhimo] of the Syrian Church","review":"Product arrived promptly and in good condition.

Yet, the one thing this book fails in setting forth is the myriad of gay men out there. Unless another gay guy is actually performing the same approaches as you in garnering a long-term relationship, the contents within this book are useless.Gay men, almost intrinsically by nature, are predominantly promiscuous, failing at ever attaining and nurturing something meaningful or ever-lasting. Gay relationships are not like their heterosexual counterparts of growth, success, stability, and true equal partnership. Instead, its based upon looks, financial opulence, and the hopes an open relatiopnship will definitely happen after the initial \\"romantic\\" spark has long flickered out . . .I commend the author for his analytical and structural prose. He makes a bold attempt at telling the reader what to do and what not to do -- such as accepting a guy with set attributes, like smoking, and not aiming for changing such characteristics. However, to assume and bestow credibility that other gay men out there yearn for a committed relationship (especially in this information age of \\"online gay bars\\" like personals and \\"chat\\"-rooms) and how to go about it is an actual disregard to a reader's integrity at best."},{"Title":"Mr. Right Is out There: The Gay Man's Guide to Finding and Maintaining Love","review":"-How do you find him? This is a difficult question for many people, but especially so for most gay men. The author, Dr. (Professor) Kenneth D. George starts by telling the reader not to internalize society's homophobic messages that gays are &quot;sick, deviant or abnormal&quot;. Gay men are entitled, in fact, empowered to have a workable LOVING relationship with another gay man. As Marianne Williamson says in her new book, Enchanted Love, we must &quot;Prepare to BE the beloved&quot;. As a gay doctor writing for gay men, Dr. George gives expert advice on doing the real work of discovering who we are, and what our strengths and weaknesses are before venturing on to discover &quot;Mr. Right&quot;. In a step by step, easy to understand plan (with DO-ABLE exercises and activities), Dr. George leads the reader through the mostly NOT so painful process of discovering what he needs to know about himself before he can enter into a LOVING RELATIONSHIP with another gay man.This is not a sex manual, although there is a chapter the reader will not want to miss --- on sex. Using actual people, the author explores the entire spectrum of the &quot;do's and don'ts&quot; of gay relationships. With chapters such as &quot;Being Emotionally Intimate&quot;, &quot;Becoming a Male Couple&quot; and &quot;Negotiating and Resolving Differences&quot;, be prepared to be challenged. If you are a younger gay man, this book will guide you in getting started on the right foot. If you are a mature gay man (what can I say?), then this book will help you see just what you might do differently as you FIND &quot;Mr. Right&quot;. There is little room for failure here. Dr. Kenneth D. George is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and runs a private practice in psychotherapy, working with gay single men and gay couples. It has taken many years for him to write this little book. He's been busy finding his own Mr. Right. He and his partner, Christopher Beck (an artist) have found each other. They celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary by enjoying a cruise on the Queen Elizabeth II --- a GAY cruise. In their vows to each other ...well, I'll let you read that for yourself.Charlie Perkins"},{"Title":"Mr. Right Is out There: The Gay Man's Guide to Finding and Maintaining Love","review":"For one, when I read a book and it changes my life I want to pass it on to my friends. If that is any inclination how this book possessed me, you should know that I have bought 5 other copies for friends.This book is beyond what words on this screen can say. Words that fit; Enlightening, Challenging, and Comprehensive. Not only will you reinvent yourself but you can completely outline what it is that you are looking for, in a healthy relationship.Being broken up recently from a relationship, that I should not have been in, this book helped me realize that the person I was with was Mr. Wrong and the only thing standing in my way from meeting Mr. Right, was myself...and the fact that I did not want to let go.Please take the time and read this book.

I was hoping this book would help me understand why I'm having problems with the perfect boyfriend.Well, this book helped a little but not much. It really is meant for those that are single and looking for Mr. Right. There are many activities that the author wants the reader to do to help him understand himself before he goes galavanting off into the next relationship. The book offers good advice, but I think the activities are kinda cheesy. One activity was to go to a restaurant by yourself. Now, I can see going to a diner by yourself for a quick meal, but the author was talking about a real restaurant. You're supposed to &quot;date yourself.&quot; That's just silly if you ask me. I would rather go out to dinner with a friend, someone to talk to. It's important to feel comfortable with yourself, but most of these activities seem to taken right out of a text book without much thought about how practical they really are.The books strong points, though, are in the text. It talks about keeping the sex great in a lasting relationship. It even talks about those that want to have open relationships and the possible benefits or consequences of that type of relationship. The book hit every point one could think of about the area of dating and relationships.I plan to hang on to this book for when my boyfriend and I break up (I see the end approaching). Maybe it will be of more use then. Until then, this is not meant for couples. It is meant for single people and I highly reccommend it to those that don't understand why they can't find a lasting relationship."},{"Title":"Mr. Right Is out There: The Gay Man's Guide to Finding and Maintaining Love","review":"I found Dr. George's book extraordinarily helpful and insightful. One of the aspects of this book which has earned my regard is the honesty and openness of his discussion. Particularly, his primary focus is doing the personal reflection and work on becoming ready for a relationship with another man. This is not a book about tips and hints and methods to attract men, but about creating a healthy mentality about relationships and emotional intimacy. He outlines several excises to help individuals think about and outline their own attitudes, opinions, and feelings. While some individuals with a great deal of relationship experience may find this book pedestrian, for the person who is struggling to build new relationships, even friendships, it is a supportive and hopeful tool."},{"Title":"Mr. Right Is out There: The Gay Man's Guide to Finding and Maintaining Love","review":"It's about time gay men had a book that wasn't women and men focussed.

Its words were very helpful in healing the pain of a lost relationship and building of a new one. It can certainly be used a reference manual and referred back to from time to time as relationships change, grow, and diminish.

Charlotte and William had never met before this so it is a bit of a challenge at first. Charlotte dips into acting and the basis of the story revolves around the acting class and her flirt with another actor in the class, Irish Colin.I thought there was more focus on this fling rather than the premise of Charlotte and her father getting to know each other. While it did reveal their new relationship, it didn't develop it as much as I think it should have.Overall an ok read but not what I thought it would be."},{"Title":"The Essential Charlotte","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

The \\"Ask the Doctor\\" research librarian is a bit off but not just because of the death of the only person who loved her (albeit from a distance). It is hard to believe because Corrine was filled with vigor and &eacute;lan traveling the globe as a nutty but likable artist.The will shakes Charlotte to the core because Corrine's stipulation for her daughter to inherit her Soho loft, she must live there for one year with her father, whom she thought died over three decades ago. Charlotte cannot even look at him so how is she to live with William LaViolette for one year. One thing is for sure it is not by seeing a hunk of an actor. Her only help lives in San Francisco, but Paul is there for her encouraging her as they talk over the Net; that is not counting her chats with mom.When the tale concentrates on a deep character study of what is THE ESSENTIAL CHARLOTTE, the story line is superb; when the subplot dips into chick lit turf it remains fun but typical candy fare. Overall Libby Schmais keeps her novel at the highest quality levels as readers become acquainted with Charlotte through her activities, discussions with her deceased mom, and the three males (dad, the actor, and Paul) currently in her life. Fans of powerful character-driven dramas will want to read the near perfect tale of how Charlotte finds her groove.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Essential Charlotte","review":"\`Charlotte' is an \\"essential\\" read!

Although not equal in difficulty, vocabulary, or style to my usual reading, I was thoroughly immersed in the characters and plot. The background theme, a woman required by her mother's will to live in an apartment with her formerly absent father, while initially far-fetched, played out nicely, and the relationships with friends and lovers were consistently engaging and plausible."},{"Title":"The Essential Charlotte","review":"I read The Perfect Elizabeth some years ago and thought I'd give Libby Schmais another whirl. The Essential Charlotte, like The Perfect Elizabeth, is another enchanting novel about getting to know a significant other in your life as well as oneself. Charlotte is a shy research librarian who lives on the edge by way of her eccentric mother, chic artist Corrine. But when her mother dies, Charlotte feels at a loss. The one good thing is that she'll inherit her mother's trendy Soho loft. But there is one condition: she has to live there with her father for one year. There is one problem: she doesn't know her father. In fact, she had no idea her father had been alive until after her mother died! How is she going to cope living with a stranger, even if he is her father? There are some twists throughout the novel.The Essential Charlotte is full of wit and charm. The backdrop of the art world as well as the obsession with New York real estate sets the perfect tone for this story. Charlotte is a great heroine and I was able to relate with her every day problems and inner musings. The novel sometimes drifted to the usual chick-lit, single-thirty-something-woman-living-in-New-York angst, but Schmais writes the aforementioned things with wit and insight and therefore making this novel unique. Her writing style is similar to the author Jennifer Weiner at times. I recommend The Essential Charlotte and I look forward to reading more stuff by this author."},{"Title":"The Essential Charlotte","review":"I loved the author's humor, wit and sensitivity. She really captures the emotions of loss, betrayal and loneliness of the main character, Charlotte. A was glad the ending was top your typical happy ever after."},{"Title":"The Essential Charlotte","review":"An easy, fun read along the lines of other \\"pink books\\" out these days, The Essential Charlotte is different because of its sense of innocence and its Jane Austen-ish portrayal of modern-day daily life.Whether intended or not, Schmais has managed to fit in all the mundane daily activities of most professional, single women of today's world - work and career, dating and the search for a partner, reproductive issues and decisions, dysfunctional family dynamics, the loss of parents - and create an image of life in society as a middle-class white, female.In the process, Schmais tells a sweet, sometimes funny story of Charlotte's quest for happiness (mirrored through her favorite computer game and spurred on by the voice of her dead mother).While I cannot credit Schmais with Austen's biting satirical and political undercurrents, The Essential Charlotte is fun and, although there is some sex, would be a good choice for that set of teen readers who are past juvenile fiction but still like a happy ending."},{"Title":"Possessions","review":"This book hurt. I usually can tolerate some silliness in pulp horror, but this book was awful. Moore makes Bentley Little look like James Joyce. A series of drawn out fight scenes makes up the plot. The main character took so many beatings and stayed alive that I thought we were heading towards an Unbreakable finale where he ends up being a superhero. Oh, and they also hit the lottery. This is not early Stephen King, this is more like early Don King.Skip this one."},{"Title":"Possessions","review":"Ever since his debut novel, Under The Overtree, the work of James A. Moore seems to be getting worse. He started off very promising, but fell a notch with Fireworks and now fell even further with Possessions. Like Fireworks, his books start off promising but two thirds of the way in take a nose dive. Almost the last hundred pages of Possessions is nothing but a continuous fight scene involving monster after monster, with excessive descriptions on the creepy creatures. Yes, Mr. Moore, I understand they are very yucky things. I don't need a hundred pages describing them! I get it. With that said, Moore is quite talented at character development, but unfortunately those characters are left in a world that I've seen many times before. This was too close to the Body Snatcher films for me. The pace and tone of this book changed drastically in the last hundred pages and really pulled me out of the story. I enjoyed Under The Overtree, so I'll give James A. Moore another chance. But three strikes and you're out."},{"Title":"Possessions","review":"First off, let me say I love horror and I'm always looking for new horror authors to read. This is my first James Moore book. It will be my last. And I'm sorry to say that. I wanted to like this book, I really, really did (in fact, I read over 200 pages before I gave up on it...something I rarely do). I give the book two stars because it starts off great...with well-developed characters, a tragic event juxtaposed with a joyous, surprising one. And then, it degenerates. The characters go from being well-developed, interesting teenagers to being stick figure punching bags (the fight scenes in this book are incredible: incredibly boring...going on for sometimes ten pages at a stretch, stretching into long-winded monotony). The story disappears: it's just man against monster over and over again, with no suspense and the character development so deft at the beginning withers away, so you can't care about what happens to them. Even Moore's writing, which starts out crisp, punchy, and clean lapses into cliche-ridden drivel by the end (something \\"takes the cake\\"; someone \\"gets his clock cleaned\\"). I wish I could recommend this book. I wish I could have enjoyed it enough to just get through it.

And then he wins the lottery and that's never mentioned again - why? And those aliens/monsters that Mr. Moore seemed to have created from a bad Lovecraft story - the descriptions were horrible and I could never picture any of them. And where exactly did they come from? And why were they after the Western Key? And why did Chris's mom have the key in the first place? Nothing was explained.

By about page 210 it started to look up because it starts the final fight scene, unfortunately the fight scene was 100+ pages and I lost interest in it rather quickly.Chris has just lost his mother and won the lottery.

His best friend Jerry tries to help out the best he can but ends up being caught by the demons and Katie (Jerry's girlfriend) is the mother hen to everyone. Chris also has several flashbacks that don't flow with the book and are very confusing at times. Personally, the characters did not feel very well developed.Like I said, this book wasn't for me. I am still confused exactly what this book is about. It is called Possessions yet there is no possessing going on. Instead the humans they are imitating are kept in heart shaped pods in the basement of a house.

When his mother leaves early to work she realizes the necklace she always wears is at home; moments later she dies in a traffic accident caused by a creature not of this world. Chris' best friend Jerry and his girlfriend Katie help him and his fourteen year old sister Brittany get through the days preceding the funeral. After the funeral, Chris sees that someone tore up his mother's room looking for something.People that change into creatures seek the Golden Key, going so far as to dig up the grave of Chris's mother. They finally grab it off Brittany's neck but Chris is determined to get it back. He learns where the creatures are conducting a ceremony and accompanied by Katie and Brittany he goes there to stop them and rescue Jerry and Brittany's boyfriend who are encased in a gel like substance. Their doppelgangers are upstairs performing a ritual that if completed will let an untold evil into the world.Add a pinch of Stephen King, a dash of Dean Koontz, a flowering of Peter Straub and one part Bentley Little and readers will have an idea what a horror novel by James A. Moore is like. He is a grand storyteller who can hold his own with these masters. The good guys are so well developed and realistic that readers will fear for their safety and hope that if they survive, more stories starring this fine young group will be forthcoming.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Possessions","review":"Here is an author with a fresh perspective, a little individuality and a lot more personality with a psychotic neurosis that would make Carl Panzram blush.The plot, although not original, is pure unadulterated gluttony. Moore takes a little bit of such classics as: Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Alien, and The Thing and adds his own twist of terror to the mix with skill. The only problem with the story is it never truly explains the reasoning behind most of what occurs. For example, why did the mom have the necklace, who is their father and what's the deal with the lottery ticket? With so many holes abound, it can make a reader feel drafty and miss that old blanket.The pace in the story is a thrilling roller coaster ride. Starting out with what seems like a perfectly normal afternoon, the suspense begins to build and maneuvers throughout with subtlety and finesse. You actually never notice the tension building until you suddenly realize you've had your hand clenched the entire time and you now have half-moons on your palm. Moore's style of writing is receptive, sardonic and laced with a lurking compassion. Right from the first page you realize that he isn't writing for you and he's not writing for the critics, he's writing for himself and to see just how much he can get away with. Perfect!The atmosphere in the book is filled with a sense of traumatic instability. The air becomes palpable and you can almost visualize the thin ice these characters tread on mentally and physically. The characters in the book are inviting, credible and at times, completely moronic. Reminding me of my own brother, Moore pulled off what so few have - sincerity. Capturing a photo-shot of adolescence, the author ingrains each mood, emotion and insane significance of what it's like to be a teenager."},{"Title":"Possessions","review":"After browsing the other reviews, I see some gripes about not having everything spelled out. Sure, I wondered what Chris' moms role was with the key, and sure, I would have liked it explained, but you know what? This is a good book, and not everything has to be handed to me on a silver platter, explaining the whos, whys, and whats of the world. Yeah, not everything was explained in detail, but nothing major - this does not ruin a good book.Minor plot holes aside, I found the plot to be original enough, well executed, some nice twist and turns in there, with no cheap plot ploys tossed into the batch. It was unpredictable - I NEVER saw the end result coming.The characters were strong and smart, being a pleasure to read about. They complimented the story and took it in all directions full force. The pace is quick, starts off almost immediately, never letting up.The atmosphere is rich with suspense, plenty of creepiness in there. Tension was thick, lots of action, drama, even minor budding romance cues.With gripping suspense, enthralling events, sympathetic characters, anadmirable writing style and almost endless flow of sheer horror (while being fun) - \\"Possessions\\"is not a snack for a starving horror fan to miss!"},{"Title":"Possessions","review":"As another reviewer mentioned, this is a work that wears its influences on its sleeve. However, after finishing the book, I have to admit to seeing a little Richard Laymon in the characters. Not quite the breast obsessives that some of Laymon's teens are, but there are the quirks that make them very real people in a brief space of interactions. At least, at first.As the plot progresses, and the sinister elements of those Things searching for the Western Key are brought onto the stage, Chris, the main character, begins to act a little pulp action, man's gotta do, heroic. Now, the typical reader sees this and wonders why. Then again, typical readers are not used to thinking about texts (especially horror heads, many of whom merely want instant grossout gratification). Chris is not normal. Chris' mother was not normal. They are real personalities, but the family partakes of a heritage of accepting heroic levels of responsibility and seeing that responsibility through. Chris ultimately accepts that heritage, and his actions carry through from that decision.A livejournal chum of mine opined that F. Paul Wilson writes intelligent popcorn. Much of this book falls into that style. Its a fun flick, the kind you giggle and shiver at. Where you root for the good guys, hiss at the bad guys and have a ton of fun watching. As a long time horror reader, it was fun to pick out familiar elements and see them approached with freshness.However, there is an emotional landscape to the work that reaches much deeper. In his other novels Fireworks and Under the Overtree, Mr. Moore demonstrated his deft eye at evoking whole towns. Here, he charts the emotional geography of a group of friends with that same level of deftness: the frustrations, the irresponsibilities, the joys. All the colors of what it means to be human and to have friends."},{"Title":"Gunstock - Finishing & Care ...","review":"Lots of info in this book but it is somewhat dated - since the book was written environmental laws have changed much of wood finish chemistry and the author's treatment of varnishes is obsolete.There are now many proprietary gunstock finishes on the market that appeared since tis book was written.Nonetheless there is some useful info, especially if you've not done much wood finishing before.There are curious omissions - how to work with alkanet, used by the great London gunmakers, for example, is not in this book!Do not expect a \\"do-it-yourself\\" manual."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I found this book to be a very interesting commentary on the way children are thought of and treated in American culture. Many reviewers seemed to dislike this story but I wonder if that has anything to do with people's not wanting to admit some of this just might be true.

She has grown into a creative, fearless woman who is living her dreams. Parents should read this book alone,then again with their children, followed by discussion about the meaning of freedom.

Some adults may feel that this book is inappropriate for children because it will stike &quot;fear in their hearts.&quot; I've had some very interesting discussions with students as young as second grade who were able to speak about their experiences regarding &quot;control&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot;. As with most experiences, conversation helps students explore and clarify meanings relative to personal experiences. This book pairs well with other books such as &quot;The Problem with Pulsifer.&quot;"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I found the idea behind this book, and the way in which it was presented, to be wonderful. The illustrations are lively and filled with a sort of movement that is accompanied by language which really gives the reader a sense of the &quot;soul&quot; (if one can say that) of each of these amazing kids. I have to say, however, that when I began to read of the first child's condemnation to &quot;the big box&quot;, I caught my breath and grabbed my chest and thought, &quot;I can't give this to a child; it would scare them too much.&quot; The way in which the sentence is presented leads one to believe that there really is a big box and kids really do get locked away for being themselves. Young children who are just beginning to come into a sense of themselves don't understand the figurative as well as adults do. I agree with the reader who suggested that this book be recommended for adults and not children."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"The Big Box - a nice metaphor for the process by which adults tend to stifle the creativity, energy, and innocense of our children by forcing them to conform to our orderly, &quot;boxy&quot; world. Instead of celebrating their feisty ideals and championing their crazy nature, the powers-that-be pride themselves on gathering to diagnose and treat them for it, as if it were somehow criminal. Kudos to Toni Morisson and her son Slade for their fabulous depiction of an area where awareness is the first step to an alternative solution for today's youth. Enjoy sharing this one with your children and get ready for some interesting feedback!"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Patty, Mickey and Liza Sue all must live in a big brown box with doors that open only one way because they \\"can't handle their freedom.\\" Patty's infraction is that she went four times to the toilet and talked in class; Mickey hollered in the hallway of his apartment; and Liza Sue, who lives in the country, let the chickens keep their eggs. These three kids do good things, however. They fold their socks, hang up their clothes, do fractions and give up peanut brittle, for example. Written by Toni Morrison and her brother Slade and lushly illustrated by Giselle Potter, this little book sends the message that parents should let their children be given a chance to handle their freedom.What a wonderful lesson for parents to learn!"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"The message meant more to me than to my young children. They didnt understand why the children were being locked in a box. They think playing in cardboard boxes is fun, not a punishment for exercising too much freedom.

They burst into spontaneous applause when I finished this one! We were learning about marginilization and Toni Morrison and this book really added to the whole lesson."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I recently got this book out of the library for my two young kids, age 4 and 2. I didn't have time to preview it at the library and assumed it would be a story about kids playing with a box. When I read the book to my kids it was completely over their heads. That said, I enjoyed it greatly and felt the need to read it to myself several times. I found the rhyme and repetition quite powerful. And the message in the book very thought provoking about how are society treats kids. I work with children of a variety of ages, many of which don't quite fit the mold that society says they are to fit into. I would recommend this book to any adult who works with children. I also think it would create an interesting discussion for preteen-teen kids. I often read my kids books that are recommended for kids older than they are, but this is one you should really stick to the age recommendation on. The book says it is for ages 8 and up. I would say it would be better for kids age 10 and up."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"The book is wonderful for an adult who wants to help other adults understand why we need to let children be children. As my favorite teacher, Bev Bos, says (paraphrase), \\"The adults in a child's life need to be less egocentric than the child.\\" All the people in the book love the child they put in a box because the child \\"can't handle [his/her] freedom.\\" Wonderful book.Adults who love children should read it and learn.But Amazon--what's with the HORRIBLE price. I found this book for $9.50 on another book site. Same edition. What's up? I don't expect outrageous prices from Amazon. I love Amazon, but on this book you went totally price nuts.

We've been reading it for two years now!! At first when I read it I thought to myself how sad it was but each time I read it, it reinforces the importance of allowing our children to be comfortable to feel free. I think of all the boundries that kept me from feeling free as a child and am using this book as a tool for myself (and others) to see the importance of what happens when children are not allowed to express their freedom. Thanks for writing such passionate books."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Adults will delight in this children's book about individual freedoms and not being afraid to be yourself. Kids will love hearing it over and over."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I read this book out loud at Children's Hospital to my granddaughter who was barely a month old and showed her the illustrations as well and I think I loved it more than she did! I think it is a great learning tool without hitting anyone over the head about individual freedoms. Great childrens' book but a must read for adults, simple, easy to understand."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"My five year old daughter loves the message of individuality and freedom Morrison and her son convey in this beautiful story. Despite magazine reviews that insist this is a book for adults, children will love being told that it is ok to be themselves. I have also read this story to my classroom and the children always ask to hear it again."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Critically-acclaimed and best-selling novelist/essayist Toni Morrison delves into children's literature with this book about three youngsters that don't quite \\"fit into the normalcy box\\", thus the trio must be placed in isolation because of their uniqueness. This separation doesn't seem to be threatening because the youngsters get to have some favorite items and receive visits from parents and others.All in all, the book celebrates diversity and enables the reader to understand the importance of individuality and the frequent need for \\"freedom\\" and non-conformity."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"When I first picked up this book, it looked like a young children's book with a great concept for self control. But as I read it, the vocabulary didn't fit with the type of children the book was written for. The author tried to rhyme, but the words didn't work with each other. Also, the book was very repetitive. I don't suggest you read this to young kids because the message of \\"controlling freedom\\" was not portrayed the way kids understand. All in all, this book is meant for older children and adults who just enjoy picture books."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Three children have been banished to a big brown box where their parents visit them on Wednesdays. They have many wonderful &quot;things&quot; and favorite foods that all children are supposed to love. The children are in the box because they could not handle their freedoms: bad in school, at the apartment, and in nature. Each child gives a viable argument of what they do to help out their families and behave, but the bad outweighs the good and the adults win-- in the box they go. This is a wonderful story about freedoms, behavior, consequences and taking things for granted. This book would be especially useful as a supplemental text to share in a middle school/high school classroom setting."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I didn't really like this book because I think that the author was trying to rhyme, and when I read the story, it didn't really seem like it rhymed. I think also that it was too repetitive also. It had different characters, but the story with all of them was kind of the same."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"The story seems to hit home, but hit hard. As an African American psychologist, who works in schools, I think that the 8-12 year old audience could be very disturbed by the imagery of being locked away, for mere exhuberance. But the story also oversimplifies the nature of emotional disturbances and behavior disorders, for which intervention is not just an adult world's attempt at control and conformity. If children can participate in making decisions in their life, and follow through responsibly, to their community, then their freedom is often their own. I think the political commentary is really directed at adults, and thus the target audience should not be children."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Excellent work as one might have expected, but it is one that deals with a controversial issue. The story deals with the issue of freedom narrating the tale of three children who were put in a big box because they did not meet the rules of the adults. When those children are in the box, they receive a lot of nice things from their parents, but the drawings show their faces to be passive and lacking something. The adults are always described to \\"love very much\\" these children, but they use this love to take away the kids' freedom which \\"they cannot handle.\\"The story ends with the sarcastic question \\"who says they cannot handle their freedom?\\" accompanied with a drawing of the three children breaking out of the box.I can imagine the debate this story is going to create, for, on the surface, it deals with the sensitive issue of how much freedom should be granted to children, and whether they are illegible to make some or all decisions. The story kind of encourages kids to rebel against the adults who represent oppression in this story, and this might be problematic for some people. The story of course implies a much more serious message than the simple one introduced through the words and rhymes. The general concept of oppression is the main theme here. The drawings help illustrate this message..again this might be very problematic for people.I personally loved the fact that it made me uncertain of how to introduce the story to my kids and how to discuss it with them. I am not that afraid to be uncertain in front of them any more. I show them, sometimes, that I am unable to decide about things or actually unable to judge things, and this takes a big load off my back. Hay, finally a not very boring children's story....Any way, me and my children had a good time reading the story and discussing the meanings of it. I tried to ignore the idea of them rebelling against me as much as I can because I like my dictatorship over them :), but they impressed me with their questions and statements, and that was what I mostly liked about the story..the discussion it stirred.My son took the book to bed, and I heard him later reading it loudly to himself with a reciting tone ..I hope he is not getting any ideas!"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Toni Morrison's The Big Box is a wonderful book with all the elements necessary to make it a classic. Although one would think that this book should be in the adult book section instead of the children's section, I would certainly read this book to children between the ages of 10-18. I think that reading it to a class could lead to some very enlightening conversation, and it would also make a great additional read for any high school psychology class.The lovely illustations and the rhyming text make this an easy book to read even though it deals with such a heavy topic.Every parent, social worker and educator should have a copy of this book to refer to so that they will never be tempted to put any child into a big box."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"This is a wonderful story for both children and adults. It tells of three children that get into trouble in the adult world and are placed in a big brown box. The children are simply displaying typical childish actions, yet are misunderstood by their parents. Very authentic for children to understand.I have shared this book in my fourth grade classroom for the past three years. Each time I share it the students seem to understand the message and what it means to them in their own way. Although some think that this story is inappropriate for children I feel that it is wonderful for all ages. Don't underestimate what children can understand and take away from good literature. This can be a great piece of literature to use to discuss the idea of freedom with children."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"From the instant I began to read this book, I knew it was perfect for the special education world. The books main theme of being &quot;locked&quot; up and having basic freedoms taken away, is what many special education students often feel. I work with emotionally disturbed students and the impact made by the children in the book made me feel a bit of what my students often do. Though the book is for a higher age level, the book can be read to and explained to a much younger group of children. It is always a healthy experience to talk about any idea or feeling, and this is a perfect example! The feeling of having your freedoms taken away because you are not like everyone else and do not conform to anyone's image! Thank you Toni and Slade Morrison for this wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I read this book aloud to my fifth graders. We discussed the book and the metaphorical implications. What does it mean to lose freedoms? Why are rules made? How does a child obtain more freedom? Do parents have rules that society sets? An excellent book if discussed WITH the children. It helps them understand society and how some of us are ready for some freedoms and some aren't."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Feeling twinges of regret at my own childhood, this story resonated with me on a deep emotional level.There is a tendency in today's society to replace experience with material objects, and for parents to protect their children by sheltering them from the world as opposed to guiding them through life experiences. Unlike other reviewers, I do not find the children in this story to be victims of emotional or behavioral disorders, but rather, alive with all the creativity and awareness that a child new to the world finds innate. The adults, unable to reconcile the self expression of each child finds it necessary to lock the child in \\"a box\\"-- a metaphor for over-protective adults encouraging conformity as opposed to creative thinking-- and further drives the point home by medicating the child with commercialism and imitations of real experience: plastic toys, televisions, dolls that have \\"already been named\\", Spice Girl tee shirts, pictures of the sky and small boxes of actual dirt.This book does hold a strong message for adults, but I think that children who read this book should not be underestimated. Discussion about the themes could encourage children to think more about their role in society as creative thinkers.Such as: What does it mean that the children receive dolls that are already named? Ask the child, \\"Do like naming your own dolls? What do you think about getting a toy that already has a name?\\" Questions along these lines explore ideas about self-expression and ingenuity, and hopefully looking at these parts of the story will allow most to get past their knee-jerk reaction that the book encourages rebellion against adults and instigates fear or disobedience in children."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"As a twenty-something first grade teacher reading this book, I personally found Morrison's writing to be very thought-provoking and realistic in the actual portrayal of a child's mis-understanding of the purpose of rules which govern their very pre-teen existence. The metaphorical dipictions of how the three &quot;troubled&quot; characters react to the reasoning behind what seem to be unnecessary and consticting regulations draw me deeper into the story as the pages turn. The somber and confused response of each child to the various forms of behavioral intervention (before it may be just too late) by the adults makes me sympathize and reminisce about simlar circumstances of my childhood. I even began to feel somewhat sorry for these characters, and truthfully a bit melancholy. However, for the nine to eleven year old reader, for whom this book is recommended, I find the underlying concepts to be perhaps a little too difficult to grasp. The pictures are wonderful, and the lyrical flow make the story very fluid and easy to read. But, I can not fail to stress the sophistication of the meaning behind the written words. I would definitely recommend The Big Box to a friend who can look beyond the facade of sentences and words used to tell a story. .....Or, maybe some of the disciplinary bodies of my childhood or the cruel, wicked, just plain mean teachers who I call co-workers! - Thomas Michael Welch, Jr., Los Angeles, CA"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"This is certainly a big eye-opener for any adult dealing with children. Although the authority figure sets the rules (or administers them), keep in mind that children need their freedom to be kids. I was not at all surprised to see that Toni Morrison tackled such a wonderful issue -- allowing children to be children, rather than requiring them to be small adults. We (parents) ask children to conform to our hectic schedules, rush around without complaint while we run our errands, and do everything we ask them to do. Children need some freedom to make some of their own decisions, and to have some time to just be silly. How else will they grow to be competent, decision-making adults later in life? Unfortunately, this was not exactly what I would expect from such a wonderful writer as Toni Morrison. The story was strangely written, and repetitive in a way that only detracted from the story. My kids were not thrilled with the text or the illustrations. It did spark some conversation, which is good, but they aren't really going to read it again and again as I had hoped."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"I am a 19 year old college student who works at a daycare center and I love this book. I think this book is a great self-esteem builder for the troubled child. So many times adults are quick to write off children as &quot;problematic&quot; when they do things out of the ordinary. This book lets children know that even if they are different they still have something to offer."},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"Toni Morrison wrote this book because when her son was young, a teacher told him he couldn't handle freedom.

The picture are lovely though!"},{"Title":"Big Box","review":"In Toni Morrison and her son Slade's children's book debut, they forgot that their audience is children and speak almost exclusively to the adults who will probably buy it. Shallow illustrations are repetative and droll, preachy refrain was tiresome to this adult. My children were bored too soon and so was I. Ms. Morrison is a treasure in adult literature. She should stick with her strength and leave this type of writing in its box."},{"Title":"The Roman Emperors: A Biographical Guide to the Rulers of Imperial Rome 31 BC-AD 476","review":"The incomparable Michael Grant delivers again with this erudite anthology of concise yet richly rewarding bios of the rulers of Imperial Rome, from Augustus thru the end of the Western Empire. Each Imperial bio is structured roughly the same, covering family background, methodology of accession, overview of reign, a general judgment of the character of both the Emperor and his time in power, and then more often than not quotes from primary sources like Suetonious or Dio Cassius giving contemporary physical and psychological descriptions of the Princeps. All the entries come with a thumbnail sized portrait of the subject, either lifted from sculptured busts or numismatic sources.What truly makes this book work is of course Grants smoothly lucid prose, equally suitable for scholar and laymen alike. He command of classical history is so complete, he can embody vast amounts of useful information in just a few paragraphs. As a source book for research or as reference for the casual reader, this book cannot be beat."},{"Title":"The Roman Emperors: A Biographical Guide to the Rulers of Imperial Rome 31 BC-AD 476","review":"This is an excellent book which offers an overview of the emperors of Roman history, beginning with Caesar Augustus (the &quot;august one&quot; who was first among equals). This book does not and cannot provide an in-depth view of each emperor's life and times &amp; politics. Indeed, great individuals such as Augustus, Claudius, Hadrian &amp; Marcus Aurelius warrant entire volumes dedicated to them separately. However, Grant does a wonderful job of giving his readers a &quot;taste&quot; of each ruler's reign as well as some useful (and sometimes colorful) anecdotes about their lives.This is a tremendous book for those who would like a nice quick-and-easy history of the Romans who wore the purple. For those who would like more in-depth books that cover certain epochs (and I hope there are many of you out there), Grant has written books such as &quot;12 Caesars&quot; and &quot;The Antonines&quot; &amp; some others which go into much more detail, but have less scope (timeline wise) than the present book."},{"Title":"The Roman Emperors: A Biographical Guide to the Rulers of Imperial Rome 31 BC-AD 476","review":"Anyone having reason to look for information on the emperors from Agustus through Romulus , and including the tetrarchy should get this book.

Harking back to Thomas Hardy, W.B.Yeats, Robert Frost,Walter de la Mare, John Masefield, W.H.Auden, A.E.Housman and carrying forward in the footsteps of modern greats like Richard Wilbur, Gjertrud Schnackenburg, Elizabeth Jennings,A.E.Stallings, Dana Gioia,and John Hollander, Mr. Williamson shows he is a poet that is to reckoned with. Although technical prowess is only a necessary, not a sufficient condition to be counted with the masters, Greg is well on his way with the poems selected here.

John Speirs does a nice job with the watercolor illustrations although they were a little on the cartoonish side (not quite elegant). So, if you prefer a fun spin on the tale, this book is the way to go. If you'd rather a more classical illustration style, this edition might not be for you."},{"Title":"The Night Before Christmas: A Trim-A-Tree Story","review":"I'm a collector of differently-illustrated editions of this famous Christmas poem, so I didn't really have to have the cardboard ornaments which come with a new copy of this book. But if you intend for this to be the only copy you'll share with your children, be sure to buy a copy that comes with all the ornaments; they slip into little \\"envelopes\\" on each page, and their absence is pretty glaring and sad if, as I did, you buy a copy minus the additions. In my opinion, the book has not the best illustrations, even for \\"cartoonish\\" style, but they ARE colorful."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I've never seen violence and battle handled this way anywhere else. A paragraph in The Iliad might start with a description of a relatively minor wound to an extremity, a hand or a foot. The paragraph will go on to describe a series of increasingly horrific wounds, leading up to the poor guy who was sliced in half or something. It's like a song building to a crescendo. Then the author goes on to discuss the family members of the deceased. The point is clear. War is hell, and people suffer, both on the battlefield and back at home.It's easy to understand the egos involved in this story. Acchiles is understandably insulted, infuriated, when his prize lady is taken from him. What is he, chopped liver? So he decides not to fight anymore for an army that will treat him with so little appreciation. The gods in the story are the same. They are as human as we are.In today's world, we just assume that the Greek gods were fables, myths, with no basis in reality. But we take the current gods much more seriously. Who's to say that ten thousand years from now there won't be a civilization on earth that thinks of our religions the way we think of the ancient Greek religion? Today's intensely held beliefs may be tomorrow's mythology. That's the way it went for the ancient Greeks, and history does tend to repeat itself.Let me put it this way. Isn't it reasonable, if we were made in God's image, for God to share our faults? Isn't it reasonable, looking at all of the amazing things in the Universe, to believe that there is more than one God, that perhaps there are quite a few? I see nothing all that childish or unreasonable in the religion of the ancient Greeks."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"been for the Greeks of 3000 years ago. Lattimore has given us with a brilliant translation that makes this masterpiece accessible in all its beauty to modern-day English speakers. The introduction provides the necessary understanding of the background and translation scheme, adding to the appreciation of the poem, but concise and short enough to permit the reader to delve into the beauty of the Iliad without much further ado. The Iliad of course is the most famous classic Greek poem. In reading this translation, one vividly moves into the world of the gods and heroes. Though seemingly long, the Iliad is breathtaking in its action and plot sequences. It is easy to get lost imagining the conflicts between Achilleus, Agamemnon, and Hector, or reflecting on the fascinating intrigues of Athena and Zeus. There are many lessons in these tales for everyone today, for we humans still behave within the same parameters of pride, glory, anger, vengeance, and love. After reading it, I was left reflecting about th meaning of victory, and how Achilleus was unsatisfied after obtaining his revenge. Read it, and you will instantly recognized why this epic poem has been deemed a masterpiece. Perhaps one of the first anti-war works of literature, the Iliad stands as relevant for our world today as it has"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Though it was a challenging read (how challenging will depend on the translation), Homer's epic poem Iliad is a classic tale about the war between the ancient Greeks (Achaeans) and the Trojans, and the involvement of the gods in the war. Although I am generally not fond of ancient mythology, this particular epic seemed to be an exception; the Iliad cannot be dismissed as just another story telling the tale of a war from a mythological point of view. The heroes and gods of the epic have relatively simple personalities, yet many of them, even the gods, suffer from various imperfections, illustrating the theme that no one is perfect. The plot is relatively straightforward, yet the manner in which is it told, with an abundance of sensory details and figurative language provides the \\"you are there\\" feeling better than any modern novel. The culture and traditions of the Greeks and Trojans are something unfamiliar to those previously unacquainted with Greek mythology, but learning more about the background of a piece of work is another interesting part of reading it. In short, even if you are not interested in ancient mythology, the epic poem Iliad will draw you into the scene of battles between the Trojans and Greeks through an abundant use of details and keep you thinking about the themes of the epic."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"The translation of \\"The Iliad\\" I'd bring to the moon. But who says I have to pick one? What I like about Lattimore is, I sometimes feel Homer's face popping through the pages. Lattimore's translation says, \\"This is important.\\" And I think his scheme, the line-by-line thing, is overall for the best. You have to go to it; I try to avoid overly slangy translations; and I was never one to mind \\"thee\\" and \\"thou.\\" But hey, as Shakespeare said, you have to piece out its imperfections in your mind. I mean, is there one best performance of Bach's \\"St. Matthew Passion\\"? No: that's why I own 4 different CD's of it. Fitzgerald is good; he hits burts of poetic heights that others don't. Other than that, I think A. T. Murray is just as good (i.e., straightforward). Give Pope a shot. Once you get \\"used to it,\\" it's a poetic marvel. I read Butler's translation a while ago, and that's a good, solid prose translation, like the aforementioned Murray's. Fagles I couldn't get a grip on, but if he's your cup of tea, why not? Wherever you roam, I'd snatch up a used copy of Lattimore from good ol' Amazon and keep at your bedside, just like Alexander of old."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"What can another translation of Homer do? A question which has no answer for those who don't already know the answer themselves. -Richmond Lattimore This book is definitely a book to add to the Hall of Fame collection of Homer's best. Although it had its dry moments, it was definetely exciting and invigorating. This is a must buy for people who enjoy reading about the ancient times."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"First off we Homerics are the best. We've been around 3000 years, so all these Jonny come lately scholars need to back up. Shakespeare is not 'the bard' Homer is. Anyway the translation is a definitive 20th century rendering, rivaled only by Fitzgerald, who for his part had much to say about Lattimore's fine work. Not quite English blank verse, Lattimore seems to veer more towards the Greek long line. It falls just shy of Fitzgerald, who of course had this to work from, but it is stellar none the less. The introduction, written also by Lattimore, is absolutely vital to any serious student of Homer and the heroic age, with a wide array of historical and interpretive insight. Also comes with a chart of the lost epics composed 'around and about the iliad'. If you buy this trans. make sure it comes with the introduction."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Nothing in greek myth stands alone - you'll need a basic background to get all the side stories. The Odessey is more entertaining on the whole but chronologically this precedes. Unbiased translation - always good."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I used the W. H. D. Rouse translation.One of our first war novels: the Achains and their allies send a great multitude of ships laden with armored warriors carrying bows, spears, and swords; divisions of horse drawn chariots rumble there way into the ranks of the Trojans and their allies laying siege to Troy. The Trojans counter-attack with a push all the way to the ships. And as we read, these gains and losses continue throughout the story. There is a short truce to mourn the dead and recoup, then the battle rages on only in our minds.It flows like a song. Lucid, with wonderful imagery and symbolism's. Homer, with Rouses' help, bring out the details of battle and personalize each warrior: we learn he has a wife, a family, and a life elsewhere, after he has been cut in two and stripped of his armor. Men are slaughtered with an indifference, as if they were mere cattle. I found it hard to follow the extensive list of characters. I believe some of the realism was lost to modernization. I also found the knowledge Homer had of the human anatomy surprising. The footnotes were helpful. Better than Odyssey.It is interesting to note: the gods control man, and man controls the gods. The two interact with each other; the gods send down their wrath and protections upon their favored nation. The gods are no different than the humans they try to control, except for their immortality. Hades is where all mortals go unto death. The parallels to the Bible are evident, with connotations of God. It can be hard to grasp.......a story that is 2,700 years old.Wish you wellScott"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"The world of mythology not only interests but captivates young men. The idea of having gods that play with the outcome of everything may be what a female likes to read about. All in all this book has it all.Homer's Iliad has action. There is a scene where Ajax's shield is jabbed by Hektor and his spear goes through 7 layers ofthe shield.The god Zeus controls the fate of all of those involved with the Trojan war. The part the gods play is very much like a soap opera. This will mellow out the action and cause more at the same time.This is a great book for anyone that likes history action or suspense. Read it!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"My favorite of the modern translations, Lattimore does an excellent job of capturing the muscular beauty of the bard's verses. I have returned to the epic many times for a myriad of reasons and am always struck by the sheer force and beauty of the story. Lattimore has the fine sense to let Homer do the brunt of the work. &quot;Such was their burial of Hector, Breaker of horses.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Almost everyone knows the story of the Iliad. A Trojan, Paris, steals a Greek king's wife, Helen. The Greek king, Menelaus, assembles an army of all of the other Greek kings and they sail to Troy to defeat the city and recapture Helen.There is more to the beginning of the story (it all starts with Paris judging a contest between 3 goddesses). There is more to the story (it ends, and the Odyssey and later the Aeneid pick up, after Greece defeats Troy through the device of the Trojan Horse) but Homer does not tell this story. Homer picks up the story in the last year of the war. Much of the story is of bickering Greeks, and especially a spoiled Achilles, and noble Trojans, especially Hector. It has plenty of intrigue, suspense, and, of course war. It makes for fabulous reading.Of course, the Iliad is first and foremost, one of the earliest texts of western literature. It was originally sung by a blind bard during a sort of &quot;dark ages&quot; of Greek history. An earlier Greek civilization had been literate but had fallen. Later on, centuries after Homer, Greek civilization would rise again. Homer would be lost to the world except that the Iliad was repeated throughout the centuries (most likely with various additions and subtractions) and then written down during the golden age. Homer himself was so lost that it was no longer possible even to tell what he had written. Later Greeks thought he wrote both the Iliad and the Odyssey, but modern scholars say no.Of course, a review of the Iliad must spend a decent amount of space on the translation to be complete. I once picked up a different translation of the Iliad while I had my Lattimore translation on me and they looked completely different.My college professor had us read the Lattimore translation of the Iliad and the Fitzgerald translation of the Odyssey. It is, of course, impossible to translate Homer without conveying a sense of the poetry, but Lattimore opts for more of a transliteration of Homer's work, while Fitzgerald is tilted towards poetry. It may be superficial, but it is also a plus to me that Lattimore transliterates the names, so you wind up reading about Achilleus and Klytaimestra rather than Achilles and Klytemnestra.I thought reading the different translation was a great idea and I am therefore partial to both translators but would suggest that you follow my college professor's views and by one Lattimore and one Fitzgerald translation if you are reading both the Iliad and the Odyssey."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Homer opens this work, and perhaps all of Western literary history, with an appeal for help and a clearly defined thesis. He asks a muse to help him relate the story of the rage of Achilles. Forgive me for uninvitedly calling Homer's own description of the work lacking. The richness of questions brought up in this work will be apparent to anybody on a first reading. The central preoccupations of the work go beyond the anger of a single man - spanning from the finitude of human existence to the sociopolitical duties of a citizen. It is awe-inspiring that a work written so long ago can strike such a powerful chord in so many of us. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that this is a work of art, and, as a consequence, Homer strives to describe and to make us all too painfully aware of the basics of life. We are asked to reflect on not only the standard issues of family and friends, but on our roots, on our attachment to the land, and on our birth and death. Of course, not every squabble of the Gods or cataloguing of the ships strike us as particularly intriguing. Yet in every delightful passage where Homer taunts his genius by pretending to keep substantial issues at bay, proviking issues are to be found. Unsurprisingly, Homer offers us little in the means of answers for the question as to how we are to deal with the profound circumstances that surround us as humans. His use of the &quot;divine&quot; in controlling human affairs may sound too much like an awkwardly familiar tone of existential resignation. For those seeking &quot;answers in life,&quot; whatever that may mean, the Illiad is not a bad starting point. We have much in common with Achilles - knowledgable about our own mortality, yet all to eager to presume otherwise. We also sympathize with Hector and the Greek soldiers - it is for the soap operas of the rich and powerful that too many of us shed blood. The striking beauty and emotive appeal of this work cannot be classified as uplifting. Yet the subtlety and craftiness of the spark of joy to be found in our peculiar human condition to which this work speaks should be ample answer for any reader as to why this work has survived for so long."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"If you are seeking solely to read for pleasure, this is not the translation you want. Lattimore is brutally literal, sacrificing smooth, flowing syntax for an attempt to duplicate every word of Greek in English. Certainly, if you are interested in the problems of Greek translation, this is an advantage, and you do probably acquire a more thorough understanding of Homeric society and culture with this method, but I still prefer the only other translator I have read, Samuel Butler, who, despite his dubious 1900-era language, does manage to infuse some vitality into the text. You will have to entertain yourself when reading Lattimore. Regardless, the Iliad is a great story and has a very moving final chapter. I would like to see it on the silver screen someday."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"This is about as close as one can get to a word by word translation of the Illiad from Greek into english. Lattimore's work is excellent for those who translate Greek.

The text is microscopically small--the spaces between lines are so tiny that it's enormously difficult to read the cypher that Indiana University Press has printed this book in. The line breaks are numbered in groups of 5, which makes finding which line you're on very hard: splitting into groups of 4 (like almost every other play, or poem ever written is) would have made this work that much easier to enjoy.Get Lattimore, but don't get this terrible edition."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"First of all, I would like to say if you are a student buying this book from Amazon to save a few dollars from the campus book store that is great, but you should make sure that the translation you purchase is the one that your professor wants. Believe it or not there are diferences. That being said, this is probably the best and most accurate translation on the market. I believe this book was origionally pressed around 35 years ago and it has stood the test of time. There is an obvious reason for that, it is the best.

But how good do you want it?I teach mythology and epic literature on the high school level, and I've always used Lattimore's translations of the Iliad and Odyssey. They preserve the LONG dactylic hexameter line of the Greeks, in the process preserving the stately formality of the language, the epithets, the epic similes. the ring construction, and all of those other things that only English teachers know! What the everyday reader will get from this book is sheer beauty. I could not tell you how many times I've read the Iliad (surely over 100), and I never fail to be moved to tears by certain parts. Fagles doesn't do that for me and neither does Lombardo or really, any other translation. You have to work for that emotion, no doubt. But it's so worth it.You will not find a more stunning description of Achilles screaming (with his HEAD on fire!) at the Trojan lines after the death of Patroklos\\"There he stood, and shouted and from her place Pallas Athene gave cry, and drove an endless terror upon the Trojans. As loud as comes the voice that is screamed out by a trumpet by murderous attackers who belelaguer a city, so then high and clear went up the voice of Aiakides. But the Trojans, when they hear the brazen voice of Aiakides, the heart was shaken in all, and the very floating-maned horses turned their chariots about...\\"Sure, other translations may be easier to read. It's like the difference between the King James Bible and one of those newer translations. What you might possibly gain in clarity, you lose in beauty and majesty. I wrote this on the Odyssey translation - I just don't feel that Homer should be vernacularized. He is perfect, just the way he is. The closer we can stick to that. the better, in my opinion.

I always wanted to read it, but always postponed it for any reason. It took me two months to read it because it's not like a fiction novel you could read today.

From grandiose to subtle, from details to eternal truths, not to mention the beautiful Icelandic-style kennings - the archaic landscape comes to live, anyone who has sailed in those waters will feel taken back out there when reading this text. It has been suspected that the abduction of Helen can not have been the real reason for the war, but when reading the Iliad and the Odyssey a culture is painted, in which hospitality to guests was sacred. Alexandros (Paris) didn't just abduct Helen, he did it after having been received as a guest, which is an outrageous act. His act would have threatened the whole order of the society if it had not been punished. The author in fact explores two possible outcomes in the Iliad - an honorable duel, and the war that otherwise would result.

The marvel of this translation is the way that it has stood up over the years, still as much poetry in English as the Iliad is in Greek. Amazing.

Homer is more descriptive than any other author I have read. While it is very long, anyone with an interest in the classics will find it more than worth their time. To fully apreciate the difficulty and beauty of dactalic hexameter(the style the epic is written in), however, one needs to have written or attempted to write in dactalic hexameter.

Lattimore captures the feel and spirit of Homer better than any other translation into English. If you're not accustomed to reading literature, whether in a highly inflected language or not, you might have trouble with Lattimore, but that does not diminish the quality of Lattimore's work. Anyone who can read poetic narrative can read and appreciate Lattimore. I have read the Iliad and Odyssey in Lattimore's translations at least 4 times each and each time I find more to appreciate. Most of the lovers of great literature I know prefer Lattimore for the same reason -- his translation is so natural and simple.

Along with the Torah, the Iliad is one of the most inspirational texts of all time, its vivid drama suggesting a way of life for those who can attain it. The surprisingly complex ethos of the hero comes alive, moment by shattering moment, in this great work. As long shadowed spears hurtle through the air, arrows leap from straining bows, bronze armour clashes and men fall like great trees, the ground of life and death is portrayed in a way that is still gripping almost three thousand years later. Men move forward towards possible death in support of their comrades and to try to win glory, or to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades from the plundering clutches of their killers.Reasonable people differ on translations. Having struggled through part of the original, and having read Lattimore, Fitzgerald, and a bit of Fagles, it is Lattimore who seems to capture best the vivid, occasionally gruesome, quality of the original along with its noble and transcendent aura."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Richard Lattimore presents the clearest translation of Homer that I have ever read.

Willcock-an invaluable resource for any student reading the Illiad, especially Lattimore's translation."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"The IliadI read Greek (or, in fairness, once did) and have read most of the popular translations and some that were never popular. Lattimore's translation is amazing for it's fidelity to the original. His ability to capture the nuance of the marvelously subtle Greek, their odd verbal moods and tenses, is astonishing. As is his rendering of the hexameter, right down to the spondee.The problem is that the nuance so finely teased out of each word, the liturgical pace of the meter does not capture the emotion of the whole. Hexameter has not found a comfortable place in English since Alexander Pope. It is ponderous, leaden. It no longer calls forth the grand emotion of an heroic age as it did in 1650. And in that context the finely tuned nuance Lattimore coaxes out of the Greek becomes labored.Lattimore's translation is a marvelous work of scholarship. Lucubracious, even as this sentence is so. There are many on this page who have enjoyed it. I will argue that it has bored or tired many more for decades. Especially the intelligent, curious, but casual reader outside of the classroom who wonders what the excitement has been about for these many centuries.Because there is no excitement here. It is buried under poetry that has no contemporary life and a language forced into an archaic form with the highest scholarly craft.The Iliad is a brutal, dynamic, psychologically complex narrative. It has a forward motion that can lead the reader on page after page. But capturing that takes more than linguistic fidelity and artificially measured lines. What ever emotion the Homeric formulas may have had 600 years BC gain nothing by their exact a repetition when reading today, no matter how close to the original. To capture that dynamic the translator must step into contemporary speech and rhythms. English has all the power and the subtlety when the translator is free to use it,I know it does not sound it, but I do in fact admire Lattimore's translation for its rendering of the text. But to this age it does not speak. [I have just as much respect and much more adimration for his translation of the gospels, where this same approach side setps so much of the political and cultural freight that text has born.]IMO If you are coming to Homer for the first time, or the 10th for that matter, the translation by Rober Fagles is remarkable for life it breaths into the Homeric epic. Without loosing sight of the Greek, the famous Homeric formulas and sense of chant, Fagles preserves the forward dynamic, draws out the personalities of charactersa and draws you into the story (or the stories, there are many). It was not until I read the Fagles translation that I saw in English the emotion and the drama of the Greek captured in English.

Lattimore is also reputedly the translator who strove to stay the closest to the original's structure, rhythm, and diction.

Lattimore does not attempt to make this 3,000 year-old epic into a flowery sonnet, a Shakespearian drama, or a willfully noble tale--instead, he goes to great lengths to preserve the feeling and the connotation of Homer's story, rendering it in highly readable, fast-paced verse that allows the reader to grasp the melodic and repetitive nature of the Greek. He consistently preserves every flavorful epithet, and thus convey the Iliad's power as closely as one can in translation. I would go so far as to say that this translation outstrips that of couplet extraordinaire Alexander Pope, for the latter's is not Homer, but rather a distant interpretation; unlike Lattimore's, it tries to make the Iliad into what it is not. For a clear picture of the original story of the Trojan War, by all means read the Lattimore version."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"All the reviews here seem to be about this book's translation.

Outstanding! Perhaps the translation does indeed lend the words a certain energy, but the true wonder of Homer's masterpiece lies in its characters and stories. Thrill to the adventures of Hector and his alternately tragic and heroic life! This book is an otherworldly triumph and should be enjoyed by everyone.

His insights were so keenly borne out in my experience of studying Greek that I became a college Classics Major the following year.

However, this translation of the Iliad has put me on the path of rediscovering my interest in the humanities. The vivid yet blunt description has forced the reader into this world which revolves solely on glory and honor. The Iliad itself offers insight into the very questions that surround our existence:&quot;Fate is the same for the man who holds back, the same if he fights hard. We are all held in a single honour, the brave with the weaklings. A man dies still if he has done nothing, as one who has done much.&quot; Iliad, 318-20This is a segment from Achilleus' statement in Book 9. I feel that this captures a very important question which hovers constantly on the edge of my mind: why are we here? What is our purpose if we are to all die eventually? Is it to capture glory and honor? If it is, does that mean this honor transcends onto our children? And even if it does, why is that important to us? Why do we strive for glory when it will be taken from us when we pass on? I do not study religion, so I will not pretend to be well versed in it--but these are issues which can be drawn from the Iliad, issues which have been explained in various ways by the world's several mainstream religions which have been in existence for thousands of years. All of this and more is plainly exposed, in all of its simplicity. The reader only has to pick up the book and ask the questions. Answers? You will find none here. A deeper respect and curiousity for what it means to be human? You might find yourself asking more questions."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Having read both the Pope translation and the Lattimore translation of the Iliad, I really found the Lattimore one to be preferable.

If you like anime, like Dragon Ball Z, or any show where the guys are super macho, this is a fantastic story.

Lattimore has given us with a brilliant translation that makes this masterpiece accessible in all its beauty to modern-day English speakers. The introduction provides the necessary understanding of the background and translation scheme, adding to the appreciation of the poem, but concise and short enough to permit the reader to delve into the beauty of the Iliad without much further ado. The Iliad of course is the most famous classic Greek poem. In reading this translation, one vividly moves into the world of the gods and heroes. Though seemingly long, the Iliad is breathtaking in its action and plot sequences. It is easy to get lost imagining the conflicts between Achilleus, Agamemnon, and Hector, or reflecting on the fascinating intrigues of Athena and Zeus. There are many lessons in these tales for everyone today, for we humans still behave within the same parameters of pride, glory, anger, vengeance, and love. After reading it, I was left reflecting about th meaning of victory, and how Achilleus was unsatisfied after obtaining his revenge. Read it, and you will instantly recognized why this epic poem has been deemed a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I re-read the Iliad recently after an abortive attempt at the book many years ago that almost deterred me from ever touching it again. That earlier failure has always nagged at me. Why did I find impossible a book that is one of the canonical works of Western literature? What did I miss that others have admired?The Iliad has entered our language in many ways. We all have our \\"Achilles heels.\\" \\"Trojans\\" can sneak into our computers and wreak havoc later. Sometimes we go on \\"odysseys.\\" The beauty of Helen of Troy is widely known. So obviously the Iliad has not been just an esoteric work of interest only to classicists of earlier times.What follows are my personal views, without the benefit of reading even a part of the vast body of critical analysis of the Iliad. I am simply presenting a few impressions in the hope that other readers might dip into the Iliad to see what it has to offer.I actually enjoyed much of the book on re-reading it - not so much for the plot and story (which are almost trivially simple), nor for love of the characters (who seem, at least superficially, to be mostly contemptible thugs); but rather for the book's deeper, timeless themes and their echoes down the ages into our own times.The story and plot had to be simple because the Iliad grew out of an even earlier oral tradition that Homer (and perhaps others) wrote down. Since it was transmitted orally at first, the plot and story had to be formulaic, with repetitions and simplicity to aid memorisation and recitation. Many of the formulaic phrases that are repeated ad nauseum seem to be mnemonic devices in the text for these purposes. The same goes for the poetic metre of the entire work. At least that is how they struck me. Homeric scholars may or may not agree.The fact that the Iliad was meant to be read aloud in public is part of the difficulty for silent readers of the text who treat it like a novel. Many of us will recall the agony of reading the plays of Shakespeare at school, but may have enjoyed performances of his plays in theatres and on TV. Perhaps that is a useful analogy to reflect upon.The major characters such as Achilles, Odysseus and Hector are mostly repugnant to modern sensibilities when we first encounter them on the page. They are violent, deceitful, braggarts who often behave like petulant children. Sometimes they are cowardly cheats. They murder foes supplicating them for mercy on the battlefield. Women are simply spoils of battle.On the other hand they are also brave and noble to an extreme degree. They fight almost hopelessly against fate in the form of the Olympian Gods. They are loyal to their friends to the bitter end. They compete honourably against one another.In reality they are just like us, but with our human strengths and weaknesses greatly exaggerated. They are complex, imperfect individuals - noble, but with equally great flaws. Perhaps this contradiction makes them so unforgettable. Their exaggerated traits cause us to reflect on timeless themes: bravery in the face of impossible odds, loyalty, endurance, duty. We may not love Achillies or Hektor, but we admire their struggles.Another difficulty for modern readers of the Iliad lies in the role of the Olympian Gods. In pre-Christian Greek times, this pantheon formed the dominant religious belief. Audiences would have had no difficulty with the idea of Gods interfering in the lives of mortals. In the Iliad they interfere with gusto. They have their favourite heroes on both sides in the Trojan War and bicker among themselves when one God's hero seems to be getting the upper hand over the hero of another God. The mortals know this, yet they battle on in the hope of victory, yet knowing that they may be undone at the last minute by some interfering God."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"What the Iliad REALLY isBy Chris MillerIt is rather unfortunate that very few people today really know what the Iliad is. Upon being asked, most readers would say that the Iliad is about the Trojan War, or about Achilles or about Hector and so on; some might say it is about war or the frailty of human existence. But the plethora of answers indicates that they have not hit upon the one thing that ties all of them together. The Iliad is about speechmaking. It was written at a time when speechmaking meant life and death to the peoples of Greece. Under the oligarchic systems in place in Athens, Sparta, Corinth and other major cities in Archaic Greece, one's skill in speaking in front of the courts, councils, foreign officials, high-ranking dignitaries, armies and even in the market place could spell the differences between death, war, confiscation, banishment, fines, payments, safety, survival and peace. This book filled a demand for a handbook of speechmaking, the speeches of the Ancient heroes of the great united Greek forces who defeated a seemingly undefeatable Asian foe. The tale being set very far back in time, and glorifying all the Greek cities, removed any political or nationalistic barriers to its reception anywhere in Greece. It could therefore display the orator's art to the full, pulling no punches (sometimes literally so!) because it ran no risk of offending anyone. About 50% of the Iliad is speeches, and the other 50% narrative but written in dramatic, emotive, rhetorical fashion. This is not to say that Homer intentionally created a textbook for speechmaking, but rather that his audience craved an epic full of brilliant speeches, since their lives were so involved with this art. The kind of exquisite rhetoric Homer provided his audience befitted the oratory they thought their glorious ancestors possessed, and it in due form became the model for their own speeches and remained so through the democratic period, through the Hellenistic kingdoms, through the Roman empire and even into the Middle Ages. It was the central text for study in Greek schools, and the raw material for speechwriting exercises there. Senators and Emperors read and reread it, even memorizing it. In our own day we seem to have forgotten the Iliad's purpose and have viewed it as a rousing tale of war and adventure; but to do so misses the point. It was not read as a pleasant novel for petty diversion but instead as a study in public speaking. It can safely be said that this text enshrined the democratic tendencies of the Archaic Greeks in the everyday life of the ancient Greek and Roman world, and set the stage for the dialectical development of thought, culture and even science. The Iliad established the debate as a socially acceptable and even necessary thing for arriving at correct ideas. The debate remains the hallmark of Western developments in all areas. This is really what the Iliad is all about and is why it is the central piece of our Western civilization."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Beautfiul. Clear. Resplendent in its language. But not for most of today's readers. Newer. Better. More emotional translations are now here. Do not huff and puff like a literary elite.

Choose a different, newer translation."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Few translators have had the success that Richmond Lattimore has when it comes to THE ILIAD. I would be hard pressed to find a better translation since others are either too literal to be poetic or too liberal to be faithful to Homer's story. Alexander Pope's is, of course, one of the greatest, but you have to go back 250 years to find one as enduring as Lattimore's."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"This is the beginning of everything. I'm not one of those who consider the Bible as the beginning of Western literature because those Jewish tales are interesting but not European. I have nothing to add about the Iliad that hasn't been said or written before and I wouldn't even try. But when I hear those first words 'Sing, o goddess, Achilles' wrath -ill-fated wrath...' something trembles inside me because I know my forbears are talking to me and telling me a terrible story of bravery and death, of war, bravery, swords, love, terrible human sacrifices that took place in the Mediterranean world just a few thousand years ago. It's so human -even the bravest warrior is afraid when he sees death coming. And I highly recommend to read aloud or recite those words because this is not a novel, but poetry and you have to feel it in your mouth, even if you don't speak or read Greek. I can tell you, Homer sounds marvellous in Spanish and I guess that if you have a good translation, it must sound wonderful in English or French or German as well. So this is not a review but a testimony of my love towards the first one we know that created beauty with words and with such a bloody story."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I had to read this over the summer for my English class. Frankly, I think that a much better translation could have been chosen. Greek is not based on word order, as is English, and thus two words, say &quot;big man&quot; are often separated in a sentence. Lattimore, rather than taking the logical route and putting the words together, often translates them in the order that they appear in the text! So then that sentence becomes: &quot;the man, walking across the field, big, kills another man.&quot; As you can see, this often leads to confusion, as it is hard to tell which words modify one another. It also sounds very awkward and unpoetic. Indeed, I feel that Lattimore steals the poetic beauty away from Homer's masterpiece. I wish I could read Greek to experience it in its original form!Despite its monotony and confusion, however, I suppose this translation would be excellent for someone studying the text rather than reading it for the sake of reading, since it is basically word by word."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"This is my favorite translation of the Iliad. Some criticize it as being too difficult to read and praise other versions as being more exciting and energetic, but comparing this with more \\"accessible\\" versions, it became clear to me that most of them (Fitzgerald excluded) are actually quite bland because of the information they gloss over. Reading the same passage in this version and then in another made it easy to see the others are actually lacking in drama and energy because of their supposed simplicity.I actually purchased and tried to read Stanley Lombardo's version several years ago and stopped several episodes in, because it was just boring. I purchased Lattimore's recently and discovered this is actually a riviting story. As I go back and look at passages in Lombardo, I can see that it wasn't a lack of attention span that kept me from appreciating this text, it was a really boring translation.As far as Lattimore's readability, there are instances every few pages where I have to pause and figure out what something means, but the advantages so completely outweigh any reading difficulty. This is a pleasure to read - not work. I recommend this version to any reader."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I read a crappy prose translation of the Illiad a few years ago and hated it. I was amazed at how much more engaging and meaningful a verse translation is. Lattimore hews as close as possible to the source, so it doesn't quite take the poetic liberties that the Fagles translation does, but he does an excellent job overall. I was amazed to find that some of these passages where quite emotionally touching. I don't really expect books this old as having these odd little moments of tenderness, but the scene where Helen is standing on the Walls and recounting to Priam all of the Argives she knew before her abduction and her past life was really quite devastating in a way that all of the rote bloodshed never manages to be"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"This translation attempts to replicate the rhythms of the original Greek. The hexameter verse of this translation has a stately, noble rhythm that the other blank verse translations can't replicate. The other translations seem flat, like regular prose compared to Lattimore's translation. To really appreciate it, sound it out in your mind as you read. The Companion to the Iliad by Malcolm Willcock is based on this translation and really enhanced my appreciation and understanding of the epic. I plan to get Lattimore's translation of the Odyssey next."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"When I first read this book, I enjoyed its themes and the overall story, but there were certainly time when I got lost in the sea of names of dying men. It wasn't until after I discussed this book in class that I realized how amazing and profound it really was. Free will, fate, the honor code, the power (or lack of power) of the gods, the various and often conflicting roles of women, and lots of symbolism are all waiting to be discovered inside the world's first written epic poem. You will be surprised how relatable the characters are centuries later. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"\\"The Iliad\\" is my all time favorite single piece of literature (even though I am a Shakespeare scholar), so I did not buy this copy to read \\"The Iliad\\" for the first time, but because my nearly forty-year-old and much read/much loved 1970 copy was genuinely falling apart (despite repairs with both packing and duct tape at two separate points in the past). So I bought it to read again and hopefully to last another forty years. The Lattimore translation is to me by far the best translation of the \\"The Iliad,\\" readable, dramatic, accurate, and very, very beautiful. I recently also re-read the good and serviceable Rouse translation, and it's excellent--in fact for first time readers, I would probably recommend it since it's easier for new readers, especially younger ones, because of the simpler prose translation. However, I compared passage after passage and found the Lattimore to have many times the poetic POWER! \\"The Iliad\\" is after all a POEM, and Lattimore shows us the power of that gorgeous poetry even now three-thousand years later."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Lattimore's translation captures the rhythm and emotions of the ancient Greek. Achilleus, Odysseus, Hektor, Agamemnon, Alexandros and the rest are presented as Homer devised them. This bedrock of Western literature and thought is a must have for any true student of modern culture."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Physically the hardback is a beautifully produced book, with excellent paper and sewn binding, and also great for reading - not too bulky or heavy. The typeface is clear, and the pages are a little wider than previously, giving more thumb-room and fewer broken lines (and more space in the gutters). The original edition had Lattimore's very helpful introduction, but it cried out for detailed notes as well, to give the reader a few more signposts to the action. So the idea of adding notes to this new edition is a good one.However, I continue to find these notes disappointing (expertly written though they are), a bit distracting and unilluminating for a basic understanding of the poem as a whole. The key I think is in the author's stated intention to minimize overlap with other separately available companions to Lattimore's 'Iliad', especially Willcock's brilliantA Companion to The Iliad (Phoenix Books). The result is a commentary that does not feel like it is self-contained, and too often reads like a supplement to Willcock, over-emphasising recent advances in knowledge while neglecting some of the most basic requirements of a first-time reader - like beginning the notes to each of the twenty-four books with a summary of the action. To me the opportunity of in-book notes is more precious than that, and the prime consideration should have been for readers who (the majority, I'm sure) will not want a separate commentary. So rather than pussy-footing around Willcock's commentary, they should have made something like a boiled down version of it (and the others), unapologetically plundering whatever of content or arrangement that would help smooth along a basic reading.The new introduction (also by Richard Martin) is very interesting to read as an essay, but, like the notes, it seems better pitched to a reader returning to the poem, and is missing some of the elementary guidance that a first-time reader needs.Still, an annotated Lattimore is the sort of thing that should be snapped up, and Richard Martin's notes are fine when judged on their own terms (rather than mine!) In the end I don't regret buying the new edition, but I found it best to read the notes SEPARATELY. At least they have been placed unobtrusively at the back of the book! (The notes I dream of should help the flow of the poem so well that they would be unobtrusive if set as footnotes.)"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"It sounds trite to call the work a masterpiece, but once you study the poem, it's easy to see how its richness lies in the details. Homer (or the collection of poets called Homer -- no one is still quite sure) recounts the last year of the Trojan War, but makes every line count with incredible heroic/epic similies, memorable epitets, and detail worthy of a great master. What makes the poem enjoyable though is the humanness of its heros -- no one who's read the poem can forget the image of the great Hektor going out to battle who scares his tiny son to death with his helmet. Homer lets us inside Troy to see their families, their women, their children, their culture -- and the Trojans were the enemy! Sure, there are many long battle scenes and formulaic parts, but it's worth reading through them to get to the great passages. If you've not read Homer before, read a simple overview of the Judgement of Paris and the Trojan War (D'Aulair's Greek Mythology is very simple and easy to follow) and buy a guide like the Twayne's Masterworks or Bloom's Notes. Remember, the ancient listeners already knew the plot, so you're not cheating if you read the basic plot before reading the chapter itself. You're just doing as the Romans, er, Greeks do. In this case, I'd recommend the Lattimore since it's by far the closest to the dactylic hexameter of the Greek -- he really hits the nail on the head in this translation."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"So, everyone knows the story of the Iliad. We're all familiar with the Greeks and the Trojans and the horse and lines written about it with regard to &quot;Who is he to Hecuba?&quot; I've been reading different translations of it since grade school. What sets this one apart?Richmond Lattimore, a Dartmouth College Alum, goes to great lengths to preserve the original language and tries to keep the story in poetic form while translating the Greek as literally as possible. This is seen on simpler levels, i.e. the use of non-anglicized name (Aias instead of Ajax) but pervades the entire book on a larger level. This keeps the awe which the tale conveys entact, and even makes it quite powerful, without going over the top and being silly, like the translations of certain professors at Princeton."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"The Lattimore translation is, as I was told my my humanities teacher, the closest translation to the Greek to date. This is good in that it keeps true to the intended poetry of the work. This is bad if you are a non-English major college student :PIn this translation, not meant to be easily understood by today's English speakers, there are many sentences that end in the subject of the sentence, which can be confusing. If you don't pay very close attention, you will get lost. There are many similies and metaphors that can be confusing unless followed closely.... it sounds something like, \\"Then Hektor of the wide arms spoke unto Melos of the flowing hair. Then they two took their swift spears and their shining swords upon those whom the Goddess of the White arms had chosen.... not a direct quote, mind you but the book sounds like this throughout.I would call this a difficult read. I would suggest it for the English majors, those who are poetry minded, or those who want a better understanding, better translation after having read another, more understandable translation.Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I wish that I could say which translation of the Iliad was the best, but as this is the only version I've read, this is all I can review. Lattimore's translation is good and easy to follow, but it seemed to resemble prose more than poetry. If you are looking for more than that, I've heard the Alexander Pope or the Chapman version to be excellent.At its heart, the Iliad is just a great story. The heroes are the very largest of life and there are many scenes that exemplify a very real human essence within all of them. The Trojan War is presented in graphic, gory detail. There are moments of reprieve, however, with dialogues between Hektor and his wife Andromache and between Achilles and a variety of people. By the end, this book will help you get some of that ever-elusive 'wisdom'.What struck me as kind of curious is that some reviewers call this an 'anti-war' book. I wasn't left with this impression. This isn't Euripedes we have here. Sure, at times Achilles subverts the Heroic code of the Homeric era, but the book ends (*spoiler alert*) with him gleefully killing Hektor, thus sealing the fate of Troy. The Iliad is too big a text to be simply 'anti-war' or 'pro-war'. It succeeds in the rarest way of literature: all sides are presented, and the reader will have to decide what to take from the book. One thing I'd like to mention: parallels abound throughout the story. Look for them. There are many layers to this story, which is why we still read it today."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Guys stabbing each other with spears and chasing one another around in chariots - what's not to like? But more than the action, the book's great value is that it teaches a cosmic, eternal truth. That truth, which Richmond Lattimore presents in lyrical, beautiful English is this: The nature of man is fixed.This ancient work makes clear that we are the same now as we were then. Therefore, any effort at \\"New And Improved\\" humanity is folly. A quick review of human history will convince anyone that establishing a new way is deadly. Stalin, Pol Pot, Hitler, Mao all thought that they had it right, that their new man living in their new way was utopia.Contrast Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot, and Mao with Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton. As so well stated in Federalist No. 51, \\"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\\" Madison had it right. We're not angels and thus, need a government. We're not going to be governed by angels and thus, we must constrain the government.We have to continue to read Homer's Iliad and embrace its great truth concerning man's nature. We should also enjoy the experience and along the way, improve our ability to speak and write English. Richmond Lattimore's translation of Homer's Iliad is the book for doing these things."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Richmond Lattimore was an absolute genius. I recommend this book to very advanced classics students, but especially to those who have taken many years of Latin and Greek courses. The translation is most certainly not intended for anyone prosaic. It is more literally and accurately translated than any other translation in existence. For the lover of poetry, this translation is a must! Bravo Lattimore!!"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Having been a very lazy student in high school, I'm sure I was assigned to read the Iliad or Odyssey, but never did. A recent trip to Crete, and to the ruins of the Bronze Age Minoan civilization inspired me to read Homer. Considering the comments of reviewers who read the Iliad under duress as students, I'm glad that I read it on my own account.Why read the Iliad? For one thing, it's where Western literature begins. The Minoans had writing, but their language is undeciphered. The Mycenaean Greeks adapted the Minoan writing system, and their language has been identified as an early form of Greek, but if they ever wrote any extended works, none have been discovered. That means that Homer and Hesiod, who are generally thought to have lived in the 8th Century B.C., are the earliest surviving literature in Europe. Homer is assumed to predate Hesiod. The themes of the Iliad - fate and free will, for instance - have been dealt with by writers through the ages, and continue now.Homer's works represent the transition point where the legends and traditions transmitted orally since time inmemorial are first recorded in writing. The settings of the Iliad and the Odyssey are in Bronze Age Mycenaean Greece, and many of the traditional legends which serve as a basis for the stories undoubtedly date back far into prehistory. The style and contents of the Iliad have many elements which undoubtedly come directly from the oral traditions, most notably the Iliad is written in verse. These, as Lattimore explains in his introduction, are tools which the narrator uses (a) to memorize the tale, and (b) to help to help the listener follow along. A lot of elements are repeated, especially the epithets (my favorite is \\"Thersites of the endless speech\\") and descriptions of repeated events like religious ceremonies or the death of a warrior (\\"his armor clattered about him\\"). Reading it, it can seem a bit repetitive at times, but keep in mind that this is an epic composed long before it was transcribed to written language.This is by no means easy reading, and it is quite long (485 pages). Things are usually developed very slowly. The plot of the story is actually fairly simple. Lattimore starts the book with a 50 page introduction, which is very helpful in explaining how the Iliad works. In the beginning of the introduction he gives a summary of the story which takes less than one page, but you would be missing the entire point by reading the \\"cliff notes\\". To give you an example, there is a description of Achileus' shield which takes up 4 pages, and which is an absolute highlight of the book. Patroclos's funeral is also detailed at length, giving a fascinating look at the culture in pre-Classical Greece (you can't be sure how much is from the Mycenaean Bronze Age, and how much is from the Iron Age Dark Ages, when Homer lived).A lot of time is given to the interaction of the various gods and immortal beings with mere mortals. This is one of the most interesting aspects of the book. These gods are hardly impartial, loving, or \\"above things\\". They all have competing stakes in the outcomes of the war, and scheme and deceive humans and one another to affect the outcomes for their favorite mortals.Not having read any other translation of the Iliad, I really can't comment on the relative merrits of Lattimore's translation compared to others. Lattimore's goal is to be as true to the original Greek sentence structure and the original meter of the verse. Since English and Ancient Greek have very different grammatical structures, this inevitably results in some convoluted sentences at times. Unlike some other translations, this one remains pretty faithful to the original Greek names, rather than the Roman ones (Zeus and Ares vs. Jupiter and Mars, etc.). This attempt to be faithful to the original is why I ultimately chose to read this translation. I really wanted to get into the spirit of the times, as much as possible.BTW on the web you can listed to a recitation of the \\"Iliad\\" in ancient Greek by Prof. Stanley Lombardo, who also did a translation. I can't understand anything, but it sounds great, and you can really appreciate the musicality of the poem."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Such a great buy. really cheap which is perfect since I need it for a class im taking. came just in time for the new semester!"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"While most schools have you read the Fitzgerald translation, and better schools have you read the Fagles translation, there really is no better version than Richmond Lattimore's. Lattimore, with artistry and skill, manages to preserve the flow and feeling of Homer's original Greek. I honestly felt like I was reading the original without having to slog through all of the pain of translating it by myself.Lattimore's translation gives life to the characters and passion to the story, and allows us to see the epic as Homer wanted us to see it. It exposes us to alien customs and traditions and does not try to hide them under forced iambic pentameter and awkward phrasing.I honestly did not like the Iliad until I read Lattimore's translation. I thought it was boring, lifeless, and foreign (yes, a very ignorant attitude). I am a classics student and always wondered why the ancients held this poem up as some paragon of humanity. When I read Lattimore's translation, I understood how the ancients saw and read this book with the same fervor that some people see and read the Bible today.If you are not familiar with an ancient language, though, I recommend caution when reading this version. Sentence construction, word choice, and writing style are all very typically &#34;ancient,&#34; which to us English readers sounds long-winded and stilted. I can see why some reviewers were not entirely happy with this translation, and I completely understand why high schools do not have students read this version.Overall, this translation brought me from absolutely hating the Iliad to absolutely adoring it. I think that means something."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"This is the Lattimore Translation & it is the best of the bunch. It matches the phrasing and cadence of the original. It also provides the most balanced form. here's an example: \\"Goddess Grey Eyed Athena\\" == \\"Thea Glaucopis Athena\\" (glaucopis is a root for the English word glaucoma - when your eyes \\"grey out\\" and you go blind).---The exception? T. E. Lawrence (yes, THAT Lawrence) wrote a translation of The Illiad. I recommend getting a copy of that translation, if you can find one, if only for the historical context of the author."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Some general thoughts....First, there are several reasons for translating the Iliad. Obviously, it is one of the greatest pieces of literature that has as much to offer modern readers as it did those of antiquity. On the surface, it offers raw emotions, visceral action sequences and colorful characters you admire and hate, often at the same time. But it is much, much deeper than that. The scene where Hector bids his young wife good-bye and holds up his infant son to the gods, praying that the boy will one day be a better man than ever he himself was, has never been equaled as a statement of what it means to be a man, husband or father. The debates about honor and duty are still the same we face every day. The humanity, insight and profound philosophy are remarkable-especially for a work now 3,000 years old.There are other considerations beyond aesthetics. Recent scholarship has revealed that Homer has much to tell us about real places, people, ideas, actions and politics. Gone is the great Classical scholar Finley's view that the Homeric poems are mostly fictitious and cannot tell much about the heroic Bronze Age. Therefore, there is a need for an accurate, line-to-line translation that can convey the feel of the original meter and still use the full range of words, places and objects that can often be \\"streamlined\\" in an adaptation.This is where Lattimore's translation comes in. This still is probably the most \\"accurate\\" translation, preserving the structure of the poem, the full meaning of the Greek words and the original \\"tone\\" of the Greek. If you're wading thru the original Greek and want to have something to check against, this translation wins hands down. Also, if your interest in Troy is historical/archaeological, Lattimore is a must. And to be perfectly honest, many, many people have loved the language itself, hailing this as THE classic translation that all others must be judged against.That said, to just sit down and read the Iliad for sheer enjoyment's sake, Lattimore isn't even my third choice. For all its accuracy, I've always felt I was reading a textbook, written by a classics scholar rather than an honest-to-goodness writer. I suspect casual readers might be put off by the (entirely appropriate) academic feel of the work, and miss the probing intelligence of the translation, the brilliant attempt to convey the peculiarities of the original language and meter into modern form.This is a notable achievement, but for those who might be looking for a less \\"formal\\" translation might be steered toward Fagles' translation, or for a heart-pounding, visceral read, to Stanley Lombardo's vivid translation."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I am happy to see that this translation of The Iliad of Homer has remained in print. My copy is over 25 years old and I still regard it as my favorite. Mr. Lattimore has sought to preserve the meaning of the Greek words and the didactic hexameter rhythm, including the additional phrases (such as the warlike, breaker of horses etc.) that make the Iliad poetry to be recited, not read. I like the flow of the words and their cadence, and sometimes read aloud.Also of importance is the introduction to the Iliad by Mr. Lattimore where he provides an analysis of the poem, the Iliad in the context of the story of Troy, the unity of the poem and the figures that populate this heroic tale. This book is not only an outstanding translation but is also a resource for understanding the Iliad. Many scholars have regarded Lattimore's as the finest translation of the Iliad and I think that time has proved this to be an accurate prediction."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"The ILIAD of Homer is one of the bedrock tales of Western civilization, and Richmond Lattimore's 1951 translation achieves its stated purpose of remembering the four qualities of Homer that Matthew Arnold once set out as key for his translators to keep in mind:&quot;[Homer] is rapid, plain and direct in thought and expression, plain and direct in substance, and noble.&quot;Taking place in the tenth and final year of the Trojan War, the ILIAD opens with the anger of Achilles at the great king Agamemnon for taking away his favorite concubine (a spoil of war). Each man's pride is too much: Agamemnon refuses to give back the girl and Achilles refuses to continue fighting. Since Achilles is the Greeks' greatest warrior, the fortunes of the Trojans markedly improve while he famously sulks in his tent. But the Greeks fight on, and such heroes as Diomedes, Aias (Ajax) and Odysseus continue the fight to sack Troy as return the queen Helen to her husband Menelaos, King of Argos. Over the lengthy yet colorful descriptions of battle, they are driven back to their ships by the Trojans, led by their prince and greatest warrior, Hektor (brother of Paris, who has stolen Helen with the help of Aphrodite).The ILIAD is really the story of Achilles, and is his tragedy. Once the danger of defeat seems imminent, Agamemnon offers to give the girl back and make amends (as long as Achilles realizes who's still boss) but Achilles remains caught up in his prideful wrath. He eventually returns to the fight and drives the Trojans back inside their own walls, but the price he pays is dear.The ILIAD is also notable for its depiction of the gods. Far from being above it all, Athena, Ares and their immortal siblings get right down on the beach and take sides in the war. You might think that a battlefield is no place for the goddess of love, but don't worry, Aphrodite soon learns the same. The Greeks will suffer, but the greater powers of Mt. Olympos are behind them, effectively making their victory inevitable.Since Lattimore was trying to get as close to the Greek as he could, his English translation is less poetic than those of Robert Fitzgerald or, I imagine, Robert Fagles (who is next on my list). But it does have its own stately rhythm that should hardly be inaccessible to the modern college student or adult. For high schoolers, though, I would recommend reading one of the other translators first, as the first time one reads Homer, it should be for the story. And what a story!"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Aside from Pope's, which sadly is very difficult to locate, Lattimore's Iliad is the best English Iliad ever made for a number of reasons. First, Lattimore translates the poem line by line, so that, if you want to follow the Greek text, you'll be able to do so with much greater facility than, Fagles, for example, who translates in verse \\"paragraphs\\" rather than lines. In Lattimore's careful, graceful rendering of Homer's prosody lends the verse authenticity without ever slipping into the pedantic. The line-by-line approach, moreover, most faithfully carries Homer's rhetoric and pace.Second, Lattimore preserves Homer's formulas. Where a series of lines appears describing some event or passing some message, Homer packages those lines and repeats them virtually verbatim when the subject comes up again. Thus, for example, Agamemnon's speech in which he \\"tests\\" the resolve of the Greeks to raze Troy (with unfortunate results), by falsely urging them to drop ship and flee, is repeated almost exactly later in the poem when Agamemmnon really means it (2: 110-141; 9: 17-28). Similarly, each major character has a set of adjectives and adjectival phrases describing the character (\\"brilliant\\", \\"swift-footed\\" Achilles; Hector \\"of the shining helm\\" the \\"flowing-haired\\" Achaens, the \\"deep-benched\\" ships, etc.) These formulas accompany the characters and objects throughout the poem. Lattimore observes these formulas. (Fagles does too, frequently but not consistently. Fitzgerald generally does not.)Third, Lattimore's rendering of the dactylic hexameter characteristic of Homer's verse, is amazing, at times bordering on the miraculous. Dactylic meters are generally awkward in English (\\"higgledy piggledy\\"). The virtousity, ease and fluidity that Lattimore acheives is something I wouldn't have believed possible before reading it here.Because Lattimore tries throughout to translate what Homer said, rather than what one wishes he said (see Lattimore's introduction), the English verse is supple and aptly conveys what \\"makes it great.\\" Moreover, the emotional and dramatic contexts are reliable. The butchering and slaughtering are immediate and terrible; the teeth-chattering fear of the heroes in the face of certain destruction prepares the many remarkable instances when a hero will flee rather than fight; the poignancy of Hector's grim certainty of his fate (as expressed in the famous scene in Book 6 where he \\"lets go\\" his heart's dearest treasure because he knows it is his destiny to do so) is dark and heartwrenching. Consider the famous speech of Achilles to Lycaon in Book 21, before Achilles cuts him down with a single stroke of his sword: After acknowledging that in a previous encounter, Achilles agreed to spare Lycaon and sell him into slavery instead, Achilles addresses Lycaon stoically, even calling Lycaon his \\"friend\\" before butchering him. Reminding Lycaon that that was then and this is now, Achilles points out that no one can survive his rage over Patroclus' death. \\"So, friend, you die also. Why all this clamor about it?/ Patroklos also is dead, who was far better than you are./ Do you not see what a man I am, so huge, so splendid/ and born of a great father, and the mother who bore me immortal?/ Yet even I have also my death and my strong destiny,/ and there shall be a dawn or an afternoon or a noontime/when some man in the fighting will take the life of me also,/ either with a spearcast or an arrow flown from the bowstring....\\" This speech is as moving and strange in English as it is in Greek. Nobody touches Lattimore in lyricism and profundity of diction in passages like this.These are just a few of the many qualities that put Lattimore at the top of Homer's modern English translators. It is impossible to overstate the virtuosity of Lattimore's line. I hate comparisons of apples and oranges, even where they improbably fall from the same tree. That said, if I could only have one translation, it would be Lattimore's. Fagles' is very fine, and both reveal aspects of Homer's genius with a brilliance unknown before their separate appearances. Lattimore, however, renders the poem's diction, style and thematic exposition more closely than Fagles, and since Homer's poem iw what we want to read when we read it in English, this is the bottom line. (Fitzgerald doesn't compare.) But since we live in times of unprecedented abundance, I don't have to make that choice.My only quibble: Lattimore tries, inconsistently, to transliterate names more \\"accurately,\\" than in most versions. Thus, Achilles is \\"Achilleus;\\" Ajax is \\"Aias.\\" Admirable sentiment. Awkward for the verse. I ignore it and \\"hear\\" the received versions when I'm reading Lattimore."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"I recognize and agree that Lattimore's translations of \\"The Iliad\\" and \\"The Odyssey\\" are the MOST TRUE to Homer and Ancient Greek we have ever seen.Two minor examples: he uses long verse lines (like Homer), maintains Homer's sentence structure and he keeps and repeats all the Epitaphs exactly as they appear in Homer.Lattimore's choice of words and sentence organization can sometimes seem jumbled and complicated and his manner/style somewhat archaic, it is because Lattimore is showing how Homer \\"sounds\\" in English as if you were translating it directly and perfectly from the Greek. That is Lattimore's aim, to render Homer as EXACTLY as possible. For this I am grateful...he has helped many to develop a more scholarly aptitude.This aside,I give it 3 stars because I find that his translation is not condusive to reading. Lattimore's 1950's American English is out of date and the story moves excessively slow. I often find Lattimore's Homer stodgy, hard, complicated, and often boring!My favorites are still Stanley Lombardo's (Prosaic Verse) and E.V. Rieu's (Novel-like Prose) versions. Both full of fire-like Excitement, shimmering Beauty and monumental Drama.I always recommend having 2 or 3 different versions of Homer on shelf, Lattimore is always on mine...not for reading enjoyment though but only for comparing.Thanks"},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Of all the verse translations of Homer's Iliad that I have read, Lattimore's is certainly the finest. Though Robert Fitzgerald's translation is probably one of the most popular, I think Fitzgerald has taken too much liberties with the language, sprinkling his own metaphors like salt and pepper indiscriminately over the text and thereby distorting Homer's style in a very inexcusable fashion. Fagles's translation is also good, but a bit too &quot;close&quot;. Even Homer's contemporaries know that this poem with a heroic age inretrievably lost in the tide of time. Even though Lattimore's translation may seem heavily formulaic and pedantic at the first glance, a little bit of patience and thought will help you in appreciating the power and beauty of this masterpiece.This paperback edition is probably the only real edition out there. I still cannot understand why nobody bothers to print the hardcover editions from the 50s and 60s any longer. Those give much more space in the margin for notes and scribbles (and who can read the Iliad without being tempted to scribble a line or two!). However, since the paperback is all there is one must be content...Those who read the Iliad will not fail to see why Homer is considered the first creative genius in the Western Canon. The Iliad is a flawless masterpiece sustaining the same tone from the beginning to the end, tragic in a sense that the tragedy is too great for tears. Book 22, the climactic book of the Iliad, is THE most powerful crescendo ever constructed. There is no doubt to the outcome: Hector WILL die and Troy WILL fall--these are given in Book I. The Iliad does not rely on suspense to captivate the audience. Rather, the experience of reading the Iliad may be summarized as the twillight region between day and night, during which we the readers know what will happen--wait for it to happen--and meanwhile, when faced to death as all the Homeric heroes, reflect on the meaning of life, of death, of glory, and of our common lot."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Recently the market has been overwhelmed by the Fagles \\"translation\\" of the Iliad and the accompanying clamour of praise that the Fagles \\"translation\\" has attracted has made it seem that Fagles' version has made redundant all previous translations. The problem with Fagles is that the praise is undeserved as the Fagles version is a \\"paraphrase\\" which strays too far from the actual Greek text for it to be a translation.I own the Iliad in both the original (Homeric) Greek (based on the Oxford version), with a parallel text in modern Greek. The Lattimore translation is the best one available in the English language without exception.Anyone who wants to get a feel for the Iliad in English cannot go past the Lattimore translation. Hopefully the Fagles fad will fade...."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"While some may indeed prefer the poetics of Pope, for those approaching The Iliad for the first time or anew, Richmond Lattimore's translation is both accessible and memorable. It will also impress on readers the various mnemonics that are such an important part of how this oral work came to be handed down.Unlike others, I do not find what amounts to blank verse in sections to be unpoetic. Unromantic, yes. But this is war. Lattimore's translation, completed in the shade of the atomic age and the Cold War, conveys the hope implicit in the embassy passage as well as the inexorable march to tragedy and the questions left to survivors. I know of no other English translation that communicates this as clearly to modern readers.Especially after the Brad Pitt movie of Summer, 2004 which reduced the epic to two busy weeks, this is important reading. Lattimore's language captures the pace (no less horrifying because of its languor) and allows readers to piece together a reasonable understanding that could be shared with listeners in the firelight of millennia past.Read others if multiple translations interest you, but start here."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Everything you have heard about the importance of Homer to all of subsequent western thought.....IT'S ALL TRUE! Homer is the very foundation upon which everything else in western philosophy and literature rests. While it is impossible to capture the rhythm of Dactyllic Hexameter in English, Lattimore's translation is nothing short of profound. Let me make a suggestion to anyone who is interested in reading Homer, but is not well versed in Greek mythology. Before beginning the ILIAD, consult a good reference guide that will give you all of the &quot;background&quot; information on this work (such as the judgment of Paris, the abduction (?) of Helen, etc). The ILIAD begins in medias res, (in the middle of things) and provides no background info whatsoever. Journey back to 1,200 BC to the ninth year of the Trojan War...join the millions of readers throughout history who have lent their imaginations to the ancient bard Homer &amp; have come to understand the wrath of Achilles.... an anger that is by one account rather childish, but on another so very human.

This book is that important."},{"Title":"The Iliad of Homer","review":"Richmond Lattimore's translation of The Iliad is the strongest, most resonant version I have yet read. It doesn't have the energy or the high poetry of the Fagles or Fitzgerald translations, but it is nevertheless the most moving and the most rewarding to read.Lattimore's translation approximates as closely as possible what it would have been like to hear Homer speak for himself, in long, rhythmic lines that leisurely extol the story of Achilles's wrath. One feature that I found helpful was Lattimore's direct transliteration of Greek names into English, rather than using their Latin equivalents. Here, Achilles is Achilleus, Menelaus is Menelaos, Hephaestus is Hephaistos, and so forth. Printing the names so that they can be pronounced as they were in the original Greek helped in separating this reading of Homer from those I had experienced before. And unlike the Fitzgerald translation, these names are not encumbered with accent marks and other distracting apparatus.Lattimore's introduction is also worthwhile. He spends a few pages examining each of the many major figures--Odysseus, Diomedes, Agamemnon, Paris, Hektor--as well as describing the cultural context of Homer's epic. And index of characters and where in the text they can be found makes this, along with the introduction, an excellent edition for students and beginners.But the chief attraction is, of course, the story itself. As I said, this is neither the most energetic nor poetic of the English versions, but it is certainly the best and most faithful to the original. Despite having read The Iliad several times before, I found myself moved and excited again and again by the often poignant scenes of war that Homer presents.If you only read one English version of The Iliad, make this it.

For Bible lovers it gives some insight to traditions and happenings outside the Bible around the time of Saul or David. Of course the Iliad would have been written sometime after Solomon. Now it does not have anything to do with the Bible but it does provide a picture of other cultures of that time.Homer doesnt seem to be anything more than a good story teller and obviously paints the picture to fully support his country. But that is how this artist viewed the events and presented his take on it.In some ways we arent really that different now. Like Homer and his ability to put all causes at the feet of the Gods you ofter hear people today claim fate to be solely linked to their God. They sacrificed similar to the Jews in offering up burnt sacrifices of unblemished animals and olive oil was considered sacred.I think this is a must read. Dont let my 3 stars turn your nose.

I was forced to read Lattimore's edition in Mr. Hickett's 10th grade English class. It was the most painful experience of my life. The text was so dull and highfalutin. Plus, Lattimore's translation consists of an \\"introduction\\" that's geared more towards scholars and students of the Greek than everyday folk. And his glossary, a necessary reference for anyone unfamiliar with classical mythology, is quite whimpy. The finest translation for the modern layman is Robert Fagles's Iliad. This is the translation I've read in college and have since become a Classical Studies major. (Take that Rickett!) It has an execellent introduction. It includes an outstanding array of maps, a genealogy of the House of Troy, helpfull notes, a great glossary, and even suggestions for further reading!

He believed that \\"beastly people must be punished\\" (Pendergast). But it was only when his book Boy was published that the truth behind his reasoning was revealed. For throughout Boy he shares the true tales of his child hood, which seemed to mostly revolve around \\"beastly\\" people. He portrays authoritarian figures with evil intentions; as depicted in his other books, such as Matilda. In Boy there are many of these figures, such as the headmasters at his schools, who enjoyed brutally caning their students, and the old lady in the candy shop, who holds some sort of a vindictive grudge against children who enter her store, especially boys. As a result of this, Dahl creates an overwhelmingly negative portrayal of adults, which thus leads to a great appeal to most youngsters."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"On the first page Dahl proclaims, \\"This is not an autobiography.

From houses, to vacations, to dead mice and even canings, Dahl paints a vivid picture of his life at home and school, until his life lead him to be a pilot in WWII.

The book on CD, with the various voices performed by the reader is spectacular (my rating, five stars), while the book adds a lot in the way of supplementary graphics related to the text. Due to my family's interest in Dahl's books and movies based on them (between us, we've read and/or watched most of the lot), it is fascinating to learn a bit about his childhood and young adult years. The author claims from the start that Boy is \\"not an autobiography.\\" If anything, it is more a potpourri of memories, most involving incidents that occurred during his time at various boarding schools (unfortunately, many involving canings). It also includes some family history, anecdotes from the annual Dahl summer holiday, the amazing fact that his mother saved (and had returned to him after her death) 600 letters he'd written her between 1925-1945, and a bit about his post-school life. From what I've learned since, the book is not without controversy, especially in his contention that one of the worst offenders in the headmasters-who-cane-students department of his childhood went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury. That issue aside, the book/book on CD (as a great source for photos, sketches and letter excerpts) combination of \\"Tales of Childhood\\" is excellent.

His first memoir, BOY, is a very slight volume, less than 200 pages, but it is full of perhaps the most delightful and whimsical vignettes of childhood ever penned. While it is true there are some very shocking references to beatings and \\"canings\\" which were apparently quite common in English public schools, administered by both the masters and the older boys, the overall tone of the book is one of wonder and fond reminiscing. This is particularly true when Dahl talks of his home life, which was obviously a very loving albeit often unsupervised time, when boys could just be boys. Dahl's father, a very successful businessman, died when Roald was very young, but his mother, a Norwegian immigrant, kept her large blended family (6 children in all) very well, and stayed in Wales (then England) to raise them all, as her husband would have wanted her to. What I found most interesting in the book (although it was ALL absolutely wonderful) were the stories of young Roald's experiences at various boarding schools. These things happened back in the 20s, and yet many of these tales were so much like my own stories from one year in a Catholic seminary (a boarding school) that I was astounded. For example, when he explains \\"Prep,\\" which was the same as what we called evening \\"study hall\\" at St Joe's in the late 50s.\\"Every weekday evening the whole school would sit for one hour in the Main Hall, between six and seven o'clock, to do Prep. The Master on duty for the week would be in charge of Prep, which meant that he sat high up on a dais at the top end of the hall and kept order ... The rules of Prep were simple but strict. You were forbidden to look up from your work, and you were forbidden to talk ...\\"This simple descriptive passage took me immediatley back to St Joe's Seminary in Grand Rapids when I was just 13 or so, and sat at my study hall desk right next to my friend Tom Cassleman. We often skirted these strict rules by raising the tops of our desks, ostensibly to get a book or pen, so we could whisper to each other or pass notes, smirking and huffing silently to each other, immensely pleased with ourselves at fooling the priest \\"master\\" up on the dais in the center of the hall. Ah, yes, Mr Dahl got it right, even though he himself was a fearful little boy of only nine in his tale, which took place in an English school over thirty years before. I could relate, as could any St Joe's student from those years in the 1950s. As for the canings, they were gone by the 50s in American schools, but we could be sent to see the dreaded Dean of Discipline, Fr Leo, if we were caught for any infractions of the rules. And I did hear rumors of a certain perhaps predatory short Monsignor who invited the smaller boys into his rooms to \\"counsel\\" them. Thankfully, since I was already over six feet tall, I never got the call. Another passage in Dahl's story which I immediately felt a kinship with was the one where he talked of the propensity of doctors and dentists in his day who never bothered with anesthetic when operating on children.\\"Pain was something we were expected to endure. Anaesthetics and pain-killing injections were not much used in those days. Dentists, in particular, never bothered with them ...\\"Yup, I had an old-school dentist, even in the 50s, who didn't believe in \\"wasting\\" novocaine on kids. The prevailing theory was that kids didn't really feel pain. I remember crying every time I got a filling, and I got a lot of them back in those pre-fluoride days. Dr Brown would frown and tell me to \\"stop being such a baby.\\" Bastard! Once again, Dahl understood and got it right. If it isn't obvious yet, I loved this book. On to its sequel now, GOING SOLO. Watch for my review of that soon. - Tim Bazzett, author of the Reed City Boy trilogy."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"BOY: TALES OF CHILDHOOD was a thoroughly enjoyable autobiography about the early years of British author Roald Dahl. I used to wonder how he came by such an unusual first name until I read that his family originally came from Norway. All of that and more is written in this small book, and some 81 five star reviews preceding mine attest to how truly entertaining it really is. Of particular interest to me were his years in several Public Schools (We here in the US know them as Private or Prep Schools.) where he excelled in sports and suffered, at times, the bullying and corporal punishment that was mercilessly doled out to young boys by sadistic Head Masters and Upper Grade Students alike.Dahl's book is divided into four parts: 1. Starting-point (His \\"Papa and Mama\\" and kindergarten 1922-3), 2. Llandaff Cathedral School (1923-5), 3. St Peter's School (1925-9), and 4. Repton School and Shell Oil Company (1929-36). So, the book covers the years from his birth in 1916 to his graduation from Repton School and employment with the Shell Oil Company in Africa prior to the beginning of WW2. It concludes with Roald joining the RAF in 1939 to train as a fighter pilot. Dahl continued his autobiographical adventures during the war in a follow-up book entitled GOING SOLO.Although Roald Dahl passed away in 1990, his books are still very popular with children and adults of all ages. I highly recommend this wonderful book...and everything else this incredibly talented man has ever written.P.S. Many family photos, bits and pieces from hand-written letters by the author, and amusing pen and ink drawings by British artist Quentin Blake are included."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I adore reading and devour about 3-4 books a month, and I can safely say this is my favorite book of all time. I first read Boy when I was around 8. Now, nearly twenty years later, I still have that same copy. The cover is hanging on by a thread and the binding is in sad shape, but it sums up how I feel about the book: I have read it to death. No one tells a story or turns a phrase quite like Dahl. His descriptions of homemade Norwegian ice cream alone make the book worth reading! While not recommended for very young children due to some disturbing images (corporal punishment at school, a scary trip to the dentist), anyone who loves vivid, memorable, hilarious memoirs should read this book...over and over again!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"My 15 year old brother-in-law enjoyed reading this book with me. I enjoyed it myself!!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Dahl's childhood was obviously worse than mine, and mine was bad enough, thank you. I can't imagine why a child would want to read about children getting abused, but judging from the other reviews of this book, apparently some children do.On pages 144-146, Dahl tries to explain why he is telling us all this. He tells us of an abusive headmaster who was later appointed Achbishop of Canterbury, and he wonders how anyone could regard him as a loving Christian.Good questions. But I am still not sure. When I was a child, I heard adults reading such stories, and I thought they were reading those stories to us just to humiliate us.I am afraid that adults will read this book to children for the same purpose. Or if they read this book to children for some other purpose, I am afraid children will THINK that they are trying to humiliate them.Dahl's gruesome childhood is probably the reason that he writes about children emerging as powerful and important.Give me \\"Matilda\\" any day."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I like this story very much. When I started, I thought it was very boring because he started with history about his Father and his Grandfather. That was a boring chapter. But when he was telling about the sweetshop and the mouse it was very funny.Not every chapter was nice, some of them were very boring and with difficult words. There are almost 2 pages of description about his schooluniform, that was very long and complicated and very very boring because I didn't understand what he was talking about. But that's funny too because Roald hates the uniform: \\"\`I'll look like a complete idiot,' I said. My mother went out of the room and left me to it. With immense reluctance, I began to dress myself.\\" (Page 136)But I had the Dutch version at home and all the chapters I didn't understand I could read in Dutch, so that's a lot easier.This book is absolutely not far fetched, it's very realistic, it's just in the past and there are things like hitting with a cane to punish that we don't know.But it's nice to read how different school was from now. Because you don't have an idea. When you read the book sometimes you really think: Wow!!! Like having prep, you may not talk, you have to work and when you say something they hit you! When we have to work we can talk! That's really different.He was a little boy who was never at home and he wrote a lot with his mother.\\"When I recovered and went home, I was given this vast collection of my letters, all so neatly bound with green tape, more than six hundred of them together, dating from 1925 to 1945, each one in its original envelope with the old stamps still on them. I am awfully lucky to have something like this to refer to in my old age.\\" (Page 82)The idea that you are reading an autobiography of the author himself is very strange. I never did that before, but it is very nice."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I remember vaguely reading this book when I was in grammar school and liking it then so when I spotted it at a little used book store I couldn't resist picking it up for nostalgia if nothing else.I must say even though it's a kiddie book it is uproariously funny even to the more aged readers. In fact I think I enjoyed it more reading it as an adult. I think it deffinately worth a flip through as the stories seem to pull anyone and everyone in."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Good book about growing up and some of the great stories you're expect from your grandfather. Could have used less information on the beatings headmasters used to give students."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy, by Roald Dahl, takes place in Norway, England, and Wales. His family lives in Wales and vacations in, his parents' former home, Norway. When Dahl was a kid, he was schooled in England. An important person is his beloved mother who raised him, and his sibling, single-handedly. Dahl's siblings were also important to him. Important childhood events are: when he dropped a dead mouse into a sweet shop jar owned by an evil woman; getting bullied by Boazers, which are like school prefect if you didn't know what a Boazer is; getting his adenoids removed; getting a job in Africa as a young man; and almost having his nose cut off in a car accident.Our opoinion is Boy by Roald Dahl is boring, if you're like us, who like fiction books; it's an autobiography. It was also very boring because, he gave small details, and not all of our questions were answered. But, if you like non-fiction books, you'll probably like Boy."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book is amazing! I loved it! I have read it 12 times in the past year!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I somewhat disliked the book Boy, which was written by Roald Dahl. To me the book had too much detail at points, the detail was needed to make the book what it is but at other points it was overdone and made me board with the book. When you first read the story Roald Dahl tells about his father and his bother and how they became what they were. I thought that too much detail was put into that it bored me very much. At points the detail was good, when he was in high school, at the point when he was canned 4 times he put into much detail. I thought that that helped show the tuffness of his child hood more then a lot of other things. The beginning of this book really put me to sleep, just about his father and such of his past. After awhile and as he got older he got more curious and into more trouble which made the book more interesting. The book was easy to read, I think Dahl always writes that way, and easy to follow what was happening. The book did pick up as it came closer to the end. The detail that was put into Roald Dahl had a youth full of adventure and sadness, the family trips to the magic island and the mischief he got up to in his days in the sweet shop. Dahl also had sad memories, when his sister died and straight after his dad also died which left his mom to take care of about 6 children."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I thought this Biography very interesting but I have to say I will NEVER read it again, The horrible beatings he had to endure as a nine year old boy left me sickened and depressed,I made myself finish it, so I could write this review. The cruelty displayed by the Matron and Headmaster was terrible, especially since these boys were away from home with no one to talk to.If you enjoy reading about such things than this is the book for you.What is truly amazing is Dahl's humor in writing these memories, I guess he had to go through this so he could write his books,,,,,sad"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"We didn't like the book very much. Because: It was not so intersting to here about Roald Dahls lifestory. We guess that he had a exciting life, but as you know it's more fun to experience the episode by yourself, than to read about Roalds stories. Some of the episodes was fun, like when a drunken doctor amputeded his fathers arm. And the carcras was also fun. But sometimes the book became &quot;to funny&quot;, and you most of all wanted to cry..... That's the reason that we only give the book to stars."},{"Title":"Boy","review":".David Gordon9/29/05English 4 BoyRoald DahlFor this month's book review, I read Boy by Roald Dahl. This story is a memoir about some events in his life; witch has a lot do with when he was growing up as a kid. I chose this book because Roald Dahl if one of my many favorite authors. I have read many of his books, for example the BFG (big Friendly giant), and the Twits. These are some of my favorite books, so I wanted to know the author behind the righting of the books; what made him so creative? That's the reason why I chose this book as my months book review.There were many important events in this book, but the series that started out the book had to do with his past. It all started with his father (Harold Dahl) losing his arm in a drunk-in misunderstanding. After that that event, he had to go through life with only one arm. but he found ways to adapt. He started his business in Paris and became rich. Then he met Roald mother and they had a family of 9, Roald being one of them.Another event that I really found interesting was when Roald was 7-9 years old. He and all of his buddies were going down to candy store to get a little treat. He kept on talking about how he didn't like the old woman running the cash register. At the store all the time she would give him dirty looks. Also one of his friends had a dentist dad. And his friends dad always told him that the candy was made of rats and other gross objects. Since his dad was a dentist, he felt like he was the expert. This showed that he had friends and that he liked to go to the store to hang out with his friends; something he enjoyed doing.One of the things I love about Roald Dahl is that he works hard on everything he tries. Whether it works or not or whether he does it well or not, he always tries his best. with his hand drawn pictures. Even though they don't look good, but you can tell that he puts a lot of effort into his work. That's another reason that I chose his memoir for my book review.This memoir was one of my favorite memoirs (Except Brett Favre's). In this memoir it shoes Roald changing from a boy to a man. From talking about his problems, whether good or bad, at least he tries to work on them. And after reading his memoir, I now know what made him so creative and a great righter."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"In this \\"autobiography,\\" Roald Dahl does not tell his entire life story from front to back but only some of his best memories and events that inspired him for his other books."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"The book Boy Tales of Childhood is an autobiography of Roald Dahl. He has had some amazing and hilarious events. I have some favorite events from his childhood. One of my favorites is mrs. Prachett's gobstoppers. I like that one because Roald Dahl and his friend play a pretty funny part in the story.I also liked it because Roald Dahl and his friend get in a lot of trouble and mischeif.Roald Dahl and his friend get a pretty hurtful punishment, but I can see why.So, overall the book was a really good book and everybody should read it. I give this book a 4 1/2 because I liked the book a lot but there were some parts that I did not like."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This is a terrific early non-fiction book for readers who are ready to move on to more adult reading, but who aren't willing to give up the delicious fun that Roald Dahl provides us.Boy is a selection of stories from Dahl's childhood. As he does with anything he writes, he has taken out all of the boring bits, and left the most shocking and intriguing parts behind to tell his story.Children and adults alike will be alternately delighted and horrified (or, even more often, delightedly horrified) by the true stories from Dahl's childhood, which range from the Great Mouse Plot to a graphic look at the beatings he and other students endured at the hands of their boarding-school administrators and peers.We also get to see the most barbaric side of early medical practice, as every doctor who makes a brief appearance in the book seems hell-bent on causing the patient as much pain and suffering as can be imagined.We can see Dahl's childhood memories as he sees them, and there are many obvious starting points for some of his most famous (and less famous) stories. The beating that Danny, Champion of the World, endures is alluded to, as is the strong Norwegian grandmother character from The Witches, among others.This is not a definitive biography by any means; rather, this is a pleasant jaunt through a series of interesting stories that have the added benefit of teaching us a little more about the man behind some of the most beloved books of his time.I enjoyed this tremendously as a tween, and I still enjoy it today. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"It's an accepted fact that most young readers prefer fantasy to biography. If given the choice between the \`Diary of Anne Frank' or the latest J K Rowling or Lemony Snicket, few children would choose the biography, despite it being an essential addition to their library. However, Roald Dahl's true-life stories of his childhood are the ideal cross-over, helping the young reader discover that truth can be as fascinating as fiction.As always, Roald Dahl's style of writing is highly accessible and great fun to read. Millions of children are familiar with his hilarious fantasy stories (Matilda, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory, The Witches), so are more likely to read this slightly more serious book than they would other biographical material. Those who are interested in writing and have ambitions to become an author themselves one day, will be fascinated to discover the original inspirations behind many of Dahl's fantasy books.\`Going Solo', Dahl's sequel to \`Boy' is one of the most gripping little books I have ever read - far more so than 'Boy.' I strongly recommend both books to children of all ages ... adults too."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"BOY is the most incredible book you could ever READ!!!If you haven\`t read this book,then you don\`t know very much about Roald Dahl,do you?BOY is about Roald Dahl as a child with his Papa and Mama,his brothers and sisters:Alfrild,Ellen,Elsa,Astin,and Radyr.It starts from the time he was born to the time he left school.There are some gross parts in this book but I can assure you that there are many,many silly parts in this book.I hope you will read and enjoy this book because it is an awesome book and you will enjoy this wonderful book,Boy."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"The reviewers who said that Boy is not as good as some of Dahl's other books are right. But that doesn't mean that it isn't excellent. There are some bits that are a little bit boring, but other bits make up for them. There is more gruesomeness in Boy than in any of Dahls other books! In fact sometimes I felt phyisically sick reading this book. There is a bit where he has his tonsils removed that is really rough. And the part where he gets the cane is almost unbelievable. Surely they wouldn't have been allowed to make your 'buttocks' bleed? This book rather makes you think about how lucky we are today."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"\\"Boy\\" by Roald Dahl is a very easy read, but highly entertaining. This book takes you from before his birth through his last days at the Repton prep school. He describes in detail his experience with the \\"cane\\" at all his schools. Also, his adventures in the summers he spent in Norway. Personally, my favorite part of the book has to do with a math teacher he had at Repton named Corkers. This eccentric old man seemed to do everything he could to avoid teaching, from doing cross words to just leaving the class room whenever one of his pupils passed gas, then never coming back. \\"Boy\\" can be read by people of all ages. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This is a great autoboigraphy by Roald Dahl. It is different than most other autobiographies in that it doesn't just list boring facts that don't interest the reader. Instead, it tells the reader about the many strange and wonderful events that happened in Roald Dahl's childhood. It is life through a little boy's eyes. Some of the things that happened to Roald Dahl when he was young are: putting a dead mouse in a shopkeper's jar of sweets, getting in trouble for putting the mouse there, going away to boarding school, getting in an automobile accident, and being a chocolate taster. As you can probably tell, this is a good book to read, and is differentthan other autobiographies."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy is about Roald Dahl and his chldhood.

It teaches you about life."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I would recommend the book Boy, Tales of Childhood: By Roald Dahl to 15+, but if you like reading adventures about people like Roald Dahl or you are a serious learner you will most likely find the book fascinating. The book was written in first person from Roalds' perspective. The book is an autobiography of Roalds' life. My favorite part is when Roald dropped a mouse into the gobstopper jar at Mrs. Pratchett's sweet shop. I read the book in a day because I liked it so much. I learned he was beaten a lot with a cane and that made me realize how much different times are today. Interesting fact: Roald's mother saved all of his letters and bound them together with green tape. I really enjoyed the book and I think you will too!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"BoyTales of ChildhoodThe book Boy is a biography that tells the childhood of Roald Dahl. He tells stories about his life in boarding school, his punishments, and his funniest moments as a kid. The book talks a lot about he's problems growing up and his experiences in boarding school. One of my favorite stories is about how everyone in the boarding school would get free Cadbury chocolates. The reason why everyone got chocolates was because the company wanted feedback on the chocolates so every kid would be very careful and try each chocolate and write whether they liked it or not. When Roald Dahl was younger he wanted to make the perfect filling for chocolates he had all these ideas about what a chocolate factory looked like. I liked this story because I think it is really cool to be able to test chocolates and I also like this because the story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was based on the chocolates from boarding school. Roald Dahl wrote this book really well and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy was quite the book to read.

His father became wealthy selling ship supplies. He died when Roald was a baby.Roald went to a preschool and kindergarten close to his home. The headmaster beat him with a cane after he and two classmates played a prank at a candy store. After this event, his mother was determined to send him to an English boarding school because his father had always believed that English schools provided the best education.Roald had a difficult time at the boarding school because he was sent there at such an early age. One time he broke his pencil while taking a test and asked to borrow one from a classmate. He was accused of cheating and was beaten by the headmaster. Another time, he was so homesick he faked being ill. His mother came and took him to the doctor. The doctor advised him not to pretend to be ill and to return to school. The doctor never told Roald?s mother that he was pretending to be sick.One of the highlights of his stay at boarding school was that the Cadbury Candy Company sent samples of new candies they were testing. The students had to fill out a survey to tell the company which candies they liked best. Also, he learned photography and took pictures for the school. He even had his own darkroom.Roald?s boarding school experience was difficult but he learned to be a great writer of children?s books as a result of the education he received.The book was well written and easy to read with some exciting parts.

He gives a bit of background information on his parents (including how Dad lost his arm) Dahl shares many amusing anecdotes about school life and how some of the teachers or older students were. This was a long time ago - no Internet, cell phones, TV, etc, so the education system was similar to ours in some ways but VERY different in others! It really is almost like a time warp, and Dahl explains/describes things in a way that make it clear for us.

But anyway, Boy had quite the gruesome life. His nose was almost cut off, he had his adenoids cut out among many other accidents and adventures.

It's filled with action and adventure. Dahl captures minor events in his life, and adds in every little detail, to create a perfect picture of what actually happened as a kid in the early 1900's. I chose this book because I really enjoy reading his fiction books, and I wanted to see where this amazing author got all his ideas.Did you have any idea that Roald Dahl was part of the Great Mouse Plot? Well neither did I until I read this book. It turns out that Dahl was a normal candy addicted kid, who stopped by a candy store regularly after school. Being annoyed by the harsh, mean woman who runs such a sweet candy shop, he and his gang of friends decide to get her back by dumping a dead mouse in a popular candy jar. This whole scene completely gave the reader the pride and joy of revenge from a child's point of view.As Roald Dahl grows up, he is sent to an all boys boarding school. Back in those days, teachers were not the kind who accepted apples unless they thoroughly examined it for any kind of prank. They walked around with canes to slap little boys on the bottom, and enjoyed seeing children in pain. One time, Dahl was accused of cheating on a test. Even though all he had done was ask to borrow a pencil, the teacher did not listen, and of course he got a good swiping with the cane. This chapter of Dahl's life reminds you of that all alone, homesickness feeling, that every one of us has experienced.Every summer, Roald Dahl and his family visit their hometown, Norway. They would take their boat out and explore all the island of the Norwegian coast. One summer, they took their usual trip to Norway, except this time they had one more person; Dahl's half sister's fianc&eacute;, or as he refers to, \\"the male lover.\\" Nobody in Dahl's family liked the male lover, except Dahl's half sister of course. This male lover especially liked to smoke his pipe of Navy Cut Tobacco. One day when they were on one of the many Norwegian islands, they all decided (mother included) to teach the male lover a lesson for interfering with their family's peaceful life. So they substituted his tobacco, for something else. . . Dahl painted a perfect picture of the coast of Norway for the reader. One can almost smell the salty, fresh Norwegian air.After reading Boy I realized that nearly every one of his books relates to some major event in his life, so I would rate this 9 out of 10. I really enjoyed this book, because it really captures the feeling of being a kid (I should know from experience). Remember, if you are looking for an autobiography, that's unique, and not BORING, then read Boy by Roald Dahl, and you shall be quite content."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Anthony DalliSeptember 25, 2005BoyBy Roald DahlThe book I read for my review was called Boy by Roald Dahl. This book is about a young boy who experiences a tough life in school. He makes some friends as well as a few enemies. It is the story of a boy who goes through life as it was back in the early 1900's. Schooling was very tough back then, especially because the teachers were strict and often disciplined students with a cane. I wanted to read this memoir because Roald Dahl is a famous writer. He wrote books such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach.There were many important events in the life of young Roald. His schooling days at Landaff Cathedral School gave him a lot of opportunities for practical jokes. The most memorable was called the Great Mouse Plot. A group of students, including Roald, placed a dead mouse in a jar and when a storekeeper named Ms. Pratchett reached into the jar and touched the dead mouse, it practically gave her a heart attack! His closest friend during those times was Thaites. Thaites was very smart and so Roald liked hanging around him. Another time Roald was accused of cheating on a test by Mr. Hardcastle, a very strict teacher! Roald didn't actually cheat but Mr. Hardcastle wouldn't believe him. \\"You are lying! I always knew you were a liar! And a cheat as well!\\" (p. 106) This was a hard time for Roald because Mr. Hardcastle seemed to hate the students.Another major event in Roald's life was when he got a job at the Shell Company. From this job, he was able to learn how to become a successful businessman. He also was able to travel to East-Africa and from all his experiences he became an expert in the field of gas lines, different kinds of gasoline and other types of fuels. \\"We trainees were sent to various Shell Companies in England to study salesmanship. I later went to Somerset and spent several glorious weeks selling kerosene to old ladies in remote villages.\\" (Page 156)Many of the experiences in Roald's life were important because they shaped his life (even though he didn't think so at the time). For example, where his mother chose to send him to school was very important because he had a lot of hardships in school which actually helped him learn to make better choices through discipline and hard work. So, by the time he got his job at the Shell Company, he was an older and wiser businessman.The author also learned things about himself. He learned that he could be a good leader if given the chance. Even at the end of his book, he was positive about his life. \\"It had nothing to do with gobstoppers or dead mice or boazers or summer holidays among the island of Norway. It was a difficult tale all together and if all goes well I might have a chance of telling it one of these days.\\" (Page 160) I really enjoyed the book because in the end, it was encouraging to me."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I first learned about Roald Dahl from my son who is now grown up. I read Witches, Matilda, and others along with this fun, amazing, and insightful autobiography by a beloved author whom I &quot;met&quot; through my son.BOY is the exciting autobiography that let's the reader in on the youth of an author who wrote some of the most original and entertaining books that I discovered as an adult. Dahl takes us to Norway for summer holidays, schools where they didn't hesitate to pounce on thetrouble makers, boyhood adventures, and frightening experiences that make the reader stop, think, and appreciate that you didn't experience some of Roald Dahl's shocking ones.A fun, enlightening, sometimes shocking revelation of the boyhood of one of &quot;kid's world's&quot; MOST ENTERTAINING writers!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I read this book when I was 11 years old (quite some time ago!) and it began my obsession with autobiographies. I haven't read much fiction since then, and I know this book was the turning point for me. I never even read any of his other books! ha ha...Like other reviewers say, it indeed has violence, but as an average 11 year old I was unfazed. It's not as though this is random, pop culture zombie violence either, it's real life cruelty and experience, which I think even relatively young readers can digest and appreciate.I highly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book was fantastic because the author(Roald Dahl) made it very funny and also included pictures and very discripted words.Roald Dahl told us about his mom and dad and also about himself. He made the story funny but also stayed on topic. My favorite part of the story was when Roald Dahl was little and he found a dead mouse and put it in the candy box for the mean candy clerk to find. Roald Dahl told and his child hood and about his adult hood. I think you would enjoy the book. My sister and I are very different and we both loved it. I hope you will take time to read this book."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"In the autobiographical book \\"Boy Tales of Childhood\\" by Roald Dahl, Roald explains some of the highlights, downs, and most memorable moments of his life. This is an easy read with interesting stories and mishaps. In my mind this book is one you must read because it travels into the mind and life of an incredible man, intelligent author, and loving family member. A third grader could read the book and an adult could read the book and both love it. It is personally one of the best books I have ever read. Roald Dahl is one of the most famous children's literature authors ever; and his life is just as fascinating as his books."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"If you've ever wondered where Roald Dahl got his stories, you should read his memoir of his childhood. You'll find a lot of his inspiration there. Beginning with a short biography of his father and ending at age eighteen when he leaves school, Roald Dahl chronicles in vivid detail his childhood life.I thought it was a very entertaining book. Roald had a pretty interesting life. He was involved in the Great Mouse Plot of 1924, spent several years in various hellish boarding schools, and nearly lost his nose in a car accident during his teens. This book is not for children only; older people will like it too."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"In the book Boy, by Roald Dahl, he describes his life in chronological order, making his life story easy to follow. Boy is very descriptive and gives a vivid picture of an English school boy's daily life in the early 1900's. Dahl describes in detail the violent punishments given so freely at boarding school. Those punishments taught him to mistrust adults because, in most cases, they unjustly punished students.Dahl's writing style reaches out to a younger crowd rather than an older crowd. As is evident in most of his books, his view of life is that of a young person, and it is as this young person that he conveys his philosophy: corporal punishment is wrong, parents should support their children, and people should follow their dreams.He compares his life to the lives of young people today. He actually comes out of the book and speaks to the reader. This is a good technique because the reader can personally relate to the book. I would highly recommend this autobiography to anyone interested in looking at a person's daily conflicts through a childlike perspective."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This was an exctremly funny book that tells all the things that took place in Roald Dahls life, leading from his British school days to his summers in Norway. I read this book and loved it, and I suggest it to other kids to."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This is a autobiography From when he was young all the way up to the end of secondary school.These were he's collection of his notes.There are some sad parts and some funny parts espaically when they put a dead rat in the gobstopper jar.Mrs pratchett finds it and shuts the shop And they think shes died from the shock.This story has lots of emotions I recommend this story for it is very funny.Also it has pictures of him for example When they had a school photo. Also Roald dahl Pretended that he was ill to go home Because he did not like the matron.I recommened it because it has mixed emotions."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"We think the book was pretty good, because of the descriptions of the different incidents. We got the chance to look into the English school system from the old days. How the boys got punished with the cane, and about the teachers behaviour towards the pupils. We also liked Roald Dahl's exact description on how things worked and looked like. For instance describing his different pranks and his different teachers.To sum up: This book was an easy reader, which gave us the opportunities to learn different words and phrases! :)"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I've always been a big Roald Dahl fan, both of his books and the books that have been turned into movies. I loved \\"James and the Giant Peach,\\" \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" and \\"Matilda\\" just to name a few.I had been meaning to read \\"Boy\\" and \\"Going Solo,\\" Dahl's two memoirs, and started them the other day. I was unbelievably surprised to find out that Roald Dahl's birthday was September 13th (and he would have been 96 years old)! I mean, what kind of coincidence is that?Anyway, I decided to talk about both books in one post because they are very much related. \\"Boy\\" is the story of Dahl's childhood, and follows his life up to age 20. \\"Boy\\" is filled with humorous stories that have inspired many of his books.For instance, we learn that Dahl attended boarding schools under mean headmasters, and an even nastier matron, who bears a striking resemblance to the Trunchbull from \\"Matilda.\\"Dahl spent his early elementary days, aged 7-9, obsessed with a neighborhood candy shop and the Gobstoppers inside it (inspiration for Willy Wonka?), and even had his hand (ah, I made a pun that will only be recognizable if you read the book!) in a prank on the candy shopkeeper that he calls the Great Mouse Plot of 1924.Dahl was also lucky enough to go to a boarding school that Cadbury would send samples to in order to find out what kind of chocolates young boys enjoyed!\\"Boy\\" is a fabulous read, with many stories that can easily be linked to some of his most popular novels.I highly recommend reading \\"Boy\\" is you want a humorous look at the youth of one of the most famous and well-loved children's authors.\\"Going Solo,\\" on the other hand, would be better for those people who wanted to know more about Dahl's military life, which contained fewer references and story lines related to the books we grew up with.\\"Going Solo\\" was about Roald Dahl's experiences in the military, with exploits about flying planes and secret missions. While I liked the book, I did get bored with the military aspect towards the end. If you like Roald Dahl and enjoy reading about the military, you might enjoy \\"Going Solo.\\" Otherwise, stick with \\"Boy,\\" which is a read that I think many more people would enjoy.What is your all time favorite Roald Dahl story? Check out my LoveAtFirstBook blog and tell me what you think!Thanks for reading,Rebecca"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This autobiography was writtin by Roald Dahl, It was about his life so far. For examplewhen he was in Pre- school and elementry school. He found a dead mouse and what he did withit is he put it in candy in Mrs. Prachett's candy jar. He had to got to a dicipline place because ofwhat he did. It was so bad he faked sick so he can go home for a couple of days. I chose thisbook because I enjoy reading books by Roald Dahl such as Matilda.Roald Dahl was sent to a boarding school because he was very bad. The headmaster wasmean. When she heard a boy snoring she was going to woop him. She was ubsessed, Roald wassent for disipline. He needed to learn so he can go back home. One day he couldn't take itanymore he faked sick. The headmaster got a doctor and the doctor knew that he was faking buttold him he will let him go if he never did that again. Roald agreed right away because hewanted to go to his mom. \\" Your faking, aren't you?' he said. \`How do you know?' I blurted out.\`I expect your homesick,' he said. \`What will you tell the school?' I asked him, trembling. \`I'llsay you had a very severe infction of the stomch which I am curing with pills,' he answeredsmiling. (Pg.97and98).Roald addmits to the mouse plot, he said it was all his idea. Roald and his friends wouldhave a secret hiding spot and everyday when the class is empty they go and check it. One daywhen they checked it, they found a dead mouse. Everyone was saying throw it out the windowbut Roald says that they should put it in Mrs.Prachetss's jars of sweets. \`We'll do it today!' theycried. \`We'll do it on the way home! You had the idea,' they said to me, \`so you can be the oneto put the mouse in the jar.' (Pg.36)He was a chocolate tester for Cadbury's. Everyone would get a box of 12 bars. They areall the same kind but if u were lucky you would get the new kind. Roald Dahl was lucky so hegot one of those bars. He had to taste it and give feedback on what he thought of it. He also gotto help invent a kind of taste for the chocolate. \`I've got it, sir!' I would shout putting thechocolate infront of him. \`It's fantastic! It's fabulous! It's marvolous! It's irresistable!' He wouldleap from his chair, crying \`You've got it! You've done it! It's a miracle!' He would slap me onthe back and shout, \`We'll sell it by the million! (Pg.148and149). They were both very excited.The author learns that you shouldn't do anything bad unless u want the concequences. Helearns about dicipline, his job, and many of his adventures. I think people should learn that theyshouldn't do a lot of bad things to eachother because they will probably end up in boardingschool like Roald."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I liked Boy very much because the author(Roald Dahl) made pictures and described his child hood and adult hood. Roald Dahl told us negative sides of childhood and positive sides of adult hood.Any little boy that attended St.Peters would get wipped with the Matrons cane if they did anything bad. One possitive side of his adult hood was whith his job he got to travel all around the world like Egypt and Peru. Roald Dahl could be funny at the same time without getting off the topic he was trying to get through. Once when Roald Dahl was little his half sister was engaged to a guy everyone in the family disliked. Roald Dahl put goates poop in his pipe and when it was time for his half sisters boyfriend to smoke he smoked goates poop. Roald Dahl told me that without just saying I hated him he told me in a funny story way. I hope you can take time to read this wonderful book, BOY."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy is a great book. it is about the childhood of Raold Dhal. Back then there was no seat belts in the cars. Will Roald Dahl loes his noes because of that? People used to use a thing called a cane in school to disaplen children. If it was used on you you would have a bruse on your bottom for 3 weeks. The cane is used on Roald Dhal 2 times but is talked about 3 times. Roald Dalh and his family go on a trip evry summer and this summer his sisters boyfiend comes along. His sisters boyfreind smokes a sagar. While he is swimming Rold Dalh gets the perfect idea useing poop. This is a hlarus part of the story but you can not find out what happens unless you read it. When Roald Dahl goes to a regular school in his own twoun he does a pretty meen thing. He finds a dead moues but what will he do with it? You will have to read the book to find out. All that I have left to say is, DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK OR ELS YOU WILL BE MISSING OUT BIG TIME!!!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Thank goodness Dahl survived this pack of childhood horrors and hilarity or the world would have been short one unmatchable children's writer.From sliced off noses, to dead mice and goat tobacco, my sides ached with joy to read these stories over and over. They can be read in any order and match James and the Giant Peach or BFG in their sheer wonderment and charm, you will barely believe it to be true."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy is a wonderful little book about Roald's family and his childhood. The mischeivious stories would easily capture a boy or girls interest, and this is a great book to get a young boy interested in reading. Really a must read for any age, as the delightful tone of the book will capture any reader."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"His childhood has begun with his father's death and has finished with graduation.

You can't stop reading once you pick up this book."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"The book Boy is about Roald Dahl's life. I thought it was a good book because I didn't know anything about Dahl's life and I never knew he got in so much trouble. I also assumed that he had been writing all his life but he actually was a photographer before he even started writing. His life was also very tough, when he was little he went to a school where he was hit with a cane and all the people were mean. His mom was very adventurous and witty. Overall his life was very fun and it was a good book."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"To be honest I think this book is absoulety ACE!!! Especially the chapter about the dead mouse and Mrs. Pratchett's shop.Dahl has something about his words which seems to caputure you inside its story.One of Dahl's best friend would have to be THWAITES.All the other stories are FAB aswell such as The Witches and BFG and of course Danny the Champion of the World.This review has been done by Jasmin Moffatt age 9."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This hilarious book from Roald Dahl that tells about the funny things that he had done throughout his life. People who enjoy other books Dahl wrote will laugh on this one. For instance, Roald and his friends put a dead rat into a jar of Gobstoppers.

His whole family thought it was funny exept his sister and her boyfriend. So all in all i gave the book 1 star because there was no action."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book is recommended for anyone who is looking for something funny, sad, adventurous and just fun.Wonderfully written!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"What a cute read--about the youth and misadventures of a Norwegian boy raised in Wales and England during the 20's and 30's! The creator of that delicious childhood fantasy, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY--tells all! Woe to cruel Headmasters and callous boy bullies who perpetuate (with Society's connivance) the curious system of excessive corporal punishment. Creative and imaginative, Dahl was familiar with the business end of several canes brandished with (dis)passionate self-righteousness. He describes his childhood and teenage experiences up through his first job, just hinting of his war activity.This is a very enjoyable book; it reads easily, with plenty of lively dialgue, excerpts from his letters, family photos and wry kid humor. One suspects that Dahl--who signs his weekly, yet subtly-censored leters home as BOY-- was not a favorite with his masters, except on the playing field. His fertile brain concocts many schemes to bring pompous or nasty adults down a few pegs. Undeterred by harsh canings, he continues to defy authority, and to comment privately on human brutality.One wonders why the British permitted such barbarism in private schools--a self-perpetuating system which rewards or encourages sadism. One hopes that boarding school conditions have been tempered in modern times. Will the real British graduate please stand up, so we may check for ancient cane lines! Did such treatment produce generations of tender-hearted Old Boys, as Dahl would have been if he had been granted Boazer status, which he had earned for athletics; or successive waves of beasts, eager to give as good as they got?There is much humor packed into these otherwise light pages, so don't miss this entertaining autobiography of an international boyhood. You'll chuckle and be outraged here and there, but you will not be bored. For kids of all ages, especially those who have spent the better (or worse) part of their lives in boarding school."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Anyone can appreciate Roald Dahl's gift as a story teller in reading his autobiographical, Boy. He displays the charm and timing of a great storyteller, and above all, the casual style that allows us to step unnoticed into such a personal set of antecdotes. But as a long-time devotee of Dahl's outrageous children's books, I was struck by the obvious ties to his fiction; almost the printed justification for the over-developed fairy-tale characteristics of child vs. adult, wicked school mistresses, and the pervading themes of right on the side of the powerless, their wits against bullies of every form. Read Boy not only for it's laughs and unconventional tales of childhood, but also to see more clearly the darker depth of his classic fantasies."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Everyone remembers the good and bad times of childhood. The games played in the backyard, or being tricked into eating mud. Everyone has stories to tell. In the book Boy, Tales of Childhood, Roald Dahl writes about his childhood up through grade school. He gives detailed description of racing tricycles down hills, playing practical jokes on the woman at the sweet shop, and getting beat with a cane by the headmaster. Roald Dahl uses great description and humourous vocabulary to portray every character he encounters. Though this book is written for children, it is fun for people of all ages to read."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book is awesome. It is one of the best autobiographies I have read. It is funny, sad, and exciting. I think every Roald Dahl fan should read it."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"If you like other books by Roald Dahl then you'll certainly like this book. The funniest (and most horrific) stories of his childhood up to age 20 are written appropriately from the perspective of a child, not as an adult reflecting back. \\"Then suddenly came the frightful searing agonising unbearable burning across the buttocks...I was determined not to make a sound, for that would only give the executioner greater satisfaction.\\" An episode at boarding school..."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"It was a marvellous book.If you love Roald Dahl's books you can't miss this one!I found it very interesting.It's very funny andyou will want to readit again and again."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"So says Roald Dahl in the introduction to his autobiogrophy, BOY. The book is a collection of his childhood memories, from the magical summers in Norway to the dreary days at St. Peters boarding school.

From Dahl's days in early schooling to his late teen years he finds himself, causing mischief, going on long adventures, and meeting new people. This book starts out quikly and finishes the same way, but lets you go at the end to wonder what happens in the rest of his life. My favorite parts of the book were, his days on the islands in Norway during the summer, the mischief he caused throughout his younger life, and the way that little changes in his life send him into new parts of the world. I personaly can not imagine life without a father, I had so much sypathy in this book for Dahl because he had no male parental mentor throughout his childhood, but his ability to lead a normal life was great. I enjoyed this book very much and found that it was easy to get into and easier to stay envolved, I would suggest it to anyone looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I first learned about Roald Dahl from my son who is now grown up.

At Landaff Cathedral School(were Roald Dahl went)he sent his mother nearly everyday and she kept them in a little boxbut his mother got illbut she still kept going.

It goes upto where he starts secondary school. He went to Llandaff Cathedral School where he got into loads of mischief. Roald Dahl didn't like primary school much because he said it was boring. There were loads of funny moments in this book. One of them is where his family got a new car and they asked his sister to drive it, but there were loads of crashes. By the time they had finished with the car there were loads dents and bangs on the car. The funniest part of it for me was when Roald and his friends went into Mrs Pratchetts shop and put a dead mouse into a jar of gob-stoppers.

In the story there are lots of anecdotes about his childhood for example he nearly got his nose cut off. Also there was a toffee shop anecdote.

Roald Dahl used to go to the toffee shop with his friends and she was allways being nasty so, one day Roald Dahl and his friends made a plan to put a rat in a gobstopper jar. When she found it she was very shocked that she went to the boy's school which was Llandaff Cathedral School and reported it to the HeadMaster whose name was Mr Coombes. Anyway a search went went out for the boys who did it. Mrs Pratchett and Mr Coombes carried out the search and yes they did catch the boys.

He also tells about a mean candy lady and about being homesick. I really liked the book although I don't read a lot of his books. I think it's a good read. I also think a lot of Dahl fans will like this book."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"We think that the book is kind of funny sometimes. We liked the story about the mouse and the gobstoppers. When Roald put the mouse into the jar of gobstoppers, and Mrs Pratchett gets a heart attack or something. It was fun to read about his trips to Norway since we are from Norway.We didn't like the parts about the cane. It must have been horrible to be punished this way. It's interesting to read about all the odd things that happened to him. This is roughly what the book is about. We strongly recomend this book. It interesting, funny and sometimes shocking.Hilde, Hans Kristian and Jon Einar"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I'm 12 years old and I first read this book when I was 9. I never stop reading it!

Roald Dahl's autobiography is sometimes funny and sometimes sad, but always extremely entertaining. I was delighted to read about one of my favorite author's childhood. :o"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Roald Dahl, son of Norwegian entrepeneurs, was born in Wales and educated in English schools during the early 1900's. Every summer his entire family spent a month among the resort islands of Norway.His descriptions and criticisms of schoolmasters are accurate and often sharp, but the author is also quick to share what he gained from his ''public school'' education. Instead of college, Roald chose a career of adventure in British East Africa. The stories of his past end before he began his career as a writer and he barely mentions his success as author of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. The reader is left to infer that following the beaten path of life only leads to boredom."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Every person must read this book. I was astonished by Dahl's fluent events.

Some chapters are hard to understand, but most are great!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Like a lot of kids, I grew up reading and re-reading Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and James and the Giant Peach. This book is the first volume in the autobiography of the man who wrote those books and, as a Dahl fan might guess, it's no ordinary autobiography.This is a quick ride through Dahl's childhood. We don't learn many of the boring details of his life, but we do get to hear about some of his early adventures, including the Great Mouse Plot and the incident of the Goat Tobacco.Much of the book is very funny. Even when Dahl tells of painful subjects such as his father's death or the beatings he received in school, he does so with great wit and honesty. Reading this book, you feel as if Dahl is sitting beside you himself, relating some of his best boyhood adventures.In addition to Dahl's singular voice, this book contains droll little drawings by Quentin Blake as well as Dahl family photos and snippets from Dahl's letters and report cards.Definitely a treat not to be missed by Dahl fans."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"BOYBY: Roald DahlThis book is an autobiography about the author's life.In addition to his mother and father, Roald had five siblings, two brothers and three sisters.

They are both \\"a must\\" for your personal library."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"The book is a easyreader. It describes the childhood of Roald Dahl himself. But notice this - it is not a biography. It is just funny tales of real things that happened to him. Roald Dahl has Norwegian parents, but grew up in Wales, and went to boarding school in England. He tells about pranks, holidays, teachers, his family, and more. We had good laughts when Roald Dahl found a dead rat, and when the matrone stops a boy from snoring. It is easy for us to picture what life was like those days. We enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I like this story very much. When I started, I thought it was very boring because he started with history about his Father and his Grandfather. That was a boring chapter. But when he was telling about the sweetshop and the mouse it was very funny.Not every chapter was nice, some of them were very boring and with difficult words. There are almost 2 pages of description about his schooluniform, that was very long and complicated and very very boring because I didn't understand what he was talking about. But that's funny too because Roald hates the uniform: \\"\`I'll look like a complete idiot,' I said. My mother went out of the room and left me to it. With immense reluctance, I began to dress myself.\\" (Page 136)But I had the Dutch version at home and all the chapters I didn't understand I could read in Dutch, so that's a lot easier.This book is absolutely not far fetched, it's very realistic, it's just in the past and there are things like hitting with a cane to punish that we don't know.But it's nice to read how different school was from now. Because you don't have an idea. When you read the book sometimes you really think: Wow!!! Like having prep, you may not talk, you have to work and when you say something they hit you! When we have to work we can talk! That's really different.He was a little boy who was never at home and he wrote a lot with his mother.\\"When I recovered and went home, I was given this vast collection of my letters, all so neatly bound with green tape, more than six hundred of them together, dating from 1925 to 1945, each one in its original envelope with the old stamps still on them.

He mentions various times where he was sent to the masters dormitory to get a canning. He was sent to get beaten about three times while attending his school. He explains the whole ordeals in fascinating form including every single bit of the cannings with extreme care. The reasons for his beatings were; he and a couple of friends put a rat in a jar of gobstoppers, he and his friends received 4 hits of the cane for this, again he received 4 hits of the cane for not cleaning the study of a boazer properly and for talking in study time which he received 4 hits. \\"The violence was bad enough, and being made to watch it was even worse, but with Mrs Pratchett in the audience the whole thing became a nightmare.The main teacher that Roald had to cope with in Llandaff Cathedral School was the principle, Mr Coombe's. He was a giant man with a face like ham and a mass of rusty - coloured hair that sprouted in a tangle all over the top of his head. Mr Coombe's always seemed to wear a black gown draped over his shoulder, which made him look like a judge. Of course Roald remember this man because he was the first person to give him a beating. While in St Peter's Dahl mentions two people; the Matron and Captain Hardcastle. The Matron was a large fair - haired woman with bit breasts. She was twenty - eight years old. Dahl mentions her because of the way she acts and does things around the kitchen. For example, at any time she liked, the Matron could send you down in you pyjamas and dressing gown to report to the headmaster whenever this happened you would have undoubtedly gotten canned. He also explains how she was rough, and hated kids. To Dahl, Captain Hardcastle was one of his most feared masters. He was a slim, wiry and he played football. On the football field he wore white running shorts and white gymshoes and white socks. His legs were as hard and thin as ram's legs and the skin around his calves was almost exactly the same colour as mutton fat. His hair was a brilliant dark vermilion colour, and it was plastered back with immense amounts of gel. The parting in his hair was a white line straight down the middle of his scalp. Captain Hardcastle had a moustache that was a same colour as his hair. Hardcastle dint stop twitching and jerking and snorting, this was supposedly caused by something called shell - shock which means he was very close to a big explosion that made him jump high in the air and he couldn't stop jumping. What Dahl hated the most about Hardcastle was his moustache. He hated the way it was shaped and the colour of it. One time when Dahl was in study time his nib on his pen broke. He was whispering to the boy next to him to lend him a nib when Hardcastle interfered. He made Roald get up and go to the headmaster's dormitory where he received 4 hits of the cane.While in St Peters Dahl suffered homesickness for the whole of the first term. He was so homesick that he plotted to get himself sent home so he could stay with his parents. He would pretend that he would have a sudden attack of appendicitis. But after a few months he would forget all of his homesickness out in the playground. \\"The only comfort is that both homesickness and seasickness are instantly curable. The first goes away the moment you walk out of the school grounds and the second is forgotten as the ship enters the port.\\"Roald Dahl had a youth full of adventure and sadness. He encountered various adventures such as the family trips to the magic island and the mischief he got up to in his days in the sweet shop. Dahl also had sad memories. These were where his sister died and straight after his dad also died which left his mum to take care of about 6 children."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy is very funny.

Each chapter is full of laughs and mischief, so much so in fact that you feel that you are right there with Roald Dahl and his school friends causing all sorts of mayhem and by GOLLY isn't it fun?! Dahl also makes some very serious points about the harsh realities of his childhood, but all in all a book that will enthrall children and adults alike."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Boy by Roald Dahl is an amazing book. It is one of the most hilarious books I have ever read. Some of the things that happened to him seemed pretty painful like getting his nose cut almost completely off. My favorite part of the book is when Roald Dahl and his friends put a dead mouse in the gobstopper jar in a candy store so that when the shopkeeper put her dirty fingers in the jar she would grab the mouse and not the gobstoppers.Also reading this book I found out that Roald Dahl based some of his books on his childhood like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. He wrote it about how he and his friends loved candy so much, but they had barely any money to buy it. It would have been awesome to have candy for a penny or two pennies and it sounded like they had some good candy.Well, anyway I absolutely loved this book and would recommend it for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"My twin eight year old sons are just loving all the Roald Dahl books. This one in particular fascinates them as it is the story of his own life."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This is a short account of childhood events that left a lifelong impact on Roald Dahl. The anecdotes are \\"skimmed off the top of his consciousness,\\" as he puts it. A very interesting glimpse of the times (The 1920s-'30s), and of the circumstances that shaped this great imagination.I loved the hyperbolic \\"Wanted for Murder!\\" poster illustration featuring a photo of an aptly wary-looking seven-year-old Dahl, accompanying the tale of a prank gone awry -- only topped by the description of the prank itself, and its all-too-deserving target.The many British private school tales remind me of Stephen Fry's excellent \\"Moab is My Washpot.\\" The horrors are stated plainly and even wryly (as in his fiction), in that subtle way underlining the injustice all the more, while the camaraderie that arose amidst adversity is inspiring. The fact that fate took Dahl to a school where (as one of its few plusses) Cadbury tested new products by sending sample candy bars to the boys, later inspiring \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" brought a sense that the universe has a plan.Though the book does seem a little free-form and truncated, I couldn't put it down, and it left me wanting more, which is always good (at least in a way), and it's funny, fascinating and moving. The sign-off will cut straight to your soul."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"It was a great book. I think it was extremely funny and great and I would even read it again but I do recommend it to other young readers and I recommend other of Roald Dahl's books because I like all of them.

And Roald Dahl's life isn't that way- his life is way more exciting!When I first read this book, I couldn't believe that anyone's childhood could be that interesting. By the end, you'll believe... from The Great Mouse Plot to putting goat droppings in a pipe and smoking it,there's never a dull moment. A fantastic thing for a kid to discover, and for all who are a true kid at heart."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"The book Boy by Roald Dhal has a simple title. The title doesn't explain a lot but it is short and plain. The book gets better and better when I read it. It started out good where he enjoys his life as a kid and he plays with his friends. The conflicts are interesting and I am eager to see the conclusion and result of it. I enjoyed when he goes to school and does many things that relate with mischief. The rat trick in the candy jar was really fun to read. It reminds me of myself sometimes. The details are lacked in explaining the characters and events. That is sometimes good to get the details over with but sometimes it would not explain them at all. A lot of the time I need want details and it didn't explain them. The setting was hard to figure out where it was. I got details but each of them seemed to be useless. I couldn't see the setting in my head imagined. The conflict at the end and middle were related and I liked that since the end carried on from the whole book and it all led up that single conclusion. The characters would usually fit the book very well because they would react to the conflict or event at the wrong time. Roald the main character had lots of action and adventure and it was always a good thing to read. Most of all I enjoyed this book from beginning to end"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"We think that this book decerves a four star , because it's a funny book , but it dosn't reach the highest mark because of some things that are missing , such as: the describing of the norwegian. As an norwegian I felt opposed by the way we are described. He makes us feel like complete fowl , eating fish at every dinner and goatcheese. But it was also a little funny to get described like that...maybe that is how foreigners perceves us? The book has a lot of funny incedens , such as &quot;the toilet warmer episode&quot;. We also found the goats tobacco incedes amousing!That is all we want to say about this book...go Roald Dahl! =)Love from Bente and Anette (norwegians)"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book was okay, i am in the 8th grade, and my class just finished reading it.

A heart-warming story of what it was like being a kid in the early 20th century. When we look back at his childhood it looks somewhat crazy and different to us. Certain events seem barbaric to us, while others just seem strange. He is writing at some time may seem easy and better fit for a child but, reading it as an adult can also be great because it can remind you of your childhood. It was a great read but at some times it seems difficult to stay with it because there is not a greater emphasis on what one or another. He talks the same way about almost losing his nose and having fun with his friends. I give it 2 and a half stars for its realism and direct view on life as a child back in the 20's and 30's but it gets tiresome pretty fast."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Wow! I've always been a Roald Dahl fan, and have enjoyed many...unusual adventures from him. However, I really wanted to find out more about this author. I wanted to meet him, and reading this autobiography of his about his crazy childhood made me feel almost as if I were sitting right in Roald Dahl's presence, listening to him tell me all of these hilarious (well, it's not hilarious when Roald's father and sister die) MOSTLY hilarious occurances. I really recomend this book for you if you're a kid wanting to read a short book about something that's guaranteed to give you a good laugh. Maybe even if you're an adult you'd like to read something about one of the world's most fabulous story tellers ever."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Roald Dahl is one of those authors who manages to make something absolutely horrible into something rather funny. He does so in Boy, which contains various stories of his childhood. His many childhood trials and tribulations, though dreadful for him at the time, make entertaining reading material, and Boy is a short but sweet collection of them. I hadn't read it in a while, and I didn't own this particular Roald Dahl, so I purchased it at Orca and enjoyed it all over again. Dahl also tells about various pranks that he played, and how he got punished for them. I may be rereading Going Solo, his memoir of his flight years, soon, but Boy is better, I think. It's also probably more entertaining for younger readers.Some of the anecdotes in this book are no doubt dramatized; some seem a bit too wild to be credulous. But they're all really interesting to read, and I sped through Boy. Roald Dahl also includes some photographs, and though they're not very good quality, they do add something to the book. It is hard to make out individual people.I don't know what else there is to say about this book. I haven't read Roald Dahl in a while, but I love all of his hilarious novels, and own almost all of them. I might reread Matilda, The Witches or perhaps The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More soon.If you love Roald Dahl's novels, try this excellent nonfiction book by the great children's author. Even though the book is easy, I still enjoyed it a lot. All of the anecdotes in the book are highly amusing. You can see a lot of where Roald Dahl got his inspiration from. I'm also planning to read some of Roald Dahl's short stories for adults in the future.4.5 stars.My blog is located at[...]"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I got this because I was writing about my own experiences in an English boarding school.

Each brief chapter chronicles a memory or reflection of his childhood in Wales and England, with summer in his mother's native Norway. The origin of many of his most fanciful stories can be found in these memories. Dahl, born in 1916, chronicles his life through 1936 when he starts work with the Shell Corporation. The difficulty of life in those days, despite the luxury of being born into a family of means, is reflected in stories of outhouses and primitive surgeries. The book shines with humor, grotesqueries and characterizations of the men and women of the stodgy private schools, bosomy matrons and diminutive instructors. So few books on my blog can be recommended to anyone under 16, but this would make a wonderful gift to that young bibliophile in your life."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book is more or less a description of Roald Dahl, how he lived in his boyhood.The stories are very good written, and it is a lovely book to read."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"A fantastic read that explains a lot about Roald Dahl and the influences on his writing. A great memoir to compare to:Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life,Angela's Ashes: A Memoir, orLittle Britches: Father and I Were Ranchers."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I'm a Dahl fan, a writer for both adults and children. I think the key to his success as writer for children is that he doesn't think children are stupid or don't understand what they see. From my own experience, and now as a father, I know that children see, hear, think and make conclusions with their experiences.This book is a collection of sketches of Dahl's school years. It makes you understand many of the stories that appear in his books: he was born in a well-to-do family, and enjoyed always a high living standard even in the depression years. He attended exclusive british public schools, etc. Then he found a good job at BP.The book is full of family love, anecdotes about a child's view point (adenoidectomy, the mouse plot, etc) which will make you smile or even laugh aloud. Some of those, together with the fact that his mother saved all his letters and family fotos and mementoes, which sprinkle the book, makes it a delightful read.It's true that some of the chapters are sombre, because for us it's shocking to know that children were so abused (beaten with a cane and deprived of affection, or bullied by older thugs who made them fag), but Dahl succeeds in making us loathe that supposedly elitistic education system. He doesn't make it sound as \\"the good old days, they had some bad things but not all...\\" In that sense, it's much better than \\"Tom Brown Shooldays\\" or Kipling's \\"Stalky and Co\\".But all in all, he brings us the sense of a fantastic childhood, surrounded by family love, affection, and well being. I grew up in a partly similar context (the lack of affection in education, but not the beatings or the comfort)and it serves me to try to be a better father, more intent into giving my children nice emotional and intelectual experiences.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This is a great book. The words that Roald Dahl wrote made such a lasting impression that I can't even use MY words to describe it. I got it at a yardsale for free...it was in the quarter box, but the man selling everything let me have it for free....I've read it over and over again and it never gets old. It's so wonderful that I'd recommend it to a 9 year old because of all of the adventures Dahl describes from when he was a child and I'd recommend it to a 99 year old because of the memories he dwells on from the early 1900s. It's one of the best books I've read, I just wish it wasn't so short. Please read it!"},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This book was a very interesting read. It progressed very well for a book that is not much more than a compilation of anecdotes. Roald Dahl has a very descriptive writing voice, whether he's describing the incredible beauty of Norway (the site of his summer vacations from when he was four until he was seventeen), or the several incidents when he was caned by the headmasters of his present school (the sound is comparable to a pistol being fired, and the pain is like being branded by a red hot poker). Some of the descriptions are a bit too gruesome or disgusting, for example when he vividly describes how his nose was about to fall off after he was in a car accident, or when he describes the malicious Mrs. Pratchett (the owner of the sweetshop in Dahl's home town) and how grimy and disgusting her clothes and hands were. The book describes a time back when there were no computers or televisions, and when someone wanted diversion, they went outside to look for it, instead of sitting down in a chair or couch and waiting to be entertained by a box. This fact contributed to the overall authenticity of the book, it took you back to when you had to make your own adventures, an era that sounded like one of the most interesting to be a kid in, and since that is unfortunately not possible for me, the next best thing it is to read this book, which I personally recommend to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"BOY was a good read because I never got bored with reading it. Scenes such as the adenoid removal, his sister's operation when the Boy smelled the sweet smell of the chloroform, the mouse in the candy jar, the goat droppings in the pipe, the canings, were all full of detail and interest. I didn't expect Dahl to have such vivid, sour memories of his childhood. He suffered beatings and pain at his boarding schools, and this must have had a huge effect on his life or he wouldn't have mentioned the canings in such detail. The headmasters were mean old farts, who seemed to enjoy beating boys; they would smile and laugh and take their time about the punishment, most of which ended in a caning. Some parents might not like their children reading this book because of some of the gruesome scenes, which might affect their children's mental state. But it's the truth, and the truth hurts sometimes. Dahl makes fun of everything, especially stupid old adults, who cause all the problems in the world."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"I liked this book because I think he had a lot of adventures going to boarding school. My favorite part is when Roald Dahl put a dead rat in a candy jar at the candy store. His favorite candies were licorice bootlaces and gobstoppers."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"Recently, my second grader had a school project, \\"All about me\\" which is a collage of who they are. She breezed thru all the usuals, \\"favorite food,\\" \\"favorite subjects\\" etc., when it came to favorite book, I thought she'd pick something more recent like \\"A Christmas Carol\\" or one of Cam Jansen or Junie B. Jones, but with endearment in her eyes, she wrote \\"Boy\\" by Roald Dahl. I was quite surprise because she read this in first grade. In fact I read two chapters ahead of her so I would be able to explain anything that she didn't understand. I love the book, myself. I think it is told in a frank and sincere manner, without trying too hard to be nostalgic or sugary. I do think at times that Dahl can be very matter of fact about all the sad things that happened in his life, the death of his little sister, the death of his father, and also the realization that god and religion isn't what it's all cracked up to be, which ironic because he was educated in expensive religious institutions. You will find this in the later part of this book, when one day he was watching the news and saw the old, sadistic school master being crowned by the queen as the new Archbishop of Canterberry. Also, I had to explain what corporal punishment is and how it isn't used anymore and why children in olden days were being sent to live away from home in order to go to school. It also gave my six year old a chance to use her imagination on what's it like growing up in a different time in a different place. Ofcourse her favorite part is the dead mouse in the candy jar and all the really funny illustrations of Quentin Blake. If you have an older child, you could probably let her/him read this book alone, but if your child is between 5-7 years of age, it is best if you read a few chapters ahead, like I did so you can help them understand some of the more perplexing and strange parts about growing up A la Roald Dahl. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"It takes no dummy to realize that Roald Dahl is a writer of some significant talent, whether he's writing horror for adults or playful fantasy for the smallest of children. Those familiar with his works also know that all his writing reflects the experiences, characters, and Britain (and colonies) of his childhood -- thus even the most odd of stories, say, The Enormous Crocodile or The Fantastic Mr. Fox could rightly be called \\"autobiographical\\" in a larger sense of mood and atmosphere.Yes, Boy, one of two supposed straightforward no-fictionizing-or-melodrama books in the Dahl collection, contains some exquisite stories within its pages -- most notably those which deal with the most vivid childhood events and places, such as schools (both Prep and Local) and early motorcar experiences. But the text that connects these stories seems forced. The book starts slow, with a style far from the \\"event narrative\\" of later chapters, making those chapters jarring when they first arrive; most notably, the ending of the narrative trails off at the end of the book as if there were no real story other than filler to get one from Boy to his second autobiography Going Solo. Worse, the best bits have already been recycled; it is clear that we have read some of these stories before, in a far better form, in Dahl's fiction. I'd borrow these from the library if you're a true Dalh-o-phile...but stick with The Witches (look! It's Dahl's grandmother!) or Danny The Champion of the World (look! It's the father Dahl always wanted!) or Henry Sugar if you want to read Dahl at his young adult, \\"autobiographical\\" best."},{"Title":"Boy","review":"This piece of work by the classic children's author, Roald Dahl, is wonderful.

Written from an evangelical point of view, it is a very sophisticated engagement with a wide range of theology, past and present. Each chapter has excellent historical background to introduce present theological engagements, as a prelude to the authors' own development of the topic. There is a stead critique of the failure of the Enlightment project and of foundationalisms, including evangelical foundationalisms regarded as inadequate in the post-modern context. The discussion of epistemology was very interesting, especially Reformed epistemology. (I have already ordered W. Jay Wood's Epistemology: Becoming Intellectually Virtuous; part of the value of the book to me is new leads to explore). There is also much dialogue with Pannenberg, about whom Grenz has written a great deal. The discussions of the Trinity and of the place of community are very well done. The book is well written and has helped bring me to date on what I think will be an ongoing area of theological work, (more especially by evangelicals?) It would be interesting to see these authors' evaluation of Milbank and Radical Orthodoxy. However I can imagine that a lot of evangelicals are a bit alarmed as to where all this is going."},{"Title":"Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context","review":"I want to first say that this book is not for the faint of heart. It is highly technical, philosophical, and seems to draw more questions than answers in the end (clearly a sign of the post-modern trend). Though I admire so many aspects of this work, the book essentially fails to deliver a thoroughly evangelical model for 'doing theology' which would see scripture as our final authority (contra culture, neo-orthodoxy, post-liberalism). I state this criticism not as an ignorant evangelical, but one who shares their concerns: a desire for a more honest engagement and method for doing theology in our present culture. However, though they (Grenz/Franke) attempt to move from propositionalist methodology into a more culturally relevant method, they essentially desire to stay within the evangelical framework. At points they engage this reworking successfully, yet in the end they tend to align themselves more with the Post-Liberal, Yale theology of George Lindbeck and Hans Frei (and somewhat with the 'Neo-Orthodoxy' of Karl Barth), than a conservative evangelical could agree with. So, in essence, the book fails not because it essentially aligns itself with these methods for doing theology, but because it attempts to do this while at the same time remaining within the more conservative/evangelical tradition which sees scripture as the ultimate authority.Other reviewers have given solid assessments of the many specifics of these aspects, so I will not write further on this. I will comment briefly on how the book attempts to give tradition and culture a somewhat equal status to scripture because the bible itself was written within a cultural and historical setting. From the outset, I feel this is honest, yet it seems to lean towards interpretations that tend to be drawn from present culture rather than an understanding of these eternal truths within their cultural setting. Some might say that Grenz and Franke have 'Left Foundationalism'. I don't think I would go that far, but they certainly attempt to exit the propositional methodology of scriptures for something that is more defined by culture.In the end, their desires to move away from this type of 'doing theology' is well-warranted as this method (propositionalism) came out of a cultural reaction as well, the conservative reaction to the liberal interpretations of scripture during 'Modernity'. Essentially, the famous 'Fundamentals' came from this reaction as it was needed within its cultural context. So, I would agree with Grenz and Franke that we need to move 'Beyond Foundationalism'. This 'Foundationalism' (which refers to a method for doing theology) sets the scripture up as an essential treasure trove of propositional facts for the Christian to learn, memorize, and essentially believe in. Clearly, the method of 'proof texting' has been taught to the majority of believers as a very practical outgrowth of this kind of belief. As an evangelical, I don't see this as wrong as long as a thorough understanding of the book/chapter and background is understood well-enough to explain that proof-text. This is just one small example of the common 'Foundationalist' method for doing theology which this book sets out to revise.This leads to the books final assessment: Does the book achieve what it sets out to do? I don't believe so, for the reasons I mentioned above. In the attempt to move beyond foundationalism, it seems to leave the distinctive of foundational/evangelical theology of the primacy of the written Word as authoritative and final in practice and life. It somewhat elevates cultural views of this authoritative written Word on equal status as the original context the writers engaged in. I believe the writers essentially aligned themselves more closely to the Neo-Orthodox view on revelation than most evangelicals would be comfortable with. Their handling of the 'Final Revelation of God', His Son Jesus Christ, seems to take precedence over the preserved written Word which both testifies of Him and is a testimony of the Holy Spirit. I think the balance between the Living Word/written Word is somewhat lost in this book, which is why I feel they have not achieved their essential goals, a revision of evangelical methods for doing theology (and an attempt not to leave it).Lastly, their attempt is oriented more for the academic audience than for the common reader. The book is highly philosophical dealing heavily within this realm. The wordage is also extremely academic in nature, almost convoluted to a point. In my final assessment, I believe Dr. Kevin Vanhoozer's book, \\"The Drama of Doctrine\\" is a more faithful presentation of how to 'revise' evangelical methodology. This and his, 'First Theology' are excellent books on how to approach the Foundationalist methods, revise them biblically, and keep the Living Word/written Word in balance as testimonies to the One true God. His work is very generous, even-handed, and revises (more than departs from) evangelical methods for doing theology in our present, post-modern culture. However, this is still an excellent work in scholarship by two first-rate theologians."},{"Title":"Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context","review":"Is an Evangelical faith still possible in light of the rise of postmodernity? Must one choose between universal standards or radical relativism? Or can postmodernity provide a new form of foundation from which an Evangelical theology can grow?Published in 2001, Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context by John R. Franke and the late Stanley J. Grenz sets itself to answering those questions. Grenz and Franke divide the book into three sections. The first section dedicates itself to identifying the historical situation in which contemporary theology finds itself. In this section, Beyond Foundationalism begins by discussing the mutual fragmentation and collapse within both conservative and liberal schools of theology. From this position the book presents the collapse of modernity as an opportunity to rise above the modernity's search for a universal, unchanging position.Instead, Grenz and Franke propose a \\"localized\\" theology. They propose a theology that speaks to and for each individual community, a theology that concerns itself with Spirit-filled living rather than superimposed doctrinal absolutes. They hope to \\"foster conversation about and participation... that will nurture an open and flexible theology that is in keeping with the local and contextual character of the discipline, that remains thoroughly and distinctly Christian, and that fosters a renewed listening to the voice of the Spirit speaking to the churches through the scriptures\\" (p.27).The second section of Beyond Foundationalism discusses \\"Theology's Sources\\": scripture, tradition, and culture. In short, the book argues that the Scriptures provide theology's \\"norming norm.\\" While one cannot simply point to a verse to prove reality or \\"Truth,\\" the scriptures provide the source and cannon for the Spirit's working in the community.Tradition establishes the \\"Hermeneutical Trajectory\\" for the community. Borrowing an illustration from N.T. Wright, Grenz and Franke argue that which tradition provides the first four acts of a five-act play. The Church is the actors. However, the fifth act is unscripted. The actors must improvise based on the first four acts. They must develop the characters and story in a manner congruent with the first four acts. In this way, Church history provides and authoritative direction if not an authoritative cannon of standards.As the final theological source, culture provides theology's \\"Embedding Context.\\" Theology should not assume to speak universally, to all generations. Instead, the Church is to understand that its answers are to specific questions raised by its cultural context. As much as it may hope for an a-cultural position from which to judge culture, theology is unavoidably shaped and formed by the culture in which it finds itself embedded.The third section of the book focuses on \\"Theology's Focal Motifs.\\" The first motif is the Trinitarian nature of God. The second motif is community. The third motif is eschatology. Because theology concerns itself with a Triune God, it is ultimately communitarian, and that community must be focused on a present and future hope for redemption.My reaction to this book is rather simple. This is the best theology book I have ever read. Beyond Foundationalism provides an easy to read exposition of a postmodern theological method. However, it provides much more than that as well. Grenz and Franke have the hearts of teachers. Throughout the book, the authors dedicate themselves to thoroughly explaining every move they make. Whereas many theological books presuppose a minimal knowledge of both history and terminology, Beyond Foundationalism is easy to follow and accessible by a lay-audience. It provides all the necessary history and a careful explanation of important terminology so that any reader can follow and participate in the conversation. After all, if theology is truly communitarian then it should be done by everyone in the community- not just the clergy and the academics.Lastly, my usage of the term \\"Evangelical\\" should not scare off mainline Christians or those who consider themselves of a liberal stripe. Grenz and Franke have carefully charted a path that weaves between conservative and liberal theologies, borrowing from both but the possession of neither. A theology beyond foundationalism is accessible to both liberals and conservatives, concerning itself more with hearing the Spirit speak in our local communities than with maintaining theological and denominational affiliations.If you have an interest in postmodern theology, theological method, evangelical theology, even postmodernity in general, this book is worth picking up and reading."},{"Title":"Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context","review":"The doctrine of the Trinity is used to construct theology in Grenz and Franke's book, Community is how this theology is made into a whole, and Eschatology is how this theology is arranged into a definite position.TrinityTo begin with, while it is acknowledged that the doctrine of the Trinity is not part of the kerygma of the Church or Scripture, Christian theology is trinitarian in nature. It is a \\"natural outworking of the faith of the NT community\\" (172). Far from philosophical speculation, the doctrine \\"arose as a response to the concrete historical situation encountered by the early Christian community\\" (173). Firm believers of monotheism and that Christianity was the fulfillment of Judaism, early Christians were faced with the task of integrating their three commitments to this God, his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit who indwelt them. \\"They did not want to posit three Gods\\" (174), but they were captive to their experiences and left with the task of communicating their theological commitments. Moving forward, apart from a brief \\"hiatus generated by the Enlightenment\\" the doctrine of the Trinity has been an engaging \\"theological conversation throughout the history of the church\\" (186). Following Karl Barth, whose great accomplishment it was to \\"argue conclusively that the Christian community's primary experience of revelation is trinitarian in nature\\" (189), a truly trinitarian theology, therefore, is shown to be one \\"that is structured around the self disclosure of the triune God as centered in Christ and given through scripture to the believing community\\" (190). It is the experiential components of Christianity that reveal it to be a religion that is trinitarian in nature, and this architecture should serve the Church in constructing its theology.CommunityTheology is formed into a whole in the sphere of community. Since we are beyond foundationalism, the much needed basis for theological discourse is the Church. It is the community of the redeemed, those who have encountered the God of the Bible in Jesus Christ, who provide the basis for articulating the mosaic of Christian belief (233). In what amounts to social contract theory with an ecclesial recasting, i.e. the Church is entered into by believing, the Church is then constitutionally defined anthropologically. But this constitution may be defined theologically as well, since the believing community is formed by the Spirit at work in the narratives of Scripture. The narrative also provides the interpretive framework as it functions dynamically for the narrative believing community (226), and as this community participates in the life of the triune God through the agent of the Holy Spirit, it receives more of God's fulness (228). \\"The church is basic in that our participation in the faith community calls forth theological reflection\\" (234).EschatologyHowever, this community is oriented eschatologically, and this is the third point for Grenz and Franke. \\"Eschatology orients Christian theology because of the connection between eschatology and the narrative of God at work in creation\\" (252). The biblical narrative that the believing community inhabits is itself inherently eschatological since it has as its goal the restoration of creation. This is the telos toward which it is directed."},{"Title":"Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context","review":"This is a required book my university class but it would be a good addition for any religious study library.

Only had one problem had a page tore out but other than that I loved to book."},{"Title":"Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context","review":"Stanley Grenz and John Franke have suggested a provocative proposal for construing theological method in the postmodern context. The impetus for their proposal comes from the widely perceived collapse of the modernist worldview and the resultant and contemporary postmodern cultural setting. The authors suggest that the traditional theological categories of \\"liberal\\" and \\"conservative\\" no longer function as adequate typologies because of the fragmentation occurring within both camps. The authors also argue that these typologies fail to take into account those theologians in both camps who reject traditional modernist assumptions and who desire to take the postmodern cultural milieu seriously. In light of these factors, the authors have proposed a new theological method which construes the theological task as a conversation among three participants (Scripture, tradition, and culture), which form the sources for theology in their proposal. Additionally, the authors argue that there are three focal motifs (a Trinitarian content, a communitarian focus, and an eschatological orientation) that provide coherence to their scheme and which make theology distinctively Christian.Grenz and Franke conceive of theology as the product which emerges from a dialogue among three participants: Scripture, tradition, and culture. Although they construe theology as a dialogue among these participants, they nevertheless argue for the priority of one of the conversational partners (Scripture), by presenting it as the normative and final authority for the church. It is important to note though that the authors make a significant qualification with regard to the nature of the Bible's authority. They argue that the normative authority of the Bible does not come from the text of Scripture in and of itself, but rather derives from the voice of the Spirit who speaks to us through the text today. The authors posit that the Spirit appropriates the text and declares His message to the church (thus performing an illocutionary act), and by doing this the Spirit creates the new community of renewed people (thus performing a perlocutionary act). By receiving the message of the Spirit speaking through the text, \\"the contemporary church becomes the contemporary embodiment of the paradigmatic biblical narrative.\\" Additionally, as the church receives the message of the Spirit in reference to the future new creation God intends to bring about, the new community receives a distinctively Christian interpretive framework that forms it's perceptions of reality and life. Therefore, in this proposal, the Spirit speaking through text serves an essential identity forming function for the church.The authors acknowledge that their proposal of tightly linking the authority of the Bible to the concept of illumination might appear to open the door to subjectivism, but they believe that are able to avoid this conclusion by appealing to the priority of the community over the individual. One must ask, however, if this explanation really does remove the threat of subjectivism (which may in fact be an innate characteristic of adopting any form of a non-foundationalist epistemology). Although the authors argue that Scripture's status as divine revelation does not depend on an individual recognition of the Spirit's voice as speaking through it, it does depend on a communal reception as the community of the church testifies that God speaks through the Bible. And yet, this explanation seems to suffer from two difficulties. First, in light of the diversity of Christian communities (particularly with regard to how different communities understand the extent of the canon), one must ask to which community would an individual look for the answer to the question of what books the Spirit is speaking through (i.e., is the Spirit speaking through Tobit, Judith, 1 & 2 Maccabees, The Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, and Baruch)? Second (and perhaps this is the formal cause of the first difficulty), it seems that merely widening the sphere of receptivity from the individual to the community doesn't solve the dilemma of subjectivity. Certainly it can be admitted that widening the sphere from the individual to the community lends to an appearance of decreasing subjectivity, but what is one to make of the differing conclusions with regard to the Spirit's message from the widely divergent communities themselves? Has the problem of subjectivity really been minimized in this schema? This reviewer cannot help but think that it has not. Therefore, while this reviewer appreciates the emphasis on the priority accorded to Scripture in their proposal, it's tight and inextricable linkage between the authority of the Bible and the concept of illumination seems unable to surmount the challenge of subjectivity that is inherent in their proposal.Grenz and Franke argue that tradition also serves as a source of theology (as a conversational partner together with Scripture and culture). This follows from the previous assertion that the Spirit speaks to the contemporary church through the Word to create world. As history unfolds, Christians today recognize that God has spoken to the church of the past. Therefore, Christians today form only a part of the Spirit's ongoing dialogue with the believing community throughout history. In this scheme, Christian tradition serves as a contemporary referent, helping the present-day church maintain continuity with the Christian community of the past and also helping to avoid the dangers they encountered. Additionally, the trajectory of the past not only looks backward, but also serves as a forward-looking referent, suggesting new ways of articulating the Christian belief-mosaic in a contemporary setting. Additionally, Grenz and Franke present a broader understanding of the concept of inspiration, construing the concept as inclusive of the community bringing the canon together as the book of the Christian community.Although Grenz and Franke make a helpful contribution by reminding the church of the essential place of tradition in contemporary expressions of theology, their proposal concerning the role and nature of tradition appears to have a number of difficulties. First, they appear to offer a discordant portrait concerning the authority of tradition. In one instance they argue for the fundamental inseparability of Scripture and tradition by stating: \\"the authority of both scripture and tradition is an authority derived from the work of the Spirit. Each is part of an organic unity, so that even though scripture and tradition are distinguishable, they are fundamentally inseparable.\\"In a later instance, they appear to separate and subjugate tradition to Scripture when they argue: \\"Despite their great stature [i.e., the past creeds, past confessions, and theological formulations], such resources do not take the place of canonical scripture as the community's constitutive authority.\\"The difference in perspective appears to arise as a result of the authors' understanding of what constitutes tradition. They take a negative view of tradition when it is understood from the perspective of fixed past confessional stances of the church, referring to such an understanding of tradition as \\"static.\\" They take a positive view of tradition when it is understood from the perspective of \\"the ongoing deposit of \`wisdom' emerging from this dynamic movement of the community under the Spirit's guidance.\\" In these two different conceptions of tradition, the first (the \\"static\\" view) is definable and concrete (as it is encapsulated in the past creeds and confessions of the church), while the second (the \\"dynamic\\" view) appears to be nebulous and abstract.A second difficulty arises from the wide diversity of Christian traditions, which raises the question of which tradition forms the trajectory for an individual confused by the varying competing Christian traditions. If the authors respond that traditions are merely local and function for particular communities (thus together forming the complex \\"mosaic of faith\\" throughout history), the question is still relevant for observers from outside the Christian community who are not part of a traditional trajectory. Which traditional trajectory would or should an outside observer consider as they seek to investigate or engage the Christian worldview? Would such a decision be merely arbitrary? The apparently arbitrary and subjective nature of emphasizing the local over the universal seems to result in a relativistic trap.The final conversational partner in theological formulation in the Grenz-Franke proposal is culture, which serves as the particular context of the Spirit speaking to the church through Scripture. Additionally, Grenz and Franke argue that the voice of the Spirit can be discerned through the media of culture, especially in light of Pannenberg's insight that \\"all truth ultimately comes together in God.\\" The implication of this is quite significant for the practice of theological reflection as \\"theology draws from all human knowledge, for in doing so it demonstrates the unity of truth in God.\\" Therefore, theology will become interdisciplinary as it draws from the insights of various contemporary disciplines. Additionally, an awareness of our own contextual placement ought to encourage us to reconsider our own understanding of the Christian faith.This area of the proposal is the one that this reviewer had the most difficulty with. Grenz and Franke's work serves to remind us of the contextual nature of our own situation (and the contextual nature in which Scripture was written and which tradition developed), which is helpful. A neglect of these basic truths may lead to theological presumption as a reader privileges a particular reading of Scripture without justifiable warrant (usually via a bald claim that the reading represents the \\"natural\\" reading of the text).On the other hand, the assertion that the Spirit's voice can (and should) be discerned through the media of culture seems to be a claim without justifiable warrant. Additionally, the Bible seems at times to present the insights from contemporary culture in contrast and in opposition to the truth of God (cf. 1 Cor 3:19-20), which raises the difficulty of distinguishing between genuine expressions of God's voice in culture versus competing voices that do not represent the truth of God.This reviewer also has difficulty with the concept of culture as a \\"source\\" of theology, particularly since the claim that God speaks through culture in ways that we can authoritatively appeal to seems to rest on such a questionable foundation. This reviewer prefers to understand the role of culture in theology as providing contemporary categories and forms of thought (because we are situated in a particular cultural context) which serve to communicate God's truth from Scripture (which was given in a different cultural context).The authors conclude their proposal by outlining the three focal points of theology that provide coherence to their paradigm and which, they argue, constitute a particular theology as distinctively Christian. The authors argue that the Trinity forms the structural motif for theology, and that any theology that claims to be Christian must be Trinitarian in content since it \\"reflects the biblical narrative, dominates the Christian tradition, and resonates with the cultural moment.\\" The authors argue that the Trinity not only provides the content of theology, but also serves in a structural capacity so that the Trinity stands at the very center of the theological enterprise and is in essential dialogue with every theological loci.It should be noted that the authors distinguish their categories of thought concerning the Trinity from the traditional categories describing the metaphysical substance of the Godhead. They prefer to use the categories of relationality, and reference contemporary theologians as criticizing the traditional emphasis on the property of the Divine essence.Since the Bible reveals God as Trinity, and since the church has confessed this truth throughout history, it is appropriate to acknowledge this key doctrine as a distinguishing characteristic of authentic Christianity. This reviewer has some difficulty with some aspects of their proposal however. First, the authors criticize the traditional categories of substance when defining the Trinity in preference for relational categories. Although it may indeed be helpful to describe the Trinity in relational terms, to do so independent of the discussion of substance (such as distinguishing between the plurality of Persons and the one Divine essence or substance) runs the risk of sacrificing a monotheistic commitment (i.e., relationality implies plurality, but says nothing about the inseparable unity of the Godhead). Second, while the Trinity certainly can and should function as a distinguishing criterion for authentic Christianity, is it alone a sufficient distinctive able to separate Christian theology from non-Christian theology? What is the warrant for limiting the criterion for what is authentic Christianity to an affirmation of God as Trinity? Should key questions with regard to soteriology, for example, be brought to bear in answer to the question of what constitutes authentic Christianity? Further, the authors admit that revising the exact content of the doctrine of the Trinity can and should be an important part of the Christian agenda. The danger of such an open posture, however, seems to be the lack of any objective criteria by which one may determine at what point such revisions render a particular stance as ceasing to be Trinitarian in any meaningful sense of the word.In addition to presenting Trinitarianism as the structuring motif of their theological enterprise, Grenze and Franke argue that community serves as the central organizing motif of theology. The authors argue that the overarching focus of the biblical narrative is the person-in-relationship or the individual-in-community, which drives the assertion that community must be the integrating motif in theology. Thus, the community plays a crucial role in identity formation in this scheme, and becomes the \\"community of reference\\" for the individual. This theme brings the various strands of theological articulation together into a single web or mosaic.This part of their proposal also seems to have difficulties. First, although Grenz and Franke argue that the ultimate goal of the biblical God is the establishment of community, there are other theological communities that understand the ultimate goal of the Triune God differently (such as communities who argue for a redemptive or doxological goal as ultimate). Further, the biblical evidence offered in support of the contention that the establishment of community is the ultimate goal of God appears quite capable of being understood in a different way than the authors propose.Second, the authors argue that theology as \\"the study of God\\" is never generic, but always set forth from a particular community. Therefore, they argue, Christian theology speaks about the God known in the Christian community. This assertion raises the particularly troubling dilemma of answering the question the authors themselves pose early in the book: \\"Why give primacy to the world-constructing language of the Christian community?\\" Their answer is that the Christian model provides a helpful vision of the kind of community that all religious belief systems (in their own way and their own understanding ) seek to foster. Apart from the difficulty of substantiating the claim that all religious belief systems seek to foster a particular kind of community (i.e., a \\"life-in-relationship\\" community presented as the \\"human ideal\\"), the question must be asked: is the authors' answer in any sense compelling? More relevant perhaps, the Bible itself answers the question about the primacy of the biblical God in a dramatically different fashion (cf. especially Isaiah 46:9).In addition to presenting Trinitarianism as the structuring motif of their theological enterprise, and community as the integrating motif, Grenze and"},{"Title":"Beyond Foundationalism: Shaping Theology in a Postmodern Context","review":"This was a tough read-- very theoretical and philosophical and sometimes convoluted. I found the lines of reasoning confusing and sometimes contradictory. Although many sections of the discussion are very well done, conclusions often do not seem to follow from the arguments.Authors are attempting to arrive at a set of principles for doing theology in the present \\"postmodern\\" era, but stop at articulating the principles without really offering concrete examples of how those principles would be properly applied. That is, they give no examples of the final theological ideas that would emerge from applying these principles. Thus, although I sensed they are laying the groundwork for a further agenda, it is not clear to me what it is. The devil is in the details-- the specifics-- and this book is short on specific applications of the principles it offers. I found myself agreeing on many of their broadly stated summary points, but suspicious at many other points that they are simply preparing to repackage conservative, evangelical, \\"Bible-believing\\" dogma in some new lingo-wrapping the old in a lot of smoke-and-mirrors talk about the new.I found value in the surveys of recent and current theological perspectives and conceptual development presented with each topic.Rather than moving \\"beyond foundationalism\\"-- a proposition I find somewhat dubious-- the authors might actually just be offering a new set of foundations that are not all that different from some of the old ones. In particular, they seem to accord the Bible ultimate authority. While I think they make some good points, I don't think they have identified the principles that can move Christian thought toward more integrity and relevance.

It has concentrated contents with in-depth theological thoughts."},{"Title":"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion","review":"This is a story of an insurrection that led ineluctably - and against all odds - to a small nation's freedom, so here's an interesting question. How does an author manage to recount this rip-roaring tale such that his description of the prologue and aftermath are fascinating, but that the chapters on the action-packed rebellion itself are incomparably dull? Answer - with passages such as this:\\"B Company was to take over Westland Row Station, and send a party up the line to Tara Street Station where they were to link up with 2nd Batallion which would be in charge of the Amiens St area. C Company would occupy Boland's bakery and dispensary, together with Roberts' builders yard and Clanwilliam House; barricade the canal bridges at Grand Canal Street, Mount Street, Baggot Street and Leeson Street, where they should join up with the 4th Battallion and/or the Citizen Army. D Company was to be based at Boland's mill, and patrol the section between the bakery and the quays. F Company was to occupy Kingstown harbour. (E Company, which came from St Enda's school, was specially detailed to form part of Pearse's HQ force)\\"[p. 176]Feel yourself nodding off? I worked for some years in offices in the area described above (specifically Westland Sq and Grand Canal Quay), and I can say that even I found this description just not worth ploughing through. (Some of the placenames mentioned above are not even on the book's map.) Chapters 6-8 of this book, which cover the events of Easter Week, consist of a stupefyingly dull logbook of such details. With the reader's nose thus pressed against history's canvas, all shape and sense of the story is lost. After sixty pages of such researcher-exhibitionism, the reader emerges with no strong sense as to what was happening, who was commanding whom, how the rebels were faring throughout, or even the proximate causes of the rebellion's end. It's a shame, because the remaining nine chapters, covering the prologue and aftermath, are very readable and informative. They are also, however, debatable.Townshend's account, for a start, scarcely brushes the surface of the long chronicle of English brutality in Ireland, and he seem to assiduously sideline the idealism and heroism of the 1916 rebels. At my home village, for example, our local football field is named after two republican soldiers who were captured by the Black & Tans: one had all his fingernails torn out with a pliers before being shot and the other was killed after being tied to the back of a van and dragged behind it. Thus locals might find it rather difficult to swallow Townshend's claim that the spirit of the age was circumscribed by 'the characteristic British values of reasonableness, compromise and non-violence' (p. 31). Far more grating, however, is the book's persistently condescending tone. Townshend speaks of 'the laxity of [Pearse's] logic' [p. 15]; the 1798 Rebellion as 'a vicious *civil* war' [p. 24]; 'the semi-hysterical Irish-American Republican culture' [p. 50]; that Major John MacBride's 'sudden promotion was certainly due to his military reputation rather than his intervening experience as a water bailiff for the [sic] Dublin Corporation, or his famous drink problem' [p. 179]. And so on.It's certainly true that the Easter rising was characterised by great confusion and many missed opportunities, But the more one reads this book, the more one senses what Townshend is trying to disguise - that he genuinely relishes playing up minor incidents which aggregate to make the 1916 Rebels appear clownish. He explains in the preface that he chose to subtitle the book 'The Irish Rebellion' because 'that term - \\"rebels\\" - carries a charge of romantic glamour which was wholly appropriate' [p. xviii]. With that in mind, it's surprising to find that this dryly written book manages to drain all sense of heroism, self-sacrifice and tragedy from a story that's suffused with all of these qualities. Pearse, Clarke and MacDonagh, for example, are shot rather matter-of-factly in one sentence [p. 279].Townshend's analytical skills tend to break down during his peroration. It is a captious and empty point to make, for instance, that 'the planners of 1916 had shown little if any interest in alienating northern Unionist opinion, and the possibility that their action might cement the partition of Ireland' [p. 349]. As is well known, the Unionists responded to the abolition of the House of Lords veto (which had blocked two prior Home Rule bills but now could not block the forthcoming one) by forming themselves into a massively armed and aggressive militia. The leaders of 1916 - idealists all - could hardly have been expected to take on the might and materiel of the British Empire on one front whilst reaching some sort of 'compromise' with the most extreme adherents to that Empire on another front. Asking Irish nationalism to find an accommodation with such militant anti-nationalism would be asking rather too much.Morover, it's easy to see which of the two political entities is in the better position today - the Republic is independent and its long-term future is solidly secure, while the Northern Unionists, still clingingly dolefully to an anachronistic relationship (featuring no mutual warmth) with a post-Imperial Britain, will be outpopulated By Irish nationalists within decades and are merely prolonging the inevitable. Townshend nevers chides the Unionists for failing to consider the long-term prospects of cementing a partition in which their half was always going to become the far less viable political entity.Additionally, Townshend does not trouble to rebut the revisionist Francis Shaw's breathtaking claim that Home Rule was 'a realistic and achievable goal' - a claim which completely ignores (i) the manner in which Ireland's 'internal majority' in favour of Home Rule always found themselves frustrated in Westminster by a four-to-one 'external majority' against; and (ii) whether or not it was culturally desirable in the first place. It might plausibly be argued that the volcano of Irish nationalism which burst through following 1916 was hardly 'created' by the event itself, but had been bubbling beneath the surface all along. How we are supposed to square this with the plausibility of perpetual subordination to England is unclear. Not only did the British fail to kill Home Rule with kindness, the 1916 Rising demonstrated that Home Rule, even if granted, would not have gone far enough.Nevertheless, read as a desiccated factual account this book is certainly informative about the causes and consequences of the Rising. It deserves credit for placing the insurrection within the context of World War I, which few histories of this period seem to trouble with. However, it must be said that the centre has fallen out of the book: the account of Easter week itself is detailed to the point of incomprehensibility, and thus the most exciting part of the story has been left poorly told."},{"Title":"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion","review":"If you are looking for a British view of the Irish Rising of 1916 this is the book. British historian Townshend minimizes the long Irish struggle for independence and puts forth the idea that it was not always a cohesive movement - this seems to be his way of negating previous efforts or even trying to suggest its invalidity. But what long drawn out independence movement ever was cohesive for hundreds of years? He even takes up the British narrative on the Land War, for example, and states that the Irish tenants \\"exaggerated\\" their plight. Yeah, right. The British government reports said the same about the Irish Famine. Parnell's downfall gets dismissed as displaying \\"reckless defiance of Victorian public morality\\".As another reviewer states he highlights what are small incidents in the actions of the 1916 men and women - MacDonagh \\"looked strained\\" and Connolly sometimes uncertain over military actions - and makes them look confused and clumsy. This is the main way he tries to discredit them. In his Epilogue he defends the \\"revisionists\\" historians and attacks Seamus Deane for asserting that \\"revisionism was not an attempt to re-write value free history but in fact was an anti-nationalist, Unionist project.\\" Townshend goes beyond revisionism to a British view of Irish history.

This is, however, the most concise book I've read on the subject and leaves the reader with a more comfortable understanding of the basis of a very complex political issue."},{"Title":"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion","review":"Charles Townshend has written a fairly good book on the Irish Easter Rebellion of 1916. Meticulously researched, and quite informative; any reader interested by the events will enjoy it.And yet on a higher level this book won't completely satisfy its readers, because it is essentially a political and military history of events that were far more than simple matter of politics and military science. What brought men and women to stage an uprising that they knew couldn't succeed, and would lead to their leaders' executions? Was it patriotism? Was it idealism? Was it frustration with their lot? Such questions make it clear that the events of that Easter week are not the exclusive domain of historians, but also the domain of dramatists and psychologists.These clear gaps brought to mind Macaulay's writing about the Irish: \\"The Irish were distinguished by qualities which tend to make men interesting rather than prosperous. They were an ardent and impetuous race, easily moved to tears or to laughter, to fury or to love. Alone among the nations of northern Europe they had the susceptibility, the vivacity, the natural turn for acting and rhetoric, which are indigenous on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea...The genius, with which her aboriginal inhabitants were largely endowed showed itself as yet only in ballads which wild and rugged as they were, seemed to the judging eye of Spenser to contain a portion of the pure gold of poetry.\\"A book that would adequately capture this element of Irish culture would almost certainly be an amazing book, as it is, this is \\"only\\" a good book."},{"Title":"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion","review":"Few events in modern Irish history are as pivotal as the \\"Easter Rising\\", the dramatic seizure of the General Post Office and other parts of Dublin that marked the declaration of the Irish Republic. Yet for decades the event has never received the thorough examination it deserves, due in part, as Charles Townshend observes in his preface to this fine book, to the long-standing reticence to release the oral histories of the event contained within the archives of the Bureau of Military History. Their release in 2003 provides the best opportunity yet to study the uprising, and Townshend has risen to the challenge by providing a penetrating examination of the origins and the impact of the Rising.Townshend traces the origins of the Rising to the development and definition of Irish identity in the late nineteenth century. Here the breadth of his examination is immediately apparent, as he moves beyond the political to study the role that the cultural movement known as the Celtic rising played in inspiring Irish nationalists to challenge British rule. A key figure bridging between the cultural and the political was Patrick Pearse, the president of the provisional republic claimed in the aftermath of the seizure of the General Post Office. By delving into Pearse's past as a nationalist consumed with freeing Ireland not only from British political domination but its cultural domination as well, he illustrates just how important the cultural component was in inspiring the nationalists and driving them towards action.Yet Irish politics in those years was dominated not by nationalism but the issue of Home Rule. Here Townshend focuses on the reaction to the Home Rule measure in Ireland, which catalyzed Unionist resistance in the north to the devolution of Irish government. The formation of the Ulster Volunteer Force, in turn, inspired southern nationalists to form their own armed group, the Irish Volunteers, a movement quickly subsumed by the Irish Parliamentary Party into their organization. Yet the outbreak of the First World War and the decision by Irish parliamentary leader John Redmond to support the war split the Irish Volunteers and came to undermine his standing.The nationalist Irish Volunteers that broke away from main group were themselves divided over the next step, however. As they gained in standing with the growing unpopularity of Redmond's decision, Pearse and other members sought to take advantage of Britain's difficulty to throw off her rule of Ireland. Given the attitudes of the Volunteer leadership, such planning had to take place in secrecy, and one of the great strengths of this book is Townshend's laudable effort to wade into the confused jumble of half-hidden events to detail the evolution of the Rising. What was initially envisioned as a nationwide rebellion quickly became a Dublin-centric event that would take advantage of a planned Easter Sunday mobilization to strike against British rule. The last-minute efforts by the nationalist Volunteer leadership to head off the rebellion, though, resulted in a confused and only partial assemblage of Volunteers on the following day.The three chapters on the Rising itself form the heart of Townshend's book, and they recount an event characterized by confusion on both sides. The poor preparations and questionable decisions by the rebels were equaled only by those of the British authorities, whose overreaction in the aftermath of the rebels' inevitable defeat turned them from extremists into heroes. Townshend concludes the book by looking at the belated efforts by the British in the aftermath of the Rising to craft a settlement in response to the growing nationalist challenge to their control over Ireland - a challenge that in the end they failed to avert.With its clear prose and painstaking reconstruction of the tangled events of the Easter Rising, Townshend's book is a masterpiece of the historical craft. The thorough research and judicious analysis contained within its pages is unlikely to be bettered as a guide to the complicated and confused developments that led to this dramatic and exciting event. For anyone seeking a study that will help them understand the Easter Rising, its background, and its consequences, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion","review":"Easter 1916: The Irish Rebellion is essential for any who would understand the history of Ireland: it changed millions of lives forever and this new coverage traces these changes, re-creating the social and political scene of the times.

If I were to rank them, ATKM would be first followed by Flood then AHG.If you're familiar with Robert Penn Warren's writing you will know that it is rich in poetry and deep in meaning. His characters have profound ideas and there is a large scope of understanding within which they express themselves. In this book more than in his other two that I've read, RPW's storyline is driven by his characters and their interactions and less from a sense of action and plot. While I don't clamor for a detective-style fueled-up page ripper, I think giving the story a bit more of an internal engine would have eased the demands on this novel's sometimes fatiguing characters.The main idea and plot begin with a town that is being flooded to make room for a dam. After reading over breakfast a newspaper article about these plans, a famous filmmaker comes to the little town of Fiddlersburg to make a film. He is joined by one of Fiddlersburg's more famous progeny, and the local reunites with his roots.The book brings us to understand that this little town breeds a dispossessed clan who cannot make connections with the outside world but are never free from the self-consciousness of their own insularity.Flood could be one of the best books of our time. I say that it *could* because I found the book to be flawed in some respects. At times it was too opaque and idle in its dreamy meditation of the characters' experience and circumstance. Yet I got to know the importance of Place from which people come and continue to grow, and I felt a tangible loss as this connection was lifted away and the waters rose and the people began to lament. I think this is a great comment on modernity.RPW has written another long and very good book."},{"Title":"Flood","review":"I hesitate to call this work a novel. In fact, Robert Penn Warren hesitates to call it a novel. He christens it a Romance, correctly I think. It is far more apt a term. The book for which poet RPW is most famous is, of course, All The King's Men, which is indeed a tour de force of at least three novels woven seamlessly into one. His most powerful work, though, I still think to be World Enough And Time: An almost inhuman book of fulgurous brilliance lighting a desolate nightscape of the human soul. But this book as I - and Warren - say, is a Romance.More - it is a particular type of Romance - the Elegy. It is sad and sweet with deep, long chords drawn out over hundreds of pages for the dying town of Fiddlersburg, the central character of Brad Tolliver and a host of other characters, living and dead, connected by what one of them calls a \\"mystic osmosis.\\"As for the writing, this same character, Blanding Cottshill, says, a propos thereof at one point in this elegy: \\"And without irony - I mean an awareness of that doubleness of life that lies far below flowers of rhetoric or pirouettes of mind - no real conversation, conversation of inner resonance, is possible.\\" The writing here is full of the awareness of this human ambiguity and doubleness.It is also, however, replete with flowers of rhetoric and pirouettes of mind, as befits an elegy. It's a lovely, lush prose poem for all humanity. And, as with all RPW's works, leads the reader into a mindset of deep contemplation.To say that it falls short of RPW's best work - as it does - is not to disparage it by any means."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"After reading a couple of early reviews of this book on Amazon, I almost didn't order it. I'm so glad I had faith enough in Patricia Cabot's writing to go ahead and read it, because it is a charming love story about two souls ravaged by society's gossip. Kate's family was destroyed by scandal, leaving her alone and penniless and forced to make her living as a governess and chaperone. Burke, the Marquis of Wingate, has also been living as an outcast from the 'polite world', but has rejoined it in order to find a husband for his daughter. Though this story could have been dark and depressing, the characters have such humor and individuality, that it is a charming tale throughout. Watching Kate discover her sexuality and Burke trying to overcome his temper is very funny and poignant.The plot is tightly written, although the mystery is somewhat easy to figure out. The charm of the book is not only in the dialog, but also in being privy to the character's thoughts. I found Burke an especially endearing hero, who is constantly trying to keep himself from smashing something in anger and is human enough to feel vain about his approaching middle age. Kate is intelligent and courageous in spite of her vulnerability in the face of her past. The love scenes are tender and well written.This book is a keeper, and I look forward to Ms. Cabot's next book. I have read all her novels to date, and I think this one is her best yet."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I would like to thank the reviewer who so vehemntly hated this book. The hostility that this benign romance novel generated for him/her peaked my curiosity.Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised. The book delivers everything a historical romance reader wants-action, beautiful locations, characters with brains and spirit, intrigue, steamy sex and most importantly a romantic HAPPY ending. If I want realism and true life I read the newspaper. For escapism from that drudgery I recommend &quot;A Little Scandal&quot; without hesitation."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I specifically called up this book to write a review and was really surprised by the first two that were written. Personally, I think the author has gotten better with her last two books. The plotting was tighter in this one than in the previous one, which had a plot twist added right on to the end of the story that kind of left me scratching my head.The story opens with our hero picking up his thoroughly aggravating 18 year old daughter and carrying her, screeching, out to his coach to convey her to an evening in society. He is stopped by the diminutive heroine, who holds him up at umbrella point under the mistaken impression he is carrying off a young lady for immoral purposes. As one might expect, especially after reading a few romances, our hero ends up compelled to hire our heroine to act as chaperone for his rambunctious daughter. As the only member of Society who pays not a whit of attention to gossip, he makes no effort to investigate her, and so all sorts of surprising secrets come out later, at the worst possible time.The hero is a fellow with a terrible temper, it's true, but he seems far more restrained than many a hero in romance I've seen. Yes, he tossed a man out a window, but he'd just caught the fellow under the hero's wife's skirts. Until recently, juries have forgiven men for even murder in such instances, not just mayhem. As for the book he tossed out the window, it was 17 years later, and the heroine had just beaned him on the head with it. As for not abusing women, I have met many a man who will cheerfully pummel another man and would never lift a finger to hurt a woman or a child. Frankly, I think they're conditioned that way. It's certainly better than those who will only take their temper out on things that are too weak to strike back.I absolutely loved it that the hero's major obsession is reading, an interest that is beginning to edge ahead of sex until he comes across our heroine. Of course, the heroine is an avid reader, as well, which gives them common ground in their relationship.I found the hero and heroine believable and their relationship believable, as well. In fact, the only part I had trouble with was the hero's daughter. She looked promising in the openning scene, but then never developed much.I'd recommend giving this book a try. For me, it's a keeper and who knows? It might be a keeper for you, too."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"This book swept me up &amp; had me in stitches up to the sooo-happy ending !!! Grouchy heroes always tug at my heart, but this one scores even higher 'cuz of his Italian temper &amp; reluctant protectiveness towards the love of his life. Not a lot of novels out there feature a spoiled brat to spice up the story. The 1st encounter where Kate almost - and let me quote - 'endangered Burke's hopes of siring an heir' is hilarious &amp; it gets even better since then on. No matter what the other scathing reviews said, I LUUUV this extremely funny, merry, passionate tale of 2 lovable characters fighting their hopeless attraction. It's well-written, fast-paced, overflowing w/ witty banters, dynamite chemistry, crisp plot &amp; sensual love-scenes. In short, it's a page-turner ! This is only Ms. Cabot's 3rd book that I've read (after Lady of Skye &amp; Improper Proposal) but she's on my must-buy list. It'll charm the wits out of ya !!!"},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I read this book in one sitting. Stopped for a food break. Better than her last two. The beginning works because of the humor. The verbal sparring between the two lead characters is very good, and the secondary characters hold up well. Drags a little bit here and there-the daughter's character is too broad. The sexual tension builds nicely (and is resolved). The mystery seems to be thrown in and could use a little work, but the book moves along and does keep your interest."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"This was my first Patricia Cobat and I enjoyed it enough to run out and buy the Improper Proposal. I liked the fact that the hero is of a more 'mature' age with a wild daughter. Their relationship was funny through out the book. I like the personality and chemistry between the hero and heroine.The fact that the hero is getting old and dealing with becoming middle age is also rather refreshing, certainly I have not read that in another novel. Kate was really practical and strong which I enjoy very much in a female lead. Throwing in the Isabel's wild behavior, you have a really nice romance.The mystery is not really interesting, after all we are not reading for the mystery plot. I have to say I enjoy this book much more than Improper Proposal which I just finished yesterday. The girl (I mean 'girl') in the story was just as wild as the daughter in this story and definitely needed help."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I thought the story was quite enjoyable. I am glad I did not read the poor reviews before I bought it. It was different and I liked the characters. I have always enjoyed her books and I am glad I took a chance on it."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"For new readers or those who have already put Patricia Cabot on their must read list this book will not disappoint. The characters are full and shrouded in mystery. The circumstances that throw Burke and Kate together provide the reader with the fiesty wit and sexual tension that has become the Patricia Cabot trademark. Cabot has also included an array of secondary characters who round out the story leaving the reader wanting to know more about them all."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I love Patricia Cabot. I truly do. I love when a romance keeps me smiling and laughing and, generally, she does. But I agree with those who felt let down. It wasn't even the plot. Sure, plucky supposed spinster saves beastly man and helps him connect to his kid/kids has been done. But so has every major regency plot, for the most part. It was just something lacking in the hero for me. I have no trouble with his type or even with him having baggage. But he seems so unlikeable and didn't get better by 3/4 of the way through, which is where I gave up. I just didn't care about his happy ending by then. People have pointed out other reasons, so I won't repeat them, but I'll add one more -- his treatment of his daughter. What a horrible father. First, she's a nuisance and he only wants her out of the way so he can have lots of sex with his mistress. Then he seems to brush her aside in his thoughts and actions when he wants to have sex with her chaperon. He only starts attending her at balls to watch out for her when he's panting after the chaperon. The disparaging way both the hero and heroine think and talk about the daughter, pretty much saying she's stupid and plain (and stupid would be his fault). There's one scene where the father compares his daughter to our heroine and tells her how much smarter and prettier she is. I expected her to hit him over the head and tell him how lovely and smart she is or could be or something. But no. She takes the compliment. The worst was when that poor, neglected daughter is in peril and rather than racing through the night and day to save her, he stops at every possible inn to have long, painfully described sex with her chaperon. Of course, the chaperon is at fault here, too. It was by the third or so scene that I stopped. That poor kid. I'd have run off and put myself in danger, too."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"This was my first Patricia Cobat and I enjoyed it enough to run out and buy the Improper Proposal.

I enjoyed the beginning to end and would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"...sex, suspense, and the trademark Cabot humor. The characters in this book are much more believable and sympathetic--and nowhere near as lampoony--as they were in Cabot's last book, An Improper Proposal. I felt for and could identify with Kate. And Burke is a god. If you want a fast read that will tickle your funnybone as well as touch the heart, this is the one to go for."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I have read all of Cabot's works and I was anxiously anticipating this book after I read her last book -An Improper Proposal. Sadly to say that I was highly disappointed with the book. I did not like the characters - Burke and Kate. There did not seem to be much chemistry with the two characters. Developing a romantic relationship was also a bit difficult with Burke's daughter - Isabelle in the story. Cabot's other books had characters with more spunk and heart. The story line was boring. I say take a pass on book."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"It seems, in reading the voting totals for reviews, that people do not particularly like to read a negative review. Well, why not? If I had given more credence to the negative reviews on this book, I would have saved myself some money and lots of time. The synopsis of the book has been fully explored by previous reviewers so I can just say why I didn't like this particular novel by Patricia Cabot.I have read other books by Ms Cabot and thoroughly enjoyed them. I started off liking this one because I thought I knew where it was heading (which is always dangerous because only the author knows where a book is truly going). It did not take me very long to begin to dislike the way Kate had of expressing part of a thought to herself and then, as a tease, going no further and leaving me dangling. If an author reveals too much too soon there is no more mystery, or confusion, or situation which our heroine needs to clear up. If an author does not reveal enough and leaves readers hanging too often, it gets frustrating. I got frustrated.A really big problelm for me was that I did not like Burke. He was way too violent for me. Not just the suggestion of an ability to becomme violent but actual fighting, hitting, hurting people, breaking things, and killing people (yes, killing). He knew he had a terrible temper and had to keep it under control but Ms. Cabot had him smashing things and people up every time he got the chance.I also did not like Kate. She supposedly had all these scruples and values yet she jumped into bed with him almost instantly. Yes, she left after their first encounter but she had to....the author made it happen so fast we weren't even to the half-way point in the book! From then on, it was nothing but an excuse to describe violence on his part until he found her and then sex over and over once they were reunited.Also, a very thin excuse for a mystery. If an author does not have enough material for the main characters to fill a book, why do they throw in a \\"mystery\\"? It must be very hard to write something convincing because most \\"mysteries\\" incorporated into historical romances are just not very interesting.Now I've had my say. You may not agree but at least you have been warned."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"Kate Mayhew meets the irrepressible Isabel the Marquis of Wingate's daughter. Isabel wants Kate to be her governess (thinking that Kate will allow her the freedoms that her father won't). Isabel's father Burke does not necessarily think that Kate is a good role model but since Isabel has agreed to abide by Kate's rules he hires her away (after much coercion and high pay offer) from his eccentric next door neighbors. Kate, forced to work for a living is immediately attracted to the Marquis who considers her a most unusual woman. Sparks fly, and the romance that develops between the two makes for a most humourous, and delightful romance."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"My friend got me hooked on Cabot with her last book which I enjoyed very much. This book was not her typical style. I really did not like either character much. He had way too much baggage - anger with ex wife for her betrayal so the rest of the women will take up where she left off, a daughter who is a handful, and a missing heart. I liked her other books when she concentrated more on developing the characters and showing their vulnerability without the trite baggage. Usually her characters have spunk -- something I did not see any of this in the book. All in all, I want my money back."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I suggest that you save your money and pass on this book. I, too, enjoyed Cabot's previous works and was disappointed with her latest novel. The characters were boring and the story was flat. I just plain did not like anything about the book. The plot is an overused one with the hero finding his wife in bed with another man. He tosses man out window. He cannot trust woman. He raises his daughter....does this sound familiar? I hope her next book is better."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"The first half of the book started out promising enough in a pleasant-I-know-I've-read-this before-type-of-way. But after a while I began to think that something was wrong and that something turned out to be the &quot;hero&quot;. The hero is a psychotic alpha type bordering on abusive: throwing people out windows and resorting to violence is his way of dealing with his stress and anger. Of course these people are annoying and make him angry: he would never, ever, treat the heroine or his precious daughter that way, right? (major spoiler: they all live happily ever after in a castle in the sky) Yeah, and pigs really do fly! This is another example of what's wrong with our society: the &quot;love is all we need&quot; solution to our problems. Gimme a break, even without the &quot;hero&quot;, the antiquated plot devices (blah, blah, blah &quot;tragic&quot; {dare I say it} Scandals! thatcomebacktohauntthem) and the emotionless sex scenes at the end of the novel used to convey the &quot;love&quot; the two main characters felt for eachother instead of developing their relationship further via a little something called communication: all made this book something that I would like to forget as soon as possible."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I generally like Cabot's works. However, I could not warm up to Burke or Kate or the plot of the book. I thought the hero was much too violent and that the heroine had to work too hard to get to his heart. The plot also seemed very flat. I just plain did not enjoy this book as much as I did her other books."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I've read Where Roses Grow Wild, Portrait Of My Heart, and A Little Scandal, and would rate them above average.However, one thing disturbs me. In all three novels, the heroines end up living in the same house as the hero, who is in a more powerful position. As gentleman, the men in a household are supposed to protect those in the women in their homes, and definitely not take advantage of them (i.e. Regency Buck, by Georgette Heyer).Yet time and again, the heroes in Patricia Cabot's books take the innocence of the heroines living under their roof, and feel no twinge of conscience, no betrayal of honor.I don't admire the men that much, they seem to have little honor concerning their &quot;own&quot; womenfolk."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I tried to like this book. The first few pages were promising. I liked Kate, at first.But I did not like the hero, and after awhile, the story just got boring, tedious and not worth my time. I finished the book, but I wish I hadn't."},{"Title":"A Little Scandal","review":"I also tried to like this book because it sounded cute. I also liked her first book - Where Roses Grow Wild very much. I was hoping for a repeat peformance, but this book falls flat with both the character development and the plot. It was truly uninspiring and boring. I only finished the book because I spent good money on it. I am hoping I like the next book better."},{"Title":"Doorways Thru Time C","review":"Archeology books can be divided into two categories: The first are those written for those savvy in the nomenclature and details of the subject - the &quot;scholarly&quot; works. The other kind are those written for &quot;popular consumption&quot; - those for the layman. The trouble with the former are obvious; the trouble with the latter is that too often these are simply photograph albums with a minimum of explanatory text.Fortunately DOORWAYS THROUGH TIME is a stellar member of that latter group with a minimum of pictures and a plethora of text. Not only does the author accompany is on an intriguing journey through time (chapters are arranged chronologically) but he provides a sort of social commentary as he travels. We begin with caves, not our first home but the first public meeting house. Then on to Egypt, Greece, a wonderful aside for the Etruscans. Following the Romans he now elects a pathway through our Judeo-Christian heritage which is quite appropriate considering the interest in that area and the overwhelming influence those two cultures have had on modern Western society.A quick look at the Shroud is followed by a glance at the last defenders of ancient Israel then on to the catacombs. Several more well-known sites follow: The Great Wall, Easter Island, the Mayas, Incas...and along the way he offers conjectures, nothing absolute nor didactic, just his personal thoughts based on years in the field.

Likewise, Henry Beard's translations of various ordinary statements and phrases in Latin (and cat behaviours in to French) also sit next to this honoured tome.When I returned from Britain and began to think in theological-training terms, I had to re-acquaint myself with Latin; for an exam I had to memorise one biblical passage, one passage from the Aeneid, and one passage of my choice. I chose Winnie Ille Pu, and, as it had not been excluded from the list, I was permitted this indulgence (I believe that the exam list now has a section of excluded works, including this one, more's the pity).Do not be frightened off by the fact that this is a book in Latin. It is very accessible, and quite fun to read with the English version of Winnie-the-Pooh at its side. The Latin version has kept many of the original illustrations as well as the page layout forms, for example:In English:And then he got up, and said: 'And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.' So he began to climb the tree.Heclimbedand heclimbedand heclimbed,and as heclimbedhesanga littlesongto himself.It wentlike this:Isn't it funnyHow a bear likes honeyBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!I wonder why he does?In Latin:Et nisus estetnisus estetnisus estetnisus estet nitens carmen sic coepit canere:Cur ursus clamat?Cur adeo mel amat?Burr, burr, burrQuid est causae cur?Statements sound much more grand in Latin: 'Ior mi,' dixit sollemniter, 'egomet, Winnie ille Pu, caudam tuam reperiam.' which means, 'Eeyore,' he said solemnly, 'I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you.'This is a delightful romp through a language study. I have recommended this to friends who want an introduction to Latin, together with the Lingua Latina series, which uses a natural language method for instruction.Alexander Lenard, the translator, obviously did a great labour of love here, and I agree with the Chicago Tribune's statement that this book 'does more to attract interest in Latin than Cicero, Caesar, and Virgil combined.' One wonders if the Tao of Pooh and the Te of Piglet will be translated into Latin to make them seem 'more philosophical; or indeed, will Winnie ille Pu be likewise translated into Sanskrit and other such languages? It is not uncommon that the entertaining use of language does more for language enrichment and interest than any academic or official push of the tongue. It is no mistake that the Welsh language effort incorporated cartoons from the beginning -- it is natural for people to respond to fun and lively things, and this kind of treatment can be rather tricky, in that the average reader might not be so consciously aware that education is going on...Winnie-the-Pooh in Akkadian? Hmmm, I feel a Ph.D. dissertation topic coming on...This work is no small endeavour, but rather a thorough and engaging translation of the entire Pooh story. From the start, when we are introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh, through to the adventures in the Tight Place (in angustias incurrit), when Piglet meets a heffalump (heffalumpum), meeting Kanga and Roo (Canga and Ru), the expedition to the North Pole (Palum Septentrionalem), and finally saying goodbye, the entire story and text is here. One can (as I do) set the Dell Yearling 60th Anniversary Version of Winnie-the-Pooh side-by-side with Winnie-ille-Pu and follow line by line the engaging story, which translates well into this one-time universal language. And why ever not? Surely if there is a story nearly universal appeal, it would be of dear Winnie.As A.A. Milne was a graduate of the Westminster School (which is housed down the block from my old Parliamentary offices) and of Cambridge, he might consider the translation of his classic work into the classical language a signal honour, and one wonders if, given the fact that Milne studied classical languages himself, if he ever translated any pieces, however small, into those languages that every English schoolboy learns to hate and love.The story leaves off with Christophorus Robinus heading off to bath (and presumably, bed) ...Of course, being a person of small importance myself, I identify much more with Porcellus (Piglet) than Pu. I know the struggles against the clerical/hierarchical/academic heffalumpum, and as Pooh has given me a new language of consideration for such conditions, Pu has given me a bilingual command of that language.Long live the Porcelli amicus!"},{"Title":"Winnie Ille Pu","review":"_Winnie Ille Pu_ has been an amazing help for me, as I am beginning to learn Latin.

It wasn't easy to translate--I don't know how the newer ones compare (\\"Harry Potter\\" in Latin, etc.)--but in 3rd or 4th year high school Latin, it was at our level and a lot of fun. The students who knew Winnie the Pooh found translating it easier than I did, as in: \\"Oh, this is the part when...\\", thus were able to extrapolate through its accessibility.

I chose Winnie Ille Pu, and, as it had not been excluded from the list, I was permitted this indulgence (I believe that the exam list now has a section of excluded works, including this one, more's the pity).Do not be frightened off by the fact that this is a book in Latin. It is very accessible, and quite fun to read with the English version of Winnie-the-Pooh at its side. The Latin version has kept many of the original illustrations as well as the page layout forms, for example:In English:And then he got up, and said: 'And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.' So he began to climb the tree.Heclimbedand heclimbedand heclimbed,and as heclimbedhesanga littlesongto himself.It wentlike this:Isn't it funnyHow a bear likes honeyBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!I wonder why he does?In Latin:Et nisus estetnisus estetnisus estetnisus estet nitens carmen sic coepit canere:Cur ursus clamat?Cur adeo mel amat?Burr, burr, burrQuid est causae cur?Statements sound much more grand in Latin: 'Ior mi,' dixit sollemniter, 'egomet, Winnie ille Pu, caudam tuam reperiam.' which means, 'Eeyore,' he said solemnly, 'I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you.'This is a delightful romp through a language study. I have recommended this to friends who want an introduction to Latin, together with the Lingua Latina series, which uses a natural language method for instruction.Alexander Lenard, the translator, obviously did a great labour of love here, and I agree with the Chicago Tribune's statement that this book 'does more to attract interest in Latin than Cicero, Caesar, and Virgil combined.' One wonders if the Tao of Pooh and the Te of Piglet will be translated into Latin to make them seem 'more philosophical; or indeed, will Winnie ille Pu be likewise translated into Sanskrit and other such languages? It is not uncommon that the entertaining use of language does more for language enrichment and interest than any academic or official push of the tongue. It is no mistake that the Welsh language effort incorporated cartoons from the beginning -- it is natural for people to respond to fun and lively things, and this kind of treatment can be rather tricky, in that the average reader might not be so consciously aware that education is going on...Winnie-the-Pooh in Akkadian? Hmmm, I feel a Ph.D. dissertation topic coming on...This work is no small endeavour, but rather a thorough and engaging translation of the entire Pooh story. From the start, when we are introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh, through to the adventures in the Tight Place (in angustias incurrit), when Piglet meets a heffalump (heffalumpum), meeting Kanga and Roo (Canga and Ru), the expedition to the North Pole (Palum Septentrionalem), and finally saying goodbye, the entire story and text is here. One can (as I do) set the Dell Yearling 60th Anniversary Version of Winnie-the-Pooh side-by-side with Winnie-ille-Pu and follow line by line the engaging story, which translates well into this one-time universal language. And why ever not? Surely if there is a story nearly universal appeal, it would be of dear Winnie.As A.A. Milne was a graduate of the Westminster School (which is housed down the block from my old Parliamentary offices) and of Cambridge, he might consider the translation of his classic work into the classical language a signal honour, and one wonders if, given the fact that Milne studied classical languages himself, if he ever translated any pieces, however small, into those languages that every English schoolboy learns to hate and love.The story leaves off with Christophorus Robinus heading off to bath (and presumably, bed) ...Of course, being a person of small importance myself, I identify much more with Porcellus (Piglet) than Pu. I know the struggles against the clerical/hierarchical/academic heffalumpum, and as Pooh has given me a new language of consideration for such conditions, Pu has given me a bilingual command of that language.Long live the Porcelli amicus!"},{"Title":"Winnie Ille Pu","review":"I didn't have very much instruction in Latin prior to buying this book. I learned how to read it out loud, and I got a basic grasp on the grammar. After only that, I can still read and understand this little book. The folks I have been working with have found that after a few readings, they know what is being said. This is how we learn our first language, and this is how people learn to think in other languages.I'd recommend this book to beginners who are looking to begin \\"the Natural way.\\""},{"Title":"Winnie Ille Pu","review":"Most people who only know a little Latin should hopefully be able to understand Winnie Ille Pu. The ending has a 'notes' section where unusual phrases such as 'scire velim' are listed under their respective chapters for easy reference.There is something a bit more elegant about the Latin of Winnie Ille Pu compared to Fabulae Mirabiles, but that is caused by the differing genres of the writings. However, Fabulae Mirabliles would be my choice for the Latin beginner."},{"Title":"Without Charity","review":"I have been reading too many romances recently, and decided to switch to a more novelistic romance. WITHOUT CHARITY is a find, and I would definitely read more by this particular author, a former author who now writes children's fiction (The Chronicles of Ancient Darkness). This is a story about an interesting Victorian-era house and estate, about the impact of family secrets over generations, and a historical mystery.Readers who enjoy books about family history research might enjoy this book in particular.Brief summary: WITHOUT CHARITY, Michelle Paver's first novel, is a story about family secrets that cuts between two different time periods and two different generations. Through the lives of an English aristocrat and his possible mistress, and through the life of their descendant, Paver describes how a cross-class romance comes about and affects later generations. Yet that romance is not what it is believed to be by the lord's contemporaries (and neighbors). A historical mystery must be solved before the truths behind the apparent facts come to light. The book is well-written, the plot interesting, and the characters complex and well-detailed. The only problem is that the generation in between is less strongly portrayed (and their actions harder to believe).Setting:The story switches between the Late Victorian and Edwardian era (roughly 1900-1905) and the modern era (mid-1990s by my reckoning), and is set in southern England.Longer review:In the space of two weeks, a thirty-five year old TV producer Sarah Dalton has lost her live-in lover (Dominic Hardy, a divorced barrister) and her job. She has fallen ill with pneumonia and spends the next two months with her mother in Coventry.Her boyfriend's younger brother Alex Hardy offers her a job - researching and producing the history of a house and estate now owned by an American university. The house itself is a bizarre monstrosity created in the High Victorian period (1850s-1860s) by the eccentric grandparents of the last two barons. Sarah accepts the job reluctantly, disliking the idea of producing an \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" (which appears to mean a sepia-tinted view of the British aristocracy) for an American audience. She also fears further contact with Dominic through his brother Alex.However, she accepts the job on the advice of her brother Nick. As she researches the background of Harlaston Hall and its titled occupants, she also starts looking into her own family background. Her father Julian Dalton died when she was 16 or 17, and never spoke of his background because of his Socialist wife. Sarah and Nick grew up knowing almost nothing about their paternal grandparents who died decades before. She knew that her paternal grandmother was somehow connected with the Pearce-Stauntons, the aristocratic Lords Harlaston, of Harlaston Hall. While trying to find out more about her grandmother, she discovers several layers of family secrets.Her search for her missing grandfather leads her to suspect that he was Robert Pearce-Staunton, the last Lord Harlaston and last owner of Harlaston Hall. She is puzzled by discrepancies in narratives about him, and by her grandmother's own life. Who exactly was Charity Fosdyke, and how did she come to be involved with a real Lord? Did Harlaston take advantage of a young innocent tenant, or was the truth more complex? Was Harlaston's reputation as a perfect gentleman based on his cousin's accounts (which had omitted his illegitimate son) and the views of persons of similar backgrounds, or was he indeed the man claimed?As readers, we have the advantage of reading about Charity and Robert's interactions as they happened circa 1900-1905, as well as reading local residents' recollections and analyses of these interactions. Letters from the vicar's wife (a well-meaning conventional sort), a family memoir by the vicar's daughter (a suffragette), recollections by aged ladies in nursing homes are combined with what little documentary evidence Sarah Dalton can turn up. And there is precious little. The best pieces of evidence are mislaid or forgotten until nearly the end.This is not a bodiceripper romance, nor is it an analysis of cross-class tensions (although there is some evident through the plot). What struck me was the complex social structure in a small village on a country estate, and the effects of sexual or other forms of deviance on extended families.The background (or the past):Lord Harlaston (Robert Pearce-Staunton) made a good marriage socially speaking in the late 1890s. In social terms, he exchanged his title, his country house and estate and his looks for his wife's wealth and great beauty. However, his marriage turned out badly; in practical terms, he may have fallen in love with his wife, who was unable to reciprocate his feelings or to understand him and his family. Violet, Lady Harlaston, was a great beauty, but someone who cared only about herself and her appearance. She was careless of the opinions of those beneath her, and not comfortable with his bizarre family home.Because of the social mores of the time, and his own character, Lord Harlaston found it impossible to treat his wife badly (to force her to leave him) or to leave her himself. A divorce was impossible then or later (the only grounds for divorcing one's wife were adultery or desertion, neither applicable in Violet's case). Appearances had to be kept up, since they were Victorians.Lord Harlaston's life was changed by the Boer War when he was ordered to burn the homes of Boer women and children, leaving hundreds if not thousands exposed to the elements and the dangers of enforced treks. The death of his only child and heir forced him to re-examine many of his beliefs about warfare, and eventually about his marriage and himself. It is at this time that he met Charity Fosdyke, the daughter of a newly hired stonemason. Charity's unusual traits, including her obvious intelligence, her thirst for knowledge, and her dignity, attracted him. Yet, as an honourable man, he could do nothing - even a platonic (non-physical) romance was not an option in an era when a young girl's reputation was at stake.An accidental eye-witness to one of their rare meetings, and the inquisitiveness of Charity's emotionally unbalanced mother, set into motion events that would change several lives. It is the interpretation placed on this \\"evidence\\" that is carried through the next generations by village gossip and recollections of elderly residents. Yet the truth about Robert and Charity was far more complex. A particularly stunning fact emerges at the end, and makes sense finally of the title.WITHOUT CHARITY was written in 2000, and appears to have been Ms Paver's first book.Why no five stars? I found Sarah's parents' marriage (specifically her father's choice of a wife so different from him) less convincing, as well as the fact that her father shared nothing of his background with his children. I could understand why Robert was attracted to Charity and vice versa, and what Sarah saw in her former lover as well as another romantic interest. But I could not understand how Sarah's father would have chosen to marry a woman so different from him. I also found Sarah's lack of interest in her father's background (while he was alive) a little puzzling. These are minor problems perhaps, but little details that spoiled the book a little for me.Written by \\"bookjunkiereviews\\" 16 January 2006"},{"Title":"Without Charity","review":"If you like romance, with a hint of mystery, and sweeping family sagas, this is the one for you. I couldn't put it down. It goes smoothly between present day and Edwardian England. I purchased this from the UK Amazon, on the recommendation of a friend in England. Glad to see it is now available here."},{"Title":"Without Charity","review":"Frankly, I loved this book, even though it annoyed me to no end! The beginning of the chapters were somewhat tedious and a bit boring, but by the chapter's end I was on the edge of my seat, hardly able to read fast enough. Then the chapters ended with some of the finest cliff-hangers I've ever seen and switched perspectives to either Charity or Sarah. At the end of every chapter I was screaming \\"No, no! Don't go back to Charity, what happened to Sarah?!\\" or \\"What? No don't stop! I want to see what happened with Charity!\\". It made it impossible to stop reading. This book is wonderful, suspenseful, mysterious, and overall heart-warmingly hopeful. This was the first time I'd ever read a book like this and I most certainly haven't regretted it.The characters were fresh, unique, and they felt like real people to me. Alex and Stephen were amazingly fun and my two favorite characters. Everyone mentioned had a part to play and played it flawlessly. Michelle Paver has outdone herself here."},{"Title":"CONSULT YOUR CUSTOMERS: HOW TO ACHIEVE CONTINUOUS SALES SUCCESS.","review":"This is a basic book about sales. It's main message is &quot;focus on the customer&quot;, nothing too profound. The book is filled with fairly basic information.

This book would help you accelerate your knowledge in any Jujitsu program you were enrolled in.

There is a lot to like about this book, which was published in 1974. Clear drawings illustrate each of the techniques. The author was an instructor who has taught self-defense to law enforcement and citizens. Chapter one shows various body weapons. The second chapter explains prisoner handling and control using judo/jujitsu techniques. Chapter three teaches various selected judo throws. The fourth chapter deals with control type techniques. Choke holds are shown in chapter five. Chapter seven deals with combat stance and defense. The final chapter covers various counters to bear hugs and other attacks. In conclusion, though this book has some great information, it is obviously written by someone trained primarily in formal judo type techniques, which takes a lot of practice to become proficient enough to use in self-defense.Rating: 3 stars.

It rang true from what I know and have been told. It pulls you in quickly and you just have to find out what happens to Marty the main character. I have read many military books both fiction and not. I consider this a good story, fairly well written and engaging to the end. Had it contained more operational type information and missions I think I would have been happier.

I don't particularly consider myself a Christian, but this book made my cry (I had never cried from reading a book before!) Masterfully written, this book takes you into the mind, body, and soul of a man found the divine in all of us. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazantzakis truly writes one of the most beautiful pieces of prose in this book. I was truly amazed at the controversy over this story. The movie does not do the intent of the novel justice. Kazantzakis adamantly reports to the reader that this book glorifies God and is simply a fictional account of what &quot;could&quot; have happened in a blink of an eye. Segments of this work were so beautiful that I was moved to tears. The artistic insight and characterization are superb. The sheer poetry in the writing is unparalelled in my opinion. I agree with a previous reviewer, that every thinking person should be required to read this work. It is truly a masterpiece and in my opinion ranks among the greatest novels of all time. If you are considering buying this book, do it. Your life will be so much the better for it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"For the liberties that Kazantzakis has taken with the plot, the novel still remains surprisingly faithful to the Gospels. The Christ of this novel, however, is not quite as admirable as the original. Perhaps this is only to be expected as Kazantzakis has explored the tortured psychology of a very human Christ. Unfortunately, at times, Christ appears almost schizophrenic. (Read the novel and you'll see what I mean!)In any case, the Christ of the novel, highlights the deficiencies of the Gospel Christ, of Judaism and consequently of Christianity. Christ's obsession with hell and death is distasteful and disappointing. More seriously, perfect examples of the nilhistic core of religion (as identifed by Nietzsche) are abundant in the text -- many characters have a 'holy' deathwish and the whole novel persistently degrades this life and this earth for the next and for heaven. Also, there is an equivocation between truth and lies that is disturbing to say the least.In contrast to all of this, earthly characters like Zebedee and Judas come out with great lines and are often more convincing than Jesus. The novelist has made something great of the character of Judas, for which I applaud him.As the book held my interest enough for me to read to the end, I awarded it a 3, rather than a 2. After all, Kazantzakis should be lauded for taking on such a grand topic with such audacity.I should mention that the novel is also diabolically and hilariously sexist.The ending was a disappointment. The novel raises more questions than answers. I found it to be refreshingly doubt-inspiring which I doubt was the intention. It often serves as a damning critique of the theology it presents. Make of that what you will. Two plus two make four."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazantzakis' most controversial novel explores the humanity andstruggles of the Christ in ways the Bible merely implies and intimates. Every aspect of the New Testament version explodes into gripping passionate emotional inner turmoil which you know is leading up to something BIG. The novel is extremely well written, every character is human, believable and has an individual personality of which aspects are magnified. The battle of the spirit is ever present. You identify with the torment and future possibilities. It is every person's struggle at some point in his or her life. The book is rich in detail and description which making you feel you are living in that era. The outcome is inevitable but the drama and intensity is enormous and spell-binding! Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"As is so often the case among protestors and \`mobocrats' on planet earth, most of those who cry loudest that this work is heretical have never read it and are therefore not in possession of the truth that stands separate from the many lies told concerning it. There is little to fear here and less still to insult Christian devotion. Most of all there is scant danger of a potential convert or professed Christian being led astray into doubt or secular humanism. Since it is made abundantly clear to all who open the cover of The Last Temptation of Christ, that this is not a religious document, there is faint concern that any unaffiliated soul unlearned in Biblical lore might be swayed against Christianity. This is a fictional tale and it claims to be nothing else. Its author had no designs on founding a new branch of Christianity, and made no claims on being a prophet. He was a writer, and a writer solely. And he was a very fine one at that.This book makes use of most of the central characters from the Four Gospels, and treats the known biography of Jesus as a background upon which to draw. Writing versions of the lives of historical men and women is as old as drama itself; Shakespeare was carrying on a long tradition of this, and so was Nikos Kazantzakis. The question to be asked then is this one: Is Jesus too sacred a person for any writer to be allowed leave to dramatize the happenings in his life? If the answer is yes, then perhaps The Last Temptation of Christ deserves some of the scathing denunciations that have existed against it for seventy years. If, however the answer to the question is no, then doesn't this book merit tolerance and an approach from a position of open-mindedness?The character of Jesus here is more flesh and blood human being than in perhaps any other in literary source where we meet him (especially more so than in Norman Mailer's hideous 1990's take on the Gospel). Jesus is puzzled by who he is. He seeks answers for the confusing state of his mind and soul. He pieces together the meaning God has for him and the role he is to play in the plan for the salvation of humanity. Yet rather than the simplistic march to sacrifice too many assign to Jesus (despite Biblical accounts of his agony in the garden) Jesus in this novel cannot help but wish for the chance at a normal, happy life that should be his and anyone's to pursue. The \\"last temptation\\" of the title comes from the offer the devil makes Jesus, not precisely of riches and power, but the chance to be a simple husband and father and live a long life among his family, contended and secure in the outcomes his, rather than God's, actions have created. And still, this true child of God denies himself all he might have had, and commits himself by his death to the redemption of the peoples of the earth, past and future.This novel is beautifully written and Kazantzakis artfully sculpts a world still mostly given to the raw, primitive days of human history. There is blood here, there are slaughtered animals, and feasts, and fights and journeys through deserts that leave the participants footsore. There is food in endless variety described by the author, a Greek of the early twentieth-century, who obviously knew the worth of plenty in a world where many starved. This is a great work of literature and I value it highly. I don't agree with any significant criticism for it that I have encountered. It does not diminish Jesus, it elevates him by making him more recognizable to his fellow human beings. The Last Temptation readily deserves the five stars I have awarded it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"At 25, more than ten years after the film, I'm still trying to convince my orthodox Christian friends and family to read this book. The continue to parrot lines fed to them following the protest surounding the release of the film. Jesus is portrayed as (...), he says that (...)', etc. None of these things are in this incredibly passionate, devout novel. In all fairness, the film oftened seemed unnecessarily provocative and I think Scorsese did a real injustice to the story. This Jesus, while not wholly accurate (as if such a depiction could exist) is not the white Wilhelm Defoe, but a First Century Palestinian Jew who is written about in a modern form of his native tongue, Greek. I should say at this point, while the English translation expresses many of the fundamental emotions, if you never buy another book in a language foreign to you, buy this one in the original Greek. Today, Christians by the thousands flock to Mel Gibsons controversial film, bemoaning any criticism of it, while completely avoiding this depiction which is without rival in pulling the reader through the ordeal of bearing the sins of humanity at the cost of something we all take for granted, the pleasures of a finite LIFE.That's all I can add to the many other brilliantly expressed reviews already presented here. If you have the time, you should read them all."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Nikos Kazantzakis is the best writer I have ever read for, specially this Book, I hesitated for a long time to read it being afraid that it might effect my faith, but on the contrary, I saw Jesus from a new perspective, one that I have never thought of.The Author succeeded to transfuse me to another world, to the times of Jesus Christ, he succeeded to make me live in that time of period, and at the end I found myself closer to God."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Admittedly, I came at this book not expecting to agree with it. I am a Christian, after all. I approached it from the perspective that this is Kazantzakis's take on Jesus, and it is a novel after all.Generally, people have the darnedest time relating to Jesus Christ because he's just so... perfect. At least, that's the way the Church portrays him. Christians go on so much about Jesus's perfection that they make him seem more than human, superhuman, or even non-human. In fact, throughout Church history, that's been the most common mistake (or heresy) in the understanding of Jesus: that he's more divine than human. Historically, Christians have taught that he's just as much human as divine; devotionally, all the emphasis is on Jesus's divinity. I think we find this in the Greek church more so than in the western church.So, this is a bit of a backlash against that. Add a little Marxism, a little Buddhism, a little Nietzsche, and you have the intellectual background that Kazantzakis brings to his study of Jesus. How can a human being be the divine Christ? Kazantzakis's solution is to make him a flawed soul, trying to understand what God wants of him, and trying to transcend the flesh by pursuing the spirit. It doesn't match the gospels; but then again, it wouldn't. The gospels are about Jesus the Christ, not Jesus the man; and Kazantzakis has to fill in those blanks as best he can. So he does what every author does: he fills in the blanks with himself. Thus you get a Jesus that's a little bit Lenin, a little bit Buddha, a little bit Nietzsche, and a whole lot of Kazantzakis.That's the part I found most distracting. I know too much about first-century Jewish history (geography, rabbinic Judaism, contemporary Jewish, Samaritan, and Roman culture) and the novel frequently reminded me how obviously Kazantzakis doesn't. These characters aren't Jewish; they're Greek gentiles with Jewish names. Kazantzakis does the same thing to Jesus that Renaissance painters did; he makes Jesus into his image, and it isn't any more accurate than any of the other images.That said, I do find the book thought-provoking. If one might find it offensive, it's only because Christians aren't used to thinking of Jesus as human. Christians may feel it goes too far in some areas (yet they never raise this objection when other works go too far in depicting Jesus's divinity) and perhaps it does. But that's an area which I feel is too seldom explored....Now, about the quote (in the previous review; you'll read it below) where Jesus complains that Matthew is distorting reality with his version of events. Am I the only one who finds that passage ironic?"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The Last Temptation of Christ provokes an idea that I've often questioned; was Christ really a radical Rabi who died on the cross only to rise from the dead in the words of the so-called prophets? I think there may be some truth to this fiction."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"As I struggle with my own ideas of god and religion, I wish this book were the bible. I would become the most devout Christian the world has ever known. Kazantzakis is the best."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This is an awesome book in that it tells many of the stories that are in the Bible about Jesus' life and times. Yet the problem is for the reader who is not familiar with the stories of the Bible and its teaching qualities, he or she may misinterpret the intended messages of that particular tale. Arguably, Kazantzakis was not looking to reproduce the Jesus of the Bible nor his stories, in complete contrast, he wanted to create a more human and more \\"believable\\" Jesus Christ.As one might guess, Kazantzakis was shunned from the Catholic and Christian churches for his blasphemous work. I believe that Kazantzakis does a good job at writing the story of Jesus' life with a human tone and maybe even makes Jesus more heroic because in his human frailty and corruptibility, one can relate more easily to his struggles and better appreciates how difficult his time on earth had been.Although it may seem it, this is not a religious read; it is simply the tale of Jesus of Nazareth life and those heroic things he accomplished."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I have heard Bible stories all my life in bits and pieces. My mother was not successful in getting me to Bible school or attending church. I do not consider myself a Christian, haven't been baptized, although I have read more Eastern philosophy. I was inspired to read this book after reading Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. It was great to have all the parables and the Biblical stories fall into chronological space in a book that was written well. Reading this didn't make me want to be born again, either, but reinforced the universal ideas of seeing the Sacred in everyday things, everyday experiences. There are many parallels between Buddha and Jesus. Both approached an ascetic approach and rejected it. Both approached a monastic approach and rejected it to mingle with common people and spread their teachings. I would recommend this to readers in a similar plight as my own...relatively unschooled in the story of the New Testament."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Like combing a Greek moustache -- troublesome, hairy, ultimately beautiful if you're into this sort of thing."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The book is remarkable and shows the story of Christ as a story of a human and a parable of the life of the average man. The portrayl of Jesus' apostles is far more believable and interesting than the Bible. This is one of the most thoughtful books I have read and I found it hard to put down."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I selected this book as my interest in new approaches to religion and the psychological need for people to worship has been piqued since the attacks of September 11th. Not a very spiritual person, myself, I have been so curious as to why people are called to religion and what fundamental needs it fills. I suppose the world is full of the &quot;hows&quot; right now and I needed to see some of the &quot;whys&quot;. Last Temptation was one a series of books I have read to try to provide some diversity and expand my acceptance of organized religion.I thought the author's approach was innovative and really enjoyed peering at Christ as a very human personality. Kazantzaki's truly sees past the divine side that is emphasized by the church and puts the reader in the shoes of what it must be like to believe that you are The Son of God but also a simple human. The questions Jesus asks himself, as well as the temptations he faces are those any of us could relate to. Ironically, I think he might be almost too successful at humanizing Jesus. By the end, I was unable to separate the character in this book with any of the myriad of quacks who each day (even today) stand up and proclaim that they are the Messiah or even God, himself.This is where the conflict arises in the Last Temptation of Christ for me. If truly, as Kazantzaki's proclaims in the Introduction, this is his spiritual manifesto and an expression of his most sincere beliefs in God and Christ, it does nothing to make this skeptic more inclined to believe than I was before. Jesus is portrayed as a man, and no evidence is given to support the fact that he is more than that. As alluded to above, there is no reason for me to consider him any different than any of the others who make similar claims and whom we call &quot;nuts&quot;. I don't believe there is any way to distinguish between the &quot;zealot&quot; who is crucified in the novel's commencement and Christ who is put on the cross at the end.Essentially, this is not a work to make one who does not believe already draw conclusions about their own spirituality. In my mind it makes Christ and the Jews too normal to illustrate them as special in any extraordinary way. Still, it is an intriguing and very insightful psychological survey of what must go through the head of a person who believes in all of this and for that reason there is much value within it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The powerful message of this book and its author is a simple one: The life of Jesus was heroic, and thus worth emulating, even if He were only a man who thought--perhaps through imaginings--that men and women were worthy of redemption through a love that suffers. Camus describes such a man as our true friend, one who sleeps on the cold ground while we are in prison, hoping for our release through his effort.Through fear, and fear only, many prefer the savage, vengeful God of the Book of Revelation to the courageous man of Mark's Gospel, described here so well for us by Kazantzakis. Only the Spirit can take us further, but first we must accept and admire the man."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The Last Temptation of Christ provokes an idea that I've often questioned; was Christ really a radical Rabi who died on the cross only to rise from the dead in the words of the so-called prophets? I think there may be some truth to this fiction."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Finishing \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" by Nikos Kazantzakis left me with mixed impressions. The reason why I gave it only three stars is the poor depiction of the relationship of Mary and her son and the assertion that Jesus committed sin which are both contrary to my religion. This novel is a piece of fiction and the author allows himself a great liberty in re-telling the gospels. However, I have to admit that Kazantzakis is a superior writer. Unlike Dan Brown (another famous writer who attempted to re-interpret the life of Jesus Christ), Kazantzakis has the gift of empathy. The vivid depictions of the fields, plants, animals, villages and people of Galilee make me yearn to visit Israel and walk in the footsteps of Jesus. The brave attempt to look deep into the psychology of Jesus is at the core of this novel. The profound conflict between the expectations of a messiah as a political leader and the appearance of Jesus is ever-present. Kazantzakis tries to capture the tension between the contradictory \\"Love your enemies\\" and \\"I come not to bring peace, but to bring a sword\\" statements as perceived by Jesus and his listeners. The part that I found most intriguing is the description of the desperate search for identity and purpose and also the temptations experienced by Jesus in the desert and on the cross.My recommendation to the readers is: Read the book, but also read the Gospel of Matthew alongside it. No novel will ever be able to depict the character of Jesus Christ, true God and true man. No book about a friend can ever replace a deep personal relationship. But let me ask: Would Jesus himself enjoy reading \\"The Last Temptation\\"? I bet he already read it and liked it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"\\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" is not so much a complex story but a different version of the Christ story. The author, a Greek by the name of Nikos Kazantzakis, is a person with definite views regarding humanity and he has chosen the Christ saga to express them. He, the author, invites the reader to consider his views and leaves the final decision up to the reader, with is both diplomatic and a clever approach to good story telling.Katzantzakis's chose to write \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" in the common person's vernacular, be it Modern Greek or English, as it best expressed the real behaviour of the average person. There is implied meaning in the narrative approach but again, it is for the reader to interpret the true meaning and purpose of this form of communication.The ultimate joy in reading this story is that it provides a fictitious account of the Christ saga and rational regarding the lessons, which have become part of modern western culture. It's interesting to note that author himself spent some years in a monastery in Greece. This may have may motivated him to write such a colourful and interesting story.John Papas"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This was probabley one of the best translations i've ever read. i don't understand some of the comments about it being slow, or lacking rythym in the language, i found it beautiful. i was surprised to see the book rated so highly when the movie is rated as rather low, i guess smart people read books, and stupid people watch good movies but don't understand them."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"If you are looking for a wholly different perspective on the life of Christ-a radical departure from the pious and saintly myth-read &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ.&quot; Kazantzakis's imagery and vivid descriptions breathe life into the stiff and wooden idol of the Christian pulpit. The reader is left with the impression that here is a man that is at once human and heroic-a model for all those who seek to live a truly spiritual life."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I was blown away by the movie years ago, and curious to see what the book would be like. For me, personally it was disappointing because Jesus was not only not the person I believe he was, he was actually unlikable in the book. I believe he was fully human while on earth, but it seemed Kazantzakis went too far in giving his character traits that bordered on irritating. I like for the book I'm reading to either teach me something, be passionate enough to involve me deeply, inspire me, or just be plain enjoyable for no reason I can put my finger on. This book may hit the mark for some, but it didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"3/8/03 The publicity given to the movie &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (It was a movie rejected by the Catholic church and had its share of protestors outside of the movie theatres)led me to see the movie(when it was made a VCR) (I saw the movie(the VCR) with more clarity after reading the book.Nikos Kazantzakis 's book is not done justice in the movie,but in the book as you follow his fictious account of Christ within his village as a child ..through to his struggles as a young man who doesn't want to follow the prophecy given of him as an infant to his acceptance at 30(his ministry was ages 30-33) takes you to the question(and plot) &quot;How would his life had been affected had he not accepted his 'yoke'?&quot;and at the end returns you to 'his crucifiction and death'..The more I read the more I returned to previous pages read to understand a fiction drawn away from 'the facts'(The Bible).The book doesn't take you away from Christ as described in the Bible &quot;As The Word&quot;, but it does lead you more away from his personus as a guide ,to the Bible with his parables as a guide."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This is a greatly moving book by a believing Christian that makes the Christ of the gospels come alive as I've never seen before. It's really an amazing testament to Kazantzakis' faith, and of Christ's love for us-and his sacrifice. The story of his life is fleshed out and made real in an emotionally compelling way.It stresses the most important aspects of his teachings and it's truly an amazing novel. I also really liked the way Judas was portrayed, as a revolutionary who could not think beyond the conditions and injustices of the earth, and who could barely tolerate Christ's pacifism, though he agreed with so many of his thoughts. Mary Magdelene was also an extremely well-done portrait of a woman who Kazantzakis makes very human and very sympathetic.I guess my only objection would be the very end where things lapse into a long symbolic fantasy of what Christ's life would have been like if he hadn't decided to dedicate it to God, who is a constant presence calling him to duty throughout his life. It gets too weird for me; Christ is living in a polygamous fantasy land and its a bit incoherent. I probably am just not trying hard enough to comprehend its symbolism, but I found it tedious and detracting from the rest of the book.But it is a beautiful and highly recommended book, which both believers and non-believers have told me they loved as well."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"For everyone who believes in some kind of God, but doesn't know why,or how...This book will blow your mind away."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"For a frequently banned book, I expected more. My expectations were definitely high, which is probably part of why I didn't really dig \\"The Last Temptation\\".Jesus is really not a very likeable character in this book. He's really mean to his Mom--which I didn't appreciate. He won't even look at her or acknowledge her--he pretty much disowns her. And I can't understand why Jesus never heals Joseph, yet he heals that Roman's daughter--that seemed really cruel. Jesus is basically so self absorbed throughout the entire book. It's always, \\"me, me, me.\\" He's desperate, and I mean whiny, falling on the knees on the verge of a tempter tantrum desperate to \\"find God\\"--too desperate for me to really relate to and his disciples--OMIGOD!! They are so annoying. They're whiney, shuffling sheep. Ugh...couldn't stand them. Judas is the most likeable of the bunch-which I found ironic--since he is generally thought of as the worst traitor ever.That being said, the book is well-writen and a real page turner at times--it's just that the characters themselves are so unlikeable-every one of them (except Judas). Also, I think the author assumes the reader knows a lot about Christianity, which I don't, so I was often confused-especially about why Jesus draws certain conclusions about what God wants him to do and why. I didn't understand Jesus' reasoning. In fact most of the time Jesus seems like a frothing maniac, not how I imagine the son of God to be.All in all, it's okay--if you have an interest in religion I recommend it, if not I wouldn't bother--but read the prologue if you happen to pass it on a bookself sometime. I found the prologue the most interesting and inspiring part of the book."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"i'm an orthodox christian and i still fully admire this book. i can cry just by thinking about it. the book is fine just so long as you don't confuse this jesus with the One in the gospels. i have little sympathy with those people who claim that we are just now discovering the person of jesus and that the original runners from israel confused the matter completely. anyway, this book is brilliant, but only insofar as it portrays the tantalizing human emotional (spiritual) realm. if you want the empty hands of that outreach to be filled, you'd be far better off reading about the real Jesus in the book of john."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I highly recommend this book in general, especially to those who are agnostic or who haven't thought much about faith. It makes an excellent entry into the Christian religion, despite its theological blunders (intentional or otherwise).It should be noted that Kazantzakis's treatment of Jesus is heretical, both in many details (such as the relationships with Jesus's mother and Mary Magdalene) and in a few major themes (such as the awkwardness of Jesus's dual humanity and divinity). But what many people who condemn this book forget is that the things the book does get right (the glory and necessity of the crucifixion, for instance) are underappreciated in the modern world, and actually come across as &quot;new things&quot;! As an example, by condemning this book, many people think that the Church doesn't like the very human portrayal of Jesus, which couldn't be further from the truth. What Kazantzakis had trouble with, understandably, was portraying the divine nature of Jesus, which he could only hint at with extreme awkwardness.In short, these are not the days when villages would put on passion plays, recreating the Paschal mystery of Jesus in greusome detail, making the life, death and resurrection of Jesus tangibly real to its participants. Many people today are rather unfamiliar with what the Church means when she says, &quot;the Word made flesh&quot; or &quot;Jesus was fully man and fully God.&quot; In fact, medieval passion plays often made theological mistakes of their own, one in particular was the comic character of St. Joeseph as a jealous old man, suspicious of Mary's conception. Kazantzakis has him in a coma, struck by lightning.To those who would say, &quot;I wish this book was the Bible&quot;: why do you have so little respect for truth? Not meaning, &quot;obviously you all know that the Bible is truth,&quot; because that isn't an obvious thing, but why do you wish to call something true just because you like it? Read the book, it's good fiction, then the Bible, and you'll find some familiar themes and some striking differences. Then, perhaps more importantly than the two above, seek the company of believers, and in this way, whittle toward the truth. You won't finish."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I tried to fill the form with &quot;No stars&quot;. 1 star is a compromise. I am still in the middle of this book and fighting through every page. Why did I ever start it? The style is just terrible: &quot;The son of Mary...&quot; &quot;The son of Mary...&quot; - this reads like a 12 years old writings. The story is boring. It stands in stark contrast to &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot;, another book which tells of Jesus' life - but interestingly and compellingly. The part that annoys me most about the book is the complete lack of historic research. The story occurs in Israel, about 2000 years ago. How come the people are eating grilled corn and tomatoes? These were brought from the Americas 1500 years later! And seeing gunpowder mentioned shocks me too. Kazantzakis also did not understand the kosher rules, and puts salt water sea life into the fresh water sea of Galilee... I expected more from the writer of Zorba the Greek."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"While the item itself is in great shape, I found the shipping/handling charges to to be way out of line for the amount of time it took to get the book."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The Last Temptation of Christ is a fictional exploration of the life of one of history's most intriguing figures, Jesus Christ. This is not revisionist history, merely an author's viewpoint on how the Son of the Carpenter may have lived his life. It should be taken as a novel, and not a reinterpretation of the scriptures.Nikos Kazantzakis presents Jesus as very human, a man struggling to ignore the voice of God while making the crosses that the Romans use for crucifiction execution. The people around him think he is mad, and at first the story is frustrating as the reader wants the character to show some guts and follow his destiny. Of course, what a destiny this turned out to be. How many of us could have done what he was purported to have done? That is the question, and as Jesus accepts that he is the Messiah, the story really gets moving.This is not an easy read, both in its prose and its ideas. There is a lot here to challenge people from all religious backgrounds. Jesus is shown as a human, with human emotions and frailties, but it is this that makes for an interesting character arc in the presenation of the novel and the creation of a truly dynamic character.Kazantzakis also provides beautiful description of the land of Jesus' birth and places we've read about in the Bible and heard of in the news. Nazareth, Judea, Galilee, Samaria and Jerusalem come alive in these pages, full of Jews, Romans, Pharisees, Scribes and ragamuffins.The character of Judas Iscariot is also interesting, a militant religious zealot who wants the Romans out of Israel. In this story, he is the one follower that remains completely true to Jesus, and must accept the most difficult task given to him by Jesus. The other apostles are shown as weak and ready to desert Jesus at the earliest threat of danger to their lives.A challenging aspect of this book is the visions, and one is never quite sure if what a character is seeing is real, imagined or a vision from God. A lot of strange things happen, and sections are full of Biblical symbolism so you might need to read sections twice or consult with the Gospels for clarity.The scenes dealing with Satan are particularly bizarre, especially the period where Jesus is fasting in the desert.Another interesting character is Mary Magdelene, a prostitute that scorns Jesus, then becomes one of his most ardent followers. She figures in the last temptation, but more important are the sisters of Lazarus, Martha and Mary. As Christ ascends the Cross, he experiences this last temptation and there is an interesting twist on temptations. To me, this section was not nearly so blasphemous as \\"religious\\" folks have made it out to be. They probably didn't actually read the book.Here are a couple of my favorite passages:\\"What are dreams, Rabbi?\\" she asked him softly. \\"What are they made of? Who sends them?\\"\\"They are neither angels nor devils,\\" Jesus answered her. \\"When Lucifer started his revolt against God, dreams could not make up their minds which side to take. They remained between devils and angels, and God hurled them down into the inferno of sleep...\\"Another\\"A prophet is the one who, when everyone else despairs, hopes. And when everyone else hopes, he despairs. You'll ask me why. It's because he has mastered the Great Secret: that the Wheel turns.\\"The only major problem I had with the writing was that there was a lot of point of view shifting within scenes, so it sometimes became confusing whose head we were in during the scene. One minute we're with Jesus, the next with John, then Peter, and so on. I don't mind multiple points of view, but I prefer to stay with one character throughout the duration of a scene.I thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who wants to examine their beliefs from an alternate point of view other than the one taught by organized religion."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I read Nikos Kazantzakis' \`The Last Temptation of Christ' back in '75. It was assigned as required reading for a college course I was enrolled in called, \\"Radical Christianity\\". Actually I faked my way through the assignment, who wants to read another book on the life of Christ? I certainly didn't. It wasn't until the end of the semester and summer was upon me that I actually opened the book for the first time and begin to read. Once I began I couldn't put it down.Kazantzakis is a brilliant writer who looks at the world and perceives the intangibles around us like no other author I've ever read. His narrative is surreal, hallucinogenic and disturbingly earthy all at the same time. His ability to look into the human psyche and translate its intensely personal contents into concrete terminology is truly amazing. At times his writing seems more akin to poetry than composition.This life of Christ is unlike anything you've ever come across before, which explains why there was so much turmoil and Christian backlash over the release of the movie adaptation by Scorsese in '88. They still haven't learned that a closed mind can never be a truly spiritual mind. Don't pass on reading the book because you saw the film. The difference between the two is the difference between night and day.One of my Top Ten Books of All-Time! My Highest Recommendation."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"So Jesus finally reads what Matthew has been writing about him for the last several months and is flabbergasted. &quot;This isn't the truth,&quot; he says. &quot;These are lies! I was not born in Bethlehem. I've never set foot in Egypt in my life. I don't remember any magi! And the dove did not say, 'This is my son,' while I was being baptized!&quot; Matthew tells him he knows this, but nevertheless he has been writing what he has been told to write by an angel, who visits him in the evening. Matthew himself questioned this truth, but the angel told him that he knew nothing of the truth. The angel told him there were many truths, the truths of men, which are many, and the truth of God, which is one. Matthew was to record the truth of God. And he did.The truth. Yes, indeed, the truth. It can make one uncomfortable on occasion, and Mr. Kazantzakis' version of the truth can certainly be said to do that. His Jesus is quite a bit different than the one we've come to know and love from catechism class and from the Bible. His Jesus only performs a few of the miracles recounted in the Bible. There is no mention of the crippled man lowered through the roof. There is no Sermon on the Mount. No wedding at Cana. The walking on water story was a dream of Peter. But he does recite some parables, heal the centurion's daughter, and raise Lazarus from the dead.He agonizes over his fate, is often unsure of his divinity, and rails at God, whose hold on him is described as ten claws gripping his skull. He preaches the doctrine of love, but is somewhat vague as to how to put it into practice. He goes to Jerusalem and screams at the Pharisees and the high priests, stating he will smash the temple to pieces. He claims that all must repent, for the baptism he provides will be fire, not water, and will burn the four corners of the earth.His disciples are weak and vacillating, except for Judas, who is a fervent anti-Roman revolutionary. Magdalene becomes a prostitute after her love for him is spurned. Joseph is stricken and paralyzed the day Jesus is born, and remains that way for the rest of his life. His mother Mary is a miserable wretch as Jesus fails to do any of the normal things that a mother wishes her son to do.No, this is not your typical Bible story. Nor should it be. It is fiction after all. But as the story is of Jesus, it is fiction which must be held to higher scrutiny. The question is, does it work?To a large degree it does. The fact is, Jesus was a man. At one time in his life he was a baby, a ten-year old, a teenager, an adult. At which point during these times of his life did he finally realize he was the son of God? The Bible itself gives us many examples of his humanity: he shows love, anger, strength--and fear. Even on the eve of his death, he cries out to God to spare him from his fate: &quot;Let this cup passeth over me.&quot;Mr. Kazantzakis gives us an interesting interpretation of this life, and one which to some degree is in conformity with Biblical events. It is a fascinating piece of work and one which displays a great deal of passion and imagination. It is clearly written by a man with a burning, spiritual yearning.But if there is a flaw it is that it fails to capture the true greatness of Jesus. Whether you believe in his divinity or not, it can not be denied that his influence on humanity was as great or greater than any person who ever lived. He began a religion two-thousand years ago which to this day continues to be practiced by millions of people on every continent of the earth. His teachings formed the basis of the greatest institutions that mankind has created; institutions based on freedom, equality and justice. He must have had, to say the very least, a remarkable personality.And this is where it stretches credulity. For Kazantzakis' Jesus is perhaps just a little too human: too weak, too unsure of himself, sometimes too timid and sometimes too shrill. It is often a little hard to believe from this novel that he inspired the faith of his own disciples, much less the millions who followed.But to be fair, who is to say what the truth is? Mr. Kazantzakis, after all, is simply recording the truth of man. One man. One of many. He must be commended, for by doing so he maybe came a little closer--and perhaps brought his readers a little closer--to the truth of God."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"&quot;The seed is love&quot;! I was raised in a christian household where we didn't question the literal truth of the bible and Jesus was a white man who was not of this earth. When I grew up and became a man, I resented the teachings I was given and rebelled against the church (and became a die hard athiest) After reading this book I was overwhelmed with a sense a inspiration and awe that no minister could ever plant in my soul. I saw for the first time the passion of Christ through the eyes of Jesus the man. I still am very much against organized religion and all its hippocrites, but I now refer to myself as agnostic. For someone to write these beautiful words about such a loving and tolerant man, proves that there must be some sort of an oversoul (like Emerson's). This is a must read book for the open minded soul who has questions about their fundamentalist upbringing. It is not for those who are intolerant, close minded, and think they have all the answers. Jesus spoke of love and compassion, he didn't judge his fellow man like most all christians do today (gays, muslims, jews, different races, hindus, drug users, and anyone who doesn't agree with them), Jesus would have not tried to change them by condeming them. Jesus would have loved them - nothing more. Fanaticism breeds contempt, the more fanatical and judgemental you are the more people will stop listening to you! By the way, Jesus was more than likely not a white, european, english speaking man. He was a Jew who probably looked more of Eygptian descent. Open your mind and heart and read this book - Absolutely mind shattering and sure to be a tear jerker for the compassionate soul."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"For the record, \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" is one of my favorite movies, one that I have seen many times, and I unfailingly find it to be moving, uplifting and inspiring. I expected to enjoy the book equally, but unfortunately I found that I had a number of reservations about Nikos Kazantzakis' book.As a reader, I tend to appreciate good, detailed research: the better the author has done his homework, the more that I feel I can really appreciate and get into a story. Unfortunately, Kazantzakis' research seems to have been minimal at best. The people populating the world of \\"Last Temptation\\"'s Jesus are basically modern Orthodox Greeks in first century Jewish clothing. There are endless references to later Christian notions of hell and heaven, in addition to guardian angels, saints, devils, monasteries, abbots, friars, rosaries, etc.; there is absolutely no attempt to recreate an ancient Jewish mindset- in fact I was almost expecting Jesus and his friends to attend mass and perhaps light a candle in front of an icon. As \\"Last Temptation\\" is mainly about the psychology of a human Christ, who was born and raised a Jew, this greatly weakened the impact of the novel for me. I was not really sure how I could believe or sympathize with a character who, for me, was in no way convincing.There are other weaknesses too. If the indifference to Judaism isn't bad enough, there are also references to things that came along centuries, if not millennia later, such as gunpowder, ears of corn, velvet, cashmere shawls, and- most unbelievably- palm-reading Gypsy fortune-tellers. There are also general inconsistencies. For example, Mary Magdalene, who is always called 'Magdalene' even as a girl, is described as a daughter of a rabbi from Cana. She does move to Magdala later, but why isn't she called 'Mary of Cana' if that is where she is originally from? For that matter, if everyone knows her father, why isn't she just called \\"Mary bat [daughter of] So and So\\"? It's little things like that which completely distract me from the no doubt powerful and moving story the author intended to tell.The misogyny is also appalling; all the women in the story are forever saying things like, \\"You forget that we're women, and weak,\\" and, \\"You must learn that a woman is like a wounded doe. She has no other joy, poor thing, except to lick her wounds.\\" I also find the style to be flowery yet without being interesting, rather in the manner of Anne Rice, although this might be a problem with the translation. (However, authors like Flaubert and Tolstoy possess exquisite styles, which have come through many, many translations.)On the bright side, Kazantzakis tackles the subject with energy and bravura, and his ideas are truly brilliant. I do apologize to all the Kazantzakis fans out there, but I really believe that Scorcese improved the story in his film. In my opinion, he made it more concise, authentic and emotionally powerful, and softened the unpleasant denigration of women and earthly things that seems to be a constant thread throughout the book. Many people love this novel, and get a lot out of it, and I think that's great. However, I personally can't get into it. Ah well- that just means that it's time to watch the movie again!"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This book is thought-provoking, vividly painted, and emotionally powerful. My religion teacher in 7th grade mentioned it one day in class as a suggestion for a book report, and mentioned the fuss about it, and so I had to read it.Maybe the fuss was because some people simply can't stand the humanization of religion. This book portrays Jesus as a man, which is in direct contrast to the currently accepted version of him, which is of a divinity who was only incidentally a man. Kazantzakis' choice of perspective is what makes this book such a worthy read. It's not only Jesus who is first and foremost mortal, but also his disciples, most notably Judas. Jesus' relationships with those around him are painted with such exceeding care that you can almost feel his torture, longing, and fear. My heart twists and soars alternately throughout this book.Taken simply as a work of fiction, this book is worth the time it takes to read it. The accuracy and vividness of the historical setting are amazing, as are the well-drawn characters. But one can also choose to look at it as something more, and if so, won't be disappointed. This is one of the most inspiring books I've ever read; I've always believed that bearing the responsibility of the Messiah (or of any other savior) must have been, in part, psychological torture. Kazanzakis understood that, but also understood the ecstasy of the burden. Look at Jesus, Judas, and the others, and be inspired, whatever your religious belief. At the heart of everything, they were merely human; but men who worked with their human frailties to bring about something that has profoundly impacted the rest of history after them.If you enjoyed this book, I would suggest that you also look at Taylor Caldwell's _Dialogues with the Devil_ and for a hilarious-but oddly meaningful-take on relgion, try _Good Omens_."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The Last Temption of Christ may be the greatest theological exploration of the 20th century. The topics it deals with are deep and complex, so to expect that this book is going to be an easy read is wishful thinking. That said, it is a very worthwhile read for anyone who struggles with issues of religion and the indentity of the divine.I should say that I am not a Christian, so the the central drama of the book, the apparent contradiction of Jesus being both totaly human and totaly divine is not as emotional to me as it is for others. That said, many Christians I know have described this book as central to their ability to embrace their faith. Why?Kazantzakis explore Jesus' humanity in a way to make us feel the character and understand his joys and sorrows. At the same time, he shows the terror that would acomplish being so completely in touch with the divine. Most important of all, he shows us the pain of Jesus decision to sacrifice himself on the cross and helps us understand it.Many people find this book very threatening. That is understandable. People who believe faith is blind are often troubled by those who dare to look too close. I have often thought that reading this gave me my best understanding of the passion with which my christian friends view Jesus. For that reason alone, this is a wonderful and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"About 95% of the people I know, including family, would all agree that this book is blasphemous. Which is sad, being that they have never actually read it themselves, plus the fact that it is an insightful, thought-provoking story about the human side of Jesus Christ. I suppose most Christians like to imagine their savior as this perfect, emotionally stable, ever peace-at-mind character, never struggling with doubt, lust, and anxiety. I'm sure the Jews at that time were expecting someone like this, too.But on with the review. Sorry, I would've liked to just review Last Temptation while ignoring the controversy surrounding it. But I can't. When I began reading this about a year ago, I knew full well it would cause a stir if anyone knew. As I mentioned before, this is a very thought-provoking depiction of Jesus. The story attempts to answer the question, &quot;What happened to Christ from age 12-30?&quot; and plenty others.Facts don't matter, however. What Last Temptation is really about is the emotions Christ experienced when he realized who He was and how he struggled with the human desires that told him he should get married, settle down, and lead a normal life. In these moments, we glimpse a side of Jesus we've never seen before. His relationship with Mary Magdeleine, Judas Iscariot, and his mother is put in new light, with interesting results.One complaint: The book is tedious at times, dwelling on priests and other characters when it should simply concentrate on Jesus. Other than that, Last Temptation is a great read, especially for the open-minded Christian who likes to be challenged. Ultimately, I think all readers will find this tale to be inspiring. Tears came to my eyes as the book closed with Jesus declaring &quot;It is finished,&quot; and then the author stating, &quot;It was if he was saying 'It has begun.'&quot;"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I marked some passages that are very telling about the novel's wonderfully passionate sentiment. Foremost, I greatly appreciated the lack of fear and hate Kazantzakis' Jesus shows repetitively in the novel:{p155} 'Judas, my brother is that you?''...I swore to my brothers and to the mother of the crucified that I would kill you.''I'm delighted to see you, Judas, my brother. I'm ready... I offer you my neck...'It disgusted him to touch a neck which was offered undefended, like a lamb's... 'Why don't you resist?''...I prepared myself to be killed... Death is not a door which closes; it is a door which opens.'This courage alone could change a world. It is displayed here again:{p177} Barabbas went wild... he lifted his hand and slapped [Jesus]...'Hit the other one too, Barabbas, my brother.'These scenes are even more powerful for us to read with Kazantzakis portraying early that Jesus is merely a confused, deserted man aspiring for greatness:{p145} A gypsy woman passed by... she said, 'I'll tell you your fortune... I see crosses -- crosses and stars... You'll become King of the Jews!' '...ever since then ... I haven't been in my right mind.'Nikos' Jesus later rises to touch this greatness. But it's in the novel's wonderful parables he tells that hold keys to an emerging paradigm of Christianity:{p202} 'God, how can anyone be happy in Paradise when he knows that there is a man, a soul, roasting for all eternity?' ... God heard [Lazarus'] thought and was glad. '...Beloved [Lazarus],' He said, 'go down... bring him here so that he may drink and refresh himself...' 'For all eternity?' asked Lazarus. 'Yes, for all eternity.' Jesus got up without a further word.It's this passionate direction and frankness that makes this character so enjoyable to read. Nicos shows it again here, in an absolutely poignant way:{p224} Jesus said... 'God is everywhere, old man, and we all are brothers.''Samaritans and Galileans too?''Samaritans and Galileans too, old man...''God and the devil too?' he asked finally.Jesus was terrified. Never in his life had he been asked if God's mercy was so great that one day he would forgive even Lucifer... 'I don't know. I am a man, and my concern is for men.'I so much wish that this was the concern of theologians today. These humanistic new ideas, found blasphemous by literal interpretations, appear again, in a compelling argument between Jesus and his best mate, Judas:{p347} 'If the soul within us does not change, Judas, the world outside us will never change. The enemy is within, the Romans are within, salvation starts from within!'And finally:{p466} [The angel says to Jesus], 'here is the kingdom of heaven: earth... Here is eternity: ...each moment that passes. Moments aren't enough for you? If so, you must learn that eternity will not be either.'If that's not liberating, then I have lost its meaning. This should be required reading. It's Kazantzakis' best attempt at living this moment (this one) as courageously and compassionately as one man did."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The most common complaint people have of this book is that it moves too slowly. Maybe that can be blamed on the translation, but don't fault the translator - fault the English language, which is a barbaric piece of work compared to Greek. Anyone who has studied Biblical Greek or even modern Greek, or read a New Testament translation with commentaries on the original Greek, will understand that Greek is an amazingly complex and rich language compared to English. A single word in Greek can mean several different things in English - sometimes, that Greek word means something literally and something figuratively, and by using that word the author means both the literal and figurative! So if the translation seems dull or slow, it may be because the author is trying to translate passages that, in the original Greek, would be far more lively and rich with meaning.Also, Kazantzakis' descriptive narratives are not without significance. He carefully takes time to describe the world in which Jesus lives and acts because this is the world we are familiar with, and his description makes it temptingly, seductively beautiful, and he wants us to be lured into that seduction. In the midst of this walks Jesus, who is tempted at all times to give up his work and embrace that world so familiar to us, and yet must give up that common life in order to bring new life to this world. Kazantzakis wants us to clearly feel and understand the world that Jesus had to give up himself.Finally, one reviewer did not like how the author continually changes the way in which he refers to Jesus... &quot;the youth,&quot; &quot;the son of Mary,&quot; and finally &quot;Jesus.&quot; There is a reason for this. Up until he uses &quot;Jesus,&quot; Jesus is on a torturous journey to discover who he is and what his purpose is. He even has gone so far as to reject his calling, refusing to follow God's will for many chapters. Thus, he is not called &quot;Jesus&quot; because he has not yet taken on that role - Jesus, after all, means the savior of the world, and until he accepts that role Kazantzakis does not address him as such. It's just a name that others call him by, but it's not yet his identity. Prior to that point, he must be called &quot;the son of Mary&quot; or &quot;the youth&quot; because THOSE are his identities at that point in the early chapters. Kazantzakis refers to him by the role he takes on, not by something as crude as his given name.All this said, I agree with most of the posts here. An important work that challenges us to think about Christ's life and how it relates to our lives. A book to be kept in any good book collection (in hardback preferably, since it should be pulled out every few years and re-read). If you haven't read it and have any interest in challenging how you think, buy it now.Also, I agree that the movie does not plumb the rich depths of the novel, but if it attempted to do so it would have been ten hours long. I think that the most important thing Scorcese captured on film was the crucifiction. Never in any readings of the gospels have I sensed that the crucification was painful, torturous, barbaric, or the worst way to die in that age. The gospels even mention the thieves conversing, in polite formal English, with Jesus while supposedly dying a horrible death. The film, on the other hand, made real the entire process, from the whipping, crown of thorns, the hatred of the masses, to the slow procession up to the hill, to the nails being driven into the hands and the long, long hours of simply waiting to die in miserable agony. This part of the movie brought me to tears and still does. So watch the film and read the book, both are valuable."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This book caused Nickos Kazantzakis the excommunication from orthodox church. The irony is that this particular book is an hymn to God and Crist! I personal do not believe in Gods but if that book was the Bible I surely would be a priest! It touches you directly in the heart. It is a MUST for every thinking human no matter which his/her religion is.&lt;P"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I picked this up not expecting too much. I thought that this would just be another safe retelling of a Bible story. Boy was I wrong! The Jesus depicted in this book is very human. He struggles with temptations and unpleasant situations. This book challenged me, made me think, and failed all my predictions. I like that this book is unpredictable but satisfying. This book really made me stay up late at nights until I finished it. I was in a book rut until I picked up this one. A riveting story. Oh and it will not bore you to tears, it's one of \\"those\\" classics!"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I will certainly agree with many of the other reviewers who find this excellent novel ponderous and hard going in many, many places. I also believe too that with all translations there is much lost in terms of rhythym, imagery and cultural frame of reference.That said, The Last Temptation of Christ demands not only attention, but re-reading as well- always the mark of a good book.Kazantzakis never intended his novel to be taken as gospel. He simply is attempting to bring into focus the humanity at the center of the mystery of Christ. Christ, in my mind is the living God and Kazantzakis, through a work of fiction, brings Him as a character closer to my own experience. Again, no one is to take this novel as Truth in a religious sense- although Kazantzakis is not blasphemus as many of this novel's attackers insist- it simply is an exploration of the sin and heartache that all human's encounter.By making Christ more human for the sake of narrative, Kazantzakis brings the price of our salvation even closer to reality. The pain of sin and blood of cleansing is even more critical and necessary to every one of us. Satan's tempting of Christ in this novel is so vividly powerful that we do indeed see our selves manifested. The book has demanded I (and all readers) re-examine and closely evaluate our faith. This does not mean we reject it- no- it actually makes our faith stronger.Kazantzakis had the courage to step out of Plato's cave with this novel. I strongly urge all readers to tackle the difficult prose and wrestle with this novel. It is a meaningful journey one can (and needs to!) take repeatedly."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Quite frankly, this is Kazantzakis' masterpiece. Taking a theme that he is probably best known for exploring in Zorba, he explores the struggle between the physical and the spiritual or contemplative life. In Last Temptation the scope and artistic courage required to examine this theme in the life of Jesus Christ must have been a daunting undertaking. This is a book of incredibly beautiful imagery. Some of the familiar gospel scenes are portrayed with an intensity of language that had me stunned at the quality of the vision Kazantzakis was pursuing and the ability to give the main characters from Jesus' life flesh and blood characterizations that give the scenes an earthy and human aspect.At the same time he employs artistic license freely and his Christ is as much of a human as he is a God. There are passages that are integral to the novel that would be considered controversial at the time this was written and in our own time as well. The ending is a sweeping re-imagining of the Passion of Christ that is one of the most poetic passages in literature and yet it remains respectful of the faith of Christians. This is not an anti-religious work but a haunting work of art that uses the best known of all stories to explore timeless themes. Approach with an open mind and you will be rewarded."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The Last Temptation of Christ by Nikos Kazantzakis can be described as a book of brilliant writing. Kazantzakis has taken the story of Jesus Christ and brought it to life after nearly two thousand years. The opening of the book with a dream sequence and taking Jesus forward into the tumult is a very scholarly way. The book deals with every day life and challenges, temptations faced by Jesus in moving from a man to a philospher and towards God. He faces many of the tribulations where people around him question his beliefs as he preaches love in order to bring mankind closer, in peace. He scorns the corruption and practices of the rich, temple high priests and people in power. Finally he sacrifices himself. This book is a screen play and one wonders why it took so long to be made into a film and the subsequent controversy by religious right. The Catholic Church has banned this book. What a colossal mistake. This book makes one understand the love of Jesus better than what is written in Bible and should be read by any one who wishes to know about true christianity and its core message as it originated in the Middle East in Israel. Unfortunately this message of Jesus has been taken and trampled with later by so called people of faith. It has been contradicted by the followers to-day from its original message of love and compassion, into a puritanical and self serving business. It was a matter of time when Christianity would be colonised for profit. Kazantzakis makes this very obvious without coming out and telling it. To excommunicate him because of this is unpardonable and denying him a noble prize is a failure to recognise this great writer. Many lesser writers of english literature were given the noble prize. This book is a must read for all people, irrespective of religious faiths, if you want to know the real Jesus Christ, the messaih."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This is the most cherished piece of literature on my bookshelf. The author's longing of the soul is translated into what sounds to me like true religion, above church and above dogma, a paradoxical and frightening union of physical and spiritual consciousness made art. This book like the message of Jesus of Nazareth has the power to make a revolution in the soul, to throw off tired and narrow ideologies to make the world a better place. It is proof that those who pretend to own Christ, cannot."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Now, I didn't see the movie but from what I have heard Scorcese missed the boat as to what this novel was all about. (Just for the record, I think Scorcese is over rated!!)This was a beautiful book. It is not blasphemous in any way shape or form. If one reads it to the end you will understand what I mean.Are there are few uncomfortable moments? Yes! But that is the point of the book. The title of the book explains everything and is ITSELF explained on the last page.If you are a Christian don't be afraid of this book or what others might say about the film. Go to a bookstore and check out the author's forward, and you just might find yourself buying the book."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"...to the Gospels. If one has no knowledge of the Gospels coming in to this book, it would not be a problem, as Kazantzakis skillfully incorporates many of the stories and parables of Jesus. However, he adds some new twists to characters like his mother Mary, and Judas, etc. I achieved a real sense of his Apostles as peasants and as true \\"common men\\" who were uncertain about whether this was the Messiah that the Hebrew Scriptures spoke of. It was a little long working up to the crucifixion, but the last 100 pages were extremely interesting as one became witness to the human vs. divine struggle of Kazantzaki's Christ. This book is a good fictional account for those wellversed in the New Testament, or for those whose experience with the Gospels has been limited. Negative comments: First, if you are familiar with the New Testament, I think you will find the review of the gospel stories too tedious. Secondly, for a fictional Jesus, I enjoyed Jose Saramago's The Gospel According to Jesus Christ much more than Last Temptation."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"As a reader, I had a very productive year in the 9th grade, reading Grapes of Wrath, Madame Bovary and The Last Temptation of Christ. If I remember correctly I also read Catcher in the Rye that year! I turned fourteen that year and my mother was horrified at my reading choices. For me, they were pivotal. I understood, even at that early age, the importance of freedom of thought and divergence of vision. The Last Temptation of Christ is one of the greatest books of the 20th century as far as I am concerned. It is FICTION. One must remember that. And it explores that unresolved question, was Jesus wholly man, or wholly God or wholly both? And it explores, for some, uncomfortably, the underlying conflict within Jesus, that is reflected in each human being on the earth plane. This incredible Greek writer, Nikos Kanzantzakis, with a different approach and an array of symbols, presents the reader with a very different vision of what might have been. Is it wrong to consider a different vision of the Christ? I think not. The important point is that at the very end of the book, Jesus says, \\"It is accomplished!\\" He did not give in to that very greatest temptation, to be totally human. He became fully self-realized as a spiritual being. This is the goal of all mankind. We are here on this earth-plane to realize our God-self and our total range of potentials. Jesus came to show us the possibilities for our personal development. That's what this book really shows us!"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"One cannot review this book as a work of literature, although it certainly is that. Kazantzakis wrote it as a love-letter to Christ and a meditation on the nature of the man. In that sense, he succeeded wildly, ecstatically, anachronisms and misplaced Greek characterizations and all. \\"Gunpowder\\", even - it's all part of Nikos Kazantzakis, and it all serves to drive us deep into the heart of his Jesus, and himself.That said . . . I have to take issue with Kazantzakis (of course. Else why write a review?)I was mystified at the ease with which The Baptist turned Jesus from his Gospel of \\"Love, Love\\" to that of \\"the Axe is laid at the root of the tree.\\" Jesus seems to get the better of John in their discussions, arguing most persuasively why his message must differ from John's - and then he goes out sounding like John redux. Did his sojourn in the desert cause this change in direction? It seemed a little too facile for me.And the ending (I'm perpetually disapointed by endings - seems to be a thing with me). . . why did he have to die? That was very disappointing.Just kidding - what disappointed about the ending is that Jesus did not really prevail over the final temptation as he had in the desert. He was drawn in to his fantasy life, luxuriated in it even, and then was surprised to find himself once again upon the cross (hope I'm not giving anything away here). I suppose this is Kazantzakis' final identification with the humanity of Jesus, but it seemed an odd perspective on the final moment of Jesus' life as a man - surprised relief rather than victory.It's too much to expect of a writer, that his inner-most meditation on the meaning of Jesus should provide any \\"answers\\" to a reader looking for illumination (I've given up on \\"Truth\\"). For all that I've failed in each of my three readings of this book over the last twenty years to fully grasp Kazantzakis' Jesus in all his dimensions, the journey has been well worth the cost in time and frustration. Kazantzakis was a natural writer as well as a Natural writer, and his Jesus is more human (with all that it entails) than any other treatment has dared allow him to be."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"It has been slightly over 40 years since I &quot;discovered&quot; THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST which, as an aside, brought me to so many other of Nikos Kazantzakis' works. I have read a great number of books since then, many of which I don't remember. This book made such an impression on me that I still carry images from it with me today, over 40 years later.Since these particular impressions are so strong, I must have felt that they were key to Kazantzakis' message. Therefore, what I remember and how I remember it follows.First of all, I remember Jesus as a young man who already knew that God had a plan for him, and that God's plan involved a lot of suffering. Jesus had other ideas, and was trying to anger God so that God would find someone more worthy to bear all that suffering. In an early chapter, Jesus, in attempt to be found unworthy, was working for the Romans making crosses for crucifixions. He figured that there was no way God would choose as his symbol on earth a cross maker. As we kinow, God had other ideas.Next is my memory of the disciples. According to Kazantzakis, eleven of them were what we, today, would call wimps. The twelfth, however, was cut out of a different cloth. He was a big, strong, red-haired and red-bearded man of great emotional and physical strength. When the time came for Jesus to be betrayed, he called Judas aside from the others and told him that he, Judas, was the only one of the twelve who had the strength of character to take the scorn and abuse that would be heaped upon him for his seeming act of betrayal. Judas argued that he didn't want to betray Jesus to the Romans, but Jesus told him that it had to happen, and that only he, Judas, could be relied on to take the role of betrayer. This, along with Jesus' cross making earlier in his life are certainly at odds with the Story as we know it, but they are part of Kazantzakis' approach which humanizes Jesus.My last memory is of the Final Temptation which came in the form of a vision that came to Jesus after he had been nailed to the cross. I won't describe the vision here. It should be read in Kazantzakis' own words for maximum impact on the reader.In outline form, Kazantzakis' book follows the Gospels but differs significantly in the details. I know that many religious authorities feel that the book is blasphemous, but, for me, the humanization of Jesus and his suffering make his martyrdom much more meaningful.For many of you who have read the novel more recently, it will probably be tempting to correct some of my details. I can only say that the above is how I remember the novel, and that it is those memories which make it such a great novel to me."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazantzakis extrapolates the scant character references from the Bible to give the all the great characters from the \\"greatest story ever told\\" real emotion and personality. Judas is portrayed as Jesus' closest confident. Jesus understands Judas's role is predestined by scripture and encourages him to follow through with his fate. Interestingly, this makes Judas the strongest and most intriguing character among the disciples, while the other disciples are portrayed as simple country bumpkins pulled from their fish nets and farms to pursue earthly glory as ambivalent followers of a charismatic leader. Jesus' inner conflict between a man of flesh and the inspirations of deity is the impetus of the plot. Mary is brought to life as the reluctant mother of an odd social pariah. She doesn't understand what is driving Jesus, and often wishes he could be just like the other men of Nazareth. Kazantzakis presents the story as his endeavor to strengthen and explore his own faith and he does not intend to be heretic or blasphemous as he is sometimes portrayed in reviews. I found his attempt to give real emotion and humane responses to people in a historically trying time to be brilliant. I feel my understanding of the bible and its characters to be greatly improved by his musings."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I consider this to be one of the finest novels I have encountered. If the original was written in Greek and the English translation is this powerful then I can only imagine what the impact would be if I could read this in the original language. As noted, this book has, since its debut in 1960, been on several \\"banned books\\" lists and for good reasons. There are several important issues to bear in mind when reading this book. Kazantzakis (the famed author of \\"Zorba, the Greek\\") is considered a brilliant, penetrating and challenging philosophical novelist. His relationship with Christianity was rocky and very tumultuous and his expressed views constantly got himself in much trouble with the Greek Orthodox Church as well as other Christian expressions.This particular book presents something that mainstream believers could never accept: that of the depiction of a very human Jesus who was filled with doubts, anxieties, often seen wildly searching for direction. Actually, the author knows his Bible very well as more than a few Old Testament prophets showed just such angst as they grew into their roles as God's spokesman. However, for me, by far the most contentious section of this novel appears towards the end when Jesus meets up with Saul (who became Saint Paul). The conceit works well in the book (Paul never really did meet Jesus in the real world) as the Jesus of this section inhabits a parallel world that we are sure never existed. The key to what I believe is Kazanatzakis' (hidden) insight is what Saul says to Jesus. When Jesus objects to what he sees Saul creating (the beginnings of the new religion), in his name, without permission, Saul cuts him off and tells him that he doesn't need him anymore. He has what he needs and this is basically the mythology of the Christ, the Messiah as articulated by Saul. It is a short scene and can be missed but I believe this is what irks the author most about the Christianity he was born into. His contention is that Christianity is really Paulinity and that Jesus would not approve. Certainly a heretical stance but one that is now being examined more seriously. Be sure to hunt down a new book called \\"How Jesus became Christian\\" by Barrie Wilson, PhD. His entire book concerns this point and should be read.As for the writing itself, Kazanatzakis was gifted with such powerful talents of poetry, such an accurate facility with depicting the true human condition. He writes with a ferocious and fierce honesty and is fearless of the outcome of his ideas. One cannot praise his work enough in my view. A thoughtful if unorthodox depiction of the life of Jesus, this has to be at the top of anyone's list of great literature. Don't bother with the filmed version which in my view has not aged well and is a mere shadow of this books power to entertain, disturb and enlighten."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I have read this book several times and learned from it on everyoccasion. It has become my standard gift to any high school orcollege graduate. Here is what I tell them (and you):This is NOT a biography of Jesus Christ. It is about realizing ourpurpose in life, the importance of love, truth, and commitment -- andthe great presence of the Divine in every moment of our lives.Kazantzakis feels: '...our highest obligation, something higher eventhan morality, truth, or beauty: the obligation to transubstantiatethe matter which God entrusted to us, and turn it into spirit.'"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Growing up in my backwoods hometown, I had heard about the film for years but couldn't find a copy because the film was &quot;blasphemous&quot; and all that rubbish. I finally saw the film last year (movie and soundtrack are highly recommended, by the way) and was pleased to discover that it was actually an adaptation of a book.Before I continue, let me say that I'm agnostic and am not a huge fan of Christianity. With that out of the way, I must say that I'm moved both by intellectually stimulating and spiritual material. This book easily fits both bills. Like Kazantzakis says in the introduction, this book is meant to be uplifting and reaffirm one's faith in Christ. I truly feel sorry for all those who have deemed this material garbage without reading it. There is much to be found by anyone with an open mind, Christian or not.What I found most powerful was how I could easily relate to Christ. In my old church, Jesus was a distant figure. Here, I could feel his pain as he fought to resist his temptations. This, to me, is the mark of a great book; when a book can completely suck you into the storyline, the author has done something special.My only complaint (a _very_ minor complaint) is that the book's a hair slow at times. It also might not hurt to have a quick brush-up of Bible history (or at least the time when Jesus was alive) beforehand. However, these are indeed moot points.The bottom line: read this book!

One who, in my opinion, actually fleshed out the Hegelian dialectic--&quot;the unity of opposed parts&quot;. His views and goals were passionate and extreme, yet somewhat antithetical. In my opinion, Nikos Kazantzakis' fate was to write a great piece like &quot;Last Temptation of Christ&quot; because, he himself was termendously torn between the spirit world(s) and the sensual world(s).Kazantakis wrestled with man's (thus his own) search for meaning. NK put out his own &quot;Odyssey: A Modern Sequel&quot; shortly after James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot;--to continue the epic of Homer's Odyssey, but it ended up being extremely long, and somehow glorifying and justifying the plummaging, the violence, the robbery and the homelessness in the characters' quest to find God...HK was a socialist, bent towards communism who loved Jewish women. He was a Nietzshean scholar who later became as passionate about Christian and Buddist tenets. He said he believed everyman should be married, yet stayed at home with his wife no time at all, once you consider 'til death do us part'. He wishes to have a soul as paganistic and fearless as the lustful Zorba, whom he immortalized in letters, yet ends up the man who searches every tome and cuniform for some answers to every snapping twig.Who else could have written an exploratory on what could have been Christ's dreams, his thoughts, the Messiah's last earthly temptation, as it were? In NK's book, Jesus faints on the cross and dreams of his life if he were to lead a earthly life. He marries Magdalen and Martha, becomes a carpenter-farmer who says &quot;I never knew the world was so beautiful, or the flesh so holy&quot;...a truly heretical statement to those who are believers of the written word in the Bible, but it is one from the passionate NK. But the story also goes on to say that Paul of Tarsus appears at Jesus doorstep with news of the arisen Christ, who is to reward all those who believed in him as God-made-man. Jesus tries to repudiate Paul's charge (redeeming sin to all believers) opting to continue with his life with wives, children, work. This is when Jesus wakes up and finds himself on the cross...and Jesus as the Christ &quot;came true&quot;.No one really knew what NK was inferring by the story, (would it be the greater sin to repudiate the pleasures of the common life, of the flesh?) for all we know it could hold some amount of truth to it. I know that most of us would probably have some of these thoughts if we were to become the Christ...that's how we humans think. NK was almost excommunicated by the Greek Orthrodox Church because of it.I feel that it is a greatly told story...the descriptions and the passions will have the reader spellbound...from a greatly passionate man. One who, in my opinion, was destined to write such a work..."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazanzakis portrays a Jesus with whom we can relate. Most people know that the stories from the New Testament, while beautiful and consoling, were written 40 to 60 years after the events described. They are quite selective, adding up to only a few days. And no one thinks Jesus went around addressing himself in the third person or especially that he proclaimed himself &quot;God's son&quot;. The idea of God fathering a human child was a Greek concept and was considered blasphemous by Jews.The book almost shimmers as one is transported back to that ancient age. It is a time machine in every sense of the word and the Jesus we meet here is a normal man with brothers and sisters and a mother. But he is troubled with visions. The realization that something great is afoot comes to him slowly, in flashes, as if a puzzle were slowly being revealed. More than anything this Jesus is a man, not a God. Yet he seems connected to the divine spark and in particular to the God of the Israelites.We view his journeys, his love for Mary, his teachings which seem to emerge almost spontaneously, then that last epic week we know as the Passion. The &quot;last temptation&quot; occurs on the cross in which Jesus is given a vision of the life he might could have. He marries, makes love, fathers children, works as a carpenter and lives happily. But he rejects that vision and suddenly raises his head realizing he is still high in the air, nailed to the cross. He did not flinch from his mission nor did he take the easy way out.Theologically speaking it was condemened as heresy and banned by the Greek Orthodox church. It was not meant as an official biography of &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; (many consider that his last name) but as what might have been. And for that reason it deserves great kudos."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Honestly, this is the most life-changing book about Jesus Christ that I have ever read.It made knowing Him in a whole new way that was, for the first time, completely approachable. Truth be told, the modern Christian Jesus is hardly someone I can relate. It has been difficult to actually be able to see Him as a model for Christian living.The Last Temptation of Christ offers a look at the Christ that is encouraging, gritty, and full-frontal look at how I can be more like him."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"After viewing the movie, I decided to give the book a try and was delighted with what I found. The concept of the novel alone is worth the 5 stars! If Christ was a man, then he would have had temptations and moments of weakness as any other man experiences. Kazantzakis illuminates this aspect of Christ(the human aspect) with an imaginative, fictional storyline. The book is heresy only to those who are closed-minded about Jesus the man; however, if Jesus is the Christ, than I believe he is more spiritual than flesh-like and was not, nor is, a typical man with typical self-doubts. And last but not least, Albert Schweitzer, one of the most God-gifted men ever to live on this planet, was an admirer of the book."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Never has the story of Christ been told so vividly or with such sensitivity as it's told here. In all of the stories I've ever heard about Jesus, he has always seemed too holy, too pure for me to ever relate to. In this book, Kazantzakis portrays Christ as all too human, making his suffering and sacrifice all the more meaningful. This is a weighty book, chock full of symbolism, but is well worth the trouble, even if it's just to remind yourself what Christ was truly about, before all the disciples and churches misinterpreted everything."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The Last Temptation, Nikos Kazantzakis, Faber and Faber, London, 519pp.In this beautifully written novel, Jesus of Nazareth is first presented as a young carpenter who makes crosses to facilitate the Romans' crucifixion of troublesome Zealots, though he is much hindered in this activity by the figure of Judas Iscariot, himself a Zealot, who attempts to deflect his efforts by ruining his handiwork. After one such crucifixion, Jesus departs for a monastery in the desert, but just prior to this is a an episode in which he visits his old childhood sweetheart, Mary Magdalene, who has turned to prostitution because the God-possessed Jesus has been unable to take her as his wife.Judas seeks out Jesus, intending to kill him, but when Jesus announces his intention to take a message to the people and shows no fear of death, Judas relents and decides to accompany him, hoping that his as yet vaguely defined mission will develop into a full-scale rebellion against Rome. Jesus' earliest preaching comes after he has rescued Mary Magdalene from a stoning, and is heavily influenced by a philosophy of love for all. He swiftly gains some rather fallible followers.Judas encourages him to visit John the Baptist who daily proclaims the end of the world and the imminent arrival of the Messiah, believing that John will recognise Jesus for what he is. John's response is ambivalent, but on the whole, he is impressed by Jesus' Messianic credentials and counsels him to seek enlightenment in the desert. Drawing a circle in the sand there, Jesus refuses to emerge from it until he hears God's voice. He is visited by various temptations in different forms, but returns to his disciples with a more savage message: that of the axe. On his return journey, he enjoys the hospitality of two unmarried sisters, Mary and Martha, who later play a major part in the novel's conclusion.He takes his new philosophy to Jerusalem where he of course angers the Scribes and Pharisees by his alleged blasphemies and criticisms of the Mosaic Law. He heals the paralysed daughter of the Roman centurion, Rufus, and in the vicinity of Bethany raises Lazarus, brother of Martha and Mary, from the grave. The corpse-like Lazarus, however, is only partially restored to life and emits a disgusting smell which repels those around him. He is eventually murdered in a particularly gruesome manner by another Zealot, Barabbas. Jesus convinces Judas to betray him and his own crucifixion swiftly follows.However, on the cross, between his anguished cry of \`ELI, ELI' and its conclusion \`LAMA SABACHTHANI', Jesus is again visited by a dream. His guardian angel, who later takes the form of a Negro boy, rescues him and brings Magdalene as his bride. Before her proposed marriage to Jesus, however, she is murdered by companions of the Apostle Paul in his former incarnation as Saul. Jesus eventually enters the household of Martha and Mary, effectively taking them both as wives. He again works as a carpenter and fathers many children, until one day, he encounters Paul (after his \`Road-to-Damascus' experience) preaching the Risen Christ. A violent quarrel ensues with the result that Paul feels he can now discard a historical Jesus completely, in his own quest to set the world alight with a new and supernatural gospel. Jesus is much disturbed, but returns to his tranquil earthly life.Old age descends on him and, at the Fall of Jerusalem, he re-encounters his disciples as decrepit old men. Only Judas retains something of his former vigour. Jesus' complacency is finally shattered by Judas' accusation that he has been a \`Coward! Deserter! Traitor!', hiding himself in the life of an ordinary man, when his destiny clearly called for his sacrificial death. The other disciples appear as pitiable weaklings whose lives have been wasted because they invested their faith in Jesus the failed Saviour. Conscience stricken and broken, Jesus briefly experiences their anguish, but soon finds himself back on the Cross, the previous scenes all having been illusions representing his final and most severe temptation. He can now complete his death-cry as one who has been faithful to the bitter end. In a sense, then, in his end is his beginning.The weakness of this novel, however, lies in its too-radical revision of the original Biblical narrative. Apart from the Temptation in the Wilderness scenes (e.g. Mt. Ch. 4) and the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (e.g. Lk. 22:44), there is very little in the Gospels to justify Kazantzakis' characterisation of Jesus as a figure even in conflict with himself and his mission, let alone as a tortured or morbid loner whose message to the world only dawns on him slowly and painfully by degrees. Kazantzakis finds it necessary to recreate by violence Jesus' so-called \`hard' parables and to foist on them new endings more in line with his own preconceptions. Many of the miracle stories attached to the authentic life of Jesus are subsumed by Kazantzakis into the dreams of his characters: Mary the mother of Jesus is visited by the \`Magi' in this way, and similarly, Jesus and Peter walk on water only in Peter's mind, and subsequently in Matthew the tax-collector's highly dramatised \`gospel'.There is a major weakness in the author's characterisation of Judas; at first he is wholly resistant to the message of love and sees the role of the Messiah in very clear, if predictable, political terms. It is therefore to be expected that when Jesus reveals to him that the Saviour is Isaiah's \`Suffering Servant' and must be crucified, Judas would reject this philosophy just as violently. Yet he succumbs to Jesus' will with surprisingly little resistance. Indeed, few of Kazantzakis' characters are convincing as Jews, but come across as barely disguised Greek peasants, shrewd, worldly and cynical. In short, Kazantzakis has turned Jesus and his world into that of a struggling Nietzschean superman, almost wholly of his own making.Dr. Kenneth D. Farrow(...)"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazantzakis explores the humanity of Christ and really focuses on how difficult human life must have been for Jesus. The story of Christ becomes even more beautiful when one realizes how difficult the temptation of sin must have been on him. This is an incredible story...but I had immense difficulty reading this book.Kazantzakis wrote this story in Greek, and maybe the problem is in the translation. The Greek, I assume, probably flows with ease and is easy to read. The english translation is choppy, and problematic. I really found Kazantzakis' style to be very uneven, very choppy, and very tedius. Once again, I believe the problem is within the translation.When a new translation comes out, I will be the first to buy it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"and little by little, you no longer hear the words, just lulling music, monotonous and sad - and then gently, you fall asleep- like disciples listening to jesus. The book is powerful, it is very lonely and sad being God, and very lonely and sad being man, too. The language is repetitive and simple, like scripture. The character of Jesus is unique here, the author takes some chances, has... I wouldn't say fun. But plays. And does so in a loving way, with effort, sometimes more inspired than other times. And he questions the whole scribal process of Matthew, too, with the archangel making him write things that he does not witness, like the virgin birth in Bethlehem and the adoration of the magi which just fulfill prophecies. God's truth and man's are not the same. gasp.The actual \\"last temptation\\" stuff where Jesus goes and starts the family with martha and mary I found very weak, almost disappointed the entire book, very flashy and gawdy and overwritten and false, not false because it didn't happen or doesn't correspond with scriptures but false in the writing, false in spirit.Some parts bring tears to my eyes. Judas is deep. His character emerges so strongly. Chapter 12, the making of wine followed by the persecution of Mary Mag and Jesus saving her, is one of the best chapters I have read in any book anywhere.Some emergences of 'biblical characters' are weak, such as Saul/Paul, and I think more could have been done with Pilate. I liked the portrayal of Peter, my favorite saint, his weakness, his fleshiness, his sometime joy, his earnestness, his effort, his failure. He reminds me of a painting by Carravagio of the three denials of St. Peter, this old man pathetic really, denying he knows the man.And jesus is fierce. And there is the transformation that the desert has on him, from lover to lion. This is true imagination, this is what imaginations are made for."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The reason I gave it four instead of five is that it is misogynistic in it's treatment of women's role in world history - as really nothing but tempters, although in the movie, I think Martin Scorsese tempers that verdict by showing that Mary Magdalene supports Jesus' and God's plan to show humans what they are really worth - she is shown as his Soul Mate (not so in the book). I saw the movie when it first came out and recently watched it again and decided I had to read the book. I usually don't go backwards like that, but I'm glad I did. The writing is superb, but I've heard Greece is a very paternalistic society that puts women second, so that slant doesn't surprise me. If that wasn't the case, I'd give the book five stars. I definitely give the movie a thumbs up. They're food for thought, anyway.The iconoclastic part of this book (that I love) is that it gives Jesus free will - and why shouldn't Jesus have something we all have, and why shouldn't we all have what Jesus had: a direct connection to God (\\"are ye not gods,\\" Jesus asked IN THE BIBLE of the infant creators who were trying to crucify him)."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I must confess that although I had not seen the \\"controversial\\" movie, I had had preconceptions based on the reputations of the movie prior to reading this book. Boy, I think this book is very passionate and respectable toward the Gospel, and frankly there is nothing \\"controversial\\" in my opinion. If nothing else, it shows the perfect Son of Man side of the duality, and unlike rather the sado-masochistic movie \\"Passion of Christ\\", this book should bring the readers closer to the understanding of and participation in the mental sufferings of Jesus Christ. A very good read."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"After I saw the Movie I had to read the book, The book helped me understand the movie alot better. The book has regained my interest in Jesus Christ, Kazantzakis' portrayal of Jesus helps the reader to better identify with Christ's sufferings and Temptations. I recommend this book to any person who has an open mind."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazantzakis is well-known for his Zorba the Greek novel, but Last Temptation is a mirror to Kazantzakis himself. Throughout his &quot;tortured life&quot; Kazantzakis strived to discover what it means to be human. The imagery in Last Temptation is superb, as is the very heretical dipiction of Christ."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Reading the english translation of the book, I found that it wasn't as intense as it was in the original Greek language. Despite that, Kazantzakis is at his best and the book is splendid. At the end, it left me the feeling of katharsis and completeness. Worth every minute of reading it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"If there ever were a book that is so emotionally intense and powerful, and shows the author struggling between his own idea of spirituality and the flesh, it is this novel. In understanding the triumphs and struggles of Jesus, we understand that man can overcome his failings to realise himself as something greater"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"To think, that the critics have called this blasphemy? This book is ground-breaking both in its perspective and psychological analysis of the figure that is Christ. Be sure to read the preface, written by Kazantzakis...it's very moving."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"As a long time student of the Bible I found that this book helped me to vividly imagine what it might really have been like for Jesus to be both human and divine. When one of the New Testament writers pens that Jesus was &quot;in every way tempted as we are,&quot; it really doesn't have the same impact as when Kazantzakis puts into words and images the exact things that Jesus might been tempted towards. I imagine the lure of a &quot;normal&quot; life with a business, a wife and children must have seemed very appealing to Jesus when compared with the road that he eventually took. Of course, conservative Christians may be scandalized at the suggestion that Jesus had sexual feelings towards the women in his life (By the way, unlike the movie version, this topic is dealt with quite gently by the author.) But if the New Testament is correct in saying that Jesus was tempted as we are, then there doesn't seem to be any plausible way to deny this facet of his humanity. With the help of Kazantzakis, I was able to imagine the enormous temptations that he was faced with, and I find that I respect the strength of his character and convictions all the more.I highly recommend this book for all students of Jesus who are willing to take a fresh look at him in all his humanity and divinity."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Maybe it's just me, but any time I get to think during thecourse of my reading, it is a satisfying treat. Perhapsthat is why I love this book so much. It deals with a verycontroversial issue that really none of us have the answerto: the life of Jesus Christ. Because no one knows theactual story, we may decide for ourselves what we chooseto believe. Kazantzakis contradicts the Bible in hisportrayal of Jesus as a despised and often disturbed soul.Instead of Jesus living the life of a king, he is forced tosuffer with pain inflicted by God, and evil spirits heencounters. The most controversial aspect, however, may notbe Jesus' life, or his affair with Mary Magdalene. It lieswithin his betrayal and the forcing of Judas to betray him.This fact does not incriminate Judas &quot;the betrayer&quot; such asthe Bible does, but it portrays Judas as a loyal friend toJesus. Though many say that this novel is simple filth,there is a reason so many read it. They are interested onwidening their horizons to different thoughts and aspects,and The Last Temptation of Christ is the perfect novel for it."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"As a person who studies the New Testament very often and in great depth I can wholeheartedly say to all those who are seeking for the historical Jesus that this is definitely not him. Yet I can also say that those who wrote the New Testament would have fully endorsed the spirit of this great book. With a vividness of imagery and harsh truth Nikos Kazantzakis paints the story of a man that could be God if only he had courage enough. This Jesus embodies the hope and salvation of mankind in an entirely novel way, in his weakness, fear, and doubt. the poetry of language in english is beatiful, I imagine in the original Greek it is breathtaking. It's a true shame that many Christians object so strenuously to this book for I'm certain that the more devoutly Christian one is the more he or she will feel the emotional impact of this book.To be as succinct as possible; this book is beautiful, brilliant, and inspired. It contains the depth of passion that truly befits the love that so many people hold for Jesus."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Banned by the Catholic church, excommunicated by the Greek Orthodox and labelled as 'blasphemous filth' is unusual praise for perhaps the most important book of the 20th Century and it's author. Very rarely is a book so lovingly constructed by the author, Nikos Kazantzakis doesn't just transport the reader back in time to follow Christ on his journey, but allows us to enter his own mind, and follow his own spiritual and mental voyage. Never before has a book left me breathless after the introduction alone, however, by the time this book has passed you by, you will either want to read it again, or it has already changed your life forever. The wonderful depiction of Christ is possibly the most accurate that there has ever been, ever will be, he is a man, a man who finds God, not a God who finds man. I pronounced this the most important book of the 20th century, and in a society as ruthless as today, man needs to think once in a while about the issues here; God, life, the spirit, himself. I have found no better source of information and reference for my own life and I can guarantee that you will be prompted to write your own review once you have finally put the book to one side."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"...arguably one of the most powerful novels I've ever read. Kazantzakis effectively explores the struggle between divinity and secularism...a struggle every human being faces at some point in life. I've read it several times...and it only gets better every time!"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I am Jewish, and so I have never been taught anything about Jesus. I'm a huge fan of Scorsese's and saw his film and had mixed feelings on it, but then I thought, 'well, one day I must read the book.' I wanted to understand Christianity without having to read the Bible. I wanted to know about Jesus and his spiritual legacy without having to be bogged down with doctrine. I simply had no desire for conversion. That being said, I must say that reading this book gave me a great respect for the Christian religion, and what I mean by that is that I've always respected all peoples and their beliefs but was simply ignorant about the most important figure of our time... Jesus Christ.So, now, about the book. The writing is pure poetry, the description of the earth, sea, air, animals and everything natural comes alive in a spirit that envelopes the Son of Mary. The narration is in third-person and is almost exclusively from Jesus's perspective, and so we are privy to the spirituality he sees in every living thing... ants, sunflowers, earth, moon, desert. To him, the face of God is revealed in all of these. He sees man, and he can't help but feel compassion. He is human, he is fearful, he is chosen, and he wants to bat God away. But he can't.One must imagine what it'd be like to be chosen as he was, and not in the sense in which your average schizophrenic believes that he is the One, but in the sense of what the story is really about, God manifested into a man... with fears and with temptations. Until the very end, Jesus wishes his destiny away, wishes himself to be human. And being human has never seemed as such a blessing until we realize what the consequences of being the Messiah is. The flesh must be crucified, the blood must be drawn, the lamb must be slaughtered... the final lamb, Jesus, will save mankind. What a concept! And he knows it, and he loves man as much as he is frustrated with man and as much as he sees his sins, because he has faced those sins inside himself and he has transcended them. And he will die for them. Pure beauty; pure sacrifice; truly marvelous.Much of the novel almost reads like one of those serial magazine stories; the plot is so thick, and the story is so down-to-earth, that I just felt like 'wow, I wonder what will happen next.' There's the Mary Magdalene love interest. There's the antagonists: Zebedee, Pontious, the Scribes and Sanhedrin, the naysayers, and at some points, even Judas and the rest of the disciples' loyalty is doubtful (ironically, Judas happens to be his most loyal disciple). And then-- last-- we have the nagging, impetuous \\"Smallville\\" frustrations, and wonder, 'when is Jesus going to realize his powers, perform miracles, and be worshiped as God by everyone already?'. We can't help but chuckle when everyone spits in his face at the beginning and don't understand his true calling.This novel opened a spiritual void in me. It is what many of the other reviewers had said this book to be: through Jesus's struggle of choosing between divinity and human frailty, and through his triumph of resisting the temptation for less glorious earthly pursuits and instead choosing to be crucified for man's salvation and God's purpose (which in essence is his purpose... and our purpose), we touch upon our own struggle between nobility and cowardice. The right path is always difficult and frightening and to some extent a sacrifice, and, hopefully, if we lead our lives right, and have the courage to follow our true calling, we shall also follow the same difficult path and also experience a triumph which will lead to a greater good. Not a triumph that will impact the entire world and bring the promise of human salvation that Jesus is known for, but a triumph that should, at the least, lead us to a personal sense of peace, spirituality, and purpose. Did I mention this is beautiful?"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Kazantzakis created a whirlwind with this wonderful portrayal of Christ. I can now see why Scorsese made the movie - the book is better! Anyone else who likes this will love Richard Patton's &quot;The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years&quot;. Somehow I don't even think Scorsese would dare produce THAT movie though! Kazantzakis writes passionately and carries you along as few authors can. It is so refreshing to find a book about Jesus that has come from a passionate heart rather than re-worked dusty manuscripts. Very gripping!"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Forget the movie...Scorsese left out the balance and meat of this story. He seemed to be going more for controversy than for an actual bringing to life of this book.The writing here is absolutely incredible. There's a proper blendung of realism and surrealism. I always thought that Jesus and the apostles would have been more human. They certainly are here. The book-long tortured, loving relationship between Judas &amp; Jesus is one of the most powerful presented in the history of literature.The book didn't have its first misstep until at least 300 pages in. That misstep didn't last longer than a page. I did find the actual Last Temptation, as presented in the book, to be too wildly fantastic to be believable. It's easy to forgive that; this is a work of fiction. Released in the middle of the 20th century, this book remains timeless. No single book has done more to make me want to read more on this subject.I did have one problem with the book. It does perpetuate the myth that Mary Magdalene was a whore. She wasn't, as almost all Binle historians will attest. She was politically &amp; religiously outspoken. That has earned her two thousand years of character crucifixion. That said, The Last Temptation Of Christ is easily one of the fuve best books I have ever read. Very powerful."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I read THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST for the first time when I was twenty. I read it again in my thirties, and now again in my forties. I have experienced new adventures each journey.A treatise on Christian theology it is not. The author is quite clear on that matter in the preface. Although not about theology per se, it is prosaic theology for the soul; for anyone who has struggled; for those who know suffering, or have seen trouble and pain. Kazantzakis offers great words of nourishment for such readers. He takes the compelling story of the Christian tradition and weaves its relevance into every human's story.The narrator asks at one point: Can the word give nourishment? The rhetorical question is answered as mandate for the author as well as guide for the reader. &quot;Yes it can --- when it is the good word!&quot; Kazantzakis poses perplexing problems and questions which can only be addressed by good words. This novel abounds in goodness against the backdrop of the complexities of each person's own story. It is a worthwhile reading journey."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"The last temptation... Yes, it was the last temptation. Christ, as all of us, had a choice. He could turn left or he could turn right. When he makes his choice what happens to us? How does it affect us and how does it affect our future? Was he right when he made his choice? How difficult was it to make the choice? What did he feel? What was the temptation?All these questions and many more I asked myself for years. I have to make choices every day. How difficult is it for me? Am I right making my choices? What are my temptations? Can I answer all that?Nikos Kazantzakis selected a very difficult field when he chose to answer all these questions. How can you? But he did give us a great version of the possible answers. The book is full of knowledge, ideas and imagination, not counting one of the best writings ever created. My thumbs are up. I loved it and so would you."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"At sixteen I thought this book was a mind-opener and now at thirty i've come full circle to the same impression. I chose to live the normal life of a good man just as Jesus dreams of doing in this story and even I wonder, could I have been greater? Could I have contributed more if i'd suffered for others and sacrificed or did I take a cowards route? That's the central philosophy and universal appeal of this work. It's the argument that humanizes the biblical Jesus and elevates His sacrifices. Nikos Kazantzakis shouldn't have been excommunicated from the church as this book is in reality a love letter to his faith."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"As great as the film was the book is even better. It shows Jesus' human side and his struggle between following God's will and his own. One of the things I like most about this book is how it explores the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Judas is far from the lowly betrayer of Christ. Any book that is banned by the &quot;Holy&quot; Roman Catholic Church is a must read and this is no exception."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"That Jesus Christ wanted to just be human, rather than The Son of God,proved very interesting reading. I loved the book, A re-writing of the New Testament."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"Exceeded my expectations Content was everything I had hoped for would recommend to friends and relatives arrived timely and in good condition as requested"},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"This moving book renders Christ in vivid, unforgettable colors; such colors as have never been seen before and probably never will be again. In the process, it tells us something about our humanity, and about our indomitable spiritual longings.Christ is important to us in part because he was human. His humanity is what moves us, and we take comfort in his image because we find his humanity comprehensible.His humanity, however, is disturbing to some people. Perhaps this is why the Christian church has worked so hard to promote the idea of the Trinity. Christ is not just a man, we are told, he is simultaneously man, God and the Holy Spirit.Those who see Christ as infallible, as essentially God-like, will no doubt find this book disturbing. Kazantzakis's Christ is very human. He is full of distinctly human frailties.The book's depiction of a flawed human in the midst of a titanic spiritual struggle is moving, profound, and revelatory. It tells us much about the human spirit, about our longings for spiritual liberation, and the frustrations that many encounter when they walk a spiritual path.This book is a testament to the greatness of the human spirit. Yet at times, I find a touch of life-denial in it. Christ turns away from friends, family, and even his own best and kindest instincts as he reaches toward his goal. That part of this great book did not always sit well with me, yet I cannot deny that in this one area, at least, Kazantzakis has ample Biblical sources to back up his interpretation.For all its greatness, this is, however, a peculiar book. I call it peculiar in part because it vividly depicts the life of Christ in a manner that is neither historically accurate nor always true to our Biblical sources. It takes place not in Biblical times, but in a dream-like landscape that is vaguely reminiscent of rural Greece in the 19th century. Some of the opening scenes, for instance, take place in something that seems very much like an Eastern Orthodox Christian monastery, only there could not have been a Christian monastery before Christ's crucifixion, and certainly there is no mention of one in the Gospels. My point is not that something like a monastery could not have existed in Biblical times, but that the monastery in this book is distinctly Christian in flavor, which makes it, at best, an anachronism.It sounds as though I am criticizing Kazantzakis's book, but I am not. His instincts as a novelist never fail him. He makes all the right decisions, and the landscape and the characters he creates come vividly alive. Never before has Christ been as real, or his struggles so clear, as when I read this book.I believe that all Christians, and many who are interested in the Christ story, will find this an essential book. One needs, however, to approach it in the right spirit. To say that is unorthodox is a gross understatement. It is a radically experimental book, both from an artistic and a theological perspective. Nevertheless, it not only succeeds, but ends up telling us something rare and precious about both our own humanity, and our religion."},{"Title":"The last temptation of Christ","review":"I decided to read \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" because one of the reviews of \\"The gospel According to Jesus Christ\\" by Jose Saramago suggested Kazantzakis did it better. (Both books, of course, have been translated into English for us uneducated Americanos.)While I find Saramago's lack of punctuation and rambling prose strangely fascinating, I failed to appreciate the Greek nuances of Kazantzakis.The main characters of both books were mere rats caught in a trap, but I found the intimate portrayal of Saramago to be more thought provoking and my first choice, if I had time to read only one of the books.However, if you have the time, read both, then the four certified gospels, and even the alleged Pauline texts, to be fair, and then compare them all.Both authors offer an interesting point of view, although I would consider the Saramago novel to be better paced.

You can guess something that's going to happen many, many pages before it will, and it's not only because the basic story is known to everyone - Kazantzakis takes his time and moves very slow; although very emotional, his writing style is not at all intense.

Then, this is the teddy for you!The last pages of the book are patterns for all the teddies that you can xerox or trace to form your own thin cardboard templates. I agree with the suggestion to use the carton of cereal boxes to make your template patterns. It is easy to hold down in place while outlining on material and flexible enough not to crease easily.The suggested materials to make teddies are available in fabric stores or from the list of suppliers in the index.I also agree with the suggestion for hand sewers to use strong thread, such as button hole thread. I do the same in hand sewing doll bodies.There is a very useful section at the front of the book called \\"Guide to Techniques\\" that shows with text and photos just how to cut out and sew, assemble your teddy, and make the finishing touches such as eyes and nose.I have to admit from the point of uniqueness I like the Grizzly Bear the best. It is just adorable and one of the easier teddy bears to make.I think once you begin making these teddy bears in you will be forever hooked on making teddies for all the little girls and boys in your life.My highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"The Teddy Bear Making Book","review":"This book is very inspirational.

As an example, he mentions how the European Community (EC) is a trading block that consists in a protectionist fortress that hinders free trade with trading partners outside the EC.The advent of the EC, and the growing trade U.S. deficit has lead government officials to respond by developing a large trading block of its own to compete with the EC. This entails an expansion of NAFTA to eventually include all Central and South American countries.The author states that such a U.S. trade policy is misguided on several counts, because:First, the U.S. already accounts for over 40% of trade with the Americas. This share is far higher than either Japan or the EC share with the Americas. Thus, the U.S. has nothing to gain from spending much energy on expanding NAFTA; it already has achieved the end goal of being by far the dominant trading partner within this region.Second, the trade volume with Central and South America is minuscule compared to U.S. trade with Asia.Third, it is triggering a response in kind from both Japan and China who are now both working on developing and expanding a large and competing Asian trading block. The U.S. would loose a lot more market share of World Trade by this development (Asian trading block), than it would by expanding NAFTA. The author states that the impetus of developing an Asian trading block is a direct reaction to the U.S. effort in expanding NAFTA.Instead, the author suggests that the U.S. trade policy should be redirected along the following lines:First, the U.S. should abandon its pursuit of forming protectionist trading blocks.Second, it should promote free trade by giving its full support to the current round of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is a far better option to promote free trade then working on bilateral free trade agreements (FTA) that are really protectionist in nature towards all trading partners excluded from the FTAs.Third, it should reduce or eliminate the tariffs it imposed on steel and textile. These domestic industries do not need to be protected anymore.Fourth, the U.S. should reduce its volume of agricultural subsidies. By doing so, it will be in a position to pressure the EC, and specifically France, to reduce its own huge agricultural subsidies.The author maintains that the U.S. misguided trade policy emanates from a misperception from the public and Congress regarding the U.S. trade performance. The perception is that U.S. is performing poorly in international trade as it incurs large trade deficits, and is getting routinely beaten by Japan, China, and the EC who routinely achieve large trade surpluses, especially with the U.S. This view is based on an outdated Mercantilist perspective that states that exports and trade surpluses are good and imports and trade deficits are bad. Nothing could be further from the truth. What really matters is the productivity of the labor force which is the engine behind a country's economic growth and rising living standard. Focusing on these more meaningful economic metrics (labor productivity, living standards, economic growth), the U.S. has beaten the socks out of its major trading partners, specifically Japan and the EC.The author brings two other interesting points. The first one is that the U.S. share of World trade has remained remarkably steady at around 12% to 13% over the past century. This negates the perception that the U.S. performance in international trade is weaker now than it used to. It clearly is not. The other point is that the U.S. trade mix is almost evenly distributed between the EC, Asia, and North America (Canada and Mexico). In other words, the U.S. has the most diversified and optimal mix of trading partners. As mentioned above, its pursuit of expanding trading blocks with the Americas will cause the U.S. to be increasingly locked out of trades with the other two major regions (Asia and EC). This would cause a decline in the U.S. diversification of trading partners. This is clearly not a favorable development as demonstrated by the author.In conclusion, this book is one of the most eloquent defense of true free trade. It can also be viewed as an equally eloquent attack on the formation of trading blocks including NAFTA, and the EC."},{"Title":"Krishnamurti's Notebook","review":"There are many collections of J. Krishnamurti's writings, which actually come from his talks prepared for various audiences, and most of them are extremely good and enlightening.However, this, his notebook, is a more direct view of his thoughts, being written down during one of his travels in a notebook. These are personal revelations, written for his own purposes, and as such are quite instructive.We do once again encounter many of his concepts as revealed in his lectures, but here they are presented in a different context, as in a personal journal. We get beautiful descriptions of his surroundings. These musings are written in the third person in that he refers to himself as \\"one\\" rather than \\"I\\".This book will undoubtedly be of more value to those already familiar with his writings and with his talks than to those who haven't yet become acquainted with them. It is a more direct glimpse into his thinking.Very highly recommended to the spiritually inclined."},{"Title":"Krishnamurti's Notebook","review":"Possibly the most important document produced in the 20th Century, and now thankfully back in print. Just as radical as Jesus's reply to the rich young man who desired eternal life (Matthew 19:16-26), and just as true and uncompromising, and expressed in a manner that contains no dogma, and requires no belief. (One needs to come to this book with an entirely receptive mind.) It is like an extended expression of the Beatitudes in modern language. What is called the\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" in the Bible is referred to variously byKrishnamurti in the notebook as the \\"benediction\\", the \\"otherness\\", and \\"immensity\\". An extraordinary book. Beautifully written. A treasure for the ages."},{"Title":"Krishnamurti's Notebook","review":"A close friend has been speaking about Krishnamurti to me for years.

Taking entry by entry ever so slowly, I began...just began to \\"see\\" that true wisdom and learning can be the saving Grace if one will just take the time to watch, observe, listen, touch, and smell all that is alive and still thriving around each and every one of us. The Notebook sits atop my night-table, and after I say my prayers (I know this sounds ridiculously childish but I don't care...), I reward myself with another journal entry from Krishnamurti.

I suggest that this is due not only to the chronological order in which his observations flow here, but also to the fact that he is writing rather than speaking to an audience or in conversation with others. His observations appear to be =considered= in light of those that preceded them. And that, at least for one familiar with Krishnamurti, may make those observations more meaningful.Several themes are followed and returned to: Love (something altogether different from what most readers conceive it to be; here it is the \\"choiceless acceptance of what is\\"), creation and destruction as useful and natural circumstances in the pursuit of awareness of what really is, denial... of what the current-day mindfulness crowd calls \\"verbal representations\\" (the words really =do= get in the way), humility, meditation (what it is and isn't, including methodical, procedural and/or rule-bound), death (again in a very different frame of reference vs. that to which most of us are accustomed), intelligence, fear, power, loneliness vs. aloneness, experience, negation (of what isn't and/or our thinking about what is), and (pseudo-) security.One gets the impression that his journal entries are emanating from the fresh, direct, sensory experience of what =is= around him each day. His descriptions probably =will= fall on the deaf ears and blind eyes of those who \\"see\\" and \\"hear\\" through spoken or written words. But they are likely to make startling sense to those who have re-acquired their innocent inner child's capacity for the wonder stolen from us as actual children in a world requiring well-trained labor, consumption and soldiering. As elsewhere, Krishnamurti takes no issue with the world's requirements; he's sufficiently dialectical himself to understand why things are the way they are, and =must= be. But he can see through the \\"game piece\\" and \\"game player\\" levels of consciousness quite as though he were simply a mildly interested passerby. Such awareness, of course, provides the observer with choices the pieces and players cannot possibly have.Like others, I would recommend some familiarity with the Brahman point of view before tackling a book like this. And even then, one will have to tolerate Krishnamurti's use of words in ways that seem diametrically opposed to how others have used them. Those who can grasp what he is describing and reporting will not, however, get stuck in that.His was truly one of the great, reality-aware, \\"conscious,\\" =simple= minds of the second millennium AD, and this, along with his =Freedom from the Known= and =Total Freedom=, may be one of his most essential, transcendent and transforming works."},{"Title":"Krishnamurti's Notebook","review":"Great book.

It is a wonderful book for those who have never read any of his work."},{"Title":"Krishnamurti's Notebook","review":"Krishnamurti's teachings hinge on the mystical experiences he underwent as a youth. K underwent \\"initiations\\" when he was young, and he experienced an ongoing \\"process\\" throughout the rest of his life. Those experiences are the key to his teachings. Without the key, the \\"pathless land\\" remains uninhabited. I don't think K comprehended the significance of those experiences, although they certainly altered his consciousness and were the basis of his spiritual life. To K, there was an \\"other\\" that was the source of his insights. References to the \\"other\\" can be found throughout his Notebook. This is a clue whose significance is elucidated in reference to his youthful out-of-body experiences with the Lord Maitreya.___Krishnamurti did not derive his \\"teaching\\" from reading his own books (or the books of others). Nor did he derive it from watching his own videos (or watching others). K was not born with it. In fact, according to the testimony of some, K was a rather moronic child with \\"a vacant mind.\\" So where did his \\"teaching\\" come from? He certainly didn't teach the Theosophy in which he was raised.K underwent occult experiences as a youth in India, culminating in experiences he underwent in California. The occult \\"process\\" that had begun in him then continued throughout his life and served as a continual inspiration to him. Without those foundational experiences, K would have had nothing of his own to teach. But those foundational experiences remain unexamined and unexplained, even by K himself. This is why I regard K's \\"teaching\\" as \\"testimony,\\" because as long as the basis of it remains a mystery he is really only testifying to its results rather than \\"teaching\\" it. If people could achieve those same foundational experiences by reading his books or watching his videos, then those books and videos would in fact constitute a teaching.Consider Copernicus. If a man asked Copernicus to teach him about the orbits of the planets, Copernicus would refer to a process of scientific observation and mathematics. The teaching of Copernicus would reside in the scientific process of observation and in mathematics, not in merely a conversational approach to the subject. If he merely stated that the Earth rotates around the Sun, his mere statement of the fact would not in itself constitute \\"proof\\" or even a \\"teaching\\" but merely his own simple testimony which would bear no greater weight (perhaps less weight) than the prevailing belief of the Church.Now consider Krishnamurti. He \\"taught\\" using ordinary conversational English. He did not use a specialized language (like mathematics) but instead confined himself to ordinary language with which he addressed ordinary people. The use of ordinary conversational language, in itself, can pose innumerable problems for accurately communicating on a subject as subtle as consciousness. For instance, what one person means by any given word (such as \\"awareness\\") is not necessarily what another person means by the word. (Krishnamurti was never very systematic or methodical with his use of words.) In addition to this, rather than employing the scientific method, K denounced the application of \\"method\\" and instead advocated \\"choiceless awareness.\\" Specifically what \\"choiceless awareness\\" means is utterly subjective and dependent on whom you ask at any given time.In the absence of applying the scientific method, it is likely that you will merely presume that you are \\"choicelessly aware.\\" The absence of the scientific method typically implies the presence of mistaken assumptions.K spent decades traveling the world to reach millions of ordinary people through his talks, books and videos. Did the millions of ordinary people who studied his \\"teaching\\" fail to understand it because of faults of their own, or was their lack of understanding the fault of K's \\"teaching\\"? After more than fifty years, if the millions of students of K's \\"teaching\\" failed to understand it, then what's the point of the teaching? Is it comparable to trying to teach calculus to a little child? That would be the fault of the teacher, not the student. But K's \\"teaching\\" is not a science, and so the question of why so many people failed to transform remains as unanswerable as the question of what it means to be \\"choicelessly aware.\\" It remains as much a mystery as the means by which K himself arrived at his spiritual experience.When Einstein published his Theory of Relativity, there were relatively few people who were in a position to grasp it. Those few people were not special or lucky, they simply had the background (the science and mathematics required) to get it. It's a matter of science, not a matter of getting lucky. With K's \\"teaching,\\" however, understanding is a matter of \\"getting lucky,\\" as he himself admits.If learning a subject is a matter of luck, like winning at roulette, then I'd say the subject is not susceptible to being taught because to me teaching does not amount to a recommendation to get lucky. You can't teach how to get lucky.I regard Krishnamurti's collected works as brilliant testimony but not a teaching. There is no doubt in my mind that K was an extraordinary human being and that he possessed an extraordinary experience. What he talked about, and what he wrote about, constitutes a testimony. It can inspire. And it can also confuse. Without the scientific method, the likely result is in fact confusion and the absence of consistent results."},{"Title":"Krishnamurti's Notebook","review":"maybe I missed the boat on this one, but kept wondering 'where's the beef' in this book. nothing profound here other than a bunch of strange headaches."},{"Title":"Tightrope Poppy the High-Wire Pig","review":"With a clever rhyme scheme and beautiful illustrations, Poppy became an instant star at our house.

I was interested in buying it when I saw that it was set in the Scottish Highlands, which is my favorite story setting. I took a chance...and was not disappointed. Ms. Wilhelm has an extraordinary talent for storytelling, her stories flow quickly and easily and her detailed descriptions of everything from the setting to the characters' emotions really allow you to get caught up in the story. The 2 lead characters are both strong, brave, honorable and currently in trouble. Hero was once wealthy, until her mother remarried. Now she finds herself lost and alone in the wild higlands of Scotland searching for her aunt after having escaped the poverty of London, not to mention a pair of lecherous hands. She meets up with Ciaran, who is escaping a band of blood thirsty Highlanders bent on seeing him die. Their paths cross. Hero asks for his help in searching for her elusive aunt and Ciaran finds he must help her for fear that she goes about it alone - again. In the process of Ciaran's helping Hero find her aunt, they find themselves falling in love with each other. Ciaran does not want this to happen as he feels his days are numbered with the MacDubhair clan's slaughtering his whole clan and him being the sole survivor and hunted by them. Once Hero gets past her initial fears she decides she wants him. To keep. So when Ciaran does the heart-breakingly noble thing by not touching her and leaving her behind so he can go off and basically get himself killed - she does not allow it.I won't tell you any more of the story but its a definite must read. The emotions the characters feel are very clearly described throughout."},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"Hero Fraser is a noblewoman in distress. Ciaran MacLoarn, is a highlander in shining kilt. When Hero's mother marries a man who gambles away the family fortune, Hero makes a desperate bid for freedom by fleeing to the Scottish Highlands and the home of her Aunt Elspeth. When her Scottish guide abandons her on the road, she is taken in by wanted criminal Ciaran MacLoarn, and his sidekick Finlay.I wanted to like Highland Jewel, but I felt the plot was unoriginal and the story seemed uneven. At points it seemed that it was a comedy. At other points it aspired to be a serious historical. It turned out to be a rather goofy blend of both. While I liked the character of Ciaran, I found Hero to be unbelievable. She was alternatively blissfully naive, and other times she is portrayed as being street savvy. Which is it?I DID like Ciarin as a character. He was well written, but I felt the other characters were too...Hmmm....Unrealistic.About the time dear Aunt Elspeth was justifying the mother's abandonment of Hero, as saying her mother thought Hero could fend for herself, destitute on the streets of London -grr- I was ready to throw this book across the room. Hero's mother was cruel to abandon Hero. Aunt Elspeth's justification was supposed to seem wise and 'all knowing' struck me as contrived. Also, I hated how all of the MacLoarn women who were forced to marry against their will, refused to leave their husbands. It just seemed so trite and convenient and made the whole MacLoarn vs. MacDubhair conflict seem silly rather than serious.While this novel starts off with a bang, it quickly became light stereotypical romantic fluff. I've read better, and certainly Wilhelm has written it."},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"Highland Jewel was a pageturner from start to finish.Ciaran is not your regular male hero because his clan has been disintigrated and his land stolen yet he is so noble in his quest to avenge these crimes. Hero Fraser just needs to find her aunt to help her since her family no longer can or will. They make the perfect couple. True highland romance fans will love this story!!"},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"Highland Jewel is, indeed, a jewel. The hero, Ciaran, strides across the highlands, an avenging warrior, intent upon discovering what happened to his family, and punishing those responsible. The heroine, Hero, is trying to find what's left of her family, and much to Ciran's irritation, he must take her into his life to keep her safe. Between them, the warrior facing death and the innocent, self absorbed heroine find that the bond they forge together in their trials leads them to a new life where two lonely people can triumph together.Within Highland Jewel there are enough tartans, clan skirmishes, and highland honor to beguile even those not devoted to 18th cent. Scotland. For those who do love this era, it is pure delight. Ms. Wilhelm's book is well thought out and well researched....even better, it's fun!"},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"Highland Jewel has everything--a wonderful, unusual setting, a spunky, loveable heroine, and an unforgettable hero. It also has a tender--and quite sexy!--romance between two strong, exciting characters. You'll hate to see their story end. I've read other books by this author, and I loved them all. She completely captures the feel of the Highlands--and she uses both humor and deep emotion in every story. I especially love her heroes. They aren't just gorgeous men. They always have a special, tragic nobility, too."},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"This book is great the story flows easily and keeps you wanting more.The love story between the main characters is warm loving and full of spunky passion.The love story by the supporting charachters is charming,fun,and helps to bring alive the lives of all in a whole.The action is great with out all the excess gore that some writers use.Terri Lynn Wilhelm gets the reader so involved you dont want to see the end of there journey.I wish she would keep writing about these characters since there is so much unexplored possibilites and directions to go in."},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"Highland Jewel was both romantic and excitingly full of suspense. I could not put the book down and yet I did not want it to end. It would be so nice if Miss Wilhelm would write a sequel."},{"Title":"Highland Jewel","review":"As an avid book-reader, especially romances set in genre, I was very disappointed with Highland Jewel. I spent so much time trying to figure out what the characters were saying and how it related to the story-lines that after 90 pages, I was ready to give up.Hero, the lead female of the book, was so uppidy and self-centered that I was hoping the story would lead to another &quot;hero&quot;ine coming to the aid of Ciaran.I recommend Julie Garwood's books for anyone looking for a romance set in this time period."},{"Title":"Abigail","review":"The story of the doll, ABIGAIL, is set in 1835 and tells of the Calvin family moving in a covered wagon - - from Kentucky to Indiana's hill country: Bean Blossom! (That destination helped them feel more 'at home' than adjusting to a new life as flatlanders.) Portia Sperry loved the rolling countryside. She and co-author Lois Donaldson researched the long-ago times seriously and drew an honest picture of life in the 1830s. Zabeth Selover's colorful illustrations in the original edition have an unusual folk charm, enhancing the story. The authors include an Indian tale, the requisite encounter with a bear, and square dancing at a housewarming - - with \\"Abigail\\" being the most important ingredient to this mix.I'd like to think there may be a future author who recalls the times around 2005 and builds a story around another young girl. Gwenyth Swain, who grew up in Brown County's Wallow Hollow, wrote about \\"CHIG\\" (isbn: 0440419204) & the Depression years in Brown county which was the era when the Sperry family struggled and \\"invented\\" Abigail to help with their survival.It is disappointing to not read any review from the author's family, or reviews by the many who listened to the story of the sweet little doll & then begged to have their own! The reason may be that the reviews written for the 1938 edition of \\"Abigail\\" were not transferred with the 2000 edition published by the Indiana Historical Society. \\"Abigail\\" IS STILL AVAILABLE IN ITS INDIANA HISTORICAL SOCIETY edition.Portia Sperry is remembered with admiration & affection in Nashville and Brown County. Reviewer mcHAIKU recalls many happy times with Emily Sperry Eads (that's her poem in chapter #16)! Having their friendship makes Abigail's story and the family's courage & perseverance even more special to read about."},{"Title":"The Housekeeper's Daughter (Silhouette Special Edition No. 1612) (Silhouette Special Edition)","review":"This first of three books about The Kendricks of Camelot was like a modern day Cinderella story.

You needed to READ the book, not skim over and I enjoyed that.The dialogue was good and I enjoyed getting to read the personal thoughts of the couple.Second - the story was a little bit more realistic than a lot of \`Cinderella' stories out there. I mean she really was the housekeeper's daughter and had the lifestyle to match. He was the total opposite having been born rich, and it was interesting to see how this all worked out.My only minus (half a star) was that I wished the heroine would grow a smidgen of a spine. But perhaps there really are people like this. I kept thinking to myself its good this is just \`bookland'. In real life this man would be taken from this lady in a heartbeat if she did not shape up and speak up! I loved the hero though.

Destitute and hungry, the boy inevitably comes to the attention of Sherriff Wade Rogers, who convinces Circle L Ranch ramrod Tyler Johnson to take the sullen, aggressive young man on as a ranch hand. Thus, the boy, who refuses to provide his real name, reluctantly becomes a Circle L employee.Because of his contrary nature, the boy, who the other ranch hands teasingly dub \\"night hawk\\", often rubs his co-workers the wrong way. His surly attitude causes a lot of tension at the ranch, eventually leading to a fist fight with one of colleagues, Smitty. Ironically, the two become close after Smitty knocks the tar out of his gangly and inept opponent.Although the night hawk makes a connection with Smitty, Ty Johnson finds himself bailing the boy out of difficulty again and again. Finally, the boy ends up in a bind that Ty might not be able to extricate him from, a situaution that may result in the boy losing his life. Relying on his wits and a little bit of luck, Ty does his best to help the uappreciative ranch hand, who seems to be a veritable trouble magnet.Night Hawk is a compact and entertaining little novel.

Pick up a book by the great British travel writer H.V. Morton. It is guaranteed to lift you out of your mental doldrums and take you places.Morton, who lived and worked in the 20th century, continues to have a significant following today--in fact, his readers have formed an international Society, the H.V. Morton Society, which any enthusiast may join. (This enthusiast has.)\\"In Search Of Scotland\\" is the Morton book I first encountered. It had a page or two, right at the beginning, that I found dull--but after that I was hooked. Morton depicted the romantic and tragic country of Scotland in such a way that I felt I was there, seeing things through his eyes. He introduced many of the people. He made me laugh. He made me cry. He made me buy other books by him.Try him. He is a writer who, if you let him, will become your friend."},{"Title":"In Search of Scotland","review":"I have to say at the start that I've read and reviewed maybe a half-dozen H.V. Morton books, and I've yet to find one that's not well-written, interesting, and entertaining. But as with any author, some books are better than others. I started reading \\"In Search of Scotland\\" right after finishing Morton's wonderful \\"In Search of England,\\" and I have to admit I found \\"...Scotland\\" something of a letdown.I've been trying to decide why exactly that is, and I think it may simply be because \\"...England\\" was a diverse, you might say, book, with a wider variety of personalities, encounters, and generally interesting things to do and see. It may be, too, that Morton was more familiar with England and so could write about it more broadly and confidently. One of the things I found most surprising about \\"...Scotland,\\" in fact, was Morton's discussion of how unknown most of Scotland -- particularly the Highlands -- still was to the majority of English people, even as late as the time Morton was writing (1929). Scotland was in many senses a foreign land, making \\"In Search of Scotland\\" Morton's first piece of \\"foreign\\" travel writing (all his previous books had been about England, and mostly about London).While parts of \\"...Scotland\\" dragged for me, there were still many times when Morton's descriptive skill shined through, and the reader comes away with a strong sense of the role history plays (or played?) in the average Scot's understanding of himself and his place in the world. As with so much of Morton's writing, it would be fascinating to know how much of what he found still remains, eight or so decades later."},{"Title":"The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation","review":"This book was written in the early 1900's.

She feels discouraged until she remembers a story from school that helped her pull herself together and concentrate on other people's lives instead of just her own.

The anmimosities, the friendships, the never ending sense of confusion."},{"Title":"The End of Order: 2","review":"This book is highly readable and certainly not like many other books on the subject which tend to be a dull and technical recitation of the Versailles Treaty process which ended World War 1 in 1919 and sowed the seeds for World War 2. It brings the era and the place and the treaty process alive with the historic figures who shaped the peace and some who will later be important in world history.

Very nice."},{"Title":"Discworld Mapp","review":"The actual detail on Ye Mapp is perhaps a little sparse, but that is because of the nature of the beast - most of the Disc has yet to be explored by someone willing and/or alive enough to tell us about it.The Mapp itself is a very nicely executed thing indeed, worthy of being framed behind glass had I a space big enough. I don't, so that's an end to that idea.The gazetteer attached to the inside front cover of the, er, cover gives much interesting information on the great explorers that made at least some of the small wiggly bits possible. An indispensable aid to understanding the factors that had to be overcome to bring the Mapp to fruition.And the cover makes it look like a proper map like the OS ones you could buy if you happened to be in England and inside a shop that sold maps. Bonus!You should buy The Mapp if you are a fan of mapps, the Disc, Pratchett stories or theDiscworld (HC)RPG.You shouldn't buy it if you plan on feeding it to the dog, because as far as I can tell it has no nutritional value to speak of and the glue used to attach the Mapp and the Gazetteer to the covers might been manufactured in Ankh-Morpork from anything too slow to evade the members of the Gluemakers' Guild and therefore possibly be bad for the animal.See also:The Streets of Ankh-Morpork"},{"Title":"Discworld Mapp","review":"If you are into Terry Pratchett's Discworld series then this map will tell you where you are going.

This is it.\\" Thus does Pratchett introduce this volume, however, he explains that he didn't want to start with a map and fit everything onto it, rather the map essentially evolved as his stories multiplied until it could be physically created.From Lancre to Uberwald to Koom Valley you can plot out where everything is. I do find it most useful to put everything and the many varied locations in perspective. For example now you can see exactly how the witches flew to Genua or where Leshp was.Accompanying the large map is a small booklet containing small biographies of the Disc's prominent explorers (those who were proper explorers anyway). These were enjoyable, but not quite the same as a Discworld story (though the normal humour was present in full). My only disappointment with the map is that I simply cannot locate Copperhead!Just don't expect any earthshattering revelations about the nature of the Disc: \\"Exactly how [the internal layer of molten rock] is maintained, and how the water that pours ceaselessly over the rim from the Circle Sea is replaced, are but two of the unfathomable mysteries of the world.\\"A true Discworld aficionado shouldn't be without this mapp. But if you're a more casual reader then it might be best to leave things up to your imagination and Terry's wonderful descriptive language."},{"Title":"Discworld Mapp","review":"Funny!

It is quite large in format and quite thin in content, consisting of pictures and small biographical vignettes of some of the Discworld's most prominent personalities. Paul Kidby's illustrations are indeed lavish and impressive, consisting of black and white sketches alongside vibrantly colored portraits. I personally envision some of the characters, particularly Rincewind and Magrat, quite differently, but it is certainly interesting to see how a professional illustrator and bonafide Discworld fan envisions the denizens of my favorite flat planet. It must be said that Kidby ably captures the spirit of Pratchett's creations, and any favorite illustrator of Terry Pratchett's is a favorite illustrator of mine. Pratchett's biographical sketches of characters are fun to read, but there is nothing found here that cannot be found in the novels themselves. I would also note the fact that this portfolio was published in 1996, at which time only 18 Discworld novels had been published. If you are not a Discworld fanatic, you will most likely be disappointed by this item.

It's cheaper, larger, has more colored pieces, and is in general more bang for your buck."},{"Title":"Images in the Dark: Encyc of Gay and Lesbian Film and Video","review":"This book is wonderful. It is filled with over 3,00 films and videos. I found movies that i had forgot about in this book. The book is filled with Directors, Themes, Stars, and photos. I would recommend it to EVERYONE. I will have to say though, most rescent titles arent included. It was published in 1996 ."},{"Title":"Images in the Dark: Encyc of Gay and Lesbian Film and Video","review":"I agree with the reviewer who stated that this book needs to be updated. As the other reviewer noted, the book was published in 1996, which makes it a very dated. Regardless, that does not diminish the usefulness of the book in any way.The book is broken up into chapter sections and then listed in alphabetical order. You may want to get tabs for the individual sections in order to make it easier to locate what you are looking for specifically. For instance, if you are looking for gay directors, it is the first chapter in the book. However films of \\"Gay Male Interest\\" begin on page 375. By putting tabs in the book, it makes it a much quicker reference guide.Each film has a small blurb discussing what the film is about and how it relates to the LGBTQ community. Not all of the films in the book are gay or lesbian but it may have a gay or lesbian, etc. character, theme, or whatever in it that contributes to the study of the sub-cultural genre. The reviews also tell whether the LGBTQ portrayals are positive or negative, in most cases, which helps guide whether or not we want to see the particular film. Unfortunately, by 1996, most portrayals of Gays, Lesbians, etc. were negative portrayals, with notable exceptions. This was a period where cinematic perspectives about the LGBTQ community was only beginning to change. That is something to keep in mind when considering many of these films.All in all, the book is wonderful and a great reference for the film buff, film student, auteur or anyone interested in the art form to refer to. The book is great for LGBTQ studies.As previously noted, the only downfall for the book is that it has not been updated in 15 years. That is the only limitation of the book. Otherwise, the reviews are clear and concise. It is worth purchasing this book and keeping it near your film library.4.5/5 stars"},{"Title":"Images in the Dark: Encyc of Gay and Lesbian Film and Video","review":"My only regret is that this book has not been updated in years.

She's a lonely freshman and tells it like it is. She is Patty Ho. Her overprotective, very strict mother sends her to summer math camp when Patty's fortune teller grandmother says she is going to meet a white man. Patty is furious when she finds out that she is going to camp while her suck up brother does nothing. So she is sent off to Stanford with no tendency of enjoying it. She is glad that she is getting away from the classmates who tease her but the thought of leaving her best friend makes her week to the knees. What she doesn't know is math camp at Stanford might not be so bad after all.....For me, the book overall wasn't that interesting. At the very beginning of the book, the second paragraph, didn't make me want to read more. It was kind of weird and almost gave the wrong impression. I started to read more and I just couldn't get into it. There were some parts that were suspenseful and exciting but after a few pages, it got kind of dull. The excitement faded out. To me, I felt there was no plot. All the book focused on was that Patty Ho was half Asain and half white. I also couldn't relate to the book. It was hard to understand where Patty Ho was coming from being half and half. Headley used excellent description and I could the see the situations in my head as I was reading it but it didn't grab my attention.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, and young adult book reviews and recommendations"},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"My dad bought me this book and another by author Grace Lin after coming back from a convention for a gathering of Taiwanese people. I was surprised because my dad never buys books for me of his own accord. So I read it. Being Taiwanese American myself, I could really relate to Patty, the main character. Except her family is nothing like mine. My mom is not super pushy to the point where you have had enough of the Dragon Lady of House Ho and feel like she's crazily overprotective. Patty's fortune is being told via her belly button. Bellybutton Grandmother predicts that she will end up with a \\"Be-gok lan\\" which literally translated means \\"American person\\" or more simply, a white person. Patty's mom is devastated to hear this and makes the decision to pack her up and send her tail between legs to Math Camp at Stanford University. \\"bo-po-mo-fo\\" are the first four letters of the Chinese alphabet that are combined to form the phonetic spelling of Chinese words. The actual chinese words themselves are symbols and the \\"bo-po-mo-fo\\" spelling is there to help people who don't know how to pronouce a word pronouce it. Unlike English, chinese spelling and pronunciation are directly linked together meaning there is only one way to pronouce a word and if you don't say it that way you say it wrong. A certain letter will always make a certain sound never to be changed. Mei-Mei means younger sister in Chinese. Unlike english there is a specific phrase used to designate older or younger. Older sister would be Jie-Jie. (Jyeh-Jyeh) 'ye' like in yes. \\"mapo tofu\\" is tofu of course. It is spicy. how spicy depends on the chef. It contains ground meat that tastes good and the sauce is yummy too. Patty definitely has Taiwanese culture in her life but she is unable to speak fluently in Taiwanese or Chinese.

Her Taiwanese mom incessantly hounds her to behave and to study hard, criticizes her for not being more accomplished, absolutely forbids her to date, and constantly disapproves of her every move. It's almost as if her mother blames Patty for being half-white, like Patty had anything to do with that. Patty can't talk to her dad because he's been out of the picture since she was two. And she can't confide in her older brother as he's their mom's favorite and has been accepted at Harvard for the fall term.As if she doesn't get enough criticism at home, that jerk at school constantly makes fun of her mixed race. He even spit on her! But Patty holds all of the pain and frustration deep inside, neither brave nor confident enough to stand up for herself, not knowing how to live any other way.When the fortune teller her mom hires prophesies that Patty will endure a terrible accident and fall in love with a white guy, Patty is quickly reserved a spot at Math Camp at Stanford University. Math camp? Patty doesn't even like math...and why would she want to be shipped off for four weeks with total strangers? Eventually, though, she meekly accepts her mother's sentencing.But then she finds a few unexpected things at camp, including a wild and outgoing roommate who chips away at Patty's shell, a really cute potential boyfriend, a confidant who helps Patty see the good in herself, and an estranged aunt who becomes a friend. Then there's the hidden family secret Patty uncovers that starts to explain why her mom is so critical. Math camp turns out to be full of surprises, just as Patty discovers herself to be.Justina Chen Headley has created an amazing piece of art with her story about kindhearted, self-conscious Patty. Headley's sense of humor and skillful use of realistic characters will pull readers into the pages, giving them the chance to realize just how special everyone's potential is, no matter what their racial background happens to be.

Patty, our protagonist, is at the heart of the story, but we see how the other girls and women in her life help her grow and change. When we discover why Patty's mother is the way she is, for us as much as for Patty, life takes on new levels. When Jasmine pushes Patty outside her comfort zone, we wonder what exciting opportunities may lie outside our own. And what is most reassuring is that after this transformative summer, Patty hasn't had to give up any of her former self; she's only added new dimensions.In Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies), we see how a girl can grow and change and find out who she is, without losing a sense of who she was. We can be in the present, look to the future, and remember the past. And I think Patty's most important discovery, and mine too in reading this book, is that the events that shape us do just that - they shape who we are and what we become. But they don't determine it.

Books are not often written about people of biracial decent, leaving those who are biracial struggling to find someone they can relate to in literature, and many people who are not biracial ignorant to the struggle biracial people go through. When you read about someone like you... for some reason it's like a validation of your existence. For others who aren't biracial... maybe they will learn a little bit about what it means when you are. I loved all of the humor in the book, especially the mom lecture series'!

As a very tall half Asian, half white teen, she doesn't fit in with her mother's potluck group of Asian overachievers, and she certainly doesn't blend in at her white-washed school, where even her best friends sometimes make fun of her Asian-ness. But, the last thing Patty wants is to be the stereotypical Asian kid at math camp...not that she has any choice in the matter when her mom forces her to go, and Patty reluctantly acquiesces--anything to get away from home after a humiliating last day of school. So she's shocked when she finds that math camp is kinda fun...and there is one guy in particular that is not only hot, but mom-approved Taiwanese. Patty's newfound freedom is liberating...but will it all come crashing down thanks to her crazy, overprotective mother?Nothing but the Truth (and a few white lies) is a hilarious and fun read that isn't afraid to delve into some of the tougher subjects, like bullying, racism, and long-buried family issues. The book is just a tad slow at first as Patty resists going to math camp, but once she gives in and goes, her story definitely picks up as many of her misconceptions are proven wrong and she finally loosens up and has fun. She hits her stride, makes new friends, and slowly begins to embrace who she is. But before long, Patty's mother bursts onto the scene and causes her to take a good, hard look at her family life and uncover secrets from the past that change her perception of herself and her mother, who has always seemed like the certifiably insane villain in the past. This is an excellent and realistic book about looking past stereotypes, finding the people who truly understand you, and seeing people in a new light. Headley's clever use of language and wordplay evens out the darker parts of the story, makes the book smart and comedic, and ultimately leads Patty to a happy new beginning. Nothing but the Truth is a fantastic, important book."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"Patty Ho is multi-racial, with a white father whom she's never met and a domineering Taiwanese mother.

Patty is sent to math camp at Stanford University. Now in a city far more liberal and open-minded than her hometown, her mind veers off math to a realm of new friends and beautiful boys. This book was absolutely delightful with serious issues of identity and racism, and light-hearted facets of romance and friendship."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"Review from [...]Title: Nothing but the Truth (and a few white lies)Author: Justina Chen HeadleyGrade: A-Ideal Audience: Girls 11-16Summary: When Patty is with her white friends and white classmates, she wishes she were fully white, without having the shadow of \\"super-nerdy Asian\\" looming over her. When Patty is with her Asian friends, she wishes she were fully Asian, so they won't turn their noses up at her inferiority. But Patty is half and half.Just to add on to Patty's nightmare of a life, her strict mother with sky-high expectations is carting her off to math camp for the summer- that's right, math camp, where Patty can hang with a bunch of math geeks who view the latest mathematical problem as the highest form of entertainment.However, when Patty arrives at math camp, she's in for a surprise. Her roommate is kick-butt cool and Patty is also taking an interest in a guy named Stu. More importantly, the summer will be a summer of change for Patty: she will learn things about her family, her life, and her half and half status.My thoughts: Despite Patty's specific identity issues, all girls- Asian, Caucasian, or otherwise- can relate to Justina Chen Headley's hilarious, touching novel. Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies) is thought-provoking without being corny or condescending.I'd recommend this book to all teenage girls: it is both a fun and a deep read."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"If Patricia \\"Patty\\" Yi-Phen Ho had just one wish, she knows exactly what it would be. To be white. Full-out, red-white-and-blue, all-American, totally Caucasian white. Not the half-and-half mixture that she is now, with an overbearing Taiwanese mother and a long-gone Caucasian father. Not an Amazon-tall mishmash of ancestries that leave her looking like an overgrown Asian teenager or a really tanned white one. Just plain old, blend-into-the-crowd white.When her mom drags her to a fortune-teller who gets her information from your bellybutton rather than a crystal ball, Patty knows she's in trouble. The \\"you're going to have three children\\" prediction is a little ludicrous, given the fact she can't even get a boyfriend. But what really freaks her out--not to mention sends her mother into a fit of unintelligible Taiwanese--is the fact that, according to bellybutton lady, Patty is destined to end up with a white guy.For Patty, that works just fine. For her mother, not so good. If her mom had her way, Patty would never get within twenty feet of a white guy, never mind date one. No, her mom wants what she didn't get herself--a marriage to a nice, respectable, rich Taiwanese doctor. Or, if there are no doctors available, a businessman would be acceptable. Never mind what Patty wants, which at this moment is knowing if the hottest guy at school, Mark Scranton, will ever notice her.Stunned into yet more lectures about life as a poor Taiwanese girl, Patty's mother decides that this summer, instead of lounging around and possibly getting a part-time job, Patty will attend math camp at Stanford. Since her older brother, Abe, is busy \\"preparing\\" for his upcoming attendance at Harvard, he's no help to get her out of this bind. So Patty sets off to camp, resigned to hanging out with geeks.Except math camp turns out to be not as bad as she'd thought. There's some really good-looking guys there, guys with brains. Like Stu, who blesses her with her first kiss. And might possibly end up breaking her heart. For Patty, this summer could end up teaching her a whole lot more than math. Things like what it's like to really be American, and learning to love who you are. Because there are guys out there who can love a hapa girl for who she is--if she'll just learn to love herself first.NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH is a great read for anyone who has ever had trouble discovering their identity, or for someone looking to find out how it feels to be different. A real winner!"},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"Patty doesn't think she fits in anywhere, not even in her own family. She has a strict Taiwanese mother, an absentee white father and a college-bound older brother. As far as she can see, the scoreboard reads world = 100, Patty = 0. She is dragged with her mother to meet a fortune teller who reads her belly button (!) while everyone else is rocking out at the high school dance. She has to go to math camp while everyone else has fun summer plans. In other words, everyone else wins at life, while Patty comes up empty.Patty's story is not just for hapas - read the book to discover the definition! - and not only for biracial teens. It has many levels of appeal. I recommend Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies) by Justina Chen Headley to a wide variety of people - both genders, various races, all thoughtful teens, and all astute adults, especially parents. This is a story for anyone who has wondered about an absent parent or struggled with a strict parent. This is for the smart kids who wonder why their parents keep testing them and making them prove themselves. This is for the kids who look different from their classmates on the outside or simply feel different on the inside. This is for anyone who considered his or her own personal secrets, lies, and truths.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"Patty Ho wishes she were different. Actually, she wishes she were just like everyone else. Half-Taiwanese and half-white, she's not the same as anyone else. She's not smart enough for her &uuml;ber-strict mom, especially since her older brother is Harvard-bound. Her house isn't American enough for her friends-- who cares about feng shui? And she's never been able to escape jokes about her last name, ranging from Santa Claus to whores. In short, Patty can't get anything right -- even a Truth assignment! What could be simpler than the truth? After an unfortunate proclamation from a belly-button fortune teller that Patty is destined for a white guy (not her mother's idea of a Good One), she's shipped off to math camp at Stanford. Patty kicks up her heels at first, but once she gets there she learns a few big lessons. First, that math is not just for geeks anymore. Second, that there are worse things than being half-and-half. And third, that the truth is not quite so simple after all. No matter what race(s) you are, Patty is a believable, lovable character, and her story will ring true with everyone who reads it. And that's the truth."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"I had the chance to talk to Justina Chen Headley briefly before she gave a reading from Nothing But the Truth (and a Few White Lies). She was very cool, grounded and an absolute pleasure to talk to. So, it should be no surprise that her narrator, Patty Ho, is equally enjoyable in every way in Headley's first novel written for young adults.Half-Taiwanese and half-white, Patty feels like she doesn't belong anywhere. This fact is confirmed when, instead of going to the last school dance of the year, Patty's mother drags her to a fortune teller who discerns Patty's future from her belly button. Things get worse from there when Patty realizes that sometimes dream guys are anything but and finds herself enrolled in Stanford math camp for the summer.This novel is a classic coming-of-age story. As the plot progresses, Patty learns that sometimes you have to find people like you in order to appreciate the value of being really unique. Now, that might sound a bit pat and cliche--but I can assure you this book is anything but.Headley writes with a style unlike any authors I've read recently. The narration is snappy and spunky--as is fitting for a teenage girl as vibrant as Patty. I also like that Headley doesn't take the easy way a lot of the time. The story doesn't follow any typical girl-meets-boy formula. In fact, Headley has quite a few twists thrown in along the way.It's also really interesting to read about Patty and her mother. The subject doesn't often come up in teen literature, where often the characters are immigrants if they are not white. Headley's dialog between Patty and her mother seems realistic (not being Taiwanese at all I can't really say). Her incorporation of slang and certain speech mannerisms bring to mind Amy Tan's writing in The Hundred Secret Senses (another book about a half-asian, half-white character, incidentally). Honestly though, everything in the book is interesting. Even math camp, which some readers will view as warily as Patty does in the beginning, turns out to be a cool environment to read about (with minimal time spent on math in the narrative).In a lot of reviews you'll see me complaining that the characters come off as flat. Happily, I can say that is not the case here. Patty and her myriad friends (and enemies too) jump off the page. Furthermore, Headley artfully negotiates Patty's changing sense of self throughout the novel.It's weird to be saying this about a novel that isn't a thriller, but it was really a page turner. I couldn't put it down. Headley has a lot to say here about identity and family and self-confidence. All of which she manages like a pro.The term \\"new classic\\" is bandied about a lot for modern books and movies. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Nothing But the Truth is going to get that label if it doesn't have it already."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book but wanted to read it because there was so many good reviews for it.It was a nice change of pace from the typical teen lit books I read and that was a big plus. I loved that the main character, Patty Ho, was half Taiwanese and half white. What also brought the story more depth than your average fluffy teen book was that she hated who she was and wanted to be caucasion to fit in with everyone else. She couldn't understand why her Taiwanese mother acted the wasy she did. What she comes to realize through a summer of growth and maturing is that the truth of the matter is, she's perfect the way she is.I'm looking forward to more from Justina Chen Headley."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"Nothing but the Truth is about fifteen-year-old Patty Ho, daughter of a controlling Taiwanese mother and a long-absent American father. Patty struggles to find her place in a world where she's not fully Asian, but not fully white, confronting both egregious and subtle prejudices from both sides. She also struggles with something I could personally relate to, being good at math, but also wanting to write. Her struggles come to a head when her mother sends her to Stanford for the summer for math camp (a month-long program for gifted high school students). While there she encounters humiliation and heartbreak, but also gains self-confidence, friends, and insight into her own family history.Nothing but the Truth is a joy to read. Patty practically leaps forth from the page, fully three-dimensional. I refuse to believe that she isn't real. Every paragraph reveals something about her, or her family, or what it's like to be hapa (the Hawaiian word for someone who is half-white and half-Asian). Her mother, with her strengths and weaknesses, temper tantrums and quirks, feels real, too. Life at Stanford during summer session is also fully realized - the book is chock full of insider information about the university.I particularly enjoyed the writing style in this book. Humorous, yet lyrical, and dripping with (frequently Asian-tinged) metaphors, and the angst of a teenage girl. For example:\\"Mama breathes in sharply. She must be smelling my exasperation polluting the air. (page 13)\\"\\"\\"O-kayyy.\\" Anne drags out the last syllable as if it's a hoe, raking through the intractable soil of my rudeness. (page 76)\\"\\"I'm here because I don't want to be up in the Pacific Northwest where it's always overcast with disappointment and showering anger. (page 108)\\"\\"Under the Dish that scans planets and distant galaxies, I know that the world -- the universe -- is bigger than high school and Mark Scranton and Steve Kosanko and their edamame-bean brains. That it's bigger than Mama and math camp. That maybe I am Zebra-woman, trapped behind black-and-white bars of my own making. (page 110)\\"Despite the tremendous depth and authenticity that Justina Chen Headley brings to her hapa and Asian characters, this is a book that will resonate with teenage girls from all sorts of backgrounds. Because what it's really about (as is clear from Patty's essay at the end of the book) is the struggle to balance the conflicts in yourself, whatever they are, and find your place in the world. This makes it a perfect first book for the readergirlz discussion group, focused on celebrating gutsy girls in life and literature. An example of Patty's place as a gutsy girl is this passage, in which she muses about facing down her fears.Is attitude truly the only thing separating embarrassment from triumph? That a little sass could turn you from a social zero to a social hero? (page 174)I highly recommend this book for anyone who revels in reading about strong girls.A slightly longer version of this book review was originally published on my blog, Jen Robinson's Book Page, on March 4, 2007."},{"Title":"Nothing But the Truth (and a few white lies)","review":"I have a signed copy of Nothing But the Truth (and a Few White Lies) and it's a keeper!

As everytime you read a book after watching the movie, your imagination can certainly fill in more information from the book versus actors acting in a movie."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol is a must for anyone's Kindle collection. It is just as good in Kindle format as it is in the book. Simply timeless!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I ordered this book a long time ago and am now writing my review. I looked at the book again today. The story itself is old and wonderful. I am truly astounded at the artist who painted the illustrations. I want to chop this book up too and frame the art. Incredible. This book is one that you won't want to bury on a shelf someplace but have it close at hand so you can revisit England in the 1800s with so much detail that you are practically in the picture. I also bought a copy for my cousin and her reverence for this book almost exceeds mine! If you are in the market for a copy, this is the one to buy. It will be passed down through the generations and won't end up in the church rummage sale. Gorgeous in every way."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This classic story has been around through several generations and it continues to captivate a new audience. Even non-christians find interest in this story because it causes us to look at ourselves and reevaluate how we want to be perceived after death. While I was familiar with this story before reading it due to several movies, there is nothing like getting the details from the original story. I would recommend this book to those familiar and unfamiliar with the story because its classic writing technique and story line will surely leave you wondering about yourself."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This book is a great quality keepsake item.

Dickens is at his strangest and finest in this work. It has encouraged my children to read more novels by the author."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The Christmas Carol was a book that I throughly enjoyed. This book tells about the hardships and trials of life. This book show how your character depends alot on the way you are received. The three ghost show how Scrooges behavior is traced back to his childhood. It shows that your childhood tends to effect your adult hood."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol is wonderful book that I would want all ages to read. The book shows how a man such as Scrooge can change and so can everyone else. The story is not like the movie. Charles Dickens does a wonderful job in making the story more appealing to me. The story makes me understand how life was like back then. An example is when we had the September 11 attack. I hope people can change like Scrooge. I think Charles Dickens does a great job in using the events from different sources to show different views from the movies. People should read this book so they can maybe stop being so mean to other people and races. (...) The book gets five stars because this is hardcore lessons that we should be teaching today in the youth of America.I think the ghost of the story should come and visit some of the people here in the United States and in different countries.Maybe it is not to late to save the lives of others, if you can not save yourself. This book should be read in schools all over the world.The book has meaning and we should use this meaning to live our lives. The book shows me that everyone can change, including the most devilish person can become an Angel."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I loved the book. Charles Dickens gets a five star mark in my book. The book is nothing like the movie. The way Charles Dickens showed or wrote how the Scrooge changed almost brought me into tears. The movie showed little events than what the book showed. The said part is that many people are just like the Scrooge here today in the United States. On September 11, 2001 showed how many people are just like Scrooge. Men, that are supposed to be &quot;created equal&quot; killed over thousands of men, women, children, and animals all because the United States is more econmic to other countries. The Scrooge being the mastermind of the whole ordeal. I still believe that this book should be given and read to all ages to show how someone as mean as Scrooge can always change when ready or when needed to. To Charles Dickens you should get an award for this piece of work. I think all ages will enjoy this book and maybe someday we will all change and not be so mean to others. Freedom should come to all since we are all God's children"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Large print. Simple and yet wonderfully clear illustrations for the children and adults alike. This is the best Christmas Carol I have seen in 50 years."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens really gives you detail on how it was to live in London at that time period! It is a great book! I am not the best review person but it is a very descriptive book in a good way!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I think this book was one of he best books it was a good story about morals and learning to give and not be greedy. It was a very exciting read about a grumpy old man who didnt really give anything to anyone and how he becomes a good kind person from the visits of three ghost showing him the past present and the future I reccomend this book to anyone who likes a quick fun read"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"My daughter and I have been reading (and re-reading!) the DK Classics (of which &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; is part of) for several years, since she was 5. These books are very colorful, with lots of illustrations and photos of genuine artifacts, maps, and people from the era in which the story is set. Side panel text gives background information about the author, pictures and story. These &quot;additions&quot; (which do not detract from, but only enhance the story) help the young reader (and the adult too!) put the story into context. It is like getting both a classic and a pictorial history book rolled into one! The text is easy to read. My daughter is now 9, and reading the books on her own. Not only has she developed an appreciation for classic literature, but for history as well. These are great books for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend them!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Patrick Stewart makes this story come alive in a way few people could. The humor, warmth, and excitement of Dickens' holiday story, read with such skill, kept us spellbound. This is an abridged version, but you don't feel like you've missed anything. Stewart reads the characters' voices with great humor and variety, and even makes great vocal sound effects.Highly recommended for those long car-trips to see family during the holidays. It will make the miles fly by!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I once read that some scholars consider &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) an unimportant division of Dickens because it is less than half the length of his normal books. I don't understand how they would explain that this is by far his most popular work and yet it is only 1/8 the length of his normal books. This is a masterpiece in that it shows us the harsh reality that some people are so hardened that not even Christmas moves them. I also feel Dickens displays his best skills when he shows us that Scrooge was not always this way. Also, Scrooge starts to change when he is exposed to his present. Seeing upclose what his greedieness has done to Cratchit catches his conscience. Furthermore he realizes that many people will be delighted at his eventual death if he does not change. The messages are very profound. In addition, we are presented with striking images. Also, characters such as Jacob Marley, Fanny, Fred, and Mr. Fezziwig, and the ghosts are very convincing. Again, Dickens shows us the harsh conditions of Victorian England. Also, Dickens emphasizes that even a hardened miser CAN change. If you like this book, Dickens Christmas Book &quot;The Cricket on the Hearth&quot; may also interest you."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"What a timeless and inspired story! This book looks stunning and will be loved by everyone in your family. A MUST!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I think everyone has seen at least 3 versions of this in movie form (I know I have!) but how many have read the story? I hadn't so I grabbed this to read to have something with a little holiday spirit. It's interesting. I guess because I'm used to seeing the movies, which they have to flesh out a bit and use rich colors and holiday cheeriness, I wasn't expecting the story to be so... simple.The language (from the mid 1800s I believe) can be a bit challenging for those of us who need a little help here and there with anything beyond the modern English language, but it really wasn't too bad. I enjoyed it, but it was hard for me not to compare it to the movies and put faces to the various actors who have played the parts.It's still definitely worth a read. You can get it free from several sources on the 'net or from Amazon, of course. Give a whirl, but be prepared to see Disney characters in your head at times ;)"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is one of the best Christmas stories ever written, save for THE Christmas story of Christs birth, that is. Timeless and classic, people can identify pieces of themselves in all of the well rounded characters in this tome. My family watches these movies every year!!! I'm the only one, however, who decided to read the book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is obviously a classic in every respect! I'm very pleased to have finally gotten the chance to read the original. Each magical little retelling has been pretty brilliant for me, and it's all because of this wonderful little book!I trust that you probably already know the story (and if not, that you can see the premise in another review), so I'll just focus on my experience on the read through. And what a delightful read it was! I laughed a lot through the opening (so clever and funny), I truly shuddered as the ghost of Jacob Marley was walking slowly up the stairs and dragging the chains behind him (really scary!), and I beamed my way through the last act-so thrilled for the outcome (that, by the way, we all already knew was coming...but the way it's written here makes it an even more joyous chapter than I expected). All in all, it's a grand Christmas book and timeless piece of literature that I would recommend to anyone.Just as a side note about the Bantam Classic edition also-this is a wonderful, small book with an enchanting cover (as you can see from the Amazon picture). The binding held up wonderfully for me through my first read (it still looks brand new). As a bonus, this version also contains a small biographical sketch on Dickens and a story about him reading this book aloud at a public reading. I haven't checked to see if the other editions also contain this material, but I definitely found it to be an asset to this one. You can't beat the price, either."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've probably seen every movie ever made from this story, but never read the story itself. I loved it. It's another great classic that we probably never read, just watched the DVD. This a new must to read over the holidays. It helps put you in the right spirit. (pun intended) It's a timeless tale that will last forever."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"If I could have only one book of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" this is the one that I would want. The illustrations are beautiful. The price was terrific. I liked mine so much that I ordered one for a friend. Love it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"When starting this book I'd have never thought Scrooge would come up with a quotable line, but through the power of Dickens and the three Spirits, even Scrooge was a changed man!Of course just about anybody who celebrates Christmas and has paid attention to the world around them as they've grown up is familiar with the story of Ebenezer Scrooge as written by the genius Dickens. And most of us have been exposed to at least a few different versions of some animated or Hollywood version of the story. But anyone interested in a simple and short read at Christmas time would do well to treat themselves to the Dickens classic in its original written form. You'll likely not be disappointed as long as you're willing to understand that it's Dickens and it's written in his classic Victorian style, i.e., not a simplified Hollywood script. This was great fun to read and there are some very good points presented by the three Spirits that just about any of us - not just Scrooge - might be able to infuse into our lives at the Christmas time of year."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I needed this book for my book club, and decided to purchase one to keep long term. I read reviews about several different versions of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" and finally settled on this one. Great price from Amazon ($12), and a beautiful book. Most of the other versions have a similar price tag, but are not hard bound with artwork. The artwork is amazing. There are pictures on almost every other page. This is a COMPLETE not abridged version of the story. It is still a very fast and enjoyable read. I would highly recommend this version. It is beautiful."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A beautifully written story much like the many movie and theatre versions you may have seen over the years.

I had been trying to find an unabridged, beautifully illustrated edition to read to my granddaughter. I finally found it in this magnificent rendition of the great Dickens tale.

I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Beautiful edition, excellent quality.The paper is high-quality and semi-gloss, the illustrations are particularly suggestive.

I was guilty of this myself and wanted to original story. I had seen some earlier versions in film, in black and white, that followed this original nearly word by word so that was refreshing to see that someone got it right.

As it turns out, the 1951 version with Alistair Sim is truest to the original, although some omissions were made there as well to adapt it to the screen... as you would expect with a book adaptation. Still, the original story is a joy to read and the 1840's vernacular is quite entertaining, if thought-provolking at times.

Who has not heard the words: \\"Bah! Humbug\\" or known that Scrooge was one of the most disagreeable characters in literature? This story is fairly short and only takes a few hours to read but it will leave you with the hope that if Scrooge could change there is hope for everyone. The plot is simple. Scrooge is visited by his dead friend Marley who informs him that he will be visited by three spirits. These three spirits take him on different journey's to show him memories from his past, what is happening in the present and then what will happen in the future if he continues to live his life in a selfish way. During these journey's we get some insight into why Scrooge became such a horrid man.

Just look at old Scrooge, he whom foul weather didn't know where to have him. Every December I dig this miraculous story afresh and every December timeless new sentences ring out. I think this time through I especially love the way Dickens resoundingly hammers home the death of Jacob Marley right from the get go:\\"There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say Saint Paul's Chruchyard for instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.\\"Amen to that, Charley. With knobs on."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Released on December 17, 1843, A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was a runaway success that changed the way England viewed and celebrated Christmas. In fact, the first Christmas Card appeared in 1843, illustrating a family drinking wine together, with a depiction of a charitable scene. It was precisely the vision of Christmas as a family occasion steeped in a spirit of goodwill to all men that Dickens espoused in the novel. To be fair to Sir Henry Cole and John Callcott Horsley, the creator and designer of the cards, their idea was in the works many years before Dickens was a writer.The story is a familiar one that you may know already. There have been many adaptations of the book produced, with my favorite being the 1951 version of the movie starring Alastair Sim. The essential story has also been intertwined into many tv series, soap operas, and sit-coms. Yet there is something compelling about reading the story as Dickens first told it - not just because he's a masterful storyteller, but symbolism and subtleties can't always be translated to the silver screen.All of the Ghosts who visited Scrooge on Christmas evening have symbolic appearances. Jacob Marley is chained down in his afterlife by all the financial appurtenances of his time. The Ghost of Christmas Past reflects a changing vision, depending on how you look at it. This spirit gives Scrooge a tour through his Christmas Pasts that he never quite considered before. The Ghost of Christmas Present is probably the most remarkable image of the spirits. His bounty represents that of Scrooge, whose wealth is only matched by his penuriousness. Meanwhile, the stark and sparse image of the Ghost of Christmas Future is that of death. As we suspect, and as Scrooge discovers later on, it is the aftermath of his own death that is being portrayed.There are some references that aren't well understood 170 years later, which makes a version of \`A Christmas Carol\\" with a Dickensian Glossary, like this book, a helpful post-mortem. There's even a reference to American History - in particular, the decision of Andrew Jackson to revoke the Charter of the Second National Bank and deposit gold bullion into local state banks. He put credit into the hands of local banks, some of whom abused the privilege by issuing the practically worthless securities mentioned by the novel.The story is only 126 pages long, which you can read slowly, and easily, in a week of commuting on the subway. You don't have much to lose - and possibly the spirit of Christmas to regain - by revisiting this all-time classic close to the form that it was first presented."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol has to be one of his most loved works and also one of the most widely known Christmas stories. Published in 1843, the novella tells the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser who is visited one Christmas Eve by four \\"spirits\\" whose mission is to save him from himself.In Mission Audio's audiobook edition of the story, narrator Simon Vance gives a phenomenal reading of the classic tale, complete with exceptional voices. The narration grabbed my attention right off and kept it through the very end. I gained new insight into the story because of the beautiful narration and was reminded of the importance of its message.Whether you've read the story before or not, I highly recommend this audiobook.

Through the visions of his dead partner, Jacob Marley, and three Ghosts, Scrooge is sent on the learning experience of a life.There is a reason why this book is so prevalent in our (Western) culture, how everyone, even those who've never read the novella/book, know the story so well (which is why this review will not have any spoiler notices). This story is a story that hits us to the core, that forces us to look outside our selfish lives and to think of others. And while the characters aren't the most nuanced, it is the story, it is the heart of the book that is most important and most inspiring.The characters are rather one-note, if you think about it. Scrooge is the only one that undergoes any change (somewhat expected, as it is a novel about his growth), but he starts out as the hideously over-done selfish man and ends up as the happiest, most joyful man in the world. Seeing his drastic change, however, does make the story more compelling, which is probably why Scrooge was painted so over-the-top in the beginning. From his little sister to Belle to Bob Crachit and his family, the characters tend to be blindly cheerful and happy despite their conditions. About the only one I can think of off the top of my head that isn't is Mrs. Crachit, who definitely harbors some resentment to Mr. Scrooge.But the remarkable thing about \\"A Christmas Carol\\" isn't the nuanced, varied characters, but the story, the journey, Scrooge's miraculous change. Reading it for the second time (I read it once in high school on my own), I was still touched and intrigued. I discovered more of the humor (the bit about Marley being more of \\"gravy than of grave\\"), the deeper meaning of the story. A lot of times, it seems that movies take the bits about Scrooge celebrating and honoring Christmas, and while that is an important theme, I thought the more important theme was to look out for your neighbor and open your heart.Scrooge was miserly, giving his employee a crappy wage (something like 15 shillings a week!). He refused to have anything to do with his nephew, he wouldn't give to the poor, and he had no compassion for beggars. While he lived in a huge home, he only lit a single candle and lived in a single room. And as the Ghosts reveal his past, present, and future, he slowly realizes, \\"Hey, I should have been nice to that kid on the street\\", \\"Hey, I wish I had agreed to visit my nephew\\", and \\"Hey, I should do something about my employee's work conditions\\".And that is why this book is so great, in my opinion. Christmas is one day and not everyone celebrates it the same way (or at all!); but kindness and generosity can be expressed ALL YEAR LONG and EVERYONE can share it. That is how I interpret it when Scrooge says, near the end: \\"I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year\\". Christmas isn't the Christian holiday, or the commercialized version that we see all around us; Christmas is the compassion we have to those around us.Brought to you by:*C.S.

At that point, I know I never really appreciated the beauty of his work and words. I recently listened to christianaudio's version of A Christmas Carol, which is one of their best audiobooks yet. Simon Vance's narration was excellent, with an engaging dramatization.At a recent Bible study, someone brought up how A Christmas Carol was particularly a message about caring for our neighbors. While most of us have heard the story many times, hearing Dickens' original words really sent the message about the power and importance of loving our neighbor.

It is filled with the stuff that modern America needs: A decent respect for humanity, a will to help the sick, the tired, the poor, the hungry, the weak, the crippled. Scrooge changed and so can the current tendency to disrepect and discourtesy anyone and everything. The plot of the story is well known: Jacob Marley returns from the grave to warn Scrooge that the chance to help people and the chance to get great joy by helping people will vanish after death. Alas, it's too late for poor Marley who must prowl about the globe seeing terrible things that he could have helped while alive but now cannot help at all. The moral reality of the idea of the strengthless dead needs greater emphasis than it usually gets: The time to do good is now, now, now. Fortunately, Scrooge sees the warning clearly, the three ghosts of Christmas having done their job well, and Scrooge wakes up on Christmas day to do the good deeds he should have been doing all along.

This is the original novella that inspired all those adaptations.That's the biggest hurdle when reading this: it may be hard for some readers to get past having heard some version or other of Tiny Tim shouting out \\"God Bless Us, Every One\\" in five hundred different ways every year of their lives, and some readers might find parts of the story hackneyed in the same way that other Christmas classics have become overplayed (anyone who's worked in a mall during the Christmas seasons will know what I'm talking about).Despite that, though, this is still a classic story, and readers who can get themselves past that hurdle will be richly rewarded. There's a powerfully archetypal story here, and one that still managed to tug at even my cynical heartstrings, even as overexposed as I've been to endless re-adaptations; I suspect it will do the same for most other readers as well, as long as they're willing to let it.Even if you don't feel like getting into the Christmas Spirit, though, it's a great introduction to reading Dickens -- probably his shortest major work (1203 kindle \\"locations\\"), and illustrates several of his major themes (urban poverty, workhouses, the Poor Laws, the inadequacy of contemporary aid to the poor, and, generally speaking, man's inhumanity to man). The language is fairly accessible even to a modern reader (Dickens frequently gave public readings of it).Perhaps most interesting is how much influence this single story has had on our entire modern conception of the Christmas holiday -- it's this one tale that in many ways created, idealized, and shaped the modern notion of Christmas, almost singlehandedly transforming Christmas from the celebration of a sacred holiday to the celebration of a family feast. In the century or two prior to this, the holiday had primarily been seen as a twelve-day rural celebration by a whole village or manorial community -- a celebration that had largely fallen on hard times, due both to Cromwell's Puritan abolishment of Christmas celebrations during the 1640's and 50's and (more crushingly) the increasing urbanization and industrialization of British life, which made such celebrations impractical or impossible. This single story took what had been a dying tradition and revitalized it for the industrial era, refocusing it on the (relatively) secular themes of charity, love, friendship, and the nuclear family -- the same ideas, essentially, that are commonly held at the heart of our Christmas holidays today -- and showing urban families a way to celebrate the holiday and make it meaningful. In a very real way, this story saved Christmas.So, if you haven't already read it, do so. It's the original -- often imitated, never duplicated. It might tug your heartstrings, and there's something to learn, too, both about the history of the Christmas holiday and its modern meaning.If you decide after this that you want to read more Dickens, he wrote a number of other \\"Christmas Tales\\" -- \\"The Cricket on the Hearth\\" and a few others. For the most part they're skippable, not up to the archetypal heights Dickens struck with _Carol_. Instead, I'd recommend _David Copperfield_; it was Dickens' favorite of his own books, probably the best of his longer works, and it both compares well with \\"Carol\\" and strikes on many of the same themes (charity, social injustice, cruelty).One note on this kindle edition: it's a bit awkwardly formatted, with the page numbers of the original marked in brackets, a \\"list of illustrations\\" that are not included, and odd chunks of capitalized text (presumably captions to the nonexistent illustrations). Still, perfectly readable despite that, and it's free."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I collect \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and this is a particularly lovely volume.

I would want to see my past, present, and future. I think everybody should read this book. You will feel different about life after you have read it.

Almost everyone, from young children to senior citizens, has at least seen it in a screen adaptation. It has become an integral part of the Christmas season, an immortal classic, beloved by both young and old. That said, if you have never read the original text, you owe it to yourself to do so. This story, though short and simple, is a timeless classic for a reason: it is immaculately written, has a great theme, and is undeniably heartwarming. Dickens is at his brief best here, deftly and skillfully weaving this immortal story in a spellbinding manner, making great and timeless art out of what would have been an overly-sugary-sweet mess in the hands of a lesser writer. This story is good enough, and well-written enough, to melt the cold hard of any cynic. The prose style he uses in this book is just about perfect: it makes for a fast-paced read which can easily be read in one setting, while also managing to be entertaining, and even suspenseful -- with a fine moral to boot. The story is also more than it seems: in addition to the simple morality tale, Dickens manages to weave in some social criticism, while also intermixing elements of horror and not a slight bit of humor. This is one of the few books that I truly recommend to everyone. Everyone can read it, and everyone can enjoy it. An essential classic."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"What impresses me about this edition is that it is affordable without being trashy. It is one of the \\"Dover Thrift Editions,\\" which reprints classics for between $1.00-$1.50, so we have no excuse for not being literate and culture. This book, however, has the feel of a pricier classic. The cover is tasteful and evocative of yuletide. The typesetting and printing is high quality. I have never seen any faint ink, or skipped words, or typos in any of Dover's publications.But any book is about the story, and not the format. This story of human redemption is deservedly a classic. People can change, and anyone can improve, and that is the message of the season.Dickens' genius is not only his vivid description, but also his thought compression. It is only 68 pages long, so it can be read in one setting. I try to do thins, since the story has greater force if it is swallowed whole, without any commercial breaks. It is the pinnacle of Christian Fantasy."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"In his 'A Christmas Carol', Dickens seems to be sending a message of gratefulness for us having to celebrate Christmas Day once a year inspite of the bitterness, sadness and hatred we sometimes feel the whole year round. Just the thought of having Christmas itself is enough reason for us to be thankful and to forgive and forget, Dickens seems to be saying.Also in this book, Dickens seems to be telling grown-ups to take care of the children. Ebenezer Scrooge has an axe to grind with the world with all he had experienced in his childhood and early adulthood. Who would not feel the same way as Scrooge after all what his early life had offered him? As when the Ghost of Christmas Past is showing to Scrooge the school scene when all young Scrooge's classmates have left for the Holidays and Scrooge's younger sister is trying to make him come home, too, but he is not inclined to do so. Dickens was constantly haunted by his traumatic experiences as a little lonely boy working in a blacking factory in industrial-age London. Dickens knew he lost a significant part of his life -- his childhood -- that he seemed to have brezzed by it straight into adulthood. He knew how important childhood experiences were as foundation of everybody's personalities that he seemed he wouldn't want other children to experience the hardships he went through as a child. And, through his 'Carol', Dickens has forever reminded adults about this particular sentiment of his.Dickens shows us how the love of money, the root of all evil, transformed a bitter, vengeful Scrooge to an old, cold man. One very poignant, heart-breaking scene of the story is when Arabella, young man Scrooge's object of affection, explains how, because of Scrooge's yearning to become financially successful in her eyes, she feels like somebody has replaced her in Scrooge's heart.Embedded in the story is the Biblical promise of redemption and salvation once a man has been born again like a child. Indeed, Scrooge, at the end of the story, on Christmas Day, feels like he's little again when he realized that there is still a chance for him to change his ways after the visit of the last specter, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.If there is one book that should be read during Christmastime by both grown-ups and children, it is this book , 'A Christmas Carol'. Charles Dickens has, indeed, given us an eternal Christmas gift."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol is read annually along with any and all movie versions. The tale is so simple yet so full of detail. Scrooge is every man who lets life get him down until something changes the status quo. The use of spirits to guide a person to a better path in life is so in tune with the 1990s where everyone is searching for miracles whether they involve spirits or angels or whatever.

This is a story that lifts up one's spirits, not only at Christmas time, but throughout the year. I recommend it highly to everyone. I usually reread it every Christmas. Several individuals have also pointed out that not only is this an early time-traveling story (perhaps the earliest), it is also probably the earliest story about alternative futures, later popular among science fiction writers as well as historians."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"If you have to choose the story among the Christmas stories I think you should have Ch.Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; among your finalists and many of us might find it as the final choice. Some characters of the story even expand the spheres of Christmas; in the first place we will probably mention Ebenezer Scrooge, who has inspired e.g. Walt Disney quite a lot. It might be that his feathered equivalent, even more prosperous than the (finally) good Ebenezer,is today better known than Dickens' original. One more reason to read the book! Among the rest I'll only mention &quot;Tiny Tim&quot;, who has lent his name at least to a tasty species of minitomatoes. The author mixes cunningly facts concerning the social contrasts in 19th century England, rich owners and poor workers, with fictitious ghosts. The latter allow him to move in time, these moves are more related to personal and moral matters than to possible changes in the social frames. The social frames of the story are as well international as English, and they cover - mostly and luckily in a more lenient form - all the ages. The darkest time of the year might make it easier to believe in ghosts or at least accept easier the ones who do so? We can follow how Mr Scrooge's opinions about the members of his staff change, he realizes that he has got some duties towards the people working for him, not just rights to use their skills and time. A kind person is easy to deal with all the year around, one of the wonders of the Yule Tide is that quite a lot of the naughty ones start to behave themselves rather humanly, too.

It's too bad no one notices that the curmudgeon had a point-quite a few points, in fact. There can be no arguing with Dickens's wish to show the spiritual advantages of love.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Scrooge starts by hating Christmas and then ends up loving the loving it thanks to the three ghosts: Past, Present, and the Future ghost. I fell that A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is a very good book, by the way that he foreshadows the chapters in the story and to give you and image of what's to come. I like the story because, Charles Dickens, makes images at the beginning of the story and he describes the ghost to be a very creative way within the story; and he knows how to make things very interesting. Charles Dickens made his characters very creative and neat looking with in your brain. I also think that Scrooges attitude in the beginning of the story is very negative, and I feel that he will never change or do anything for anybody. Scrooge, towards the end is really nice and he is giving to people who don't have anything for the most part. But towards the end Scrooge comes back to life and is nice once again. I also saw Scrooge change through out the book when the present ghost came and he sees the way that he acts toward to the people and he sees that Tiny Tim will die but he does not really care. The future ghost comes and shows him self dead, and he realized that he died greedy .Past ghost comes and changes him for good, because he saw himself sitting alone and he had no one to talk to or anything. I feel that when Scrooge came out of his greedy stage and bought a huge turkey for the Crattich family and he acted like anther father to Tiny Tim and how Tiny Tim did not die and I thought that was very sweet for what he did for them and he garishly gave everybody in the family money. I though that a Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens was a very good book and everybody should read it."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is Dickens at his best. But your add said this was for ages 4-8. As this does not appear to be an abridged addition, 4-8 years old is way too young.

Yes it is abridged, but the story does not suffer from this. I think this is much better than Patrick Stewart's recording, which attempts to tell the story with Mr. Stewart doing all the characters by himself. Which is a good effort, but this recordingis a little bit more like an old radio play, and I think tells the story more effectively."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"\\"You will be haunted by Three Spirits.&quot; So forewarns Jacob Marley's ghost to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge, a miser of stingy, unfavorable traits. And so begins the enduring Christmas classic distinguished by almost everyone. Come along on an erratic journey with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future, all of whom attempt to point Scrooge onto a virtuous path. Meet the most notable characters ever introduced in literature: Bob Cratchit, angelic Tiny Tim, and good-natured Fred. With vivid descriptions of Victorian England and enlightening dialogue, 'A Christmas Carol' will enrapture both the young and old throughout the year with a vital lesson on hope and benevolence for humanity. This, I find, is treasured most of all in this brief story marvelously crafted by the creative Charles Dickens. No matter how many adaptations of the book one has seen on television or as films, the real source is highly recommended and should not be missed. For if you do pass the book up, you are being just a Scrooge (metamorphically speaking, of course!)."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a great book for everyone!

Reccommended for everybody!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"The formatting is well done and it's nice to have a TOC that links, but the file seems to be missing its images."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Once again I find it a bit daunting to write a review of what is arguably one of the most well-known classic stories. I, like most people I know, grew up with Scrooge (although the form has changed). From Donald Duck to Jim Carrey, I've listened to the story of the grumpy, old, miserly man and his miraculous change of heart on one fateful Christmas Eve.My aunt actually ordered A Christmas Carol for her kindle and I saw the email and thought - oh, that would make a great read-along book for December. Perfect season, I've never read it.. but oh.. it's DICKENS. I don't know about you, but just the name Dickens is enough to strike fear deep into my heart. I struggled so much with A Tale of Two Cities and David Copperfield back in the day that, although interested to see how the book was, I approached this story with not a little bit of trepidation.It also helped to know it was short. I'll admit it.For those of you who haven't read the book, let me just say - put aside everything you know about Dickens from his other works and give this one a shot. It's remarkably easy to understand and, although he can go on, due to the shortness of the book as a whole, the descriptions don't get too much out of hand.There were quite a few things in the book that surprised me - details that really rounded out the story much more than the movies ever have. I regret that I've let all these years go by without establishing the reading of this story as atradition for myself, but it is something I intend to change in the upcoming years."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Great Christmas novel about a man that was stingy and grumpy. The Christmas spirit got a hold of him and turned him into a very giving and happy man."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This is a review of the September 2010 paperback edition from ACTA Publications with an introduction by John Shea.Though few have read the book, most people are familiar with A Christmas Carol, the Charles Dickens classic about Ebenezer Scrooge and the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future. Author and Publisher Gregory Augustine Pierce numbers it among his favorites. Thus, when he was visiting a bed and breakfast, he was delighted to find a beautifully rendered edition that was in the public domain. That meant he didn't need permission to reproduce the version he had discovered. He called on friends and favorite artists to work on the book design, illustrations, and cover. Theologian John Shea agreed to write the introduction. The final touch was applied by the publisher's office manager who, Pierce says, \\"found a red ribbon, put it on A Christmas Carol, and it was complete,\\" a beautiful Christmas gift.Shea suggests that those approaching the book as a \\"must-read yawn,\\" will be surprised at the connections to be drawn between Scrooge and ourselves, and the pull to consider our own past, present, and future. He characterizes the unconverted Scrooge as smoldering with anger, rationalizing against helping the needy, and choosing isolation over communion. Scrooge's conversion, Shea explains, is a result of \\"the unyielding work of grace, the theological atmosphere that envelopes the Christmas season.\\"The ghosts show Scrooge the opportunities he has missed, the isolation of his current life, and the promise of an un-mourned death. But conversion is still possible for Scrooge and for us, Shea writes, citing the end of A Christmas Carol. In the final paragraph, Dickens reveals that Scrooge had learned how to keep Christmas well and expresses the following hope: \\"May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!\\""},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I have always loved this story and enjoy the old english language which some reviewers did not like.

As far as I can tell, this is the complete and unabridged version, with a few illustrations. It's very inexpensive, but is not made as cheaply as some paperbacks, so I don't think it will fall apart immediately. Here's hoping!

Dickens was a master and I feel a little silly even reviewing this classic tale. I will comment that the text was error free as far as I noticed.

Again, it was FREE! how can I not rate it a 5?"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"What does one expect with a thrift edition? It is best used as an inexpensive stocking stuffer. This version of the immortal Xmas classic cannot be destroyed by splotchy editing and a difficult to read font size. Purchase a magnifying glass the size of a frisbee, click on the fireplace, snuggle into a Snuggie, sip some Swiss-Miss, curl into the La-Z-Boy and read this timeless work while drifting like a ghost into Xmas past.Personally, I would purchase a finer edition than this. Dickens Christmas Carol is the type of read that must be completed via a REAL book, preferably an old leather bound edition with decorative end papers and such. The tactile creases in the paper, the creak of the bindings, light dust thumbed away on the top ream, the smell of old musks radiating from text, natural oils reflecting off the leather binding...The Kindle serves a purpose but nothing beats an old book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I ordered the audio book A CHRISTMAS CAROL to use with my class.

On the first page, there's this wry joke about how Marley was \\"dead as a door-nail,\\" then goes on to speculate about why door-nails are more dead than, say, coffin-nails. This sets the tone for a powerful tale of redemption and change laced with both humor and a bit of fear (all these ghosts!). At the end of it all, Dickens inspires us to be better with this old story; he really captures a \\"spirit of Christmas\\" (and I listened to the story in March).Second, the reader: Jim Dale is simply one of the best in the business. He lends similar creative, dramatic interpretation to his characters here as in his masterful readings of the Harry Potter books. We plan to initiate a family Christmas tradition of listening to this audiobook every December, letting it both entertain and inspire us."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Mr. Dale provides his usual vocal magic to bring Dickens' immortal holiday classic to life. Excellent narration, sprightly character voices and the reader's sense of good fun make this recording my personal favorite of 'A Christmas Carol'.If you enjoy this then pick up more of Mr. Dale's audiobook recordings. I highly recommend all 6 of the Harry Potter audiobooks *on CD of course as you will wear your tapes out & replace them constantly* and 'Peter & the Starcatchers'."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This edition of Charles Dickens classic is doubly wonderful in its timeless tale of redemption as well as the wonderful illustrations executed by American artist Everett Shinn. In no way either slick or modern, when one is handed the book, it seems as you are holding an artifact from another time; a time of coal fires, slate roofs, horses in the streets, a time that predates the sad state of comercialism that permeates contemporary Christmas season. In its simplicity of story and its fine nostalgic illustrations it becomes a treasure to be handed down through one generation to the next.Hope dwells here."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"This review is of the free version of the story.Overall, a very disappointing read. The story is superb, probably the best Christmas story other than the story of Christmas itself, but the formatting is outright horrible. No effort was put into proper conversion from print to ebook. It was literally scanned with text recognition and exported to HTML. There are characters that display incorrectly because they are just 'typed' and are not the correct code. The page numbers from the print version are randomly scattered through the text, making it very hard to read. There are no page breaks, no table of contents, and absolutely no formatting whatsoever. Some text is in caps, other text in bold, you know where I'm going. Download it and see for yourself.You are better off spending $.99 on a decently formatted version of this story. I have tried a sample of several versions and this one has left me fairly happyA Christmas Carol, as it looks to be very professionally done(Embedded cover, active table of contents, page-breaks, appropriate 'stave' headings, etc. I imagine it will be the same way throughout the book).

He can redeem himself!Scrooge is visited by three more spirits that Christmas eve. His past, his present and his future. Each take him on a fantastic journey,through time and space, showing him how his ways are wrong, and what will happen if he doesn't change.Scrooge goes through subtle changes at first, is humbled by the spirits, and then he is transformed from a bitter man to a caring human being. His new found appreciation of mankind is contagious.

Dickens' wonderful story about the meaning of the Christmas Spirit is a story that we all know, but if you haven't enjoyed the original version (or haven't for a long time) I strongly recommend you do so, and soon. While the cartoons and children's books get the general gist of the story across, they lack the subtle qualities that make it so beautiful and compelling in its original form. Heart-wrenchingly emotional scenes of Family and chuckle-inducing moments of humor propel you through this story that provides a powerful lesson for us all.Also, this short book provides an excellent example of the writing style of Dickens without getting into an 800+ page monstrosity that most of his other works are. You'll almost certainly find you love his subtle wit and dry sense of humor while reading this one, and I then encourage you to seek out those other monstrous and magnificent novels.Whether you buy it in this version, or another, get your hands on Dickens' original tale.

Mesmerized by the three ghosts, the stinginess of Ebenezer Scrooge, and the frailty of Tiny Tim, I kept the book beside my bed, tucked under the lamp on the night stand close at hand in the family home in Iowa. When the situation seemed unbearable within the walls where the family quarreled daily, I would read it, and imagine myself freed from the hatred around me.When I began teaching at a small rural Iowa college. I risked everything to introduce A Christmas Carol to my students as representative of 19th century England: the work houses, the potato famine and hunger, the miserliness of those with financial means to stay aloof from the ever-increasing poor. Reading Dickens' Christmas Carol enabled many to discover that life had not changed that much. At night, when I would return to my small apartment on the second floor of an old wooden house, buffeted by harsh winds and empty space, prepared a cup of potato soup or wheat gruel for supper, I began to feel myself to be an ever increasing part of Dickens' tale.Later when I taught at major universities in the USA and abroad, the Dickens classic was my constant companion. When I taught English history or English literature it was required reading. Discussions turned to interpretation and the book's relationship to the present clime and time: we went through the counting houses of banks, the dark alleys where the gin-soaked poor brought stolen goods to those who would resell, and the holes where prostitutes earned a scant living, much as occurs today. Of course I encouraged my students to also read Hard Times, Oliver Twist and other Dickens classics to discover the misery of the Industrial Age and the scorn the rich had for the poor, outsourcing jobs, lending money at usurious rates, and the calloused treatment of employees. Things had not changed much, and personal choice was only for the wealthy who counted for about 1% of the people.At sixty I moved to one of the poorest, most heavily impoverished nations where crime is a daily routine, education at best a joke, and plagiarism expected and condoned by teachers at all levels. In 2007, after Antonio Chang enforced the law to test all teachers in Peru, when I learned that only 151 out of more than 185,000 teachers who were tested for basic compentency had passed, I offered to teach the teachers. My first book of choice was A Christmas Carol as it covers every art and literary aspect of dialogue and education. I am still teaching the teachers--the few who allow me the honor, while most prefer to stay at home or travel to a second and/or third school to teach for additional income. I am still using Charles Dickens' stellar work. I pull out my weathered copy of A Christmas Carol and read it to my students and collegues, and then show the George C. Scott rendition of the classic that is now on DVD and fortunately is available at Amazon.com. Several students swiftly see the similarity between 19th century London and contemporary Peru where survival remains the primary goal and the only source of hope was within the walls of churches. Unfortunately the 1% of Peru who own the means of production and wealth have not yet met the Ghost of Christmas Past and the clergy they sit in front of like marble statues are more like Dostoyovsky's Grand Inquistor in his classic The Brothers Karamazov than the pastor in Dickens' Christmas Carol.A Christmas Carol is mandatory reading in my English classes. Passing any course I teach requires a demonstrative ability to show the relevance of the Dickens' classic about Ebeneezer Scrooge to the twenty-first century elites who still rule over lives and destinies.Today the students at my university in the north of Peru, are working to help the very poor nestled on a small hill in front of the great gates to this privately-owned center of learning to plan for running water and a sewer, to go to school, to look for better jobs, and improve their lot in life. The wasteland that many have moved to in order to escape the depression in the mountains is but a mirror of the rampant poverty of the shanties surrounding Lima, but in each case A Christmas Carol's presentation of the poor districtions of London are easily understood by the poor of Peru, and Ebeneezer's epiphany is readily known and hoped for as a better future for all. Peru has a long way to go before it will climb out of the abyss it is in because of a too-long history of rule by dictators and teachers who occupied classrooms for the limited money but without any skills to impart knowledge, A Christmas Carol gives hope to those who seek a better life, and the Ghost of Christmas past still has its finger pointing at marked graves at those who have no charity, no compassion,no sense of feeling. Dickens' tale will help change that and I will teach it as long as there is breath in this old body."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"One of the classics, a must read.It's a nice warming Christmas story about old uncle Scrooge.

The story itself stands the test of time(as everyne knows), and I enjoyed the differences in the way English was spoken at the time of its writng, as well as the many references to things that are now obsolete, or practices no longer necessary due to modern inventions. It is a peek back into another century.This Apple Classic version is just a pulp paperback copy, but it gets the job done if you are merely wishing to read content. There are only a few minimal line drawings scattered through the book."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"(Star rating is for this special edition.) The Eyewitness Classics edition (ISBN 0789420708) of this popular Christmas story by Dickens has been \\"translated\\" for a younger audience, offering much historical background and outstanding illustrations while sticking closely to the original dialogue and format. With modern illustrations by Andrew Wheatcroft, this edition also features some of the engravings from the period in explanatory sections which are interleaved with the Dickens story.As the chapters of Dickens's classic unfold, the child reader also learns about Dickens's London, with paragraphs about the city and its smells and the emphasis on work for all, including children. Subsequent sections contrast the working poor with the rich, delving into the subjects of workhouses and prisons, the 7-day workweek for servants, and the lives of businessmen. When Marley's ghost appears, the reader learns about the recording of deaths in a registry--along with the meaning of \\"grindstone,\\" the importance of Christmas charity, and the custom of servants taking the master's clothes, with the remainder going to \\"rag and bone shops.\\"As the three spirits appear, additional information is provided about clothing, dances and games, foods (roast goose, Christmas pudding, and chestnuts), Christmas gifts and trees, and even about the \\"crutches and frames\\" used by Tiny Tim. Dickens's biography is mentioned briefly, with a stress on his childhood and work history, along with notes about various film versions of this and other Dickens stories, including photos of some of the stars who have played Scrooge.Graphically, this edition is a winner, with beautifully reproduced illustrations, a newspaper-style paste-up (with boxes, sidebars, and text and pictures set at angles to attract attention), and excellent clarity and color. Parents, grandparents, and friends looking for an edition which will prepare children to love a stage or film version of this classic will be richly rewarded by this edition.

Who, in the Western world has not heard, &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot; And who can forget the now almost hackneyed line of Tiny Tim, &quot;God bless us, every one!&quot; or his cheerfully poignant observation, that he did not mind the stares of strangers in church, for he might thus serve as a reminder of He who made the lame, walk and the blind, see. Several movie versions: musical, animated, updated, or standard; as well as stage productions (I recall the Cleveland Playhouse and McCarter Theatre\`s with fondess.) have brought the wonderful characterizations to the screen, as well as to life. This story of the redemption of the bitter and spiritually poor miser, and the book itself; however, is a timeless treasure whose richness, like Mrs Cratchit\`s Christmas pudding, is one that no production can hope to fully capture."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"Charles Dicken's A Christmas Carol is by far one of the greatest holiday novels ever. It was first printed in the winter of 1843 and it is still in printing to this day. This classic story of Christmas joy and Christmas hate has been one of my favorite books of all time. The interaction between Ebenezer Scrooge and the supernatural is humorous and touching. When Scrooge sees the troubles the Crachits are having with money, tiny tim, etc., it is moving to see Scrooge change his way of treating bob and a number of other people. I hope that this novel will hold its ground as one of the greatest holiday novels man has known."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I chose this rating because it I was a great book.

A must-read for everyone,regardless of age. Although Dicken wrote it back in December,1843,It still very much related to this very day. This book suits every era and even more now into the 21st century. It showed a great example what's is Christmas all about. Sharing,loving and giving...Charles Dicken's timeless classic about a miser,Ebenezer Scrooge whom couldn't understand the true spirit of Christmas. However with helps from 3 Spirits(ghosts) namely Ghost of Christmas Past,Ghost of Christmas Present and Ghost of Christmas Future,each showing him envisions of his past,present and what will happened if he continue being mean and a miser.He came to face up with his pasts, realised his mistakes and turned a new leaf and became grateful to life and learn to be loving and giving. He also learnt to be appreciate people around him and learnt to share his life with his nephew and helped less fortunate people like Tiny Tim. Eventually he honour Christmas in his heart.May Dicken's brilliant prose always be remembered. I quote: &quot;I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.&quot; CD"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"ALmost everyone knows the story of the Christmas Carol, either through the muppets or Bill Murray, but few haave read the book.You should read this book, unlike many of Dickens other books it is simple and not over long.

It has been adapted into so many variations (my favorite is \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol.\\"). However, the story still remains fresh and a pleasure to read.A short novel, this is still classic Dickens. His characters have depth and even insignificant characters are given a human quality. Of course, the curmudgeon Scrooge and his transformation is the focus of the novel, and Dickens delivers an enthralling, somewhat eerie story as the wraiths (spirits) of Christmas attempt to instill a human warmth in Scrooge's cold heart.There is nothing new or earth-shattering in the novel. Almost all the adaptations have more or less adapted the text of Dickens novel. There are a few extra places and people that are visited that don't appear the movie adaptations. However, overall it is the same story that you know and love, and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"A Christmas Carol, written by Charles Dickens is a book of being given a second chance. Ebenezer Scrooge, the main character of the book, is a grumpy old man who feels he has no time for anyone. As an owner of a firm called Scrooge and Marley's, Scrooge runs the business while Marley has been dead. On Christmas Eve, exactly seven years from Marley's death, his ghost visits Scrooge. He tells him that soon three different ghost will visit him during the night.As promised, the ghosts of the past, present, and the future visit Scrooge. He is visited by the ghosts because of his rude attitude and his disregard for anyone's attempt to be nice, which we all find ourselves doing now and then. The past shows Scrooge how he used to be, which was somewhat pleasant but still lonely for Scrooge. The present shows Scrooge his actions in a way Scrooge has never realized, most of which are to his dislike. The future shows the time when Scrooge is dead and no one cares for him, actually they are happy that he is gone. All of these visions has Scrooge sobbing in tears and ready to make changes in his life.The book is cleverly written and fun to read. It often makes you put yourself into Scrooge's situations. My favorite part of the book is when Scrooge visited the past. I think it would be great to revisit all of the things you used to have in life. My least favorite part of the book is when Scrooge is dead in the future, instead of mourning, everyone is interested in his death will. It would be horrible to leave earth in such a way that all anyone wants is your money.As far as recommending the book for others, I believe its a great story especially for the holidays. If you are into the Christmas glee spirit then you would like the book, especially the ending. A Christmas Carol can make you angry, cry and laugh all throughout the book. Its a story of one man whos favorite words, \\"Bah Humbug\\" becomes sincere and realizes all that he can accomplish in life."},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"I've always liked the story of \\"A Christmas Carol\\", whether it was a live action film version, the Muppet version, the Disney animated version, even one of the dozens of sitcom parodies. I finally got round to reading the original, and I quite enjoyed it. Even though I'd seen and heard so many versions of the story, reading it was still very special.It's a tale about a man called Ebenezer Scrooge, who runs a business successfully and tightly. A little too tightly, most would say. Though he has a lot of money, he has none to spare for charity. Though he has a lot of time to himself, he has none to spare for his cheerful nephew. Christmas is coming, and Scrooge wishes it was over. What reason does everyone have to be so cheery? What reason do they have to stop work and get in the way of his business? He's pretty cemented in his views, though he and his worldview begins to crack the night he is visited by four ghosts. The first is the chained ghost of his dead business partner, Jacob Marley, and the other three the Ghosts of Christmas: The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. He is shown the beauty in all that he has criticized, the joy in things he has forgotten, and the grief his crabby ways have caused himself and others.The book is a little different from all the interpretations I have seen, but not by too much. The Ghost of Christmas Present takes Scrooge to a lot more places, like over the sea to a Christmas party on a ship, for instance. Dickens is warm and wordy here, and captures the bustle, the sights, the sounds and the tastes of Christmas very well. This is not the tacky, forced Christmas cheer you see on some television specials. Not at all.Even though it's a lot shorter than many of his other books, Dickens still pays attention to his characters. Even the minor ones have a personality in the few words Dickens uses to describe them. Being short, it doesn't take too long to read. It's divided into five \\"Staves\\", one for each of the four ghostly encounters and the ending, which helps build the anticipation up as you read, and makes it easy to find your favorite part later. There are also a few illustrations by John Leech, which are nice.It's definitely worth reading, if you're interested. It's pretty cheap here on amazon, so even if you're Scrooge you'll be getting a good deal!"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol (Classic Fiction)","review":"the author is Charles dickens. there are 112 pges. the story begins w/ scrooge in his counting-house on a frigid, foggy christmas eve in london. the characters are: scrooge, bob cratchit, tiny tim, jacob marely, the ghosts of christmas past, present, and future, fred, fezziwig, belle, peter cratchit, martha cratchit, the portly gentlemen, and mrs. cratchit. the setting is one frigid, foggy christmas eve in london to a happy but still cold christmas day. the beginning of the plot starts by an old man named scrooge, a very greedy person who hates christmas and loves money, counting his money in a counitng house. the rising action is: the mean old man is haunted by four ghost, including Bob marely. this book is very inspiring book to those who are mean greedy of money and those especially that hate christmas.i like this book because i used to take christmas as a day of juss getting presents and it taught me that christmas is really about love and family. this book showed me that even though they give me a cheap gift but to thank the person fer giving it to me. like the saying goes,: \\"its the thoght that counts.\\" if you are a hater or that u dont really care about christmas, read this book. it will changhe ur thought aboput christmas. this book is very interesting. readers all over the world should read it. this book teaches people that take Christmas fer granted a lesson. this book inspires, teches, and somewhat entertains. read dis book! and you'll think so 2."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],q={key:0},M={key:1};function F(s,e,n,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",B,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,D)):b("",!0)])}const P=u(x,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-61e3c3a2"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/48.md","filePath":"quotes/48.md"}'),E={name:"quotes/48.md"},W=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(P)]))}});export{L as __pageData,W as default};
