Delanie's reason for being in the jungle, how she got there, and the part she was playing didn't sit well with me at all. A kindergarten teacher??? Nah! Supposedly she was only 'playing' a bimbo.... some of her actions convinced me that she really was!

The way CA descibed him was just awesome.... Now I did have a small problem with the fact that he couldn't keep his pants zipped at a couple a really important times... a person would think that a man in his position would have a little more self-control that that.... but oh well, this is fiction read for fun, right?!All in all though, I enjoyed reading this one. It was an original storyline (for a romance novel anyway), the hero was to die for, and it never let me get bored (which is very important to me).

It was also a life-saver when I was learning General Relativity because of its clear and careful exposition. Schrodinger was doing this back when nobody was quite sure what the deal was with, e.g., index notation, and he took pains to lay out the benefits -- but also the limits -- of that system. See, for example, his discussion of the derivative operator, something that is almost always glossed over.I'm in the middle of my dissertation now, and every now and then I hit on a subtlety in GR that my advisor has missed but I caught from reading this book.Don't get thinking that this is Schrodinger's book on the unified field. It is more like the lecture notes of a very intelligent man figuring out what on Earth this truly new version of gravity is all about.In the end of course this book is too slim to live on its own as a GR text.

These we will call \\"time lines\\". From these infinite lines spread more infinite lines. We'll call these \\"destiny lines\\". Then there are more and more destiny lines branching from those destiny lines, and so on and so forth. They get very complicated. Time lines are the original paths of time. Destiny lines are the lines of time determined by what happens along the time lines. Sounds confusing? Well, anything you do creates a new destiny line. As I write this, I am creating a new destiny line. The future may be different if I didn't write this at all. Time planes are the collection of one timeline and all destiny lines spreading from it.

Later, Cow reincarnates a woman who'd had eleven children in her human life, breastfed them all, and regretted the moment when each was weaned.

Having just finished the book, here's my assessment of the pros and cons of this book:PROS1) This is a good introductory look at the history of early commercial and air mail aviation. I've never read anything about this subject before, and was captivated by the bare-knuckle drama of the entire enterprise.2) The book immediately immerses the reader in the danger and unexpected nature of early flight within the first few pages.3) The authors do a great job of presenting the astounding obstacles of time, money, weather, manpower and resources to the development of a reliable air mail service.4) The research is documented and footnoted in the back of the book to assist further reading.5) The photographs are wonderful glimpses into an all-but-forgotten world, where the joie d'vivre and devil-may-care attitude of early flight (as well as the lines of care and constant exposure to danger) are clearly visible in the eyes and faces of the aircrews involved.CONS1) There are no maps in a book that talks about developing landing strips and air routes in little-known areas of the country. At least one good map in a book of this nature would have been most useful.2) A bibliography would have been helpful to those seeking further reading.3) The bios of the pilots might have been better served as sidebars or separate vignettes entitled \\"The Airmen\\" or some such, rather than weaving them with varying effectiveness throughout the story (i.e., \\"Wild\\" Bill Hopson).4) The tone of the book fluctuates unexpectedly between scholarly and popular fiction, and sometimes even goes completely over the top (such as inventing an imaginary shooting script for Douglas Fairbank's war bond air mail promotion).5) At times, the passage of time is difficult to track as the authors jump forward, then backtrack to tell other portions of the story.As a popular and easily accessible introduction to the world of early air mail, \\"Mavericks of the Sky\\" is a fine read despite the few failings and foibles noted above. The best recommendation that I can give is what I'll do next ... pass it on to a friend who is a pilot and loves the history of early aviation."},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"In the historical non-fiction, Mavericks of the Sky, the authors have recounted the exacting tale of bold men during the last stages of World War One. With hardened courage they worked against the grain of public and political opinion, and boldly took steps to create the first United States Air Mail Service.With a shoestring budget, cast-off military equipment and neophyte pilots with a sense of daring unequalled in this day and age, two sons of Texas--Albert Burleson and Otto Praeger--stood firm in their convictions. The future of the United States Postal service lay in creating a service that would take advantage of the Wright Brothers flight accomplishment only a few years earlier.The feat accomplished by Praeger and his men in less than three years was the precursor to all flight operations that take place on a day-to-day basis in this country today.From an inauspicious and somewhat deadly beginning, the US Air Mail Service was forged by the guts and sweat of Praeger and the first pilots of the aptly nicknamed \\"Suicide Club.\\" This small group of dedicated men spawned the first commercial U.S. airlines and the person-to-person connection by mail that we hold so dear today.The account of the first transcontinental flight on February 22-23, 1921, from San Francisco to New York, is awe-inspiring in itself. The fact it was accomplished in the time (33 hours and 20 minutes) we consider industry standard today is astounding. The bar was set high during those two days. The difference: today we use high-flying jet aircraft to deliver our airmail shipments. In 1921 a half dozen pilots used a variety of single engine, open cockpit aircraft made of canvas and wood, in all weather, rarely flying higher than ten thousand feet.Armchair Interviews says: In Mavericks of the Sky Barry Rosenburg and Catherine Macauley extensively researched and gave us a concise accounting of these men and the trials and tribulations they endured in the effort to construct the delivery systems for the U.S. Mail."},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"A chance purchase at the airport bookstore resulted in an enjoyable flight across the country while immersed in the early days of Flying.Having already been captivated by this subject after reading Beryl Markham's \\"West with the Night\\", this view of flight's maturation and the start of its commercialinzation process was fascinating.It led to many questions including what lessons might be derived from this experience as NASA attempts to move towards commercialiation efforts of its own. It made me crave more in depth analysis of specific problem solving methods and long for a map of the various fields and distances.There are intriguiing modern day parallels on how to apply technology and the process via which technology can be deployed to affect improvement, efficiency, and service.There is no better material than that which entertains, leades to questions, and furthers an interest!If you already have an interest in the topic or if you never wondered how the whole thing got started but it now sounds intriguing, I strongly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"Such detail that you feel like you in the plane with them. Get read from front to back. BUY THIS."},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"Mavericks of the Sky brings to life a seldom remembered tale of when the U.S. Postal service (as opposed to airlines and contractors) flew the mail. For a decade, young men, many recently released from military service, climbed into wood and fabric biplanes to conquer gravity, weather and imperfect aircraft to get the mail through.A few technical errors creep in: in one instance they say that one of the pilots became a flier because pilots were lauded in print and radio. The trouble is the authors were referring to 1920, years before commercial broadcasting began. Later, they refer to the Junkers mail planes as \\"twin-engined\\". Sorry, the Junkers had one engine. As a pilot and aviation historian, I get the feeling that the authors aren't in their usual element as the author's descriptions of the people involved seem a lot surer than their descriptions of equipment and flight. Still, it's impressive that someone took the time to research a little remembered slice of aviation history.I found myself wishing they had taken their story to the end of the Post Office flying operations in 1926.A suggestion for a future book, a look at how the ill-equipped U.S. Army Air Corp was tasked with flying the mail after FDR hastily cancelled airline contracts in 1934 on the assumption that the bidding process was somehow rigged.

Full of anecdotal tales stretching from the humble beginnings up until the departure of the key founders of the service, the book provides keen insight into the motivations and driving forces behind air transport of the mail. It is a good read.However, what prevents this from being a great survey of the early air mail services are many of the objections of previous reviewers, namely a lack of maps and charts and other graphical data to statistically support the commentary (I for one, would have loved some graphical/statistical depictions of the various aircraft discussed) as well as insight into the overall reception and reaction of airmail service from those in power and those on the street (never do we learn whether the general public or elected officials appreciate the expedited air mail or not).Furthermore, in reality, the story is really the story of air mail service during the Wilson administration with only minor attention paid to the service in subsequent administrations. Very little detail is provided about the privatization of the service in later years and no anecdotal stories from this daring period are provided (i.e. the development of Charles Lindbergh's piloting skills that would ultimately lead to his Atlantic-crossing solo flight).But, for anyone wishing to discover the details, facts, stories and people behind the earliest days of U.S. Airmail, \\"Mavericks of the Sky\\" provides a very solid and very good starting point. Using the notes provided by the authors, one can glean additional sources to further one's study.

I thought that the book was clear and well written. There are a few small hiccups that interrupt an otherwise clearly flowing history of the U.S. Air mail.You pretty much have to be an aero-phile (my word for aviation fanatic), history buff, or have some freakish interest in the U.S. Postal service to enjoy this book, definitely not for a casual reader. A quick, clear history of the U.S. Air Mail and the daring men and woman who have helped make aviation what it is today!"},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"Congratulations are in order to the authors of Mavericks of the Sky. Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay managed to create a story, almost three hundred pages, about the beginnings of air mail in the United States that could have been all summed up in their thirty page epilogue. Rosenberg and Macaulay, at first, seem to be well proven authors with many successful publications under their belts. Both have published work for publications such as Aviation Week & Space Technology, E/The Environment Magazine, and the Daily Racing Forum. It is important to remember that looks can be deceiving.Webster's Dictionary defines Maverick as a person or individual that does not get along well with others. It is quite odd that that Rosenberg and Macaulay would title their work and label the founding men of aviation and air mail as \\"Mavericks\\", but maybe the name was stolen from Top Gun. The book basically sums up the stories of the early pioneers of aviation that led to the formation of air mail and the airlines as we know them today. It is quite amazing that a topic of such interest could be told in such a confusing and unprofessional manner as Rosenberg and Macaulay demonstrated.Mavericks of the Sky begins with the ill famous story of Major Reuben Hollis Fleet, and his tedious role in the formation of the air mail service. The book continues with the story of Major Fleet and introduces numerous amounts of characters that some how had a role in early air mail service. The authors present a story that would be quite sufficient for the average 7th grader, but not for anyone who has the slightest inclination about the overwhelming amount of information that should be told about the pioneers of the air mail service.Rosenberg and Macaulay are successful in telling the story of the air mail service as much like a comedy skit off of Saturday Night Live. Both continually change from the tone of a scholarly author to that of one that seems to be writing an episode of Seinfeld. It is easy to spot numerous examples throughout the book where both authors display a carefree attitude in the telling of an incident, and the average reader loses the historical meaning of the incident, because they become caught up in a joke. The authors may simply be meaning to poke harmlessly at the mishaps of these early pioneers, but it is suggested that they stick to a more serious attitude when discussing men who lost their lives day in and day out to further a dream.The epilogue of this book was much more beneficial that reading the story itself. Information was presented better and more organized than through the twenty something chapters in Mavericks of the Sky. The epilogue simply shortened all the various stories presented throughout the book and got right to the point instead of a bunch of ad lib.Rosenberg and Macaulay deserve much credit on the pictures contained in the book, because they give the book much more character. It is easy to gain a lot of understanding of what early aviation was like by flipping through the pictures contained within this book, but it is sad that neither author can take credit for these pictures. Pictures make a book very personnel and these deliver the wide array of attitudes presented by these men and women just be looking into their eyes.This book is a great recommendation for anyone interested in a quick read with little information. Mavericks of the Sky, is very selective in the stories it tells about the formation and development of the air mail service in the United States. If the reader desires to have a more detailed understanding of these pioneers and their stories, it is recommended that this book be passed up and one chosen by someone who actually can write a historical work of non-fiction!"},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"Dear Readers, the co-author and I have been thrilled at the positive response to the publication of MAVERICKS OF THE SKY, and while we understand that not every story is for every taste, we have to take exception with the comments of Mr. Carnett in his review of our book (in his first review on Amazon).There have been a number of obscure scholarly works on the subject of the founding of the U.S. Air Mail service in which the authors did little more than recite names, dates, and pounds of mail carried. We believed that none of those books did justice to the bravery, tenacity and sacrifice of the air mail pilots and the government officials who organized the service. In MAVERICKS OF THE SKY, it was our intention to tell their stories in a new and exciting way so that the readers are caught up in the danger and adventure and not bogged down by the bureaucratic details. The historian for the U.S. Post Office said no other book ever written on the air mail gives the reader a better \\"you are there\\" emotional pull.We spent years researching their stories and treated the pilots with the utmost respect. They cursed every now and then and we're sorry that the previous reviewer was offended by that. We made light of what was funny and pointed out the absurd, all in the hopes of humanizing the story. Pilots are notorious for gallows humor and often referred to themselves as part a \\"suicide club\\".We also took great pains to place the founding of air mail in the context of the times: World War I, the progressive administration of President Woodrow Wilson, suffrage and the Jazz Age. We're disappointed that the reviewer felt that these asides were distracting but it is that type of detail that brings the story to life.We've received dozens of positive reviews since publication, and every other reviewer got exactly what it was we were trying to accomplish.The Associated Press called the book \\"an enthralling saga, told in a smooth, agile style.\\"Air & Space magazine wrote that \\"the authors introduce a succession of fascinating characters who flew the mail\\" and said the book \\"is a should read story of forgotten flying pioneers who earned their keep in the hardest way.\\"Publishers Weekly and Booklist (the publication of the American Library Association) also understood our point of view in their reviews, which are included in the Amazon listing. Also, dozens and dozens of libraries in North America have purchased the book for their collectionsMAVERICKS OF THE SKY is both meticulously researched and fun to read. We're proud to have been able to bring to light to forgotten chapter in American history. Thanks for your time. Barry"},{"Title":"Mavericks of the Sky: The First Daring Pilots of the U.S. Air Mail","review":"In Mavericks of the Sky, Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay present the daring and heroic tale of the first set of air mail pilots in the world. Mavericks of the Sky brings to life the many characters who risked their lives on a daily basis in order for the delivery of the mail. The pilots of the United States Air Mail conquered the impossible task of transporting cargo on a regular schedule through inhospitable terrain and weather. Unfortunately, an interesting topic becomes tedious due to poor writing and poor organization.According to the back cover of the book, Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay are both professional writers who have made their livings writing for various magazines. Having written for Aviation Week and Space Technology, Rosenberg is the only writer with aviation writing experience. It appears that neither Rosenberg nor Macaulay has written a book of any length. One particularly trying item is the authors' tendency to interject curse words into the exposition. It is simply out of place in a scholarly and historical work to use words such as \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" to underscore a point. Furthermore, Rosenberg and Macaulay do not even use the curse words to underscore a point. The words only serve to detract and distract from the writers ultimate purpose - whatever that may be.Mavericks of the Sky suffers from a lack of discernable purpose. The authors possess a broad purpose of informing the reader about the United States Air Mail operation. However, this is a wide topic and the authors address many topics that are outside of the purview of the history of the air mail system. Rosenberg and Macaulay often stray from their supposed topic to enlighten the reader on postal history or the history of Belmont Park. While these items may seem interesting in a historical context, the frequent digressions of the authors detract from the overall purpose and meaning of the book. The scope of Mavericks of the Sky is far too broad. While the title states that the book is about the \\"first daring pilots of the U.S. air mail,\\" it seems that the authors meander through a history of the air mail whilst only mentioning the pilots when it becomes necessary in the storyline.In the end, it seems that Rosenberg and Macaulay cannot make a decision on which authorial voice they wish to use. At times, the authors use a scholarly voice to discuss the heroes of the airmail. However, at other times, Rosenberg and Macaulay opt or a more entertaining approach as if trying to make the reader laugh at seemingly innocuous details. Early in the book, the authors recount the arrival of Lt. George Boyle at the airfield in Washington, D.C. the day of the inaugural mail run. With President Woodrow Wilson present, Postmaster General Albert Sidney Burleson rushes to meet Boyle with a bouquet of spring flowers in hand. Rosenberg and Macaulay interject with, \\"the sight of the notoriously terse postmaster general holding a bunch of spring flowers in his arms, trying to pass them over to man clad in all leather appeared awkward at best.\\" What does this statement mean? Are the authors implying that Boyle and Burleson were gay? Are the authors implying that Boyle and Burleson were homosexuals involved in sadomasochism? While it is likely that the authors are simply trying to make light of a humorous occurrence, both the joke and the implication are irrelevant and improper in a work of historical non-fiction.Rosenberg and Macaulay display a clear lack of understanding of their subject throughout Mavericks of the Sky. Aviation, and specifically aviation history, requires an understanding of the dynamics of flight, the inherent risk involved, and the enormous sacrifice that all aviators must make to pursue the dream of flight. Early in the air mail service, the authors describe the organization as \\"an operational nightmare reflecting a mere 78 percent on-time success rate.\\" Only fifteen years after the first flight at Kitty Hawk, a four out of five success rate does not seem so horrific. Without the aid of instrument navigation, weather reports, or reliable aircraft instrumentation the aviators were lucky to arrive at their destination at all. Most appalling of all, is the flippant terms and jokes the authors make several times throughout the book. At one point, the authors refer to the air mail service as \\"Uncle Sam's Suicide Club.\\" In a book where the supposed main purpose is to inform the reader of the history of the United States Air Mail, referring to the sacrifices made by the heroic aviators so flippantly is preposterous. To refer to an aviator and soldier's ultimate sacrifice for his country and his love for aviation as a \\"suicide club\\" is morally irreprehensible. In the lengthy epilogue, the authors note that forty-three American citizens lost their lives in service of the air mail. The authors commit an egregious violation of trust and simple good taste by referring to the air mail pilots as part of a \\"suicide club.\\"In conclusion, Mavericks of the Sky is an interesting topic that is poorly executed. The authors continually sabotage their own attempts at proper writing through poor organization and poor writing. The time of the United States Air Mail service is an exciting and interesting time in the history of America and the history of aviation. Unfortunately, Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay have not done the aviators justice."},{"Title":"Express Italian: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Express)","review":"In reading some of the other reviews I am amazed at what people think a single CD course will accomplish. The Pimsleur Express courses (I've used Spanish, French, Italian, German and Russian) are not gimmicks, but merely an effort to provide a bit of comfort with spoken basics and travel expressions. If I want to learn a language well enough to survive several weeks in a foreign country I know I'll need a more indepth course than this. These do, however, give me enough to do one of those tours where I'm spending 2, 3 or 4 days in a country (or several countries), before moving on to another.The only reason I give them a 5-star rating is that they do exactly what they say they will. Even though the second part is an oral listing of basic travel expressions, rather than fully developed Pimsleur lessons. I found that, when coupled with a great phrasebook (such as those published by Lonely Planet), Pimsleur gave me enough exposure to the phrases to be able to either read or say them correctly. Yes, I did have to review the travel phrases several times to learn them, but I think if Pimsleur took the time to develop separate travel lessons in the Pimsleur format I'd have had to pay a lot more for them, and I'd have had to spend a lot more time studying them.If Pimsleur is guilty of any gimmick, it's the same gimmick others use by trying to tell us we can learn a language in several hours (or 10 minutes a day) -- and the Pimsleur Express doesn't make that claim -- just that it's a quick introduction to important phrases needed for travel. They haven't prepared me for deep philosophical discussions, but they have successfully gotten me through airports, train stations, in and out of taxis, stores, hotels and restaurants. I think that's exactly what they were created for."},{"Title":"Express Italian: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Express)","review":"This Pimsleur Express CD contains a 25 minute conversation lesson followed by about 40 minutes of \\"scenes\\", or typical travel situations.The conversation lesson is obviously the highlight of this product. Organized in the patented Pimsleur style, it stuck immediately.The \\"scenes\\" contain many useful phrases, but I retained very, very little on the first listen. Several listens later, I have still not retained much. However, I do value the facts that (1) the vocab is topical, and (2) native speakers do the talking. Maybe by the 30th listen I will have this all down. This makes the \\"scenes\\" portion of the CD about on-par with Pimsleur's competitors (too much work!). The \\"scenes\\" are all about repition.This product is a gimmick. I assume that Pimsleur wanted to create a low-priced product that would look attractive on the bookstore shelf next to the $20+ Michel Thomas, Berlitz, Living Language, etc. etc. products. People will buy this for the topical vocab and the low price. But they will keep buying Pimsleur because their conversation lessons work.If I ever buy a Pimsleur Express CD again, it will be in a language I already speak pretty well, not in a language I am just starting to learn.

Lesson 1 on this disk is Lesson 1 from Pimsleur's Italian 1 program. That's fine; however, after that it's a whirlwind going through various little scenarios that you may encounter while traveling through Italy. I would probably have to listen to this 100 times before I mastered the conversations, because it moves so fast. You really can't listen to this while driving (at least initially) because you need the (tiny) little book that comes with it to understand the pronunciations which are difficult to pick up when listening to the CD sometimes because they talk too fast. One thing I will say is it gives you an idea of how fast the Italians will be talking when you get there. Beyond that, I'd say again, only buy this program for a little refresher before your trip (assuming you've already studied the language).Here is a breakdown of the scenes/quick conversations that are included on the disk after lesson 1:-Landing at the airport-At customs-At breakfast (a one-sided telephone conversation of someone ordering room service)-At the tobacco store-Shopping-Finding the way-In front of the Colosseum-At a reception-At a restaurant-At the emergency room-At the hotel-A stroll through VeniceKeep in mind these conversations all last about a minute or two at most. There is a little recap and repeat, phrase by phrase, at the end of each short converation that moves way to fast for my liking.I've ordered other programs and will listen to this one again after I go through some REAL lessons. One note in Pimsleur's defense: I went through the Pimsleur Italian 1 Lessons 1-5, and they were great, slower moving and easier to understand."},{"Title":"A Higher Sanskrit Grammar: For the Use of School and College Students","review":"Sanskrit Grammar is very ancient and has helped shape the grammars of many subsequent languages. The most outstanding feature of Sanskrit Grammar is its precision - it is indeed a wonder that the current form of grammar which is more than two thousand years old also encapsulates many principles of discrete mathematics such as the Backus Normal Form. It was used in ancient days not only as an end in itself, but also as a field synergetically integrated with philology, phonetics, morphology and linguism.Each work of the author Sri M R Kale is a deeply researched one, and this book is no different. There is no doubt that this book will serve as a reference book to the fraternity of Sanskrit scholars and students. It outlines systematically the grammar in currency at present viz the grammar based on the treatise of Panini, enlarged by Katyayana and commented by Patanjali. Its treatment of sandhi ( conjugation ), samAsa ( compounding ), lakAra-s and vibhakti-s ( declensions ) are very systematic, and very illuminating even to a scholar. This book can serve as a very good pre-cursor to the celebrated treatise siddhAntakoumudi for those interested. One only wishes that future editions of this book should be published in premium quality paper, as this book is a treasure, for sure, on one's bookshelf. The occasional typos also need to be eliminated in the future editions. This book is a very welcome addition to a Sanskrit scholar's bookshelf indeed !"},{"Title":"A Higher Sanskrit Grammar: For the Use of School and College Students","review":"Congratulations to M.R.Kale because the work he created.I am aready a novice to Sanskrit studies.Although I have begun learning through the Introduction to Sanskrit methods of Egenes I have bought this little but enormous detonator thinking for my future studies.you will find sandhi rules expounded largely, declensions,comparison,compounds, secondary affixes, verb conjugations,syntax and everything you may need."},{"Title":"A Higher Sanskrit Grammar: For the Use of School and College Students","review":"Anyone wishing to go beyond introductory Sanskrit will benefit from this book.

The 2004 edition claims to have been \\"expanded and revised\\", when in fact the bibliography holds nothing published after 1993. He states that NutraSweet in small doses causes complete blockage of pancreatic enzymes, when the study in his bibliography pertained to saccharin - not aspartame!

A medline search on oregano oil yields 20 studies carried out on meat and bacteria - not one single human study has been conducted! Alcohol, coffee and tea are listed as a \\"cause\\" in every deficiency listed on the basis of one paper on each. Did he develop \\"sudden illiteracy syndrome\\" in 1993 which has prevented him reading any further papers?He should really be considered a laughing stock, but for the fact he is whipping unsuspecting people into a state of nutritional hysteria with the intent of relieving them of their hard-earned dollars.

Before she wound up on the streets, she was in and out of hospitals, receiving so much electro-shock therapy that she believes her nervous system has been re-wired and now tunes into the bio-rhythms of people around her.Trudy takes us, along with her two alien companions, on a discovery trip to find out what it means to be human and imparting her own impressions on life. She tunes in a wide array of people, ranging from Agnus Angst, a 15-year-old punk performance artist; Agnus' grandparents Lud and Marie; Chrissy, a recently unemployed workout enthusiast; Lily, an actress currently performing a one-woman show; and many others, both men and women, gay and straight.This play is full of marvelous insight into the human condition and life in the 1980's. This is very apparent in the incredible second act, in which we follow Lyn from the consciousness-raising times of the 1970's through her rise and fall in the business ranks of the 1980's and her turbulent family life. Also, all the characters, in one form or another, have some influence on the life of the other characters in the play, whether or not they actually meet: Lyn has an affair with Agnus's mother; Kate, a rich trendsetter, finds a suicide note left by Chrissy lying in the street; Trudy takes the aliens to see Lily's play in order to show them goosebumps.The book also includes still images, from the stage production, of Lily Tomlin, many of which were shot by Annie Leibowitz. Jane Wagner also created some montages of Lily as the many characters in the play.Full of wit, insight and tenderness, this play stands as a perfect glimpse into understanding society."},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"I've been wanting to read this hilarious, thought-provoking & well-written book again for years...glad to have it in my library."},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"Come on...

Lily Tomlin was superb on Broadway as she portrayed these characters, woven together in such a illustrious way to show the many connections that aren't always so obvious as we are in the midst of living life. Jane Wagner's words are genius. The BEST ever!!! What a terrific team. Always gives me GOOSEBUMPS!"},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"The word \\"Tour de Force\\" may not have been invented with Lily Tomlin specifically in mind, but she is one of the best people for whom this epithet should be used. I've seen her do this show live, twice, when it first came to Philadelphia, and enjoy repeating the experience via the video, and the book. She's an amazing performer, and this is an amazing piece of theater."},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"As she tries to explain human beings to extraterrestrials who are searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe, Trudy, the bag lady, channels among others: Agnus Angst, a throwaway teenage punk; Chrissy, an unemployed young woman who doesn't know what to do with herself; Kate -- a rich socialite bored with everything. It's a tough job, but Trudy is up to it -- she refuses to be intimidated by reality.Wagner weaves together the stories of these separate lives with speculations about time, space, reality, art, and human nature. From Trudy's skewed perspective a vision forms of the interconnectedness of human life -- maybe of all intelligent life in the universe. Filled with laugh-out-loud one-liners and characters whose words and feelings ring true, this one-woman play is masterful writing from a deep and generous heart. If you didn't see Lily Tomlin's performance on Broadway, don't miss reading the book. It's more than a story; it's an experience."},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"This one woman plays many characters, and will take you on a journey of laughter, and much more, and leave you smiling for long after you put it down..."},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"This play is just what my title says....very entertaining and if you are in the theatre world, guys, but especially girls, should look into a purchase of this play for potential monologues for auditions."},{"Title":"The Search For Signs Of Intelligent Life In The Universe","review":"I'm in an arts/high school program, PCCA.

Some worked for me. Some didn't.This one, however, seemed to 'click' with me. I brought this cd for the purpose of promoting self-love for myself, as I have been struggling with self-esteem for a very long time. The first time I listened to it, I felt my chest grow lighter(in a comfortable way). And my breathing seemed to flow easily in a tranquil way. My heart felt very energetic, and it seemed like with each breath I felt like a river of energy flowed out from my heart....The music, the one on the second track, is the same music as that of the Positive Thinking Subliminal CD ( whooshing wind...mysterious lady singng near the end....yeah, that's it). But even though it is the same music as the Positive Thinking, I can assure you that the results are completely different, as Positive Thinking only works on your thoughts and not your body as a whole.This music was not all fluff and bunnies for me, either.Sure, I may have felt lighter and more open to love the first time I listened to it, but at the same time I felt a bit uncomfortable. I felt uneasy. Uneasy as in a queasy-irritated feeling. I read another reviewer of this cd and read about how she felt like vomitting. I did not feel like vomitting but I did feel very uneasy, as I stated above, so I believe that anyone who is interested in getting this cd should be AWARE BEFORE HAND that this is a not a one-time-listen-transformation.If you had been struggling with self-esteem for years, or if you just feel bad most of the time or had bad experiences in your past that had crippled your love for yourself or others, the subliminal affirmations that embed total self-appreciation will most likely have a negative effect upon you for a little while. But do not feel afraid. Because after you get past that uneasy-stage then you will reap the benefits. You will see yourself in a new light. You will love yourself and others more easily. You will see the world more friendly and, maybe, even find a partner if you wish.This cd is a learning cd. It is not quick in changing you. You have to work with it everyday to grow in love for yourself, your family, and your friends.I think that that's worth fifteen dollars, is it?Good luck and take care!!!!"},{"Title":"Attract Love: Brain Wave Subliminal","review":"I would have preferred a relaxing talk to slow down and relax as I drift off to sleep.

It calms my heart and know that all is well."},{"Title":"Attract Love: Brain Wave Subliminal","review":"I swear that I don't work for Kelly Howell or anything, I just really admire her work, and Attract Love is the best one in my opinion. If you find that you don't possess a lot of self-love, didn't grow up in a very loving home and/or find it difficult to express yourself in a loving way with others, I would say to definitely try this. Listen to it once with headphones before bed, at least once without headphones during the day, everyday for 6 weeks and you will definitely feel a difference. As it says in the program, look out for coincidences (affirmations are seriously powerful!). Especially in the first week, you may start getting messages telling you why you need more love in your life. You might find the messages in a commercial, in a conversation, anywhere/everywhere. You might begin reflecting on the emotions which hinder you from being a more loving person. In my opinion, this is the period where your brain goes against the new messages. Keep at it though, and don't be discouraged if the affirmations don't stick right away after 6 weeks. Just keep listening until these new beliefs sink in. There is a lot of work to be done here, depending on your situation. On a conscious level, it might help to write down the affirmations listed with this program and say them to yourself (especially when you feel challenged). It can also be helpful to have a journal to write down the progress you notice within yourself and toward others. Another really good program of hers is Stress Free Forever. If you've tried everything (medication, counseling) and still feel miserable, try subliminals. You already know how to help yourself, the affirmations just help remind you.

Keep it on your toilet and just open to random pages when you get the urge.&quot;One of the most fantastic qualities of Henri's book (which, by the way, is a series of quips and longer anecdotes recorded in print by Henri's students) is that it's non-linear structure allows you to do precisely that- open it to wherever you want and begin. The genius and omniscience of Henri's words saturate this book to make it not only timeless and relevant, but also convenient.Certainly this book is a must for any artist, visual or not, but Henri's wisdom can be applied to anyone who is literate and breathes. To quote:&quot;If you want to know how to do a thing you must first have a complete desire to do that thing. Then go to kindred spirits-others who have wanted to do that thing- and study their ways and means, learn from their successes and failures and add your quota.

I read it to my students weekly. It is the essential and quintessential hearthplace wherein the flaming art spirit of Robert (Cozad) Henri (\\"Hen-rye\\"- his preferred mispronounciation- how American!) still lives. How often, even in dreams, have I intoned, \\"Art, when really understood, is he province of every human being\\".?To be clear: ALL ARTISTS SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF \\"THE ART SPIRIT\\".Like many of the best \\"books\\", The Art Spirit (TAS) was not written by Henri, nor was meant to be published necessarily- I think of van Gogh's heartwrought letters to brother Theo, Hammarskjold's hidden diary while Sec. General of the UN; \\"Markings\\", and of Gerard Manley Hopkins' groundbreaking poems published by friend Robert Bridges years after his death. One of RH's students took good notes- and in spite of all else, published them! Thank God for all of us!It , TAS, has comforted, consoled, angered, made me cry, inspired, and taught philosophy, skills, anddesign/color fundamentals for more than 30 years of my life as an artist and teacher. Henri was, perhaps, our country's greatest art teacher- look at all those he directly taught, as well as all those he has indirectly (me, etc.) taught. And I pass it on to mine- nearly every day- along with many others. Manifesting the elusive fire of \\"being\\", which Henri worked to capture as he painted what he called, \\"my people\\", is still the core of the visual experience as it becomes art. We contain it- but it is elusive and difficult to see much less paint . You are \\"my people\\". They are us. The artist paints what never changes. WHOIAM.Finally, a confession: at every bookstore visit, anywhere I am in the USA, when I find their copy of TAS, I place it out, front and center, with that remarkably painted child's face meeting perusers. Amid the Manga mediocrity and \\"how to\\" drawing/painting \\"manuals\\", and other worthless ego hallucinations, I hope to remind of the ongoing, unchanging, core Beauty of the human spirit- maybe in a young child who always finds a pencil in his hands; or in the eyes of the retired banker who is attracted to paint the sunset on the golf course. May they pick it up! (and may it never cost more than 20 bucks! I found a first edition, hardcover, of TAS at a bookstore for $3 in Little Switzerland, NC last summer)) Then, at every bookstore, I take all of the big, shiny Thomas Kincaid (\\"Master of Light\\") books and turn them to face away- hidden.

But his ongoing influence is indisputable: He helped organize the Armory Show, which brought many new artists- Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse and the Impressionists- to America for the first time.

Paint color, composition, line...The book is written as a painting with no particular beginning, middle, or end. It needs to be absorbed as a whole to fully appreciate its contents. The pedantic English can tire but it does not subtract from the freshness of the message and the pleasure it provides to every student of art."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"The Art Spirit. Now there's a bold title. The implication is not only that there is such a specifically identifiable thing as an \\"art spirit\\", but also that the author, painter, and teacher, Robert Henri knows these specifics; a bold implication indeed. The difficulty (wherein lies the boldness) whenever one attaches the word spirit -or spiritual- to anything, there are, of course, as many understandings or perceptions of that word as there are hearers and readers of that word. This may exist to no greater degree and appear no more obvious than in the world of visual arts. Henri himself acknowledges this, writing in the forward, \\"...the opinions are presented more as paintings are hung on a wall, to be looked at at will and to be taken for what they are worth. If they have a suggestive value and stimulate to independent thought, they will attain the object of their presentation...\\" And later, \\"There is no idea that anyone should agree with any of the comments or that anyone should follow the advice given. If they irritate to activity in quite a different direction, it will be just as well.\\" Although he embraces this free thinking, to-each-his-own, take what you will from it approach, it is merely one of the specific personality characteristics evidenced in the Art Spirit. Henri intends to show there is an \\"art spirit\\", and it is the province of every human being.This is the crux of the issue for Henri, his point of departure from other artist/writers, and the chief value of this book: The Art Spirit is attainable by anyone, can be exhibited by everyone.Other works on the subject tend to be either the less specific, more nebulous notions where we are expected to buy the fancy explanations and just accept that there is something spiritual, or of the spirit, going on here, or the very specific, artist-only oriented varieties. For example, consider Mandarin's grid \\"composition\\" series and his writing about them. While his theosophically induced explanations may help some to a degree of understanding, we are essentially left to take his word for what we are supposed to be seeing in the canvas. In his \\"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\\", although Kandinsky presages Henri -discussing psycho-emotional, expressive, and contemplative states of artists out in the real world and before the canvas- he ultimately leaves it with the artist, not really taking it out of the studio and into the factory, construction site, or office cubicle as Henri does. Whereas Kandinsky seems to digress at times into a sort of \\"how -to\\" instruction guide for defining and placing spiritual elements into a picture, Henri takes it further, defining his Art Spirit, then setting about showing us how to tell when it's present. This every-man definition is offered at the very beginning of his book:\\"Art when really understood is the province of every human being.It is simply a question of doing things, anything, well. It is not an outside, extra thing.When the artist is alive in any person, whatever his kind of work may be, he becomes an inventive, searching, daring, self-expressing creature. He becomes interesting to other people. He disturbs, upsets, enlightens, and he opens ways for a better understanding. Where those who are not artists are trying to close the book, he opens it, shows there are still more pages possible.The world would stagnate without him, and the world would be beautiful with him; for he is interesting to himself and he is interesting to others. He does not have to be a painter or sculptor to be an artist. He can work in any medium. He simply has to find the gain in the work itself, not outside it.\\"Henri then spends two hundred and forty five more pages illuminating and reiterating how one is -or can be- an inventive, searching, daring, self-expressing creature; how to live life to the fullest. The Art Spirit manifests itself in the appreciation of the non-material things in life; in the \\"true student\\" who self-educates and explores feelings, meanings, who contemplates, who really sees, who learns to express \\"who is you\\"; in what comes from the external world and inside you; in the full enjoyment in the living of life; in doing a thing well ... anything.Henri accomplishes a difficult task here; a book with specific and important information for the artist, yet within that structure filled with insight and compelling ideas for the non-artist. One is urged to make a full reading, since quite often both are mingled in the same sentence or statement. For example, a non-painter might be tempted to skip the ten-page section on brush strokes (pg. 62-72), seeing no need for it. The unfortunate reader would then miss out on many little gems of insight and information. What is a brushstroke but a purposeful committed action by an artist? So then, consider the message in these statements when you substitute the word \\"stroke\\" with \\"action\\" or even \\"attitude\\" (parenthetical insertions are mine ):\\"Strokes carry a message whether you will it or not. The stroke is just like the artist (person) at the time he makes it. All the certainties, all the uncertainties, all the bigness of his spirit and all the littleness are in it.\\"\\"There are more strokes which laugh, and there are more strokes which bind laughter, which freeze the face into a set immoveable grimace.\\"\\"(There are) bad strokes which are bad because a brush (a method) or a condition of paint (situation) were chosen which could not render them.\\"While Henri plays to both artist and non-artist audiences, it is at these times when he addresses the artist more directly he more closely aligns himself with Kandinsky. Both men bring their great passion for the subject into their text in their strong, clear, and pleasing voice. Kandinsky, sounding alternately-yet only slightly more- poetic here, technical there; Henri with a bit more enthusiasm. They share the same territory on many issues, such as the shape, direction, and function of line, intention of every stroke, careful planning followed by exuberant expression and more. Yet, while they may travel the same road, they do not share the same vehicle. There is an important distinction in each man's approach to spirituality, or the art spirit. For Kandinsky, there is a spirit world out there, and a spiritually inspired painter can -and should- find ways to represent both that indwelling spirit and that exterior spirit world to which we are all connected. Henri says (when) we search the external world with appreciation and wonder, and we search within ourselves, and when we become more self-expressing creatures, we have the art spirit...we are the art spirit. Kandinsky believes only non-objective images can reveal the spiritual, Henri says it matters not what you paint but how you paint it-compelled by the spirit. So while Kandinsky can use the \\"psychic effect\\" (pg. 24) of color to manipulate the viewer's emotional state toward a comprehension of the spiritual, Henri says the artist's mark itself can manifest the Art Spirit. While, in both cases it takes a more or less purposeful opening up to the notion of the spirit, for Henri it is not trying to grasp the spirit and record it, it is about internalizing and building the spirit inside ourselves, and our resulting expressions will, by definition, represent the Spirit. And it is possible for all of us.The long quote above (from pg. 5) is written exactly as printed in the fifth edition printing not only as expository text, but as a means of illustrating Henri's bright, clear and energetic voice that runs throughout this book. The subtitle for The Art Spirit reads, \\"notes, articles, fragments of letters and talks to students, bearing on the concept and technique of picture making, the study of art in general, and on appreciation,\\" and that is exactly how it reads. Much of this is due to Henri's considerable gift of communication, and the balance is credited to the physical layout of the book. There are no chapters, even very few headings to sections, lending itself very well to opening to any page and beginning to read. At times, a lecture, or perhaps advice to a single student goes on for five, six, seven pages. Other times, pages are divided into two or three sections, or set up in individual sentences which concern the same subject, yet stand on their own. The resulting effect is the feeling of being in the very classroom of Professor Henri. There are also considerable instances of repetition here, albeit in subtle variations. The index, however, is usefully repetitious as well, helping to differentiate between those subtleties when one may be in need of a specific quote or reference.The last thirty pages are exact notes taken by Margery Ryerson, a Henri student who eventually compiled the notes, fragments, etc.(in the revised edition, she is credited as Editor). This is an excellent addition to the book. Reading Henri's comments and insights in her necessarily abbreviated, note-taking style provides fresh psychological weight to the reality of Henri's classroom.One area of disappointment concerns the photograph illustrations of Henri and his work. In the fifth edition, the plates are in black and white. Although understandable at the time of inclusion (1930), they do not allow for close comparison with Henri's ideas and techniques about painting elaborated in the text. The real disappointment is to find that the current edition available from booksellers has not updated to colorplates, but jettisoned the pictures entirely, save for the full color cover.I recommend The Art Spirit to anyone involved in the creative process. It is a must have, particularly for those times when one may be experiencing a creative burnout, or to shake off the cobwebs. I am recommending The Art Spirit to non-artists as well -anyone who is looking for a little spark, a little positive push toward self-actualization.For the artist, I am not recommending The Art Spirit over the Kandinsky classic; I see Henri's work as more of a continuation, or a rounding out of what Kandinsky started years before. Artists and aspiring art appreciators must read both if there is to be any hope of understanding"},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"Unbelievably this is the best book on art/ painting I have read even though it has not got one picture or sketch in it. I would thoroughly recommend this to both budding and experienced artists, or someone who is thinking of taking up painting or even if they just have an interest in it. You won't find out any specific techniques of painting here so what does it have? It gives the author's genuine insight into what should be the true meaning and purpose of painting and it will inspire anyone to start or continue working in this medium. It gives guidance on what art should be all about and will encourage the reader to persevere and to get the best out of themselves. It also gives general principles on painting, mostly on portraits. It is a book that you will keep and read over and over again for its sheer delight and words of wisdom. If everbody who went to school had someone like Robert Henri as an art teacher, then they would all end up as artists."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"I love the book, but I thought it would have more of Robert Henri's paintings inside.Great buy anyway."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"This book is a gem. Yes, it has practical advice for aspiring artists, but more than that, it is about finding your own individuality as an artist, and in that sense is inspirational for writers, dancers, and anyone in the creative arts. For that matter it's about seeing the incredible beauty in the world through your own unique lens. I highly recommend it to creative individuals looking for inspiration, especially young artists."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"This is more than just a book on art theory or even the creation of art. This is more like a book on how to live a life that appreciates art - a life lived on it's own terms - a life of intense feeling and profound contemplation. Yes, there are also many helpful tips for improving your artistic abilities. I've had this book for all of my adult life. I never did become a very good artist. But I still bring this book down from the shelf now and then just to re-read the many passages that I underlined so many years ago.Robert Henri was born in Ohio in 1865. His real name was Robert Henry Cozad. Around the age of 17, after his father was involved in a scandal, Robert changed his name to Robert Henri (which he pronounced \\"Hen-rye\\". I remember reading about how, on his first day in art class in Paris, his teacher called out his name and he did not answer. He did not realize that \\"Henri\\" was a French name with a different pronunciation than he had created for himself.An example of his philosophy: \\"There are two classes of human beings. One has ideas which it believes in fully, perhaps, but modifies to bring about \\"success\\". The other class has ideas which it believes in and must carry out absolutely; success or no success. The first class has a tremendous majority; and they are all slaves. The second class are the only free people in the world. Some are kept under the grind of poverty. Some are sent to jail, but they are still the only free class.\\"A classic, and a book recommended for all aspiring artists, and all those who are just artists at heart."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"This is an unusual book in that it is a compilation of fragments, letters, critiques and so forth. There are no clearly defined chapters by topic. There are essentially no photographs. Furthermore, the content ranges from how to \\"nuts and bolts\\" to the most abstract topics about the purpose of art and the mindset of an artist. This may all sound rather dry and high-brow, but I assure you that it is not. I could read this book regularly for the rest of my life and keep learning. The human mind can only focus on so many things at once. One has to be ready for certain concepts before they will be useful.George Bellows, Edward Hopper, Patrick Henry Bruce, Stuart Davis, Rockwell Kent, Guy DuBois, Alfred Maurer, Carl Sprinchorn and countless others who studied with Henri, went on to do unique and great work. Henri had too many successful students for this to be coincidence. Henri did not encourage his students to paint the exact way he did but rather he provided the tools for them to develop their work in their own direction. The \\"Art Spirit\\" is the closest thing that we can get to the \\"Kool-Aid\\" that flowed in Henri's classroom. In addition, at his best, Henri could rock a canvas. His best paintings are remarkably solid and loaded with psychological impact.One can glean quite a bit from the pages of this book. At his best, Henri could rock a canvas. His best paintings are remarkably solid and loaded with psychological punch. So, unlike most books about painting, this one is written by (actually, his student Margery Ryerson compiled the book) somebody who created some truly exceptional work. It is both practical and inspirational. I have to say that it can be a bit frustrating - not being able to see anything that is the focus of discussion. It would be great to be able to ask a question! But in some ways, this forces us to think more. In the end, as artists, we all must be motivated to learn and discover for ourselves. Buy a copy, read it, think, experiment and grow."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"\\"Art when really understood is the province of every human being.\\"Thus begins one of the most remarkable books ever written on the subject.The Art Spirit is comprised of various letters, articles, speeches, notes, and fragments of artist and art teacher Robert Henri. Ranging from several pages to single sentences and arranged somewhat haphazardly, these teachings nevertheless add up to a fairly comprehensive view of the purpose of art and the nature of the artist. He discusses technique, but emphasizes that technique is only a means to the end of artistic expression, not an end or expression in itself. Being an artist is about having a certain relationship to existence, a unique perspective on reality. Art is value-laden, and that's what makes it meaningful. Art isn't about simply making the best copy of nature, it's about seeing beyond the surface impressions and finding the deeper meaning of things, and selectively using what's given in nature to express that meaning: \\"The great artist has not reproduced nature, but has expressed by his extract the most choice sensation it has made upon him...The artist who does not use his imagination is a mechanic.\\"Even when he's discussing technique, Henri's teaching will greatly enhance anyone's appreciation of art. And much of what he says about technique is applicable at least by analogy to other art forms (such as literary expression or musical composition), and some of it to any kind of creative work.The book's form makes it perfect for reading straight through, or for dipping in at random. A truly remarkable book."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"I am new to painting and now love to talk about painting with artists.This book was mentioned as a pick up anytime, anywhere book of inspiration.Yes it is.I bought a used copy, published in 1960, there was the nicest inscription from a previous purchaser to an artist friend.It was signed \\"J\\"Thanks J,I love the book"},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"This book is a true treasure and I can't stop but reading both the whole and parts of it over and over again.

Even if you don't find it fulfills at least some of your needs, you may know someone who's needs it may."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"Henri would not relate directly to his students while they were working; instead he would return to the classroom when it was empty, observe the various works of his students, and leave them notes to encourage and give direction to their work. Mostly these notes were poetic, metaphorical, oblique to the actual work. Henri, this great artistic soul, spoke through the work of his students, to the essential artist in them, deepening their connection to this in themselves and opening the doors for this essential artist to a truer expression. This book is a collection of those notes, to read cover to cover, or to open and read a page for insight into one's art or one's life. I myself have found that I have no apparent artistic ability, but through this much read and much appreciated little book, I have been made into an artist in my own inner and outer life and expression. I live a little deeper and with a greater clarity. My heart is opened with each reading. Every artist, philosopher and Lover of life should have the pleasure of this , the heart of Robert Henri."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"My friend who was an artist gave me this book to read. Now it is one of the few that I carry around at all times. Robert Henri saw that there is no division between art and life. To be an artist, or trully alive for that matter, one has to experience life to his fullest. This means finding yourself and the people/things/and way of living that inspire you. When beauty strikes you so, and your full of love and joy it is hard not to do things beautifully. Henri tells us to find that beauty within us and the rest will follow. And one of the most enjoying things I found about this book was that the authors personality is very bright in every sentence. It made the book a great read.

Robert Henri speaks of both the technical side of art and the art experience. I have re-read this book, a little bit at a time, many times over the years and have found something new to appreciate each time.While I find less and less time in my life for my artwork, I am able to enjoy beauty and clarity in all of it's everyday forms. The trick is to remember to capture it in your mind. When I feel I have lost the ability to appreciate everyday beauty, I pick up this book. It never fails to rejuvinate my mind and inspire me."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"I thought this was a very philosophical book that applies to life in general and not just painting. Lots of his quotes are great. Like this one: &quot;Don't ask someone for a critique until you're unable to give one yourself. Then you will be ready to receive it.&quot; The main premise in the book is to have the art spirit. That is, instead of just copying what you see, paint what you feel. I think that is something very few painters do. Have you ever looked at a well executed painting but it just didn't do anything for you? This could be why. Really I think this book is a must read for all artists, even non-painters."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"This is a book of notes, articles, letters and student instruction from the teacher himself (not any ordinary teacher, mind you) about the concept and technique of picture making, the study of art generally and on appreciation. This is an easy read; one that can be read a bit at a time at leisure. It felt like a visit with an old friend. Full of inspiration and a touch of philosophy here and there, it brings it all together. I quote just this once from Mr. Henri: &quot;Art appreciation, like love, cannot be done by proxy: It is a very personal affair and is necessary to each individual.&quot; He is giving advice here on not following the critics! I include this to give the reader the &quot;flavor&quot; of the book.

In a world in which we are pulled in every direction through media and advertising etc, Henri reminds me of what it is to be a real artist. Time and again his writings inspire me and send me off to the studio with purpose in my step. Here is one quote to give an idea of the importance of this book; 'The country is full of men who are working in the cold, or worse- too much heat- just to get enough to purchase a day's miserable existance. You are working for your character, and your pay is to last you all your life.' Buy it.

You see, this book is utterly essential--essential, that is, if you have any desire to glimpse the real meaning of what art is and how it comes to be.

I have bought several copies of this book and make a practice of loaning them out when finished, asking each &quot;borrower&quot; to pass it along rather than return it to me. A book like this should never sit closed on a shelf."},{"Title":"the art Spirit","review":"Within his treatise on art and its many facets, well-known artist and teacher Robert Henri shares insight on the making and viewing of art.

He discloses a lifetime of his personal &quot;life-lessons&quot; about his own art and his personal struggles as an artist, and he shares honestly the perils and triumphs of both he and his students. In a mere moment the reader learns lessons about art and its making which take artists years to learn. This book is a joy in every sense of the word -- from Henri's suggestions on rendering light reflecting from a woman's lower lip to his secrets to making a portrait &quot;glow&quot;.

Steinbeck engages with the reader with symbolic themes such as struggle of the exploited proletariat and the dissenting views of 1930's America in this story about the rise of a local fruit pickers strike. As usual, Steinbeck does a great job throwing the reader into a vivid setting he has created- while at the same immersing the reader into the everyday struggle of the \\"working class\\" American with nothing to lose. Steinbeck's inclusion of real characters who are not shy to have a opposing opinion about the importance of the drive of the primary protagonists plays an vital role in the story.

This book changed my mind about a good many things: the nature and results of capitalism, labor unions, socialism, work, wages, the individual and the group, destiny, and free will and choice, to say nothing of Steinbeck himself. Once I was able to break out of the mindset that Steinbeck wasn't saying what I felt he should be saying about America and our way of life, I was able to see that to be a part of our lifestyle is not necessarily to agree with it, and that our adopted lifestyle is not inherently good and fulfilling for all. Challenging things to consider, that all things are not black and white, cause and effect. What courage Steinbeck has to see and believe these things, let alone write about them with such honesty, objectivity and grace. It is not his most complete work, but to judge it against &quot;Grapes&quot; or &quot;Winter of our Discontent&quot; is to do disservice to this book's own merits.

In Dubious Battle is a powerful story of the apple pickers and their struggle for justice. Steinbeck paints wonderful pictures for his readers.

He pulls you into their world in order to appreciate the true meaning of brutality, greed, and deception. His literary genius brings home the fact that many have sacrificed before us."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"A must for Steinbeck fans. A powerful, compassionate novel on the struggle of man for justice."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I'm glad that I read &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; because it offered a new perspective on Communism and mob mantality. It made me see through the eyes of California's oppressed field workers. Steinbeck paints both beautiful and frightening pictures of what people are like in the face of adversity by showing their reactions on both individual and group levels. In a sense, reading &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; is an educational experience in safe voyeurism. Steinbeck illustrates the cycle of the fight against injustice and the loss of self that can ensue in the process. The novel shows from beginning to end that in accomplishing something revolutionary, it is of utmost importance to &quot;never submit or yield.&quot;"},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"\\"In Dubious Battle\\" is basically the first of Steinbeck's socially-engaged novels, in which he portrays a strike staged by itinerant fruit-pickers against price-cutting orchard owners. This is hardly a pamphlet for the labor movement or the Communist Party, though, as Steinbeck is less interested in pontificating than showing the frustations of the workers and the toll that their resistence actually takes on them and the local community. It also shows the organizational difficulties involved in getting a diverse group of dissatisfied workers to work for a common cause. The characterization is vivid and brilliant. Aside from its obvious literary value, this novel also has historical value, for like Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" (although with greater realism and much less pathos) it provides a powerful description of the plight of working people in America earlier in the 20th century. \\"In Dubious Battle\\" gives readers a good idea of the type of courage it took, and still does take, to fight for positive change and social justice."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Steinbeck masters several different purposes with this book. First, he provides us with, in typical Steinbeck fashion, an in-depth character study of several figures worthy of discussion. The characters are intriguing, life-like and hold our attention as they move through their existence.Second, he weaves a picturesque and spellbinding story with this ability to animate scenes with his words. He truly captures the idea of &quot;suspension of disbelief;&quot; the reader has no doubt he/she is reading about real places and people.Last and most important, Steinbeck turns the tables on the reader in the last paragraph of the book. While this book may superficially appear to be a scathing commentary on the ruthlessness of unchecked capitalism, its really a singular question on human nature, regardless of the dominant socio-economic system, be it capitalism or communism. The reader must make up his/her mind at the end on which is the worse crime: exploitation of the masses for profit or exploitation of the masses for personal power and position, especially at the expense of a friend and allie.One of the most powerful books I have read in such a few number of pages."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"By far, Steinbeck had his finest moments writing this story. That says a lot about a man who did such great character studies as Of Mice And Men, The Grapes Of Wrath, The Winter Of Our Discontent, and The Pearl. In this story, Steinbeck hits a raw note rarely reached in American Literature. Few people would have it in them to write a story about the &quot;Reds&quot; in the 1930s. Steinbeck not only wrote the story, he made it his masterpiece. The story alone is the best he ever published. A story about a migrant worker strike in California and the effects of an ununionized strike unfold in the novel. The more important part of the novel is the humanist views Steinbeck took. Every man can feel the hate of the system tearing you apart. He captures that hate in all 300 pages of this story. In every aspect, he captured people who have been pushed too far in In Dubious Battle. He told the story of men who had nothing to lose and in the end lost anyway. This is not another story of the underdog. This is the story of the American Dream being left unfulfilled."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Like the preceding reviewer, I felt that Warren French's essay offered a very poor introduction to this novel. It isn't simply that French gives too much of the story away; that could be solved simply be reading the 'introduction' later. More bothersome is how his analysis is based mainly on elements that are exterior to the novel (a few comments in Steinbeck's personal letters, historical anecdotes...) but remains largely at odds with the novel itself.Contrary to French's convoluted claims, the novel is first and foremost a careful study of various aspects of worker/capital confrontation, played out in the form a depression era fruit pickers' strike. Steinbeck uses his two main characters, Mac and Jim - two 'communist agitators' who are instrumental in whipping up sentiments of resistance among the workers - to offer a 'big picture' perspective of the organizational aspects of the confrontation. The bulk of the novel explores tactics, with many of the typical property owner ploys and worker counterploys represented, and it attempts to dissect and explain the vicissitudes of worker morale (and, to a lesser extent, to explore the psychology of those acting on the side of the forces of repression). The specifics may be dated, but anyone involved in social struggles today will immediately recognize most of the tactics and the psychology. I am thinking less of contemporary strikes in North America, which have generally evolved into less violent confrontations, and more of struggles where people are still fighting to gain the power of solidarity. Worker struggles in the third world come to mind, but also the larger struggle to establish unity against the neoliberal agenda. Participants in recent 'antiglobalization' protests, for instance, will see many familiar elements in \\"In Dubious Battle\\" .French's contention that \\"In Dubious Battle\\" is a 'bildungsroman' is also pretty far off the mark. It is true that Jim, undergoing his apprenticeship as an organizer/agitator, is revealed to be a natural tactician. But generally the characters remain constants throughout the novel. I would agree with other commentators here who have complained that the personalities are somewhat stiff - ceratinly, that is, in comparison with the depth with which Steinbeck usually imbues his characters.Steinbeck is only minimally concerned with 'character development' in this novel. He is more concerned with the ways in which broad social solidarity develops, and also with some of the concomitant tactical and moral issues. Steinbeck shows strikers resorting to violence, and yet he describes the overall situation accurately enough to make the reader fully aware that, faced with an enemy which has overwhelming control over property and legal apparatus, these are very often the only means for workers to trigger awareness of the need for larger solidarity.French claims that the battle \\"is dubious not because the outcome is uncertain... but rather because it was the kind of struggle that should never have occurred at all.\\" This, in my mind, totally misses the point. Steinbeck clearly recognizes that the battle *must* be fought for workers to improve their lot. The failure of the apple pickers' strike is certain, but just as certain is the fact that it will pull workers together in future and discourage the growers from being quite as mercilessly exploitative. The \\"dubious\\" part has to do with the means by which the battle is fought, and particularly the tendency to sacrifice individuals and small groups unscrupulously to a larger cause. Doc Burton is the only character who fully grasps the implications of this; namely, that the ultimate goal towards which Mac and the 'reds' are fighting - i.e. a classless (and non-violent) society - is undermined by the means which they are using.For those who are new to Steinbeck and are looking primarily for a good read, I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" offers a much more moving evocation of exploitation and discrimination. \\"In Dubious Battle\\" has its fair share of excitement, but it is a primarily a practical (and consequently more prosaic) analysis of the realities of fighting exploitation ."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"The best book by Steinbeck. Gritty down in the dirt daily lives of workers. In today's world people forget that it was the Communists who fought and won many benifits workers enjoy now."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Having just come out of a 49-day strike myself, I can say Steinbeck captures the logistics of a strike: the manipulation by the media against the strikers, the changes moods of the strikers, the importance of gathering public support. Steinbeck gives a balanced view of manipulators on both sides:the leaders of the strike and the employers. Jim Nolan, the protagonist,is lead by an over-zealous racical, Mac, into riling up disenfranchized apple pickers in a fictious town in California. Steinbeck's talent is in making you experience the strike in real-time, ugly warts and all. Although I felt the ending was harsh, Steinbeck gives the reader a lasting and haunting image of the kinds of sacrafices that were made to fight for the rights of working stiffs. I was most impressed by the vivid characters, an economy and dimension of a Doesteovski novel, as well as an ability to capture scene. I wanted to see more of the aftermath of the strike, but Steinbeck ends the novel like a kick in the gut. Almost too abrupt for my taste, but, alas, this is a classic and well worth the time of anyone wanting to better understand the dubious nature of a strike--its work never finished in a single lifetime."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"\\"In Dubious Battle\\" is not Steinbeck's best novel. It's heavy on the preaching of workingman values, uses characters to convey belief in that awkward way you see in blatantly political novels, and it ends abruptly and unsatisfactorily, as if Steinbeck were racing against a deadline.But it's refreshing to read the novel in light of today's capital-dominated society. While the poor get steadily poorer, and the rich richer, Steinbeck's message still resonates today. Steinbeck's characters fight barehanded against orchard monopolies and their collected police and vigilante forces armed with guns, tear gas, and money. The Red agitators at the center of the story spark the day laborers' fear and anger and incite a strike, which brings the men together brandishing hope instead of guns. We could take a lesson from the Depression-era strikers and demand a fairer, more just society, one they so obviously failed to win for us.Though stiff and ragged as it is, the novel also haunted me as I read it. While the conditions of oppressive capital exists now more strongly than ever, the workingman's struggle is long dead. In fact, today's average working stiff is the guy in the novel who loves his truck so much that he won't risk it in the battle for his own humanity. It's not until the truck is destroyed that he becomes truly vengeful.So when you're blue about suburban sprawl, when you spend day after day in a cubicle working on meaningless projects, or when you watch our nation's highest offices sell to the highest bidders, pick up this book and howl."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"This is one of those books that changes the way you see the world.I've read a few of Steinbeck's books, including the big ones and some of the smaller ones.In Dubious Battle is just as excellent as Grapes of Wrath, only in a smaller way. After I finished this book, I sat and thought for a long time, unable to get it out of my mind.This is not to be missed. Entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I'm disappointed to read that some folks regard the characters in this great book as caricatures - rather, they reflect the hard-working, strong-willed people that struggled so during the Great Depression, and made huge headway in business, that we today benefit from. With this in mind, I want to sing Steinbeck's praises for a moment, and thank him for making a difference in his own time. He was unafraid of putting the spotlight on a difficult truth in American history, and doing so effectively.This book is distinct from The Grapes of Wrath, in that it studies closer the reality of an actual strike, and the involvement of the Communist Party therein. As the reader follows the experience of Jim and Dan, the lead characters, their strengths and flaws come to the surface, as they struggle to keep the strike underway, and the men and women involved strong. Their trials and tribulations are realistic, and depicted in an edge-of-your-seat manner. The ending, much like that of Grapes, is a heart-wrencher, perhaps even moreso. Any reader with heart and conscience is left stunned, and provoked. Although the book is a work of fiction, it is surely not far from the truth. Truly a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Efforts of workers in this country to organize and to fight for fair wages and decent working conditions have been long and extremely arduous. The history of the labor movement has been fraught with violence and bloodshed. It was not until Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal that Congress passed laws allowing workers to organize and to strike for the conditions which should have been rightfully theirs all along.Set in California in the 1930s, _In Dubious Battle_ accurately depicts individuals who strike when the owners of the orchard in which they pick apples decide to reduce their pay. The book documents these workers' extreme poverty and hunger, as well as their fears of bodily harm or even death at the hands vigilantes and police with whom they must contend during the strike. Their leaders, some of whom are on the extreme left political fringes, are men of fervor and dedication who are willing to sacrifice their own lives in the struggle. Steinbeck who often wrote of the sufferings of the common people, to his credit, presents a balanced portrait of these men. Bullying unarmed strikers into a fighting frenzy against men who possess deadly weapons, exploiting the martyrs in their ranks, and stealthily committing arson as methods of gaining them sympathy, were considered ethical acts that justified their worthy ends. One of the book's great strengths was its non-fictional, documentary feel. Admittedly, Steinbeck's matter of fact approach and dialogue sometimes dulled the book's dramatic impact. On the whole, though, I felt as if I were living amongst very realistic people, experiencing their disappointments fighting a dubious battle in an ultimately successful war for economic freedom of all working people."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Unlike Steinbeck's other works, \\"In Dubious Battle\\" exhibits much more of a social conscience toward the need of the average man. Aside from \\"The Grape of Wrath\\" and \\"The Moon is Down\\", this trait of Steinbeck is not always evident in his work. Although communism is never mentioned by name, the book is centered around the laborers that organize in a fruit strike in the California Valley. In his storytelling, flaws are revealed on both ends of the spectrum so it would be inaccurate to call this book pro-communist. Yet the pro-labor leanings expressed in the book may reveal a preference.Jim Nolan is new to the movement, leaving his past life with the idea of making a difference. While he initially seems to be the main character, the focus becomes quite broad. \\"The party\\" plans to incite a strike and seeks employment as pickers with this in mind. As the plot is sets up, the story moves somewhat slowly in the initial pages. The reader may find himself/herself waiting for the descent to begin as rage gradually builds among the workers.As the strike begins, the characters begin to take shape in a form similar to characters in Steinbeck's other works. As the rules of working life are removed, some of the men struggle without structure in their lives. While Jim becomes familiar with the life of the party, Mac and London act as a guiding force with the future in mind. However, Doc is the steady force in the novel as he provides a remarkably objective eye toward the movement. Although his role is less prominent, he may be the most complete character in the book.My only real disappointment in the novel is that I felt it ended to abruptly. The factions are headed toward what is seemingly their ultimate clash as the story draws to a close. While the answer of a war between communist and capitalistic ideas has seemingly been won in the real world, one has to wonder how it ended in the world created by John Steinbeck."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"This is a story of the attempt of the Communist Party to infiltrate the labor movement. Using the rage of migrant farm workers against the unfair labor practices of the California agricultural community, and anything else possible, up to and including the dead bodies of their friends, labor organizers convince growing numbers of workers to organize. The title of the book, &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; discusses the dubious choices made by the leaders of the labor movement of that time, inserting socialist ideals and abdicating conscience for the &quot;cause&quot; in many cases. It traces the slow evolution of its main character as the plight of workers versus values such as the rights of farmers, and morality, to name two, bring him to make choices."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Steinbeck has an amazing way of just grabbing you by the neck and thrusting you into the full swing of a strike. He manages to keep up so much tension and suspense throughout that you're just dying for more and more. One word of advice, don't bother reading the introduction by Warren French. It not only gives away the ending, some parts of it sound more as if he were venting some personal vendetta against the Yale professor and literary critic, Harold Bloom. Smack of jealousy? Anyway, it may seem irrelevent to be reading a book about commies in this age of time but I really liked the way Steinbeck was trying to humanise the other side and to show that at the end of the day we were all just human beings. Especially poignant was the constant reference to the mob mentality and how people change completely and adopt animalistic characteristics void of humanity or those associated with the individual. It's scary, how we can degenerate. Just look at the world around us today. Both 'good' and 'evil' are guilty of this i'm afraid. Oh well..."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"By far, Steinbeck had his finest moments writing this story.

It's about the effort of a group of farm workers to organize and their ultimate defeat by the field owners.Jim Nolan joins the Communist party and goes to the camp of a group of fruit pickers in Torgas Valley for training. Soon the strike breaks out; the orchard owners try to bribe the strike leaders (Dakin and London), to no avail, and then bring in strikebreakers from San Francisco. Things get nasty and violent, with men getting beaten up, some shot (Jim and a character named Joy), and the strikers destroying some of the orchards. The book ends on an exciting and passionate note when Jim is ambushed and shot and Mac, another strike organizer, retrieves his body and pleads the striker's cause over his dead body.Steinbeck's novel is insightful and dramatic. It is written almost totally in dialogue, and the men's speech is raw and brutal. Although his sympathies are obviously on the side of the strikers, he doesn't deify them or demonize the opposition. Mac thinks of the strikers as mere pawns and feels the right to do anything to succeed. Doc Burton who comes to the striker's camp in charge of sanitation, is an interesting character because of his neutrality - he doesn't care about the politics involved and refuses to moralize. Steinbeck ends the book in uncertainty: we never really find out what happens with the strikers, their cause, their success. The chief strength of the book lies in Steinbeck's characterizations; the men are well drawn and true to their natures (though one-dimensional, a fault here that was magnificently corrected in THE GRAPES OF WRATH). A powerful book and a defining book in Steinbeck's canon."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"after i read this book I had a feeing of depression, anger, and inspiration all at once. steinbedk has a frighteningly sharp insight and imagination"},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"The novel is, from its shell, seemingly one of Steinbeck's most objective novels. However, analysing this work, you should find that it is in fact a wonderful experiment in psychological writing for mister Steinbeck. The novel analyses mob mentality and the devestation it can inflict, but also is one of the first of his works to include his &quot;group-man&quot; theory, that a cooperative group is man. As for souls, they do not exist in an individual sense, only when man is one, together. While Steinbeck ardently disagreed with the tactics of Communists, this &quot;group-man&quot; suggests a natural socialism... Also, the book is wonderfully fascinating as a kind of modern-day metaphor representing Milton's Paradise Lost. A great read."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"In Dubious Battle seems to be a continuation of Grapes of Wrath, though I considered it far superior to Grapes when I was young. I read this one half a dozen times between the ages of 20 and 30 and loved it each time. Tried it again at 50 and didn't care a whit for it.

Something that struck me as interesting was that almost every review for this book was given 5 stars. There were a few 4's and one idiot who gave it 3 and didn't even state his reason. Anyway its a magnificent book and you should definatly read it. If you have read this or Cannery row please do not go on to read Grapes of Wrath. The book itsn't a fun read.

If you read the book, don't go about analyzing it, it just ruins the story."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"In Dubious Battle was written before Grapes of Wrath, and when read you can see the later, and better book taking shape.

LImited in scope, compared to the epic journey of TGOW, but just as powerful, and with the same fine work."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Published in 1936, this book is Steinbeck's fictional investigation of a strike by migratory fruit pickers in California. It narrates a clash between struggling manual laborers and the corporate owners of apple orchards. The owners have surprised the workers by suddenly dropping the rates they are willing to pay. Enter two Communist agitators spouting their Red doctrine and attempting to incite the pickers to strike and riot against the Capitalists. The agitators have well-organized socialist backing that provides them with funds and contacts, food and propaganda in their pitched battle. The responsibility of the duo, Mac and Jim, is to get the strikers to follow one of their own, London, with his leftist leanings, in the uprising. Steinbeck is sympathetic to the organizers and workers. But, is that sympathy warranted by the facts? The workers were willing to pick at the lower rates, although that would probably mean lower rates for harvesting the upcoming cotton crop as well. Mac and Jim stir them into action using psychological tacticts they have used in previous organizational attempts. On the other hand, the police appear willing to keep mayhem to the minimum. Yet, vigilantes, on the side of the corporations, elicit revenge in the form of shootings and arson. I have read the book carefully, but I must admit that I am confused. As a person who grew up during the years of Commie hunters, the Cold War, and all things Red are wrong, this book forces me to take a long, hard look at my ingrained beliefs. I guess that's good. Anything that makes a person think has to be beneficial. I don't know if I can resolve this issue in my mind, but it has given me things to think about when I am trying to go to sleep at night; and keeping me awake, too. It should also be noted that Steinbeck joined the the League of American Writers, a Communist organization, the year before this book came out. His Communist aspirations led to government scrutiny, especially by the IRS. Oh, if you are trying to quit smoking, I would avoid this book. Steinbeck does a masterful job in recreating the physical and social joys of lighting up. Almost made me go out and buy a pack."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I admire Steinbeck for his beautiful descriptions, his mastery of dialogue and his ability to weave tension and dynamism into his stories, and all three qualities are abundantly on display in this early novel, which I believe is often overlooked. It's one of his best."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Though perhaps I have not trodden the halls of American literature as thoroughly as some, it seems to me that there are few American novels whose heroes are Communist organizers. This is one. An experienced labor organizer and strike director (Mac) takes an enthusiastic tyro (Jim) under his wing. They are soon called to lead a strike among the apple pickers of a California county. How they do it and the conduct of the strike is the subject of the book. The two organizers arrange support from sympathizers in the community, some of whom pay a heavy price for their ideals. Mac operates on an ad-hoc basis, using anything as grist for the mill of Revolution. The strike surfs on waves of violence caused chiefly by the so-called forces of law and order, which servilely do the bidding of the orchard owners and bankers. I wondered, as I read, if Steinbeck would turn against collectivist ideals, which hold that the individual is of no importance in the struggle to overthrow the ruling class. No, he does not. I happen to believe that the end does not justify the means. Here, you will find the opposite argument. That's why I felt that these were tarnished heroes, even if bold and ingenious, struggling valiantly and selflessly for their cause. Social justice is, at last, more important than simple class struggle. Overthrowing everything seems---in the light of the last century of history---to be equivalent to throwing the baby out with the bath water. A character called \\"Doc\\" intimates as much, but his voice is less heard. But, the title intrigues me. What does the adjective \\"dubious\\" actually refer to ? It could be Steinbeck's own question---why is this battle necessary? Or, is the fight against capitalism and oppression of workers the right one ? Or again, is such a fight at all possible, given the power that the owners can wield ? Readers will come to their own conclusions, but you have to admire the ability of the writer.The prose flows swiftly and with masterful dashes of color, interludes of calm, and perceptive portraits of working \\"stiffs\\", as he calls them. Insights on mob psychology and the nature of protest and strikes fill the pages. IN DUBIOUS BATTLE was one of Steinbeck's earlier novels, when his anger at the condition of the working class in America waxed white hot. If you ever wondered why Steinbeck was so popular in the USSR, you will understand after reading this work. It seems to me that it is not much talked about today in the USA, when there is rising resentment of an unjust system, but it should be."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"\`In Dubious Battle' is the first of Steinbeck's depression era books (which also comprises \`Of Mice and Men' and \`Grapes of Wrath) and whilst often overlooked in favour of the later two books, it is very much in the same vein. It has tight, richly evocative language and a story line that highlights the struggles of the time whilst offering up an engrossing plot. Following Jim Nolan, who helps in an apple pickers strike, this book makes you feel the anguish and frustrations of the workers being bullied and exploited by their employers and by the end you are feeling wrung out and exhausted as only a great book can make you feel. There was some controversy when this book was published and it was deemed to be sympathetic to communists and communism, but more than anything else it is a book about the down trodden and overlooked in society. I admit I am a fan of Steinbeck and his work, but even taking that into account this is exceptional even by his high standards. The language captures you immediately and you feel yourself admiring certain turns of phrase on a regular basis and your emotions being stimulated throughout, whether they be anger, sadness, loneliness, happiness or a whole gamut of other feelings. The story keeps you engaged until it's shattering conclusion and like \`Of Mice and Men' and \`Grapes of Wrath' it hits you with full impact and imprints itself on your memory to play over again and again over the coming days after you finish the book. This really is an exceptional novel and shows a master writer at his peak. This comes highly recommended indeed.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"In Dubious Battle, along with many other Steinbeck's, really shows the life and hardships of life from the depression.

The story is propelled along at a quick pace as the situation worsens with each passing day.

I read it in a day on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"When the depression hit and there were more workers than work, landowners were paying workers less and less income each season. The laborers had little recourse and no bargaining room.This story chronicles the birth of the union. It is not how the war was won, but how the battles were waged. These pages are filled with the unity of the men. How they came together and how they fell apart. How leaders were raised and how a directed mob could operate independently of direction.Steinbeck was so committed to the tale. It is timed coinciding with the Grapes of Wrath but it is a completely different story. In this book a reader will not find the starvation aspect that was so present in Grapes of Wrath, nor will they find the family element that bound those pages. It is unique.As always, I am amazed with John Steinbeck. He knew something of man and he shared a bit of it in each of his books. In Dubious Battle he wrote:\\"There aren't any beginnings,\\" Burton said. \\"Nor any ends. It seems to me that man has engaged in a blind and fearful struggle out of a past he can't remember into a future he can't forsee nor understand. And man has met and defeated every obstacle, every enemy except one. He cannot win over himself. How mankind hates itself.\\""},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"John Steinbeck's 1936 novel, In Dubious Battle, follows a labor strike by apple pickers who are attempting to combat a reduction in wages. The novel mainly focuses on the efforts of Jim Nolan, a new member of the Communist Party, who is mentored by Mac McLeod, a long time Party member and experienced labor organizer. Together, these two men try to motivate (and manipulate) the disgruntled workers into standing up for themselves against the land owners who have cut back their salaries.Nolan is emblematic of the disenfranchised worker. He comes from poverty and has watched his father fight against the system only to be beaten down by it. His mother took solace in religion, but it also provided no answers, merely a short, hard miserable life. Jim eschews vices like drinking and smoking, as well as the company of women, mainly because he doesn't want to get \\"nibbled to death\\" by responsibilities that stem from having a family to care for. He only feels alive when he's fighting the system.Mac is more cynical than Nolan, willing to use anything and anyone to achieve his goals. He coaches the younger man on the best ways to organize the striking workers, but also draws strength from the fiery Nolan.As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear that there are two sides surrounding the striking men. On one side are the interests of the land owners and on the other, the interests of the radicals. The outcome of the strike itself (and the men involved) becomes less important than the statement it sends to the other side. The landowners wish to crush the strike to make it clear that their authority is absolute and to prevent future challenges to that authority. The radical organizers don't care whether the strike succeeds or not, so long as it inspires more men to join their cause. Lost in the middle are the men who merely want to work for a decent living and need the strike to make their point.Steinbeck doesn't take either side, but his compelling characters and descriptive prose illustrate the conflict, painting a portrait informed by reality. I enjoyed this novel almost as much asThe Grapes of Wrath (Penguin Classics),East of Eden, andCannery Row: (Centennial Edition). If you're a fan of Steinbeck's writing and haven't read this one yet, make sure you pick it up."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"In Dubious Battle (a quote taken from John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\") is a short powerful novel which will hit you in the solar plexus of your literary being. John Steinbeck wrote three powerful novels of labor unrest in California in the 1930s:\\"In Dubious Battle\\"; \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Of Mice and Men\\".The Plot: Young Jim Nolan joins the Communist Party. He becomes a field worker who is assigned to foment a labor strike in the apple growing region of California. Steinbeck is good in describing the physical setting of the Torgas Valley where the action of the novel transpires. Nolan works with veteran organizer \\"Mac.\\" Mac is a tough old bird who has seen it all!The book is filled with bloody conflict between the orchard owners and the strikers ending in a tragic climax. There are many fascinating characters in this novel including London a striker and Lisa a young woman who gives birth during the strike. Battles between the scabs and strikers show the bitterness of this Depression era narrative. The book is a \\"bildungsroman\\" as we see naive Jim Nolan become a leader among the workers fighting for better pay. As a result of his struggle he gains in maturity and his potential for leadership is realized.Steinbeck's forte is the earthy dialogue he handles so well. He narrates the story in a reportial style avoiding author commentary. He was always on the side of the poor and oppressed.Your reviewer despises Communism! This is, however, a worthy entry in the Steinbeck canon. The author won the Nobel Prize for Literature."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"This book is great. Do not listen to the people who say that the book is boring. The pacing is great, and the characters are strong and believeable. The struggle of the worker continues to this day, and an important novel like this is a great way to see what type of struggle these people faced in the past."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"We all know Steinbeck was a lefty, and we all know that he was sympathetic to labor; but somehow, in this prelude to The Grapes of Wrath, he manages to produce a book that you simply can't put down. Stripped entirely of imagery, etc., a labor battle in California is depicted in all its ugliness. Dos Passos' U.S.A. boiled down to around 300 pages."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I am a huge Steinbeck fan, and have always been. There are a some of his works that I appreciate more than others. Steinbeck captures the heart and the soul of the poverty stricken, the worker bees that keep the social wheels turning. He knows their mind and their emotions like he has been there with them and he believes what they have to say is of value. He brings a warmth and almost acceptance to the idea of being a Communist in America."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"It is one book i read over and over. This and the Grapes of wrath should be must reading in High schools. (however the way this contry is being attacked by our home grown anti-intellectual fundamentalists I fear this won't happen anytime soon)"},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"A long time forgotten when a man had only one concern: to find work at any wage so he could feed his family. No other time in American history exemplifies this best than the Great Depression when transplanted Okies worked up and down the West Coast. In In Dubious Battle by John Steinbeck, a group of migrant workers courageously decided to strike against the powerful and wealthy landowners. Wonderfully written, In Dubious Battle engrosses the reader easily eliciting reaction ranging from outrage to shock.First of all, I was outraged at the owners attempts to break the strike. The owners seemed to have control over just about every thing in the city. For example, the owners hired people called vigilantes to start trouble and then the coops blamed the strikers for the trouble and tried to arrest them. Next, the owners had the newspapers write that the people who got shot were shot by the strikers. A wonder example of how the process used by the owners worked was when a farmer naned Anderson, who let the strikers stay on his farm. The vigilantes burned down his farm, and the papers placed the blame in the strikers. Clearly, the vigilantes and the papers worked for the owners. The puplic did not really know that the strikers were the good guys. The public thought that the strikers were organized crime. For that reason the owners outrage me the most, for decieving the public. However, I was also shocked at how the police and newspapers were seemingly controlled by the owners. The police are supposed to uphold the law at all times. But when one of the strikers was shot and killed by the vigilantes, the cops tried to blame the rest of the strikers, even though the cops knew that the vigilantes did the killing. The papers were also aware of the truth, yet they also blamed the strikers and print editorials written to make the strikers look like organized crime. One of their editorials actually endorsed violence against the strikers:&quot;We believe the time had come to take action...This paper doesnto ad has never believed inviolence; but it does believe that when the law is not sufficient enough to cope eith these kinds of malcontents and miderers, an aroused citezenry must take a hand...&quot;Besides being impressed with how the story got my attention, I was also impressed the the main character, Jim. He was knew to the whole strike idea and was literally learning as he went along. During the story, Jim is under the guidance of a man named Mac, who is in charge. What impresses me the most is Jim's ability to be the only person who is thinking rationally in times of disorder among the rest of the strikers. THis is illustrated best when the strikers turn into a frenzied mob after someone got beat up. Jim, who is at the moment injured, uses his head to not join the mob to attack the owners, who have used the police to barricade the roads. I often thinkthat rationality is the only advantage the strikers have.To sum uo, In Dubious Battle by John Steinbeck is a wonderful book to read, as are all John Steinbeck novels. A person would read about the hadship endured by the migrant workers in a history book by they would only understand whoat happened by reading one of Steinbeck's novels concerning this subject."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"This is one of my favorite books. After reading The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I came along In Dubious Battle. This is one of the best portrayals of labor strife in the 1930's. It read as though you are present with the protagonist. It is exciting and suspenseful, and the reader establishes a true connection with the characters. I learned about strikes, blacklisting, suspected Communists and their treatment, and more. One of Steinbeck's finest masterpieces."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Steinbeck, through In Dubious Battle, shows yet again how great a writer he is. In Dubious Battle is a great tale that incorporates the lifestyle of an applepicker with the idea of forming a union. He follows his tradition by keeping the content of his novel in a fashion that portrays a realistic and timely picture of the life that was lived by the workers in the Torgas Valley, and the others around the nation. Mac and Jim (the main characters) provide an indepth look at the times when a union was considered Communist, and themselves being &quot;Red&quot; for promoting the idea of striking, picketing and forming a union. Not only does In Dubious Battle include the realism already mentioned, but also has many places where Steinbeck infuses his ideas about the world into his characters. In Dubious Battle is a classic story of the common American worker trying to make a decent wage and live a fulfilling life."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"&quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; reads like the last few chapters of Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;: polemical, propagandist, and two-dimensional. Of course, Steinbeck is always a fabulous writer, but this work simpply can't compare to &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;East of Eden&quot;. The characters are types (the cold-blooded radical, the hot-blooded radical, the straight and simple working-class leader) without the perfect nuances of individual character that one usually finds in Steinbeck's creations. The prose is less poetic than in his earlier novels; if you're the sort that hates Dickens and Hardy and you skipped the rambling descriptive chapters if &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; I guess that wouldn't be a minus though. But unless you're a die-hard Steinbeck fan, you might as well skip this one in my opinion."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I love this book! I don't know how many times I've reread it, but it is my favorite of all of Steinbeck's works."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"This is novel was an interesting book to someone who is interested in history, but for most others it is rather dry. The main character, Jim Nolan, is at time likable and also despicable. The other characters are not as endearing as those from &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;Of Mice &amp; Men&quot;. If you are looking to read a GOOD Steinbeck novel then read one of the aforementioned, but spare yourself from reading this novel. It reads quickly and is easy to understand, but it just doesn't grab you like his other books. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was due to the highly accurate portryal of migrant life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"Good Service, received on time, book was a bit beat up but was acceptable since it was used. No Complaints."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"East of Eden.\\" Instead I have focused on \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and his lesser known works, such as \\"To a God Unknown\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"Pastures of Heaven.\\" I've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular.When I began reading \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck's work. Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac, it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac's radical cell. There is a great (and misleading) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar, work secretly through letters, go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers. Early on, the pace is fast, exciting, and engaging.Suddenly, Steinbeck simply fails to deliver, leaving the reader wondering when he's going to pick up the pace again. After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker's strike, I expected the sense of excitement to continue. It simply never does.Summary of \\"In Dubious Battle\\" - Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired. Workers get mad. Workers get tired.The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking. And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first, they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book. Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration, and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense......and eating. Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story, because at least a good 25% of the story concerns finding, eating, and (worst of all) TALKING about food. There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story, but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment, discussing whatever comes to mind.Steinbeck's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters. But I advise any reader of \\"In Dubious Battle\\" to take this course - after the strike is initiated, simply set the book down. You won't miss anything. Nothing of great import happens, and only a very few memorable characters ever surface, and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces.I suppose now I'll give \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" a go. Perhaps if it isn't one of his \\"greats,\\" it isn't worth reading."},{"Title":"In dubious battle","review":"I know it's considered sacrilige to be critical of the great John Steinbeck, but this book is an insufferable soap box bore. If the characters didn't repeat themselves so endlessly, 100 pages could have been shaved off, and the book would be better for it. There was not one character in the story I cared about, and I was relieved to reach the end."},{"Title":"Folk Art of Europe","review":"The plates reproduced in this book are the same which were published in &lt;u>Peasant Art in Europe&lt;/u> (1927).

The &quot;rape&quot; scenes were not what I thought they would be. Yes, it's rape because she didn't want to, but in the first scene, during the rape, she's actually thinking how good it starts to feel. Hmmm... If you've ever read Stormfire by Christine Monson, the heroine is raped, no pleasure there. Not so in this story. And it is understandable how she falls in love with him. Tristan is actually very funny, and he does grow to love her. You can see it, if you read the story.This just proves to me that it's best to read a book you're interested in, and judge for yourself.

It struck me that the only way you could possibly rationalize the final relationship is that it is similar to Stockholm Syndrome. There is such brutality in some of the rapes, that it is impossible for me to believe love could exist. It is more like a poison or disease of the mind. Rape does not lead to love! Now, I gave this three stars, because I still think Johanna Lindsey is a good author. I'm just not sure where her mind was when she wrote this book. The male lead watches his mother get brutally raped and murdered, so he lives his entire life only to track down the man who did it and kill him... So then how does he justify the fact that he kidnaps, and then rapes and keeps this woman prisoner for a year? Because she belongs to him... That's what the book says is his answer. I felt sorry for her when she got pregnant. I wouldn't want to have a child of his. You can't change DNA, and there's always the risk she'd be giving life to yet another rapist. Disgusting!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I'm a lover of most Johanna Lindsey books but this book was terrible. There was no chemistry between the main characters (but how can chemistry occur when the first meeting involves rape). At no point in this book was love or even seduction developed. But, rape was mentioned over and over. This was so degrading and the main character Bettina by the end of the book has lost all her spunk. I love Lindsey's book because the female characters are strong and the strength is appreciated in the end by the man she loves. Not so in this book, Bettina's strength is broken and instead she's \\"tamed.\\" Disgusting!!!! Now onto Tristan how about callous, arrogant, rude, spiteful and RAPIST. Perhaps this was the equivalent of \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" in a romance book. I felt obliged to finish this book but immediately it was taken off my device."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Huge Lindsey fan for decades and I wish I hadn't picked up this relic from her early years. First - the writing is terrible. It's not close to the standard of her later works (which, again, I love). I thought it was new because it shows as new in Nook (I guess cause it's new there). I was relieved to find out that it was so old, because when I thought it was new I assumed that Johanna had either lost her mind or stopped writing her own books and that someone was simply using her name. Second - rape is not romance. I stopped reading and deleted the book from my Nook (despite having paid for it) after 53 pages - right around the time the \\"hero\\" rapes her again. I don't need a hero like that. I've read reviews here that make me glad of my decision as apparently he just rapes her over and over again before she magically falls in love with him. I've also read reviews claiming he \\"wouldn't hurt her\\" and that his threats (to whip her, and hurt her while he rapes her) are \\"empty threats.\\" To those reviews I have to say, WTF?! He's a rapist."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I found this book very disturbing. I was very surprised. The word rape appreared thoughout the book. The women in her life we acting as if it was no big deal. I always finish I book I've started. That was the only reason I kept reading. However, I enjoy Lindsey's books. This is the only bad one in all that I have read. I hope that my fellow readers will not stop reading her books. She has written some great ones."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I was very disappointed in this story. Tristan repeatedly rapes Bettina. He also insists on calling it \\"making love\\". Bettina tries to get away several times. The first time she is thrown in jail only to be released into Tristans custody. The second time she manages to make it to her betrotheds land only to be kidnapped again. She manages to get away then only to be captured by the first man that tried to rape her. She finally gets away from him to find her betrothed. She is with him for only 24 hrs before Tristan kidnaps her again. She then finds herslef pregnant with her rapists baby. During all of this her made and her mother both try to talk her into giving in to the rape and finding love with Tristan since he is such a handsome man. Bettina finally decides that she loves Tristan so now that she no longer considers it rape it's now time for her to be kidnapped yet again. So now Tristan must go and save her from her latest kidnapper. seriously this poor girl is kidnapped 1. by Tristan 2. Jail then handed back to Tristan 3. Shawn the sea dog 4. Antoine (the first attempted rapist) 5. Tristan 6. Bastidia and finally back to Tristan again.

I will admit I didn't read the entire book so this is not an entirely fair review- but I think what I read is enough to warn other readers to NOT BUY THIS BOOK or even try reading it, unless rape in your romance novels is your thing.The book was good until Bettina gets put onto the pirate's ship. There she meets the captain Tristan and is immediately and roughly shoved into his bedchamber, where he sits her down and calmly discusses how he's going to have his way with her, like it or not. Of course she doesn't like this and so he threatens to torture and kill some innocent people from the ship she came from unless she doesn't put up any resistance. How lovely! Like the fact she's not resisting makes it not rape??? What sickened me even more where the discriptions of how she kind of liked it! What! This is just awful. My heart goes out to any rape victim and I'm pretty sure that they found no pleasure in it!After that I just had to put this book down.

Tristan tells Bettina that they have taken many of her ship hostage and they will be slowly tortured to death unless she submits to him without physically fighting him....Towards the end of the book, Tristan is fighting with the man who raped his mother and murdered his parents.

I kept her, and she will bear my child and become my wife.\\" Don't sentiments like that just make you all warm and gushy inside?This is really a book I would have been much happier not reading.

It surprises me that anyone would think that women want to read about a girl being continually raped and sexually assaulted as fun entertainment."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"To each his or her own, for those that liked 'A Pirate's Love'. But what I will never understand is this argument that because this story didn't occur in the here and now, readers should just 'go with the flow' and accept that part of the 'romance' of this book, was rape.Is rape really any different in any century?The story is about this poor, pretty 19 year old named Bettina Verlaine, who has been ordered by an uncaring father to marry a man named Compte Pierre Lambert. He owns a sugar plantation in the Caribbean. Bettina has to go by a ship the Compte has paid for, and she is to take her nanny, a woman named Madeline or 'Maddy'.Bettina makes the mistake of drying her wet hair on deck. The fact that she wanted to do this at all causes some upheaval on the ship, since the captain doesn't want his men lusting after Bettina.Well, Bettina is almost raped by some crew guy on the ship. He is punished by being whipped. THEN the ship is captured by pirates, specifically because the pirate captain saw her from afar and has decided he wants her for himself. And his name is Tristan Matisse and he's 26.Every reader is going to get something different out of this story. Bettina and Maddy are kidnapped. Maddy is just locked up in another room. Bettina is the one that had to bear the brunt of everything. Meaning Tristan tells her to submit so he won't 'have to rape her'. Bettina knows good and well, especially in the year 1667, that if she 'submits', that means she'll become his whore. And she's not interested in that becoming her path in life. So she fights him.What she gets in return are bruised wrists(she's held down everytime), painful penetrations, guff from a rape free Maddy, who tells her to submit because Tristan is handsome, a lot of physical grappling with this slob, who doesn't wipe down after each rape...a lot of incessant prattling from Tristan...etc..etc..etc..also, stressed out Bettina is always trying to get him to assault her quickly, so that he gets no pleasure. Because in her mind, if he thinks she likes it, he'll be on her morning, noon and night. If it's not good for him, maybe he'll leave her in peace.Bettina tries to run off twice and fails, since she's still not really interested in living as some obsessed pirate's mistress. So by now, she discovers that Pierre isn't interested in marrying her, her mother(who was captured by Tristan and can prance around Tristan's house rape free as well) agrees with Maddy and thinks she should just give in. And to make matters worse, she is now pregnant with her rapist's baby and is trapped by her circumstances.Then from page 286-287, Bettina falls in love with him.This story needed another hero. Someone else to save Bettina from Tristan. Someone that could have taught her the difference between lovemaking and rape. And someone that wouldn't have held what happened to her at the hands of a pirate, against her. Who WOULD have been nice, is dashing hero Clayton from Judith McNaight's 'Whitney, My Love'. But we're talking about two different periods...different people. But he would've made Bettina a great husband and first lover."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"When I first read this horrible book, I was a teenager, and the rape scenes between the \\"hero\\" and the heroine were extremely upsetting to me. So, years later, I decide to try it again to see if the book is as bad as I thought it was when I was young. MY GOD, IT IS EVEN WORSE NOW.This story is actually a really good portrayal of a nightmarish horror story.

He's an okay guy! Accept your lot in life! What you want doesn't matter!\\"The hero is disgusting. He does not care at all about the heroine, about what she wants, about the fact that she in no way wants to have sex with him.

She's 'the most beautiful creature in the whole wide world' or whatever and kind of an idiot, but she still is generally unobjectionable. She's married off by her father and heads out to sea with her nurse maid to her new home. The ship gets taken over by pirates headed by Captain Tristan and Bettina and her maid are captured. The rest of the story goes like this:Tristan: I'm going to rape you.Bettina: Please sir! Please do not rape me!Tristan: Take your clothes off.Bettina: I beg of you sir! I beg you please do not rape me!Tristan: I'm raping you but if you hold still while I'm doing it, I won't torture your ship's crew.Bettina: Oh sir! Please! I don't want to be raped!Tristan: Silence! You said you wouldn't struggle.Bettina: Fine! I hate you![Tristan shoves into her painfully and finds his own pleasure]Tristan: If you hadn't sassed me, maybe I would have let you enjoy it.Bettina: You're right, sir. BTW, I think I may love you.Fin.There. I just saved you 8 bucks. You can thank me later.I have never been more repulsed, horrified or traumatized by a romance novel. And I have NEVER given a book one star before. And really, if I could give it negative stars I would. There is no way to establish a romance on rape. And spending the next several hundred pages trying to justify it was more sickening than the rape itself. Or should I say the 'Rapes (Plural) themselves'. I have read Lindsey's books before and have never been a huge fan but this one takes the cake. I'm steering clear of Lindsey after this.Also, some reviewers noted that this book was published in the 80's but this book was RE-published with a shiny, contemporary looking cover and readily available at bookstores. Most people don't check to see when a book is published. I didn't know until I came on here. So many people will just think Lindsey is an insensitive, misogynistic crazy person. I don't know what the heck the publishers were thinking. The publishers know times have changed and I have no idea why they thought this was appropriate or something modern women would like. Frankly, they were wrong."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Wow. I have 50 MORE Johanna Lindsey books saved on my kindle at this moment. Since reading this horrible book, I may just delete them all today.SPOILER ALERT!He rapes her repeatedly, admits it and NEVER regrets it.He refuses to marry her for a long stretch of time.The twists and turns were just irritating.He abandons her right when she is about to give birth and to cheer her up says. \\"Well the next time we see each other you will be slim again. In the meantime you will have the child to occupy you.\\" WHAT????Then,she is abducted right as she is about to give birth.She is put into a bad position for the baby to be born and is told that the baby should die. AND if she screams during childbirth that she will probably cause her \\"hero?\\" to be killed.Besides the fact that Johanna Lindsey is long winded and never knows when to leave a decent plot alone. The \\"love?\\" scenes did NOTHING for me.Just a terrible book. Johanna Lindsey is fired for me."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I am no feminest but hey - since when is rape aceptable as a sign of love. Tristan was a maliscious rapist who thought he had the right to violate and control woman.Forcing Bettina to become his sex slave just to satisfy his lust , not even considering her feelings . This book was so disguting and frustating filled with hate . I was wondering when was it going to end . The book would have been alright if seduction was used in place of rape , the setting was very good ,but I have never read of such an evil man before as the hero."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Lindsey, I realize must be a rape or abuse victim. She often has the hero abuse the heroine. While in some books, Fires of Winters for example it is upsetting but given the historical context and a sufficiently repentant hero one can kind of understand. In this book the hero raped the heroine repeatedly. It was sick. I can't even recall when she consented? So what if she enjoyed it, it is still rape. On top of that he had some serious issues, telling her he wanted to beat her constantly, including when she was pregnant! Seriously, this guy is terrible and there is NOTHING charming about him. Ugh. I bought this book for entertainment on my train ride down for Christmas to my parent's house, I will throw it away as I don't want anyone to believe I enjoy this rubbish."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Warning Spoilers Ahead: Might as well read them, since this is a horrible book!As the first book I have ever read by Johanna Lindsey, this was a real disappointment. The so called hero continually rapes the heroine, imprisons her, threatens her, and other people if she doesn't comply to his sexual desires (a different kind of rape than outright violent rape - which he does as well). [...]Almost every male in the book is one who is no where near a \\"good\\" man in my opinion. Almost every man in the book has tried to rape Bettina. One man rapes her repeatedly, another man tries to kill her after he gets punished for trying to rape her, her betrothed ends up being regular visitor at a brothel and wants to keep her as his mistress since she's been sullied by being raped, etc. [...]The woman falls in love with the man who kidnapped her and raped her repeatedly, and he also assaulted her a few times with the intent to scare her. There isn't a \\"good\\" man in the book! If they didn't try to rape someone, they did something else that was bad. Several men are murderers, or attempt to murder people, including Bettina. One man abandoned his pregnant lover out of pride that he couldn't provide for her. He is also the same man who wouldn't help a 19 year old begging for help to get away from her rapist kidnapper - oh jolly, it just happens she's his abandoned daughter, too!And the man who she thought was her father arranged her marriage to some stranger she'd never even met for economic gain and cared nothing about her even though she'd tried to win his love since she was a girl.Even the women are bad! There's a lot of \\"Oh Bettina, why do you hate Tristan so much?\\" when he's been raping her nightly and keeping her tied up and locked in her room - at one point, Bettina had a mental breakdown from all the abuse (but since she wasn't with Tristan at the time, I guess it's not his fault *sarcasm*). They were telling her to just make the best of it! I couldn't believe that they seemed to be against her and siding with the men! \\"He's not so bad, he's been GOOD TO YOU.\\" What in the world?!?!? Even her nurse and mother (who are both supposed to love her as mothers do) don't even really try to help her. About the only other women in the novel are either promiscuous women who are jealous about her position in Tristan's bed, or are servants - who don't speak any language Bettina does and who seem to have no opinion about her situation because they don't care what their masters do to her.I also hated the treatment of her as a pregnant woman - one man was going to torture and murder her if he couldn't use her, and Tristan was going to leave her alone to have his baby while he was off hunting for vengeance. What about Bettina's vengeance? What about all the crimes Tristan and his crew committed against Bettina, her mother and her nurse (but mainly Bettina)? Oh, that's right, they don't matter. It's some how just fine that Tristan rapes Bettina. I can't get past that, and I can't forgive it. I'll never read another Johanna Lindsey book because of this ridiculous piece of crap. There was a line at the end I was just flabbergasted to read, and another reviewer has already picked it out. I'd give this book NEGATIVE stars if that was possible. I LIKE pirate romances.... where the pirate SEDUCES the woman, NOT rapes her. Seduction can lead to romance and love, but rape is so far from romance and love, it shouldn't even be considered anywhere near such things. Rape is violence and hate, not love."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I have been a huge fan of Johanna Lindsay's novels for a long time, especially the Mallory novels. But this book offended me so much that I wonder if I will ever be able to view her the same way. The &quot;heroine&quot; was repeatedly raped by her captor - and it was not the typical sex where the woman has to be persuaded and then it is wonderful. This woman was repeatedly RAPED, screamed through it and had bruises on her wrists to show for it. Then for some reason which is not apparent to the reader, the &quot;heroine&quot; falls in love with her captor. If you are a Lindsay fan, SKIP THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Johanna Lindsey has been a favorite author of mine since I first read, &quot;Say You Love Me&quot;. I've taken in to consideration that this book is supposedly one of her earlier writings. All in all, the book was a fair read. The plot was interesting enough but I soon tired of the interaction between Tristan and Bettina. Granted, a lot of readers were turned off by the whole &quot;rape&quot; thing but having been made an avid reader of historical romances after reading &quot;The Flame and The Flower&quot; and &quot;The Wolf and The Dove&quot; by Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, I was able to understand that this was a theme found in quite a few romance books written during this time frame. What did bother me was that, unlike the characters in the novels I mentioned before, most of the interaction between the two main characters in this book consisted mainly of rape and the author didn't seem to take the time to show how the two developed feelings towards one another as time went on. It was more like...&quot;I'm going to rape you.&quot; &quot;I hate you.&quot; &quot;I'm going to rape you&quot;. &quot;I hate you.&quot; &quot;I'm going to rape you.&quot; &quot;I think I may be falling in love with you.&quot; WHAAAT???The storyline has enough to keep you reading but one reading was enough for me. I'll not likely be pulling this one out of the bookcase again any time soon."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I am torn between liking this book and hating it, I did like some of the story line.I DID NOT like how Tristan treated Bettina in the beginning of the book, telling her to remove all her clothing to take advantage of her was not cool and threatening her with the whip if she fights him when he forces himself on her, then I felt in the middle of the book when Tristan and Bettina are fighting and not speaking to each other but Bettina couldn't wait to be in his arms again or when his old lover(Gabby)shows up and stays with him Bettina is very jealous and shows it, Bettina explains that she misses being next to him in bed, misses waking up with him and how she wants Tristan to come get her from her mothers room to bring her back to his room and at the end of the book when Tristan finally realizes that he loves Bettina and has respect for her, their love felt real to me.The raping part is what I hated the most. I think Lindsay should have toned it down a big notch. In reality a woman would NEVER fall in love with her rapist especially if he got her pregnant but this is a FICTIONAL book its coming from Johanna Lindsays imagination. I did delete this off my Kindle because I will not read it again, I will still continue to read Lindsays novels because she is an amazing author and I love her stories."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"When I first picked up this book I was a bit apprehensive but decided, what the heck, how bad can it be? The answer is, pretty bad. Normally I'll finish a book, even if it's not the best, but with A Pirate's Love I couldn't even last a hundred pages. Not only was the book extremely stilted, but I felt like I was reading sentences from a child. I am usually not very critical but there is a point when one must draw the line and say enough is enough. I also didn't enjoy reading about the Bettina being raped continually by the &quot;hero.&quot; In conclusion, what can I say? One must reevaluate the merits of a novel when someone who usually isn't the least bit picky or judgmental thinks that this Lindsey novel makes better fire kindling than reading material."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I read this book a long time ago when I was a teenager and I enjoyed the book. It's funny how people's outlook change. Back then most of the popular historical romance authors wrote rape scenes into their stories, take Rosemary Rogers (though she stopped, thank goodness in her more recent books, even the great Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rebecca Brandewynne. It was like a mine field trying to avoid them, because a lot of the heroines were raped by either someone other than the hero or by many other men, shown semi-graphically- I say this because sex scenes they wrote back then would be tame by today's standards). I couldn't stand it, but back then rape or \\"forced seduction\\" by the hero was the theme of the day. Now we know better.I hate that people attack this book because of the forceful seduction or rape by the hero. This book is so much better than what we're getting now with boring, formulaic, historical romances. No wonder historicals are on the decline. Historicals written today are fluff and many of the authors don't even take time out to thoroughly research their period. The characters are unrealistic because they're written with a 21st century mentality and not the mindset of the time they are supposed to take place in. I go on about this because historical romance has always been my favorite genre, but now I'm frustrated because I can't find one book that gives me that feeling of being back in time, like books by Laurie McBain, Kathleen Woodiwiss, Shirlee Busbee, Patricia Rice, and I can name a dozen more.Times change, I get it and I even remember back in the 80's when there was a public service message against romance books (that they were just fiction). Romance books were even blamed for spousal abuse, so the industry changed. Historical romance books have now become formulaic, boring and unrealistic, even pornographic (I don't see much outcry against the pornography we get today). People have now turned other romance genres like paranormal books, because they were allowed to be different and don't depend on realism, but now they're getting standardized. Without these early authors, the romance industry wouldn't be what it is, and we would all believe that everybody in history, of all types were polite, understanding, civilized and caring. Myself, I like to read historicals for a bit of realism.People should read the copyright cover page to see when the book was originally published, because many of the longer lasting historical romance writers have books out there that have been reprinted several times.I do agree with AngelMimi's review and this was more of a \\"forced seduction\\", and I know I will get a lot of boo's out of this, but remember this is fiction. I do not condone rape and I'm all for women's rights and glad I'm not living in the past but let's not get hot and bothered with something that was written before we all \\"knew\\" better."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I think Johanna Lindsey writes very well especially in developing her characters, their relationships with each other and their dialog. However, I thought the romance between these two characters was a bit dark. The pirate (Tristan) continually raped her and up to the end he was not ready to marry the herione (Bettina) even though he realized he loved her. Also, how could he have left her again only weeks before she was about to have a baby? I like to have conflict between two characters because it makes it exciting but when there is too much conflict (as the case in this book), somehow the romance goes sour. I found myself intrigued by this book and I read it fully without being bored, but I really liked the other book I have read by Johanna Lindsey much better (Once a Princess)."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"The time frame is in the 1600s when privateers were enlisted by England to raid Spanish ships. The French also participated. Privateers are basically pirates under the protection of England with permission to exact their piracy upon the Spanish.Bettina is breathtakingly beautiful and has been essentially hidden away by her unloving father. Starved for attention from her father whom wished for a boy, she develops a growing temper. He sends her off to live and become educated in a convent. She has lived a very sheltered life and knows nothing of the ways of men. She has finally learned her place and it is time that her father arranges a marriage for her. He has selected Pierre Comte de Lambert, a young, handsome, and rich plantation owner in the Caribbean. While her mother has filled her heart with dreams of choosing a man of her own, the convent taught her to control her temper and accept her fate. She obeys her father and with her lifelong servant in tow boards a ship to be taken to her betrothed.Tristan is a privateer under the protection of England. Ever since he was a young boy he has vowed to kill Don Miguel de Bastida. Unsuccessful at his deed, Tristan takes a break from seeking revenge and spotted Bettina from a distance while on her way to her betrothed. Tristan declares that he must have her. He disregards the fact that the ship is not a Spanish ship and boards her anyways. Apparently, Bettina had not lost her fiery temper after all. Tristan is spellbound by her beauty and keeps her to himself but this spirited lady also captures his heart.This is the first Johanna Lindsey book that I have read. At first, I was distracted by Bettina's lack of response to certain things. For example, (spoiler alert) she handled learning the true identity of her father very well. For such a spirited young lady as the author tried to portray her, she did not really seem to live up to that image. The rape scenes in the beginning I thought were a little difficult to read too but not because of the rape itself. Her reaction and how the events unfolded didn't seem realistic to me. I almost wanted to put it down at that point but my mother-in-law said it ended well so I trudged on.I was actually surprised at how the events unfolded after that. The story was complex and intertwined. There was a climax and a very happy ending. There were even a few little side stories so that the story wasn't entirely about Tristan and Bettina. Bettina's reactions started to become clearer and more realistic. By the ending, I felt good which is exactly how this genre is supposed to make you feel. I think I may read another one of her books.Now to address the \\"elephant in the room:\\" the rape. I am not a fan of rape stories and in the beginning I felt like it was kind of an offense to women who had been raped. I think it was easier to get passed because in the beginning he had used trickery to get her to submit rather than brute force. Essentially, it is still about control though. But the moment in which I started liking Tristan was the moment he gave into Bettina's demand for a clean shaven face. Then when his prickles reddened her face, he decided to keep it cleaned shaved all the time. He would shave just before dinner so not to harm her. There were a few brutal moments but moments like when he stood up for her when someone said she was a whore makes the story acceptable. He exclaimed, \\"She is not a whore!\\" She did find enjoyment in the sexual acts, which is by no means an excuse, but I think if he had wooed her a little rather than exact certain control that Tristan would have found a way to her bed anyways.In my opinion, it would have been better if there was no rape. I would have liked to have seen Bettina submit to him willingly because of the bond they shared outside the bed. I would have liked to have seen a growing relationship sort of like in Beauty and the Beast (sorry, that was the best I could think of at this moment). What makes me able to overlook the rape is the fact that in most cases he was gentle and cared for Bettina well. The fact that he truly seemed to care for her was also a factor and then ultimately Bettina was able to find love for her captor as well. This genre aims for happy thoughts and is known for the sex scenes. With these characters, as prideful as they were, the sex would have been cut down dramatically had Tristan needed to gain Bettina's approval before getting into her bed. Because of the rape, this book will not appeal to all readers. Either way, the ending was in fact good."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"The first \\"love\\" scene(heavy sarcasm) should have warned me to chuck this horrid book into the trash. If you are in the mood to be utterly disgusted then this is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I give this books 5 stars not because I love Johanna Lindsey and hate to see her books get less than they deserve or because I like to be in the minority (which I generally am) but because I thought this book was great. I agree it was extreme but sometimes the traditional romance can get boring and you need something to spice it up."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Johanna Lindsey is one of my all time favorite authors. This is by far, her worst book. I bought it and read it, because I love and own all her others. I will not read it again, it was so offensive. I just cannot believe that a woman who is repeatedly raped can come to love her rapist. For those who have read this as one of thier first Lindsey books, please do not give up on her. As with most Romance novelists styles change through the decades. This is one of Johannas older books, and, unfortunatley, reflects the writting styles of it's time. I recommend everyone to pass on this book. If you want to read a good book, and an exaple of Linsdey's increadible writting I recommend &quot;Heart's Aflame&quot;, &quot;Tender Rebel&quot;, &quot;Gentel Rouge&quot;, or &quot;Angel&quot;. She has many INCREADIBLE books, but this is not one of them. As much as I dislike this book, I still love her writing, and applaude her willingness to delve into different worlds, styles, and stories. All her newer books, are definatley worth reading, and it is great to see the growth of her writting through the years. Johanna Lindsey has earned her title of one of the best romance writers. Yet not everyone is perfect, and this is an example of that truth. Pass on this book, and read the rest."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Worst book I've read in a very long time and first of Johanna Lindsay's. Believe me, I won't pick up another. When did repeated rape lead to everlasting love except as Stockholm syndrome as one reviewer pointed out? Publisher ought to be hung and I cannot for the life of me understand where the good reviews I saw listed came from. Did Johanna stay up three days in a row to write them under different names? Not only was it poorly written, but Bettina was unbelievable, and though Tristan was a pirate, if he's going to be the hero of the story, he has to have SOME redeeming qualities other than not raping or bedding another woman while he's busy raping Bettina for months.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I saw \\"A Pirartes Love\\" at the store and it caught my eye, one because it was a Johanna Lindsey novel and I read her Malory novels and loved them and two because I like pirate stories. I wasn't too sure whether I should get it or not so I read the reviews and they honestly turned me off from the book, but I decided to give it a chance anyway and I am happy to say that I am glad that I didn't listen to the bad reviews.This book is about a french woman named Bettina who is kidnapped by a pirate named Tristian, and yes ladies and gentleman he does rape her, repeatedly. But from the very beginning of the book there is a connection between the two of them that is present, but Bettina is reluctant to admit to it because Tristian did rape her. I'm not condoning the act of rape but this is the plot of the book, which is fiction, so there is no need to sound the alarms and be disgusted by it. As the book progresses it does turn into a love story, though the lines are blury as to how it got to that point. It pretty much jumped from I hate him to I love him in the matter of a page without much explination as to the light bulb moment when Bettina realized it.Another matter in question is how Bettina's mother and maid tried to convince her to submit to Tristian even though he raped her. This book takes place in the late 1600s when men ruled women and women knew this was there lot in life and they knew that men had the power to do as they please. As bad as it might seem that Tristian did rape Bettina, aside from that fact he treated her good, and only treated her badly or became rough with her when she pushed his buttons, he did try to show her pleasure, and be gentle with her. If your looking for a book where the women are equal to the men, then historical novels, especially this book is not the right read for you.As far as Johanna Lindsey goes as an author, this was only her second novel and personally I think it was pretty good, though she has improved tremendously through the years, and I don't think that because you read this book and don't like it means that you should be completely turned off by her as a writer, if you didn't like this book then definatly give her another chance and try the Malorys. All in all this book is a good read and should not be read or taken literally but as a work of fiction."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Anyone who reads Johanna Lindsey's books know that the character are ignorant to the last minute. This is no different with Bettina. She is captured by a pirate who desires her. She claims she does not desire him but the way she describes him and express her feelings gives the readers another idea. All of Johanna Lindsey's book protray the characters as saying one thing but thinking another. She does call it rape but it is not rape. No rape victim gets sweep in the moment. The dialogue is good and story is very suspenseful. The ending is very sweet and you feel for Bettina and Tristen. Read the book and see if it is so call rape because it looks like ignorance and sexual chemistry to me."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"When I started reading Ms. Lindsey's books some time ago, I did not read this one because it had so many negative reviews. I figured that so many readers could not be wrong. When I had finished reading most of her books, I decided to read this one anyway. I found out that they WERE WRONG! Lesson learned: find out for yourself~ It is a love story of a beautiful girl who is captured by a pirate and ravished by him. It turns into a passionate love story set in the Carribean amidst tropical scenery. This is not one of my favorite Lindsey works, but Ms. Lindsey excels at writing even when she is not going full steam. It is worth reading and savoring for what it is, a fine escapist novel with an exciting tale of romance."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"i liked the book,enough to finish it. it wasnt the best of her works, but not the worst (so far). tristin did treat her badly, but i believe that is how it was back then, but toward the end they fall in love with each. the ending saved the book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I think, it was a remarkable book, I'm not a big reader and I could not put this book down!

Now I want to read and collect all of Lindsey's novels. If anybody wants to read romance mixed with the Carribean adventure, I would definitely recommend this one"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I felt I needed to put a review because so much controversy was given to this story. There is no mis-treatment of the heroine in this story by the hero. The heroine is a hot headed young girl who is a trifle spoiled. Lots of reviews were dedicated to the \\"rape of the heroine\\" on amazon I noticed and really there isn't any rape or violence in this book. Our heroine from the start desired the hero and admits her desire for the hero she is just immature and dramatic and uses the word rape indiscriminately in the beginning of the book. Rape is a terrible offense that generally most women don't recover from. It breaks a woman's spirit and traumatizes a woman & most normal woman can't have normal relationship with men once exposed to this violence, they certainly don't desire and crave their offender as our heroine does. This girl was immature and spoiled so after her seduction by the hero she threw the word rape around a lot. She was never scared of the hero and in fact was a willing participant in their intimate relations on most occasions. My only issue is that she seemed like a really poorly sketched out character in the beginning of the book she threw so many childish fit I felt like putting her in time out. Thank god ms. Lindsay gave her personality more dimension in the second part of the book when she became likable and more in tune to her feeling. I am glad this was not a story about rape since it is every woman's worst nightmare. This story was about a beautiful spoiled girl seduced by a hot forceful alpha male. He basically tamed her. I think every woman likes a man who is over bearingly seductive but caring and kind at the same time. This hero was all these things and more. Please don't let the reviews put you off if you like ms. Lindsay's work. This book was sweet and there was no violence in it at all (except when the heroine punched or hit the hero really does this sound like he was abusing her). I think fans who read historical novels are looking for the forceful alpha male types more of this era. That's what makes these stories yummy and fun. I don't know if the people who left bad reviews finished the book to see how these two people grew to love each other and bloom into a mature relationship the second half of the book clearly shows the heroine growing up and figuring out her feeling towards the hero. Lastly if you are abusing the heroine you don't set her mother up in the same house. So something got lost in translation for the people who left the bad reviews the girl was not used or abused and she got her happily ever after. Maybe less use of he word rape would have helped the story. Rape is a strong word the elicits strong negative emotions thats all I can think because the reviews are very different from person to person. Regardless this is a sweet story and not offensive in anyway. I like romances with a strong male lead and this falls into that category. Hope this review helps the readers."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"THIS IS THE FIRST ROMANCE BOOK I EVER READ AND THAT WAS 17 YEARS AGO.IT GOT ME HOOKED ON ROMANCE NOVELS.I READ IT OVER AND OVER.SIMPLY THE BEST!!!!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"First I will start off with the whole \\"rape\\" issue in this book, I guess I thought of rape in a different since, he never beat her and as a romance novel goes, he never really \\"forced\\" her.

To me, a romantic hero is someone who SAVES a woman from rape.I don't know what the hell Ms. Lindsey was thinking."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I found this book to be extremely unrealistic and even corny at times. It's not much more than a naughty pleasure to read if forced sex is one of your private fantasies. Everything else in the book is merely a frame for Tristan's constant one-sided sex life with Bettina, the main character.One thing I found strange was how much Bettina enjoyed it. As soon as Tristan is fully in the act of forcing himself on her, she becomes his passionate and willing lover. She resumes her very passionate hatred of him after it is over, only to drop it once again the next time she is invaded.One thing that amused me a little was the fact that Bettina is extremely beautiful and hates random features about herself as thought we're supposed to accept that they are as unattractive as she thinks them to be. Those features? Long legs, slender hips, straight blonde hair (knee length, I might add). Come on, let's be realistic here...Of course, she has a fiery temper. Strike two for the Mary Sue.My overall impression? It's far from one of my favorites, but I can understand the appeal for some... it's basically one long rape fantasy."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I thought that I loved all of Lindsey's books but I was wrong. This was too unrealistic and Tristan is the sort of male I did not enjoy reading. Lots of scenes of rape. Hated how Bettina is taking all his crap and should have searched for a better person to love who would never refuse to marry her over and over. The story didn't have any depth or feeling to the story."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I hated this book...I have been reading Johanna Lindsey forever and Ms. Lindsey NO MEANS NO!!! My book not even finished is headed for the trash!!!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I am usually a fan of Ms. Lindsey. Angel is one of my favorite romances. But this was... nearly indescribably disappointing. The heroine is raped repeatedly, and unrepentantly, by the supposed hero, yet she falls in love with him for no apparent reason. The villain is a two-dimensional stereotype, the side stories are predictable and bland, the main storyline is underdeveloped and does not build suspense. My time would have been better spent re-reading one of her other novels."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I am absolutely dissapointed. The only reason why I finished the book is because I spent money to buy it. It took me almost 2 months to finish reading it because the characters in the story line was too lame."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Please, please do not assume all her books are like this. I found this copy amongst my other romance novels (buried in a box). I think I read it when I was younger but was too naive to understand what was going on. As an adult, I could not get passed the rape scenes and the two protagonists' personalities. Bettina annoyed me to no end, and Tristan needs to be tortured for his acts,then hung where the vultures can consume him. I love Johanna Lindsey's books so much. I'm so glad this wasn't my first introduction to her. I'm just going to pretend it never existed."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Johanna Lindsey is one of my favorite authors. I have read all of her books and I have enjoyed each one, except Pirates Love. The book was well written but I had a probelm with all the rape scenes. I read the reviews before I purchased the book but I disregarded them. Johanna Lindsey is a terrific writer so I figured I would like the book anyway, but, the reviews were right. Rape is rape no matter how you look at it. They were not love scenes we all expect from Johann Lindsey, they were rape scenes all through the book. It was hard to finish the book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"WOW! I feel more violated reading the reviews here than I did reading the book! Good job ladies! Reading material is one's own choice and I think we have far enough bashing going on here. For those ladies that entered into reading this novel unaware it was a true \\"bodice ripper\\" (as many of Lindsey's novels are) I'm truly sorry if you were taken by suprise or offended. The 'hero' is most certainly rough and he certainly does \\"rape\\" the heroine. I've noticed almost all of the five and four star reviews on here seem to be voted down, as if women who did not enjoy this novel feel it's their right to tell other women what they should and should not enjoy in a fantasy - and indeed a fully fictional book at that. Myself, and other women have very much enjoyed Tristan's rough loving for years and our reviews shouldn't be \\"voted down\\" simply because you are offended that we were turned on."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"its not so much the raping and hating of each other that goes on throughout the book right up to the end but what bothered me more is that even if we were expected to think thats a pirate in the 1600s where was there once a description by either one of them going crazy in each others arms that would slightly make this bearable when the got together it was the same spark as brushing ones teeth sad this one even if youre looking for an escape sth different you dont get that even read karen robards island flame exact same story but so sensually written!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book does not even deserve one star.And you know, when I was buying it, I had a gut feeling that it might not be my cup of tea but good grief, I never expected it to be so revolting. I know that it is only a book, and I wouldn't be so outraged if it hadn't left my skin crawling for days after I literally threw it into my trash can.I could have easily handled the rape had it happened only once. I could have handled it, as well as the all-around dispicable treatment of the heroine, had the hero shown remorse for hurting the woman he supposedly came to \\"love\\". I could have believed that the heroine could \\"love\\" and trust said hero had he done a damned thing to earn such feelings from anyone.I realize that society's views on many things were different, in these novels, from those views in today's society. I realize that this is a HISTORICAL novel. However, someone is clearly forgetting that is is also supposed to be a romantic novel. So, tell me, where did the idea come from that a woman who falls in love with the man who repeatedly, mercilessly, and shamelessly rapes her...is romantic? Because it is not romantic. It's vile and it is disgusting.I believe I will now conclude my review, before the feelings that have risen inside me once again induced by thoughts of this piece of trash cause me to set something on fire. In short, if you like rape, this is the book for you. If not, it's a waste of your money."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"To be quite honest, the book had potential. The only thing that would have made this book a 4 or 5 star would have been if the hero didnt keep on raping the heroine. I didnt quite understand its purpose. I mean, people find rape repulsive, not sexy. This is definitly not a typical Lindsey book. Even though this book was much of a failure, I still continue to read her other books. We also have to keep in mind that this was one of her earlier books."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book was extremely offensive!!!! I am a HUGE fan of Johanna Lindsey and I have collected and re-read all of her books - EXCEPT THIS ONE! I can not bring myself to read it again. The only reason I keep it, is because it is part of my collection. Try another one of her books."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I couldn't believe this story. Every few pages I would have to put it down, because it made me so angry. I normally like Lindsey's work, but I can't believe that she actual wrote this. The idea that a woman would fall in love with a man that rapes her continously confounds me. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Can we remember for a moment that this book was published in 1978? This is the same era as books like Stormfire by Christine Monson, Sweet Savage Love by Rosemary Rogers, and Whitney, My Love by Judith McNaught. And what do these books have in common--besides fitting the traditional \\"bodice ripper\\" image? Forcible seduction, as it was called for romance writers of that era, or in more modern terms, rape. By today's standards, this book is nothing but a piece of trash that just displays the brutality of men in general, and pirates in particular. In 1978, it was a romance for the ages. There's a place for everything and the late 70s/early 80s romance novels are a place for heroines to be taken whether they want to be or not by the hero. You know what you're getting when you pick up a 70s bodice ripper, and I think it's absurd to complain about it. You want modern ideals of love, pick up a historical romance written by a more contemporary author like a Julia Quinn or Gaelen Foley. You want a bodice ripper, you want an alpha male who won't take no for an answer, you pick up a 70s bodice ripper. It's just that easy."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Okay when I read (all ) the reviews I have to say I was quite curious about this book. Especially all you one star reviewers. My god how can this be a romance?! Well this book was anything but boring. And the rape scenes were anything but brutal.In fact after her first experiance with Tristan she told her friend/nurse it was \\"I thought it will be a horrible experiance but it wasn't so bad\\" \\"He was gentle with me and is pleasant to look upon\\" Now ladies does that sound like a woman who is living in pure terror?! In Lindsey deffense she is writing about a pirate and yet he is hansome he is will a pirate..Do I believe Bettina was raped? Well yes her head said NO.Her body said yes but in today's society if a woman says no it is no, that's it.Overall this historical romance was good. I love the love hate relationships. Most books who are like this makes me believe the hero and the heroine learn to fall in love with eachother. I like my heros arragont and handsome with a backbone. I like my heroine fiesty who won't take crap from the hero.I haven't yet read a historical romance novel which the hero and heroine are in love with eachother right away and there is no conflict between them. But I will I give everything a try.If women do not like to read this kind of romance by being abducted than enslaving the heroine than expect a love hate relatinship. With somewhat a rape scene here and there.There are many different romance novels out there for different tastes that is why different authors write different stuff.."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book is awful. Not only are the characters two dimensional and the plot cliche, but when it comes down to it, rape is never sexy. Don't bother with this book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Really, i wish I had listened to those reviews which proclaimed this book as horried rather than give in to my instincts. I really HATED this book. It was simply boring, unintresting, unorignal, and I found myself skipping through the pages. The story is simply ridiculous and I found myself loathing the heroine and the hero and shaking my head at the ridiculous plot. Can you believe that the heroine's maid justified the Captain's rape of her mistress by saying he could have been harsher with her? Can you believe that the heroine actually had to justify herself for hating the captain who had raped her? Now , dont get me wrong. Usually i love reading Pirate stories who are a little bit rough and excting but this one was defineitly NOT exciting just stupid. This is the 4th book I have read from Johanna Lindsay and while the others were just so- so this one was definetly bad. I don't recommend this book unless you really are on a deserted island with nothing to do. Plus that i'm sure i will steer clear from now on from Johanna Linsey's book - they are definetly not my cup of tea and basically - once you've read one you've read them all."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"God this sucked... it sucked SO BAD.Tristan... you saw your mother brutally raped by a pack of pillagers, and yet you constantly rape your \\"true love\\" and taunt her about it. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. Bettina... you say you have control of your temper yet you're lashing out at everyone, not to mention you fall in love with YOUR RAPIST. It irks the inner feminist in me and these two have absolutely no reason to love each other. So glad I rented this."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I love Johanna Lindsey, but I hated this book. If this had been the first of hers that I read, I wouldn't have read another. I was very uncomfortable with the continuous rape of the heroine by the supposed hero. This book should never have been re-issued. It needs to be forgotten as soon as possible!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Pretty much, the entire book consists of Tristan raping Bettina, Bettina telling Tristan she hates him . . . again and again and again, until suddenly Bettina realizes that she loves Tristan. (Because, you know, if you rape a woman enough, she'll eventually learn to enjoy it and then fall in love with you.) To top it all off, over the months that Bettina is being raped by Tristan, her mother tries to convice her to love him. Ewww? I want my $7.99 back."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I can't believe I actually read this whole book. It was the worst romance novel I've ever read, if you can even consider it \\"romance,\\" that is.To sum the \\"romance\\" up, Tristan kidnaps and rapes Bettina (which she secretly enjoys? Yuck!)... Bettina hates Tristin... Tristan still rapes Bettina... Bettina still hates Tristin... some boring background story plays out... and then strangely by the end of the book all's great and wonderful and they're in love.What the...?I usually enjoy Johanna Lindsey's writing, but this is the worst of her's I've read. Try reading Gentle Rogue by Lindsey if you want a good romance."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I like most of Johanna Lindseys books and in fact own all of them but I do not find rape exciting and can not figure how the heroine could fall in love with her tormentor.

The hero is a lowlife creepo who rapes virgins and feels no remorse!!!He is the villian! How can anyone fall in love with the creep?? Do you fall in love with a rapist just because he's a good looking idiot??Take my advise, please don't read this book!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I, along with many other Lindsey fans, like most of her earlier works. But this one just grossed the hell out of me!I have read other reviews where people say rape is a standard thing in a lot of romances. Maybe. But what I like about romance novels, is that usually, the man, while aggressive, has a modecum of decency. Meaning, if they know a woman has never been with a man before, they won't just hump on her day and night! The won't just ram themselves into her! But of course, this guy was a pirate, so I guess he had no manners.This is what went on in 'A Pirate's Love'(by the way, it also went on in 'Fires In The Winter' and 'Captive Bride'). Another reviewer here said it best: 'Bettina was nothing to Tristan but a body to relieve his lust upon'. I never grew to like him and of course, he was never sorry. What's romantic about that?I have to also say, I didn't feel too much sympathy for Tristan's little 'childhood trauma'. He watches his mother get raped repeatedly as a child, then grows up and inflicts the same kind of pain on a young girl?A woman wants to feel what the woman feels in romances. There is no way I'd want to be Bettina. I thought the pregnancy was sick and I would've thrown myself in the ocean the minute I got the chance, before some scuzzy pirate put his hands on me again! Like I said in my title, maybe Johanna Lindsey was on crack at the time she wrote this book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"The hero rapes the heroine repeatedly and all the women closes to her can say is basically to grin and bear it because he's not such a bad guy and he's easy on the eyes?? Are you kidding me? ! This is so far removed from romance novels as they come. This is like a romance novels for rapists. His defense is that she's too tempting (beautiful)? I can't tell begin to tell you how many times they use the word rape in the book because I lost count. He's just not a good hero, even if he didn't sexually assault her over and over and over and over. He's not a likable or interesting character. I think the funniest (or sadest) part of the book is when He confronts the villain from his past who murdered his parents (and raped his mom) and they basically compare each other !! Tristan (hero) actually justifies why he raped the heroine. This is possibly the worst storyline I've ever encountered in a romance novel. I don't get it... She's such a good author and I have liked her other books, but this one should've never been written."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I love Johanna Lindsey book, but this one was just horribly long and borring. There is a reason why this book has so many negative reviews... Do yourself a favor and don't buy it !"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I am beginning to think, that Johanna Lindsey books are like lottery tickets....most of them are blanks. At least this one was. There is so much wrong here I don't know where to begin.The writing is bad, the execution is bad, the characters are not likeable, actually they are annoying. Bettina is manipulative and insipid. Tristan is boring and a caveman (caveman can be good, not in this case though). A lot seem to mind the rape. I don't. I dislike just about everything else in the book. The pace of it is agonizingly slow and drawn out, while at the same time. Everything is SPELLED out. \\"I did this, then I did this, and then this because I wanted you to react this way.\\" It doen't stop there though. It just goes on and on with misunderstandings, manipulations, wrong conclusions, and so on, till you just want to beat sense in to the characters.And I am sorry, but no one normal speaks to their mother about sex the way Bettina does in this book. No one goes around almost chanting: rape, rape, rape.....As I am reading this book I only have one thought in my head: WHY. Why do I keep reading? Is it like som accident you cannot avert your eyes from?After reading three books by this author I am convinced this will be my last. After reading these three I feel I have already spotted the same formula in all of them: Imposed/staged misunderstandings (what happende to talking?), foolish escapes (sometimes so many it just seems plain stupid), unlikeable and foolish protagonists who never really rationalize about their situation, and they are always so very very beautiful."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I actually bought this from the bookstore today hoping for a small/short distraction from Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series (love it, but I needed a break from book 5). Anyways, I don't like traditional romance books. I like some adventure and action with a romance on the side, or forbidden love, which is the only flat out romance I'll read. I had recently been looking at pirate romance novels here on Amazon, but there are few I could find in the bookstore (I ordered them though :) ). I decided to pick this book up based on the fact that many people seem to read and enjoy Johanna Lindsey's books. I used to work in a library, so I know she's fairly popular. I'm pretty picky, but I really wanted something new to read. This book sounded like it fit the bill from the description on the back, but its nothing like the description on the back. Its the most boring and confusing piece of fiction I've read in a while. The pirate, Tristan, continually rapes the girl, Bettina, and yet somehow they end up falling madly in love. It probably sounds like Stockholm Syndrome for those reading these reviews, but its not and that's what makes it all the more disturbing. Its just continual and has no point or purpose to enhancing the story what-so-ever. There is nothing sexy about being raped. If you're looking for a pirate romance, this is not the book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Spoilers in the following review. I wouldn't have read this had I realized that the \\"hero\\" raped the heroine in this book. I read the beginning in the store and thought it was good. But, then she was raped, and I hoped the decription on the back was wrong and Tristian wasn't the hero. I thought maybe the captain of the ship she was taken from wold be, since he protected her from being raped while on his ship. Then I thought she'd escape and might end up with the guy she was supposed to marry, be he was awful too. Then I thought, okay Tristian will atleast come to his senses and apolgize, stop raping her, etc., but no again. Partly I continued reading because I thought Casey may turn out to be her dad, etc. Atleast all that worked out pretty good.Overall the book was NOT A ROMANCE. It was more a drama, it probably would be a good book for a psychology class to read to learn about stockholm's syndrome. As a drama it was pretty good, though I would have liked Bettina to be free by the end and even getting past the nightmare she went through.I am amazed that this book was reprinted recently and was in the store, the modern reader will probably find it more offensive then when it was first published in 1978!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I agree with these 1 star reviews and their reasons for not liking the book. Having the man rape the woman and then having her fall in love with him is sick and irresponsible! I can't believe this book was written by the author who wrote the wonderful Malory series of books. What was she thinking! Plus I can't believe the comments by women who defended the rape especially the woman who called it darkly erotic. Ewwwwww!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This is not a romance novel. Nor is it an erotic novel depicting a rape fantasy. It is a book masquerading as a romance novel but contains nothing of the sort - only rape and sex slavery. You've heard of Elizabeth Smart? Jaycee Lee Dugard? Tanya Kach? Patty Hearst? Well, 19-year-old Frenchwoman Bettina Verlaine is likewise kidnapped and raped by 26-year-old pirate captain Tristan Matisse. Except Bettina is not rescued from her kidnapper/rapist. Not even by her own two PARENTS who have the opportunity! Instead, she falls in love with him. Today we would call this Stockholm syndrome, but there was no such understanding of the phenomenon in 1667 when this book takes place. Nor was it as widely known in 1978 when this book was published. Defenders of this book claim that it can be excused because it was published during a time when \\"bodice ripping\\" and \\"forced seduction\\" were common elements in romance novels. The problem is that this book does not contain \\"bodice ripping\\", it does not contain \\"forced seduction\\", it contains rape and sex slavery - brutal, savage, barbaric rape and sex slavery. Allow me to elaborate.The first time Tristan threatens to torture and murder the other captives if Bettina doesn't submit = rape under threat of violence against othersThe second time he threatens to flog her with a whip if she doesn't submit = rape under threat of violence against victimThe third time he forces himself on her and when she experiences pleasure outwardly he laughs and gloats as though he's just won a battle against her = forcible rape (I hope we all know that victims can experience arousal & orgasm during rape and that it in no way whatsoever equal consent)The fourth time he rapes her ferociously with much fighting and screaming on her part, while he just laughs manically = forcible rapeAnother time (this one particularly heartbreaking) he drags her to a bedroom, and, in sheer desperation and despair, she threatens to jump from a window to her death - it's the only way to escape him. But he calls her bluff. She comes off the window because she's too afraid to die. He locks the door and the scene \\"cuts away\\". = forcible rapeYet another time he gags her mouth and lashes her arms to the bedpost with rope so she can't fight or escape = forcible rapeYet another time he forces himself on her while she is pregnant with his own baby = forcible rape...and many moreTristan calls Bettina \\"spoils of war\\", proclaiming her to be \\"mine by right of capture\\". He rapes her under the excuse that she is just \\"too tempting\\". He justifies it by claiming that any pleasure she experiences means she really wanted it. Because Bettina angrily tries to fight him, like any woman would, he denounces her as a vixen whom he must tame. And in the end, it works! The vixen (read: woman who believes she has the right to choose if, when, with whom she has sex) in Bettina is tamed (read: psychologically broken via repeated sexual trauma). Bettina gives birth to the daughter that she was forcibly impregnated with (she's named Angelique, which is French for \\"product of her mother's rapes\\") and she marries her rapist and they live happily ever after. As if! Her \\"love\\" for him that she professes at the end is 110% unconvincing and unbelievable. There is no love, there is only total submission from an emotionally scarred girl. The same goes for Tristan. He claims he loves her \\"beyond reason\\", \\"so much that it hurts\\". It is a simple human fact that you do not deliberately rape someone that you love.Oh, yeah, I almost forgot. Tristan's mother was raped and murdered before his very eyes when he was a kid, and throughout the book he's searching for the man who did it so he can kill him as revenge for his horrible deed. (read srachel's review for details and the infamous Tristan quote) Look in a mirror Tristan! Your dead mother would be ASHAMED of the monster you've become! This book deserves ZERO stars."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book was terrible, shallow characters notwithstanding, the entire premise of a ROMANCE based primarily on REPEATED brutal rapes was completely unrealistic, not to mention offensive. I felt no affinity whatsoever for the characters, and their about-face from rapist and victim to a loving couple was entirely unbelievable. I am very pleased there was no sequel (possible plot: Tristan rapes his daughter, or something equally sordid). This must have been written by Johanna Lindsey's evil twin, as her other books are much better. I find that Lindsey's best books are part of a series, for example, the Viking/Briton series (Fires of Winter...), or, of course, the Malorys."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. I picked it up b/c i'm really interested in pirate stories and now i'm sorry i did. It is about a woman,Bettina, who is captured by pirates and is continually raped by the captain. Since when has rape become an accepted fact in society? I found nothing arousing about Tritan forcing his unwanted, disgusting attentions on Bettina. And I will thank the heavens that i don't have a mother like hers who tells Bettina that she should &quot;go along with Tristan and not hate him. He's doing what's best for her.&quot; I find rape digusting and this book is an insult to any good literature. It's like a slap in the face to any woman who has ever been raped. I will never ever read another book by Johanna Lindsay. This woman needs help. I give this book 1 star only b/c I finished it. So please, don't waste your time and money."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I get everyone has their own thing. I sometimes find forced seduction books can be quite sexy. This was not. There was no seduction, there was just rape. You can't sugar coat this. For anyone who read 'Captive bride' by Lindsey, that was tame by comparison. Captive Bride was VERY borderline, but at least she gives in because she enjoys it. In this, it was just rape. How on earth are you supposed to like a hero who by his own admission painfully raped a woman repeatedly who VERY clearly was not keen, just because he wanted her? And then he only ends up marrying her because he's not allowed to have sex with her until he does.The fact that the leading lady, Bettina, has a maid who doesn't seem to care she's being raped, and a mother who essentially shrugs her shoulders at it, means it's no wonder she ends up 'falling' for him. With zero support and everyone telling her she's being silly for resisting, what else is she supposed to do.I also dislike the fact that the rape is all made out to be Bettina's fault because if she wasn't so 'stubborn' and would just give in then she'd apparently enjoy it. Her resistance is put down to a stubborn personality and that she's displaced her anger of her father on to her captor. Um, no. Pretty sure her resistance was because she didn't want to be raped.Cue the ending, where somehow she magically falls in love in the last two pages. Ugh.If you took all the rape out of this story, and maybe added in a gentle seduction instead, it might have made more sense and been quite likable. As it was, it wasn't."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"A Pirate's Love is the worst book I've read by author Lindsey. The book is little more than a series of kidnappings and/or rescues, rapes and recriminations, repeated several times throughout the book. There are a couple of good scenes very near the end, which is why it rated higher than one star.I'd recommend several Lindsey books over and above this one, including Man of My Dreams, Once a Princess, and, my favorite Lindsey, Prisoner of My Desire.TTFN, Laurie Likes Books"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I have always enjoyed Johanna Lindsey books but this one was horrible. The hero was determined to find and kill the man that killed his father and raped and killed his mother. Yet, he doesn't think twice about continuously raping the heroine. I'm not sure where in between the raping they supposedly fell in love. But in the end they are together and the hero never apologizes for his horrible treatment of her or makes any mention to the fact that he shouldn't have acted that way. Has Ms. Lindsey ever known a rape victim? I can assure her they are not filled with a warm, fuzzy feeling when thinking of their rapists. The only way I can forgive this novel, is the fact that it was published in '78, and as far as I can figure, romance novels were different back then. (After all, that was the time of the famous love affair of Luke and Laura, and their relationship started out with his raping of her.) Needless to say, I am going to stick with modern romance novels from now on. And no matter how much I love an author's writings, I am not going to read her early works."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book has a simple message: it doesn't matter if the man kidnaps, continually rapes and threatens you, if he is young and handsome you should be grateful to him because he gives you food and clothing, so you should let him do whatever he likes with you.I mean, I just don't get it. The hero behaves really really cruelly, treats the heroine like a peace of meat, or property, or something to be used and abused. He wants her, so he takes her. With force. When she runs away to her fiance, he follows her and kidnaps her again. And tells her off for running from him. Her fiance is supposed to be the bad guy - because he doesn't want to marry her now that she is used goods. The 'hero' is supposed to be a good guy - he just wants her so much that he can't do anything but rape her. This is just awful. And, as another reviewer already said, Tristan is searching for a man who raped his mother - but what he does is totally acceptable to him. He 'doesn't like violence', so he threatens the heroine so that she won't fight him. OMG. I just couldn't believe how far he is willing to go.In all this awful mess, the heroine, Bettina, was the one bright spot. She was brave, never gave up, was willing to take matters in her own hands and try to escape this madman of a hero. She was amazing and she didn't let anything break her. I felt so bad when her nanny and her mother kept lecturing her about what she should do! They stuck with the rapist instead of the victim! How could they live with themselves? I just don't get it - all right, so he raped you, but he gave you clothes, so you should be grateful and fulfill his every wish. I would slap them and tell them to shut up If I were Bettina.The second part of the book was slightly better then the first, but I could just never warm up to Tristan, he simply behaved too awful in the beginning. Then we have a few unnecessary twists and turns, like the appearance of Bettina's father and her being kidnapped by the villain.in the end, I don't know why, Bettina falls in love with Tristan. How, why, I don't get it. I think she would be better off without him. I guess in the end he somehow manages to break her and makes a slave out of her. So sad. I don't know what Tristan would have to do to redeem for his cruel behavior. But he never atones. He never even accepts that he did something wrong, or apologizes to the heroine. He just lives on in belief that he did everything right and that everything is heroine's fault because she is too beautiful for her own good. I mean, this is just sick.I gave this book two stars because I really liked Bettina's spirit. Tristan gets zero stars and I will always remember him as one of the worst romance novel heroes ever."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I can't believe I spent my money on such a trash! I usually enjoy pirate stories (McKinney &quot;Till dawn tames the night&quot;), but this was stupid and the style of writting was simply unreadable. I hated Tristan from the beginning and although I hoped to start to like him, it wasn't possible and I thought I'd never finish the book. There's only one book as boring as &quot;Pirate's love&quot; and it is &quot;Temptress&quot; by Jude Deveraux. Don't read it."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"one word is enough to describe this book....HORRIBLE."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"It was okay for me. Not her best, not her worst. I will read more from her though. Thank you."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This is Lindsey's second novel ever written, and it shows how poor of a writer she was back then (makes you wonder how she EVER got published). The plot of the story is British privateer (pirate) Tristan spies the beautiful Bettina on her ship as she sails from France to St. Martin in the Caribbean to marry her betrothed. Tristan, of course, wants her for himself and steals her away. The rest of the story is rape, escape attempt, rape, escape attempt, rape, escape attempt, and then they fall in love. When I read this 10 years ago or so, I was pretty outraged by the whole thing and hated this book with a passion. So I was rather reluctant to re-read it, but since I'm now re-reading all my Lindsey's, I figured I'd suffer through this story, then move on to an outstanding JL romance, like &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot; Little did I know that, instead of being upset all over again, I matured enough to realize this book is just a good example of poor writing and, quite honestly, it is so dumb and so bad it is actually quite funny to read. I mean, Bettina actually stomps her foot in anger -- like every five pages. Not only that, but how many times can she get her clothes ripped off her?!? Worse, every time she escapes, she runs into somebody who also wants to rape her (therefore, making Tristan the lesser evil among the rapists)! Throw in cheesy dialogue and overall ridiculous characterization (Bettina is so-o-o-o innocent she doesn't even know what &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;making love&quot; are at the beginning of the book), and you've got a great book to laugh at. The only thing good about &quot;A Pirate's Love&quot; is the urge it gives you to visit the Caribbean. If you want to read a seafaring JL romance, go with &quot;Gentle Rogue&quot; or &quot;Magic of You.&quot; They are a trillion times better than &quot;A Pirate's Love.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I believe that this story didn't receive such great reviews, but I have to say for me that this story has incorporated EVERYTHING that I LOVE about love. I love that she is a girl that is a spitfire but is also a lady at heart, that she is forced into some form of relationship with a gentleman that seems to be cold heartened and unloving. They find that through tough turmoils they are wanting more and more of each other. And then when they are faced with what they both desire, they continue to be in denial of what they really feel. In the end the story gives off a great ending. I find myself wanting to reread this story again and again. I guess it is one of those that you may love it, or you may hate it. But MOST definitely don't underestimate the message that this AMAZING book is putting out."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Although this is one of Lindsey's oldest books, it is probably my favorite. Tristan is gorgeous, and though he is mean at times, he IS a pirate! Bettina is so funny and fiesty. Sometimes I miss the old Lindsey."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This is one of the best novels i have read, and I have read a lot of novels. Some people object to the behaviour of the hero but we are speaking of a different era. she cannot talk about a pirate and make him sound like a modern soft man otherwise the novel is not sincere. the events are suitable for the time and the novel is witty and well written, the hero is intelligent and great. I love this one, I read it over and over again."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This was probably one of the first romance novels I ever read, and I can say quite honestly I still consider it one of the best. For the naysayers, consider what exactly it is that you are reading. This is not a feminist treatise to be sure, but it is quite entertaining. P.S. The writing is on par with the rest of her work; it is not horrible."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I know, I know--most readers hated this book. It was Lindsey's 2nd book ever (written in the 1970s) so you have to cut her some slack. But I have to say that I love this book and always have. I think Bettina is pretty spunky and she sure gives Tristan a hell of a time. And there is just something about a gorgeous pirate...Sigh!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I'VE BEEN READING HER SINCE 1979, MY NIECE ASK ME TO READ A BOOK THAT ,WAS 19 YEARS AGO. I'M STILL READING HER BOOKS, SHE IS THE BEST, BESIDES JUDE DEVERAUX,JULIE GARWOOD. THEIR FUNNY AUTHORS PLUS A VERY GOOD AT WHAT THEYDO. THERE WERE TIMES I BROUGHT HER BOOKS AND COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN EVEN THOUGH I KNEW I HAD TO GO WORK, THE NEXT DAY. STOPPING AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS READING WITH PEOPLE BEHIND ME BLOWING HORNS. SO IN GROSS HER BOOKS. THE MALORY'S SERIES ARE VERY BEST, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT HAPPEN TO JASON MALORY, JEREMY, PERCY, PLEASE PLEASE. YOU HAVE TO WRITE ABOUT THE REST OF THE CLAN."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I was surprised when I first read all the reviews on this book, that so many of them were bad, and that hardly anyone cared for this book. I am a big fan of Johanna Lindsey and I just couldn't believe that one of her books could be as bad as everyone was saying. Naturally, I had to find out for myself, and to be honest, I disagree with most of the other reviewers. This book isn't the best book I've ever read, but its for sure not one of the worst. A lot of people find the story line alarming because he rapes Bettina, but its not really like that at all. She calls it rape in the story, but this isn't a story that is going to traumatize you with how tragic it is. She isn't really even all that upset about being raped, she ends up being more upset about being lied to. More or less, everyone needs to remember that this is a work of fiction not a true story, so take it for what it is and not be too overly critical about it. I thought it was an enjoyable book, though its not one that I would read again, I'm glad that I gave it a chance."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"PL's rape scenes didn't bother me as much as disjointedstoryline, and there did seem to be a lack of &quot;connection&quot;between the main characters. This *is* one of Lindsey's earlier ones, so don't judge her entire work by this book. She's done much better and she's worth reading - her later stories aren't as &quot;violent&quot; or masochistic. The last few scenes are definitely overkill, I will agree on that point. It's a book that I'd pick up if I were bored, but luckily I'm not frequently bored :-) END"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"The rape part of the book was not a big deal to me. I can't honestly get mad about it as others have done because A. some people LIKE those kinds of stories (and I will not judge them) and B. it was stupid. The rape scenes went something like this.Bettina: I hate youTristan: I don't want to do this, but you're forcing me to rape you.Bettina: Then do it!{Rape}It was just stupid. The part that I hated was the characters themselves. I couldn't even care that the heroine was getting rape because I didn't like her. She was selfish and bratty. She was just such a one dimensional character. She didn't have any positive characteristics to back her up. The old lady who traveled with her was confusing. At one point she's all \\"don't touch her\\" and then the next she's telling the heroine to submit? Then the hero, Tristan, was a joke. I didn't get his story either. Was he suppose to be good? Was he suppose to be evil? I wanted to call Johanna Lindsey and ask her to walk me through this book and tell me HOW it makes sense."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I'm a Johanna Lindsey fan, but after reading this novel, I found that I want my money and time back. The plot is stale, and the very idea that the main character was raped for the first half of the book THEN falls in love with her rapist is deplorable. I wish i had read the reviews before the book and saved myself both money and time."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"How this could have been considered a romance is beyond me. I have read a Lindsey book before and enjoyed it very much. However, this book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It certainly has me questioning the authors idea of a healthy relationship. Im all for the strong willed man seducing a woman but I am NOT for the continual rape of a woman. I hated this book and I would have it banned from bookstores if I could. Rape is not romance no matter how you write it. It is disgusting."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"As part of my reading club, So Bad They're Hysterical, I recently received A Pirate's Love in the mail from a fellow networker. At the same time my sensitivities were offended beyond ire (falling in love with a rapist? Please!), I also found I couldn't stop laughing. These characters are so cardboard cut-out I wondered if maybe cookie cutters had been issued with the original printing. Our hero (ha) and heroine (more ha), Tristan and Bettina (what horrible names) were delightfully irritating throughout. I wish they'd both been eaten by sharks or blown up in a volcanic explosion--that would have been a happy ending!And for heaven's sake, what on earth is a hellcat?For those of you who'll cry out, &quot;But I read this book when it was first published...things were different then...blah, blah, blah&quot; take note. This book has been in circulation with So Bad, They're Hysterical since 1979. Obviously there were people 20 years ago who could discriminate."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"To anyone considering not buying this book because of people's reviews-don't listen to anyone's thoughts but your own when deciding to read a book. Read the back of the book, read an excerpt if one is available-if you like it, try it out. Also, people-loving the rest of her books then hating this one-published in the 70s-and stopping your buying of her future books because of this one? That makes no sense. I've noticed alot of terrible reviews for this book and it makes me angry. 1st of all, yes, as you can read in a lot of these reviews, there IS rape. NO, I do not appreciate that it happens in one of her books. That being said, Johanna Lindsey is my favorite author of all time-and for good reason. Her books are simply this-magic. The characters are the type that you don't forget and you keep them in your heart. Her books simply come to life, and the tales are something to truly treasure as well as the characters.For this particular book, its actually one of my favorites. Yes, she sleeps with him after he says he'll harm her crew. Was he planning to? No, and if you read it properly, he also wouldn't physically harm her by (he mentions lashings) this way. This is a PIRATE book set in the 1600s!-but if you get proper feel of his character he wouldn't harm a hair on her head. This was written in the 70s and the style and wording of the book is different than something that would be written in these times of 2010. When they sleep together, each time she likes what she feels-but she is extremely stubborn about sleeping with him-and rightfully so! After all, she doesn't want to, he is physically stronger than her and as he touches her, he knows she likes his touch and isn't scared of him. Now there is one point where it mentions the \\"raping of her body.\\" For me, again, I take into account the time this book was written and the style it was written in. I think about what time period it was written about and the situation and feelings between the characters. I take this as- he takes what he wants, yes, because she was (rightfully) unwilling to sleep with him even though she liked what feelings he was making her experience. And right afterwards she gave it back to him, retorting to him like she should. I take it as more he was taking the pleasure that he wanted from her but at the same time she, on one level, was not willing to admit and give what she wanted to him-and then again, she would have, had she admitted her real attraction for him.Convoluted way of thinking? Maybe, but if you get the proper feel of the book and the characters (and take those things I mentioned above into consideration), you will realize that there is a real love story going on here and that this book isn't about horrific and graphic rape whatsoever. My thoughts, form your own after reading the book. Think about what Bettina thinks and says after he takes her against her wishes. Give the book a chance and read others from Johanna as well. Remember, again-this was written in the 70s, set in the 1600s, and RAPE IS NEVER LOVE or anything near it and I wished the wording had been different in that scene-but the characters romance is about stubbornness and Johanna captures that to perfection in the book. Believe me, I feel that rape is disgusting and evil and don't care to read about it, but this romance wasn't in that context. Give the book a real chance to see what I'm talking about and remember that this character, in this time period, is innocent and is unaware and stubborn as hell about her feelings for her pirate abductor. As is he, in his own stubborn way. Just read it 1st and give her books a chance, I promise you-you won't ever be sorry."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"First off I happen to love Johanna Lindsey books - the Mallory series is one of the best in historical romance. So, I do like her style of writing and I think she has amazing depth to her characters. Yes, Pirate's Love is a little tough at times to accept. Does Tristan rape Bettina over and over again -sure but he was a Pirate of sorts - and his feeling was she was his prize and he took her. That was the prize he wanted when he overtook the ship she was on - she was the sole purpose for taking over that ship. He wanted her, he took her. And probably if Bettina were not so stubborn and a little more mature and not have opened her mouth and spouted such nasty hate - they could have realized so much sooner that they actually had a true attraction. But these two were both stubborn. In reality Tristan was the much more likeable early on of the two. I found Bettina annoying and truly wanted to shake her.I mean she protested too much. Thank goodness for Gaby and she finally realized she was JEALOUS!! However the main thing readers that are critical of all this - these were the times that this book is written about and these things happened. And you cannot expect a sedate proper little courtship between a pirate and a wench that he desired. So what Lindsey writes was is the old style bodice ripper historical romance and we should all be glad - because truthfully many of the plots are totally boring today. This books was anything but boring - the characters were interesting and passionate. I found myself liking this book more and more with each chapter. And wow if this was one of Lindsey's first efforts - it is no wonder that she is one of the best today!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book is disturbing and, frankly, dangerous. It is based on the premise that women really like to be raped, that if a man just rapes a woman well enough, and often enough, she will be really turned on. That a virgin is forceably raped on threat to others and herself is not the basis of a romance. And when a women \\"falls in love\\" with her captor, we call it the Stockholm syndrome and talk about the extensive therapy she will need. Here Lindsey, whose writing I usually like, has the \\"hero\\" repeatedly rape the heroine who secretly is turned on by what he is doing to her and eventually she falls in love with him. This book is offensive. I do not know that I will ever buy one of her books again."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"How can rape and romance equate to romance and love? Readers in the 70s may have found this storyline romantic - but I was disgusted. All the negative reviews regarding this book hold true."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book is not for those who are squeemish about kidnapping and rape as a basis for most of a &quot;romance&quot; story. I had a hard time reading this book but was &quot;compelled&quot; to finish it to see if it got any better. With the amount of kidnapping and raping by the &quot;hero&quot;, I felt this must have been the author's one &quot;off&quot; book. All of the others I have read were much, much better and developed more of the character of the main &quot;lovers&quot;. It does have a bit of romance between the pirate and his captive, and gets better toward the end, but I was very disappointed in this book; I doubt I would have bought more of her books if this had been the first one I read. Her other books are wonderful, very descriptive, sexy and extremely hard to put down; I own almost all of them. Don't let this book stop you from reading her other books as you won't know what you would be missing. I believe she is the best historical romance author I have ever read!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"The story of Tristan and Bettina, was most Unfulfilling. He treated her badly and I could not find any reason for love between the two of them. I belive the story had enormous potential and could have been handled a lot better. However, the plot somewhat redeemed itself towards the end. I love the author, so don't let this put you off."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I cannot think of a less flattering, more misogynist view of awoman than what is portrayed in A Pirate's Love. I read it for thesake of being \\"read up\\" on the genre, and I am told that such instances of rape, violence, and general degradation do not occur in more recent romances. I'm very bothered that this book remains in print and available for purchase. Yes, it's THAT offensive!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"If you're in the mood for a horror story in the romance section of the bookstore grab this atrocity. It's brutal rape after brutal rape with illogical characters and development. There's no seduction here. In the beginning Tristan threatens to torture and kill the members of her crew (by cutting off their fingers, ears, toes, etc. before throwing them to the sharks) unless she allows him to rape her. When she opens her mouth to tell him how much she is not enjoying the experience, he roughly and painfully forces himself on her. This happens over and over. Lesson learned... fight your attacker in any way and you'll hurt worse.In the end, she's pregnant, in labor, having been tortured by the man who raped and murdered the hero's mother but she insanely professes love for her rapist hero.This book is so disgusting one wonders why it remains in print. It is most definitely not a romance novel. There's simply no romance or love in this book. It is a plain old boddice ripper and tale of brutality. I suppose some readers who enjoy rape fantasies (and continually torching puppy's eyes with lit cigarettes) get a kick out of it.But if you want to see how the villains in all of today's romances view their world, then this is their idea of ::cough:: romance ::gag::."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book is so disgusting I don't know where to begin. My friend read it and told me about it so I read it for myself because I didn't believe anyone could write something so horrible. There is no way anyone who was raped would feel anything but revulsion for her rapist. This book was so revolting that my friends and I were convinced a man had written it until we found out that there were a lot more books by this author. I'll never read any of her other books because I'd never be able to forget she'd written this garbage."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"My friends and I have a thing for pirates, so when one of us picked up this book at the library, she said, &quot;You all HAVE to read this,&quot; and it made the rounds. Not because it is good, or even just mindless entertainment, but because it is so ridiculous it defies description. We still laugh over how stupid it is, but I guess it isn't really funny that a 20th century woman writer could ever put that on paper. I do not believe that any sane woman could ever fall in love with a man who raped her. And in this book he doesn't just rape her, he forcibly, repeatedly, brutally rapes her. Come on! It was absolutely a revolting book. I almost have to recommend it because it's so bad. You might find it amusing."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"In modern society today, do we consider rape sexy or romantic? Of course not! Which is why I say don't read this book. Tristan kidnaps Bettina and gets her pregnant after continually raping her. The only part of this I enjoyed was when Casey showed up and realized Bettina was his daughter, therefore thwarting Tristan's plans to try and get Bettina to stay. Also, I loved it when Bettina planted doubts about her child also being Tristan's. But the rest of this book is disgusting. I don't understand how Bettina can love Tristan after all he's done to her! I would NOT recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I'm a pretty big Lindsey fan, but this was the worst Lindsey book I've ever read! The fact that the \\"pirate,\\" Tristan, forced himself on Bettina day after day was NOT at all romantic. I found it upsetting. If Tristan wanted Bettina's love, he just had to love her without forcing her. This book is not worth reading. Thankfully this is one of Lindsey's first books. I'm guessing that she didn't have the romance \\"formula\\" down yet. Her other books are much better and don't involve the main character constantly raping the women he supposedly loves."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Seduction is acceptable, but rape? No. Thank you kindly, but I'll pass. This is one of Lindsey's worse books, but it truely makes you appreciate her later works. She is an astounding author, but the period in which _Pirate's Love_ was written tends to be a bit on the masochistic side of sexuality. I've read other books from the time that my grandmother swears by that leave _Pirate's Love_ looking clean and wholesome. Not for everyone, but try it anyway -- from the library."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I know I read this book in it's entirety sometime, but when I tried to re-read it, it was awful! Lindsey's later work is a lot better and I hope even she would agree."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I was totally disgusted to pick up this book and read the awful RAPE scenes written by Ms.Lindsey. It made my stomach sick that she could justify putting this in a Romance. The Pirate(Tristan)-Kidnapped, Raped, Blackmailed, Lied his way thru the whole book. I couldn't believe the mother trying to talk the daughter into forgiving her Rapist and telling him that she loved him. It was the worst waste of money ever printed!!!!! Don't buy this book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I don't think words can ever express how disappointed and disgusted I was in this novel by Johanna. I have read many of her books and enjoyed them, so there was no hesitation when I saw a new one I hadn't read. I really wish now, that I had put it back. I won't go into a full description as the people below me already outlined the book, but I will agree with their opinions. I was amazed that Johanna even tried to make continual rape seem romantic and that by fighting him, Johanna made Bettina, her lead girl, seem silly and naive. Johanna kept trying to write Bettina as a spirited and strong young woman, but seriously how strong can you be when you start having feelings for your rapist after the first night? When Bettina wasn't being raped, she was basically a full grown 5 year old that spent the rest of her time throwing tantrums. I was bouncing between hating her and pitying her ever other page. And Tristan? The \\"Hero\\"? A man that raped a 19 year old virgin because he decided he wanted her, then criticized her for not allowing him to give them both pleasure. Let me state this again...he rapes her then blames her for not enjoying it. I have disliked books before for not being in my style for taste but this is the first time I have ever truly HATED one. I would had killed both characters if it were possible, I stopped pitying Bettina as soon as she fell in love with Tristan and decided that she was just being silly for fighting such a \\"good\\" man. And Tristan? A rapist? I think the reason he should have been killed off would be quite obvious, at least to those who have read the books. Except to Ms. Lindsey, who either had a moment of madness when she wrote this, or who has always had a screw loose and is just now showing it in her writing. Either way, put this book down and step away. There is nothing to see here."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This book was okay. The plot was interesting and I liked the little secondary romance with Bettina's mother. My biggest problem with the book was the relationship between Tristen and Bettina. The fact that he raped her wasn't that bad since many books written in the seventies and eighties had this theme in common. The trouble was there was never any reason for Bettina to fall in love with Tristen. He never changed. He never grew to respect her feelings. The two of them fell in love abruptly and unbelievably. All in all okay to read once. I do enjoy Johanna's other later books and I would recomend them."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This was the first Johanna Lindsey book I had ever read and now I'm hooked! ....this book was the best! I love the story line and it was very humorous."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Everytime I dive into a Lindsey, I expect the best. She is a writer so versatile that manages to please a lot of romantic souls at the same time.

I just wish she would get back to the way she was before. But everybody changes I guess."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"This was a really great book. Yeah, it was a bit extreme, but this was one of her first books.

And she still loves him! Make sure you are prepared for the rape scenes and violence, this book has plenty. I only gave this 3 stars because I love the author and am being nuetral, comparing her other work."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I love Johanna Lindsey. In fact, I'm reading all her books and ranking them in my listmania list. This book was really bad. I would actually say that this is her worst book. Everything from plot, pace and characters. So many times, i wanted to give up and stop reading and actually throw this book.I hated the heroine she was extremely bratty. I thought she needed a good beating. She made dumb decisions based on her temper. She desperately wants to get to her betrothed even if she's never met him. She doesn't seem to learn her lesson and escapes the hero's capture twice only to get in worse trouble. She hates the hero and fights him for 75% of the book then suddenly realizes she loves him?The hero is gentle with the heroine despite how she treats him. So unbelieveable!He rapes her repeatedly. I don't think she ever enjoyed the sex - she eventually did but the author just said that \\"her body betrayed her\\". We never got to share her enjoyment. There was no sexual tension between the leading couple. They just seemed to hate each other. You just want them to end the relationship somehow.This is a fluke for Ms. Lindsey. It's one of her earlier works. Note that it was first published in 1978. It's not an excuse. All of her books are so much better!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I'm a huge Johanna Lindsey fan, in fact, when I was very young (around 15) I first picked up one of her romance novels and was instantly hooked. I believe A Pirate's Love used to be one of my favorites--until I recently re-read it.I understand Tristan's a pirate and therefore has the \\"if I want her, I will rape her\\" attitude - that is not what confused me. What I wondered instead was, at what point did Bettina fall in love with Tristan?I read the book about 2 more times after re-visiting it to try and pinpoint this, however I could not.For mostly the entire book, Bettina acts like a shrew. Granted she's being raped by a Pirate and has every right to since she's been abducted and held captive against her will, the constant bickering from her end begins to grate your nerves. I didn't understand how one minute she was a cold fish to him as he raped her, and then suddenly found herself falling in love with him.Tristan on other hand -- he seemed more obsessed with her than he did in love with her. Towards the last few chapters of the book, their love seemed so hurried along that I couldn't pinpoint where his moments of tenderness towards her grew into love and when her hatred towards him changed into her falling in love with him.I understand Bettina was afraid for the most part and wanted her freedom, but after all those escapes, when she was finally back with him and actually wanted to stay with him - she still acted like a completely spoiled brat!At that point, I could no longer see the difference between her being spunky or acting a shrew.It such a shame too, I'd love for this to have had more substance because I actually enjoy Pirate Romance Novels a lot."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I really tried to like this book, but it just never got any better. Tristan who I guess is suppose to be the \\"Hero\\" constantly rapes Bettina. There was no seduction and at times very brutal. The only way Bettina could have possibly fall in love with him is from shear brainwashing by confindment and threats. Worst is her nursemaid from childhood and even her mother tell her to just make the most of it and couldn't she just try to love him because he's \\"handsome\\"!!!!!!! Come on. This book should just be retired because it's way past time."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"I absolutely hate this book. I recently bought it as an example of pirate-related romance fiction for my own writing since I am not very familiar with the genre, but instead I found it to be an example of how NOT to write. I went to my local bookstore with a different book in mind to buy, which they did not have in stock, so I picked this one up instead. BIG mistake and waste of my money. I'll never again buy a book without reading the reviews first. I actually found myself laughing out loud because the plot is so ridiculous. I can't imagine how this book ever got published."},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"Please someone tell me what is so romantic about a man who repeatedly rapes a woman? I was so discusted by the way that poor woman was treated that I will never read another one of this author's books. And to top it all off, her mother and maid tell her to make the best of it. If my daughter were being raped, I would not stand by and tell her to make the best of it. Is this author smoking weed? No one in this book is loyal to their spouse, everyone is trying to rape someone, and in the end the wretched woman thinks she is in love with her rapist. I am sure a pschologist would have a field day with that one. Really, if this poor author thinks rape is so romantic, I ask her to please get to know someone who has been through it. Pure filth!!!"},{"Title":"A Pirate's Love","review":"After seeing all the bad reviews I was curious to read this one. It turned out to be very good, despite the rape scenes.

Astonishingly simple. Entirely engaging and written in such a black vein of humour that you won't be able to help yourself. Questions the foundation of the Christian faith: can you ever remain certain that it was Christ who was nailed to that Cross having read this?If you loved Monty Python's &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; you'll adore this book."},{"Title":"Live from Golgotha","review":"I did not find this book of interest. In fact, I had to make myself continue reading it to the end."},{"Title":"Live from Golgotha","review":"The idea of the plot in Live From Golgotha is so simple it's genius: the battle about transmitting live from the crucifixion of Jesus. I wonder why nobody has got that idea before. That alone is enough to deserve one star.But the story itself does not deserve more than an additional two stars. It drowns in overexposed attempts to be controversial, in the typical American way of wanting to provoke the authorities of moral.This novel is a mixture of the movies Back To The Future (I, II and III), Life Of Brian and 12 Monkeys and the filmatization of The Last Temptation Of Christ. Gore Vidal has a lot of good ideas but he does not seem to tidy up in order to &quot;kill his darlings&quot; among them. However, Vidal's humour has a certain level, balancing on the thin line between Woody Allen'ism and blasphemy. (Being an atheist, I am not the right person to judge whether the author actually does step over the line and into blasphemy).But the story fades, in and out. Mostly out, towards the end of the book. Compared to the expectations you start with, knowing the plot, it fades to disappointment.So, reading Live From Golgotha, you get some good laughs, a few chills because of Vidal's close-to-blasphemy, from time to time some excitement about how the story is going to develop... but in the end, closing the book, the feeling is kind of empty."},{"Title":"Live from Golgotha","review":"This book is a disgrace. My copy is going in the trash immediately. As a Christian, I don't want to keep at least this copy in the market. If it was possible to give zero stars I would do so."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"Like some other reviewers, I didn't intially like Ina because she does seem a bit whiny and spoiled, but by the second half I was rooting for her to get it together.This book is about an upper middle class family mired in the drudgery of daily life. Ina's day is filled with running the household and caring for her three children while hubby Jay is out trying to become a real estate mogul. Ina felt stifled and the two drifted apart as unspoken resentment crept into the relationship.Ina did what a lot of us do while trying to figure out what to do with ourselves -- she settled. She went for predictability and security and wound up miserable. I was nearly in that situation myself. We think that trying to be what someone else wants is the easy way out, but suppressing your true self only leads to more problems down the road.Beset by financial difficulties and in the midst of an extramarital affair, Jay leaves Ina, and she is forced to contemplate her life. She has to somehow reconnect with the person who existed before she became the matriarch and Martha Stewart wannabe.This book offers no tidy conclusion, but in the end, the couple somehow manage to reconcile after a period of instability. Though Jay hurt and betrayed her, Ina grew from the experience and they were able to start over -- as equals this time.Little touches on the ambiguities of motherhood and life in suburbia, but the big story is about Ina and how she copes with the life she created but doesn't want, and how she has to start over and become her own person. This book was a nice slice of reality."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I sat down just to see what the book was all about, and two football games later... I was done!!! This is a good story about how ordinary people can overcome extraordinary circumstances. Well done Ms. Little!"},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"My product was shipped in a timely manner and it was in as good of condition as the seller stated."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"Fear of the unknown can lead you to your spiritual and emotional death.Not following your passion can lead to your spiritual and emotional death.Not living consciously can lead to your spiritual and emotional death.Understand? Yes?Well too bad because Benilde Little doesn't think you can grasp this concept. To help you out, Little spends nearly the entire novel having her protagonist tell the reader this in nearly those EXACT terms. This was no story, it was almost just an excuse for Little to lecture people through the voice of her heroine!Basically the heroine was too scared to follow her passion when she was younger, so she checked out, got married to someone who knew what they wanted to do, becomes a Stepford wife, and wakes up 13 years later to find that even her husband has become bored with her and leaves her.This is where the novel opens. The next 300 pages are spent lecturing, lecturing, and lecturing us on how many other people are in boxes. A box being a figurative term for people who don't live by their own rules. And in Little's world boxes are for people who can be labeled as jocks, geeks, cheerleaders, Greeks, BAPs, etc.So who's outside of the box? Lesbians, cross dressers, and artists. Seriously. Those are the only characters in the book who Little says is outside. And the cross dresser dies of a DISEASE (it had no name and she never comes out and calls it AIDS.)So outside of all these lectures what does our heroine actually do? She talks with some friends, considers getting with a former love of her life (never happens), moves into a smaller home and has to take on two part time jobs to make ends meet.Hmm. Sounds like the story of a lot of people who are inside the box.Oh, wait! She works part time at a newspaper as a photographer and part time at an art gallery. Whew! Being broke - the cure to being in a box."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I suppose Ina's story isn't for everyone -- many a hardworking woman would call her an ungrateful whiner. So maybe this is a book for the more eclectic and artistic of us, those of us like Ina who have a hard time finding a place where we fit in, or where we don't need to fit. Because I understood the temptation to mold yourself to fit the life offered to you, I probably run the risk of over-rating this novel.In any case, I understood both Ina's struggle as an artist, her guilt of not being satisfied, and I was very empathetic towards her tendency to lose herself in the process of raising her kids. This is a novel that does not trivialize anything about the life of the creative, artistic black woman, and I can't believe I waited so long to read it."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I'm a big fan of her work,so I guess you can say I'm already somewhat biased. Anyway, while overall it was a good book, the sudden jumping to different events I didn't feel. Also, it did not have as much depth as her other works. However its still worth the time to buy & read."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"This book is not one of my faves, but I gave it 4 stars because it was pretty good and Benilde Little can do no wrong as far as I am concerned.I have been on a 'reading hiatus' for the past two years, but I came back to myself on Friday after learning that Ms. Little has a new novel out. Since I already had this book, I decided to read it before buying the new one. I read it in a day and a half so it definitely held my attention, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed her other two novels. Something was missing that I can't quite put my finger on.Could it be the absence of my beloved Miles Brown? I didn't think that Ms. Little could have a book without that man. I love him!! Oh well, I see that he is wreaking his own special kind of havoc in the new book, so I'll have to get my Miles fix there."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"This book was ok, it was about a lady who is going through marriage problem, job problems and just trying to find out what she wanted in life. I really didn't like this book as much as I liked the author's first two novels. I thought the the main chracther of the story complained to much and that her life was not all that bad up into her husband did her wrong. I wished her dirty little secret would have come out in the book also."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I held back on the 5 stars because I guess this book does lack something. What that is...I don't exactly know. What I do know is that I love Benilde Little's talents and skills at writing. She is smart and thoroughly entertaining with her craft. Her writing takes you to another intellectual level as you read her works. I have read other books that I literally couldn't put down but his one, I can more or less take it or leave it. That's really why it didn't get the extra star. But, it definitely is still a good book."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I have always enjoyed Benilde Little's writing. I remeber when I first read Good Hair. I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to tell friends about this wonderful new author.And now two books later, I still feel the same way. Ms. Little is truly gifted. She has departed a bit from her original formula, but manages to deliver an engrossing story. At times, the story ambled and stumbled a bit, but it was very well crafted. The plot was an old one, but she went into a new direction and let us look at things at a different angle. The characters had depth, and made it easy for me to get to know them. Moreover, I wanted to know them. I'm looking forward to Ms. Little becoming quite a bright star in the literary world. If nothing else, this story drives home what all Sisters should know by now: You cannot lose yourself IN someone without losing yourself TO them. We can love our brothers strongly and not forget to continue loving ourselves. Wonderful book."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and am very grateful that I checked it out at the library. The lead character is only a little bit interesting and the supporting characters are dull. In fact, the storyline is dull, predictable and I could not muster any support for the lead. I mean, by the fifth chapter, I was not interested in her plight anymore. Moreover, there are sequences in the book that come out of nowhere and some characters end up having a complete personality change by the end of the book (i.e., David)...I just did not get the sense that Ms. Little's heart was in this one."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I am a huge fan of Ms. Little, but this one was not one of her greatest. Ina was an interesting person who appeared to be a good person, great mother and decent photographer. However, she had some problems in her life and it seems like she was always looking for someone else to blame for her misfortune. Her mother was never around, David wasn't the man she needed but she definitely wanted, Paige was the perfect neighbor who had it all but was judgemental and lived the life that Ina wanted. Jay brought her total joy and total frustration at the same time. He provided her with a stable life with three beautiful children, but after his indiscretion, caused to have to live a life that she never wanted or asked for. So, all through the book if something wasn't right, then Ina never owned it. I wondered if she had lived out her true life if she would have had all the problems she incurred.The book was good, but not extraordinary like her others."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"While I will agee Acting out was a good read. It just did not compare to Benilde Little's previous books.The storyline was a great one but I am not sure what it was that (I thought ) did not make it a terrific read as her other work.Ina did a good job finding herself after her husband acted outon her.It was not easy but I was so glad she found herself.Especially after having given up so much to her husband and kids.The ending was not what I expected but I did agree with Ina's decision.Ina lost herself alone the way in her family and husband.She gave up so much to her husband and kids.Imagine to Have it all and then to lose so much in the end was hard for her.She actually had to lose herself to find herself.It was one of those story that makes you think and feel what if ....While Jay Acted Out,he and later found himself but was it to late? I will not tell. However I will say Ina did a great job at finding herself and being lost for so many years.My over all rating is about 3.5 stars. A good read just not one of her best books.I will still be anxiously awaiting her next book."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I DID READ GOOD HAIR AND LIKE MANY OTHERS ENJOYED THE STORY.

I liked the fact that it showed how black women are able to cope through various aspects of life. Granted this was an easy and nice read but it is not her best writing."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"A good book will cause you to think and feel, and this is the effect that Acting Out has.Benilde Little is an observant writer with a penchant for good, relevant detail. She paints scenes with her words, makes you feel the characters, tempts you to question what you'd do if you were in Ina's situation, the narrator of this novel about a wife who finds herself in a marriage/mommy/woman dilemma. Benilde Little makes you know the character; every emotion that Ina feels, it's as good as yours. If Ina is there, so are you. Some of Ina's feelings are disturbing, or is it that she's just real, honest, able to get in touch with her heart no matter what's inside. In truth, Ina confesses certain feelings that many of us might hide for fear of judgment, for fear of misunderstanding. But if we're honest we can relate to Ina's musings, her regrets and non-satisfaction as a tired and wore-out mom, a disillusioned wife.Her third novel in approximately seven years, Little's absence from fiction has been felt; her return well worth the wait. With its candid revelations and realistic portrayal of family, marriage, and independence, Acting Out triumphs."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"As always, Benilde Little did a superb job of telling the story of one woman's struggle to fulfill her mission in life. In \\"Acting Out,\\" the main character Ina is faced with moving on when her husband leaves her and their three children after 12 years of marriage. Unlike many characters in contemporary fiction, Ina doesn't sing the \\"my man done me wrong\\" song. She looks within and tries to examine how she contributed to the demise of the marriage. She comes to the realization that she focused so much on carrying out the roles of perfect wife and mother that she abandoned her own dreams and ambitions. Instead of focusing solely on the shortcomings of her \\"no-good husband,\\" Ina decides to focus on reclaiming her dreams.There isn't a lot of over-the-top drama and in-your-face biting commentary. This book is more of an exploration of life beyond the fairy tale and what happens after you say \\"I do.\\"\\"Acting Out\\" is a must-read for anyone who's aching for a smart read. If you're tired of ridiculously graphic sexual escapades, constant profanity and page after page listings of designer/bling-bling references that fill pages of many contemporary black fiction novels, then you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I have read Ms. Little's previous books and really looked forward to this one. I could not even get through it - it was abstract and not at all interesting.I rarely don't finish a book but I could not get through this piece of work."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"I really enjoyed this book and the way the character was able to connect her childhood, college days, initial motherhood, and the current situation to see how she got where she was, inside.I liked the fact that Ina admitted that she wasn't the woman her husband had married. I appreciated the storyline that explained how a woman goes from a college graduate ready to conquer the world to someone who has a full day everyday caring for the people in her home, but one that does not have the respect of most people. I enjoyed the ending as well. It didn't matter if she and her husband reconciled. She was complete in herself.I was also grateful that Ms. Little left-out any explicit sex scenes. Sex has been all to described in modern literature. Its time to go beyond that and explore why we do or don't do something.Don't miss out on this one."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"As always Ms. Little has delivered a blockbuster! I was enthralled with Ina and her emotional rollercoaster. Ms. Little painted a vivid picture of not just characters in a book but human beings. People I loved and cared about. I actually could not put down this masterpiece because I wanted to know if Ina could survive as a single Mom, could she forgive her Mother and face her on fears. Could she rekindle her creative side that would inevitably allow her to be herself. Not to mention being faced with issues of denial and even infidelity. The element of family and how they shaped Ina was also fascinating even as they struggled with their own issues. Especially her cousin whose tragic life ended to soon. Also having grown up in the very neighborhood as the author and played in the same streets, despite some ficticious names, mentioned by Little took me home again."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"Ina has a twelve year marriage, the luxury of staying home to care for her three beautiful children, and a home that most people only see in magazines, yet happiness is just outside her grasp. When her husband announces that he is leaving, she is shocked and a little surprised that he was the one doing the leaving. All her life, Ina struggled to find a level of comfort with who she really was. Once she married Jay, an enterprising and hardworking owner of a real estate firm, her search for self fades into the background and eventually she becomes consumed by her life as a wife and mother and loses herself. After a difficult childhood, Jay dreams of having the perfect family, the perfect home, and enough money to enjoy all the comforts the world has to offer. But what is Ina's dream and is Jay's dream enough? Now that Jay has left, Ina is forced to explore her past, come to terms with her present, and plan for the future. Will she find herself along the way? Is the marriage really over?Benilde Little's latest novel demonstrates that she is still at the top of her game. Through Ina's character, we experience pain, insecurities, and the rich cultural legacy that are common parts of the lives of African American women. We learn the importance of accepting ourselves and others for whom and what we are, through Ina's experiences after her husband's departure. While this book is focused on Ina rebuilding her life, it is also about her self-discovery. The supporting characters in the book are diverse and add additional complexity to the story line. One of the book's messages, that you should never get so caught up in the dreams of others that you forget your own, will surely tug at your heartstrings.Reviewed by Stacey SeayThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"Moving tale of wife and mother Ina who seems to have it all--beautiful family, hardworking husband, million-dollar house in the 'burbs...until one day her husband Jay announces he is leaving..and walks out, leaving her to care for and raise their three children. Her husband has left her for another woman, and Ina is left to &quot;find herself.&quot; Having devoted years to her familial role, Ina soon realizes the her entire identity is intricately tied to those roles of wife and mother.

The author can effectively tell a story. However, I could not get into the main character at all. In my opinion the author did a good job of making Ina out to be a whining, selfish woman who, if in the back of her head knew that the married/children life was not for her, should not have made the choices she did. No one is to blame for her unhappiness but herself. Yes, her husband is a rat, however throughout the book it was as if Ina's main problem was not her husband's infedelity but rather her unhappiness with who SHE had become. The woman was unhappy because she chose to be. Throughout the book she complains almost non stop about the dredges of motherhood, but what did she really expect? No one forced her to &quot;give up her dreams&quot; and no one forced her to marry her husband. And only a selfish person would leave her children for one week after her husband leaves her (as if they haven't been abandoned already.)So while I enjoyed the writing, I really did not like the main character."},{"Title":"Acting Out","review":"For Ina, the matter is a life of unfulfillment, discontent and frustration. As she contemplates her life, her husband announces that he is leaving her and their three children. Never following her dreams because of doubts from others and her need for a safety net, Ina is forced to be all that she can be for the sake of herself and her children. Jay is a man from humble beginnings who wanted it all, worked to achieve his dream, and it still was not enough to prevent failure. Forced to look within his bourgeoisie psyche, lessons are abundant as Jay comes to terms with the world that he never quite fit into.Told through the voice of Ina, she dwells on her childhood, her college years, her courtship with Jay and a lost love. A host of secondary characters add to the mixture forcing the reader to understand whom Ina and Jay are and what they really are trying to escape, hence the good character development.Thought provoking, intricate and somewhat complicated at times, Benilde Little forces the reader into Ina and Jay's world as we navigate the past, present and future with them. Acting Out explores how our past can dictate our future, our hopes and our dreams and reverts back to that age-old quote, \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" Reviewed by Dawn R.

For the most part, entries are thorough, covering a person's career and accomplishments as well as illuminating their private life and what part, if any, their sexuality had on their professional lives. Some subjects are more revealing than others. For example, entries on Agnes Moorehead and Cary Grant, two examples of famous \\"were they or were they not?,\\" don't really include any new information, aside from gossip, and the basis for their inclusion is questionable. On the other hand, recently deceased contemporary subjects, who never publicly came out, like Roddy McDowell, James Ivory and Ismail Merchant, are included. Famous bi-sexuals (like Tallulah Bankhead, Errol Flynn, Brad David and Margaret Cho) are included. A notable highlight of the book is the inclusion of contemporary actors, like Dan Butler, Alan Cumming and Lily Tomlin. There are so notable omissions (like Leslie Jordan, Sara Gilbert and David Hyde Pierce), but the editor states that the book is not meant to be comprehensive and the lack of information on certain individuals is often the reason for their absence.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cocktail Party","review":"In a world of appearances, a new species of peace-makers has been invented. The priest of old has disappeared. The psychiatrist has replaced him. He is there to listen to secrets, to sort out situations and to propose solutions to human problems. The very few that are worth it can become the saints of today, going to foreign desolate countries and helping people out of their difficulties, fighting poverty and diseases, bringing the christian faith to pagan people, living in suffering and dire hardship. The others are helped to adapt to our society, to be successful in this society without feeling the remorse or the fear that come along with it. They just become adaptable, supple enough to fit in a deeply dishumanized society. The psychiatrist is the go-between for such people.This play is surrealistic and yet perfectly descriptive of reality. It is full of a new type of poetry, his poetry of love and hate, of a new type of drama, his drama of conflict-solving. T. S. Eliot manages to shift from the most superficial bourgeois drama to the deepest and serenest tragedy turned comedy. The path of these people is tragic in a way, but it ends in beauty or at least in harmony.Yet I think T.S. Eliot would have been better inspired if he had gotten away from this bourgeois aristocratic society that is nothing but vain cocktail parties and superfluous appearances.

Eliot is best known for his modern absurdist poetry, which deftly painted landscapes and characters both grim and gorgeous. His attempts at drama seem much more of a mixed bag. While I greatly enjoyed \\"Murder in the Cathedral\\", I was not so amused with \\"The Cocktail Party\\".Eliot delves right into the action in Act I, with a small party of guests conversing in Edward Chamberlayne's London flat. Their host is distracted, and after all of the guests leave, he confesses his problem to an unidentified guest, that his wife has just left him. The unidentified guest mysteriously assures him that his wife will return the next day, as indeed she does. They each wind up meeting with a psychological consultant, who turns out to be the unidentified guest from the party. Through his circular questioning and the insights of their friends, he is able to convince the pair to find the answers for their ailments.\\"The Cocktail Party\\" has been reviewed as a tale about the search for the meaning in life. If that is the case, Eliot had few answers, although some interesting questions. This snapshot of 'modern' London life feels cold and one-dimensional on the page; the reader has no sympathy or feeling for any of the characters who are questioning the meaning of their existence.

It's the movie I HEART HUCKABEES.In both, there are ordinary people leading more or less empty lives, and the people they turn to for advice. These advisers have mystical powers or divine connections, but the whole show makes fun not only of the ordinary characters, but of the advisers and how they work as well.THE COCKTAIL PARTY is a more serious play, since Eliot believed in the Anglicanism his advisers dispense, and he even has a martyr as part of his comedy. But both shows use their unique heavenly personages very well and get a lot of laughs out of them. And of course we have to give Eliot credit for inventing this particular approach.There have been divine advisers before, of course, in plays like THE PASSING OF THE THIRD FLOOR BACK or MR. PYM PASSES BY. But the way they drift in and out of being real, in and out of being comic, is special in PARTY and in HUCKABEES.

Julia occupies the center of the storytelling. Edward is the host. Julia describes herself as a tough old woman. Edward claims his wife Lavinia is tending an old aunt in the depths of Essex.After most of the guests exit, Edward is left with the unidentified guest. It is learned that Lavinia has actually left Edward. Edward is told to resign himself to feeling ridiculous. Alex and Peter return. Peter is concerned about his friend, Celia. Alex doesn't want Edward to be alone.Celia then contacts Edward. She understands that Lavinia has left him. Edward fails to watch the dinner on the stove that Alex cooks for him and it is ruined. Julia returns. Celia remains and announces her interest in Edward to him. Julia's call interrupts the discussion. Her spectacles were left in the kitchen.The unidentified guest reappears. He tells Edward he will change his mind, but he is not free to change it. Celia and Peter come again. They say Lavinia telegraphed Julia. Lavinia arrives, knowing nothing about a telegram. Peter is going to California and Celia may be going away.Julia enters and next Alex. Everyone then leaves to accomodate the couple, Edward and Lavinia. Lavinia says she forgot all about the party. Edward tells how he invented an aunt.In another act Edward tells a doctor how he cannot live with and cannot live without his wife. He says the death of the spirit is terrifying. Lavinia arrives and claims that she merely wanted to talk about her husband, not to meet him in the doctor's office. The doctor says that they are both too ill to enter his sanatorium. He characterizes them as self-deceivers. Celia will enter the sanatorium.Act Three centers again on the drawing room of the Chamberlaynes. It is two years later. Julia and Alex appear and there is talk of tigers. Peter enters, having left Los Angeles three days earlier. He is a screeen writer. It is learned that Celia has died in a gruesome manner. Peter is disturbed because he doesn't think anything he does is important if Celia is dead. The physician notes that Celia has paid the highest price in suffering. Every moment is a fresh beginning."},{"Title":"The Cocktail Party","review":"Although this play of 1950 was Eliot's first full-length comedy, he had made an earlier stab at the genre in the 1920s: &quot;Sweeney Agonistes,&quot; a first-rate work that unfortunately remained unfinished and is now included in collections of Eliot's poetry. &quot;Sweeney&quot; was a jazzy, dark comedy with originality and verve; by comparison, &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; is tepid indeed.Even judged on its own merits, however, this play falls short. The first half is enjoyable enough: an unusually well-written English drawing-room comedy with serious overtones. The play begins to fall apart with the bizarre sessions of pseudo-psychotherapy in Act 2, and degenerates into overt Christian flag-waving by the final scene.Yet the play is still well worth reading. It is more accessible that Eliot's earlier plays and was a surprise hit on Broadway when it first opened. It is still occasionally revived today; one production featured Nancy Walker in the plum role of Julia, a seemingly scatterbrained older woman. (&quot;Salvation!

His books have more than PROMISE...they have DELIVERY.The main character Elijah is followed through his crisis of faith and love for one woman, Ebonee, with such passion that you cry with him, cheer with him and despite your hesitation...FIGHT with him against the forces of darkness. Whew! What a read. Don't miss out on this one."},{"Title":"Demon Hunter, Book 1","review":"Elijah Garland is tired of life as he knows it. Just as he experiences some kind of happiness, something happens to take it away from him. It's as if he isn't meant to be anything other than miserable and alone. It is in that misery that he finally accepts his fate, accepts defeat and shoots himself in the head, taking his own life. One wonders how all of that comes to pass in the first few pages of DEMON HUNTER by T. L. Gardner, but only one who hasn't read previous work by this talented young author.Instead of death being the end for Elijah, he wakes up in the hospital days later without any apparent damages. His mother and sister are happy to see him alive, but the doctors and the police don't quite understand the \\"hows\\" of his recovery and want to run tests and interrogate him. Elijah doesn't question it too much either. He just makes a run for it and eventually it is revealed to him that he has been chosen from birth to right some of the wrongs in the world, to take battle against the forces of darkness (demons, minions, and even Lucifer himself) who are trying to take over their world. With his twin swords Enobe and Soul Seeker, he sets out on the mission. He is \\"The Protector\\" and he uses his past pain and rage to guide him on his journey.Being chased by the police, he encounters FBI Agent Ebonee Lane to whom he immediately feels an attraction. She is undercover on a case which she finds has some connection to Elijah and just as she thinks she knows what's going on, everything around her changes and she ends up fighting for her life. Through both their travels and the battles with the human and supernatural forces around them, they are tested on love, faith, and the meaning of life.DEMON HUNTER is a mesmerizing and emotional trek through the landscape of good and evil, love and hatred, life and death.

Well TL Gardner explains in Demon Hunter how if the Archangels or any angel with status has a mission for you that your life could be altered even before your existence.Elijah Garland never could figure out why so much wrong has gone on in his life from the many failed attempts at happiness, love, and joy but when he finally finds happiness and thinks he has a hold on it a man with a vengeance for what Elijah has done takes his away another one of his one true loves. What he fails to realize is that the Archangel Gabriel has played a part in his existence before he was even conceived and it was all in reason of him to become a Demon Hunter a half angel half human to fight the war that is happening on Earth. Elijah has found a second love with Ebonee and wouldn't let harm find its way to her but he didn't realize that Ebonee would also become the one who could pull him out of his dark moments. With Elijah and Ebonee teamed up as one they fight hells most evils presence with the help of FBI contact and a priest but will it be enough to keep love alive long enough for Elijah to finish his father's mission and to possible catch a full glimpse of love and happiness.TL Gardner brings laughter and complete enjoyment into his book and his characters leaving you wanting for more just to see what else these characters could get their selves into.

In particular, I've found memoirs written by Philip Caputo, William Manchester, and Stephen King to be particularly enjoyable to read. This one, by Graham Greene, is my favorite of them all. He led an event-filled, spectacular life. He went on patrols with Gurkha troops in Malaya, worked for British intelligence in Africa, lived and worked in Indochina/Vietnam during the French occupation, even reported from Dien Bien Phu. But beyond the subject matter, it's Greene's mastery of the language that is primarily responsible for the magnificence of this book. That, and the fact that he is honest, open, and utterly unapologetic about many things that someone less brave might have kept to himself.But as I said, more than anything, read it for the language. Greene was one of the greatest authors to ever work in the English language, and if you've never read anything of his you have a wonderful experience waiting for you, if you only pick up one of his books.Example? Here is Greene capturing a subjective experience in just a few words, one that is particularly difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced it first hand. Most authors who have tried have failed. About his first experience with opium, he says\\"It was like the first glimpse of a beautiful woman with whom, one realizes, a relationship is possible.\\"The book is full of gems like that. It is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Ways of Escape","review":"I'd have to agree with another reviewer who characterized this as \\"odd.\\" Greene was apparently writing this in his 70s, and the prose isn't always as pellucid as one would wish.

(Apparently there's a huge 3-volume biography on him available.)The essays really meander between the struggles he underwent in writing, his travels, his impressions of the political problems on the ground in Malaysia, Haiti, Vietnam and Cube between WWII and the 1970s.It's full of juicy anecdotes, including his mixed experiences with Hollywood trying to bring some of his work to film.

O-I-L. That image reflects the interests of our political and economic establishments. To fashion that image various sources-former diplomats, dubious experts, universities, think tanks and public relations firms-are enlisted. None will harm benefactors who make contributions to their institutions or pay for their services. Writers who take different positions are ostracized and belittled; and journalists quickly learn that truthful reporting is verboten.Said Aburish is a legitimate expert who has not sold out. I highly and enthusiastically recommend his book for anyone who is interested in the current ME situation because he reveals the sordid intrigues of the ME leaders that underlie the turmoil in the area.The ME as we know it was created after World War I. The British and French recruited Arabs to fight the Turks promising emancipation from the Ottoman Empire. When the war ended they carved up the area to form new easily manageable countries and installed client dynasties under their direct control. Any leader who sought to represent the majority and develop a legitimate democratic government was quickly ousted.The only major change that occurred in the intervening years is that the United States replaced the British and French. No existing regime is legitimate. A government that represents the people is a threat. It might charge more for oil and control the industry. It is safer to have compliant puppets who accede to their demands. The West has used every vile tactic and formed alliances with despicable villains to guarantee long-term instability. It shows little interest in competent or intelligent people; tough, mean, corrupt thugs are perfectly acceptable.Aburish analyzes each ME county. Invariably, a tyrant from a minority sect maintains political control. The ruling sect uses income from oil and the military to remain in power. The West manipulates the oil market through oil companies and influences the purchases of arms which make the military effective. By using both oil and arms-two major enormously profitable Western businesses--it determines the policies of these countries.America supports Saudi Arabia as an anchor of its ME policy. The corrupt Saudi ruling family with thousands of male members and over 50 billionaire princes spends an estimated $17 billion on the king's palaces and between $6 and $7 billion for the royal family budget. When oil prices declined per capita income in the country dropped over 50 percent but the royal family was not affected. They rule with an iron hand-imprison, torture and murder their people. The American government has used Lend-Lease and tax credits to satisfy the family's greed. In return the Saudis obediently follow the foreign policies of the country that controls the purse-strings. They maintain a price of oil, acceptable to the West, by increasing or decreasing production. Although their security has been guaranteed, they squander so much on armaments from Western companies that it costs five times more to maintain a Saudi soldier than an American soldier. They support corrupt Muslim and Arab leaders, and underwrote the Iran-Iraq and Gulf wars to the tune of $60-$80 billion while budgets for health and education declined an average 5 per cent a year. At the time the book was written Saudi Arabia had run thirteen consecutive budget deficits. These policies have turned their people against them.Nasser was and continues to be the leader that the average Arab most admires. He was no revolutionary but a pro-West, anti-communist conservative, who wished to cooperate with the West. But he was a man with an independent mind who could not be controlled. He supported the wishes of the people and opposed corruption. His independent foreign policy was frowned upon. He promoted a secular Arab nationalist movement that represented a threat to Western hegemony. To overcome that threat the CIA promoted a major Islamic movement. After Nasser's death his secular movement was soon replaced by a stronger continually growing militant Islamic movement--the result of the West's prior sponsorship! Husni Mubarak, his successor, is similar to all the other ME despots. He needs the army and Western support to remain in power.Without doubt Saddam Hussein is a despicable tyrant. The Sunni minority provides the army officers whose loyalty keeps him in power. He executes people at random, imprisons and tortures thousands. He killed the Kurds of his own country. He developed a military arsenal that included chemical and biological weapons and was working on an atomic bomb. How could such an unsavory character get these weapons? He actually acquired these weapons from the West. Saddam's horrors were not exposed in the Western media when we looked upon him favorably. We supported him in the Iran-Iraq war although we claimed neutrality. Only when his subservience to our wishes became suspect were those atrocities disclosed. When he was on the ropes at the conclusion of the Gulf War we failed to perform the coup de grace. Why? Because destroying the Sunni control might create a government which would represent the people--and this might jeopardize the already precarious ME establishment.Arafat and Fatah his political organization are supported financially and politically by the Arab establishment. They consider him a conservative and a bulwark against the more radical Palestinians. He is a poor administrator, who puts loyal corrupt followers in important positions. He has been unable to control dissidents. To remain in power he must walk a tightrope--accede to the demands of his supporters but not distance himself from the aspirations of the Palestinians (that is why he supports the current Intefada and supported Iraq in the Gulf War). Initially Arafat and PLO properly represented the Palestinians and were opposed by the West. Curiously though, during that period, the PLO was in continual contact with the CIA. By entering into the peace agreement he temporarily gained the support of the West. But his Palestinian Authority is corrupt, it mistreats fellow Palestinians and suppresses the press. As a result he has lost the support of those he is supposed to represent.Jordan, Syria, Lebanon--amply covered in the book--are similarly corrupt and abusive. Read this book. Learn what really takes place in the ME."},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"Said Aburish's book does a number of tasks. It exposes Britain and the USA's complicity in the current state of affairs in the Middle East more clearly than any other book I have read, (perhaps with the exception of Chomsky's World Orders Old and New.) At the same time, he brings out the truth, (or what appears to be the truth,)about the various coups in the region. In addition to this, his analysis of the situation in the Lebanon is masterly; but it was his exposure of the Saudi Regime for what it really is, which shocked me. Aburish's analysis of the progressive leaders of the Gulf, (Nasser and Kassem in particular,) is also very rewarding. He goes on to analyze the behaviour and attitude of the main Orientalists as well. But perhaps the two most important messages of Aburish's book are these: 1.) With the undermining of Arab nationalism and socialism in the Middle East, the final radical force left in the area is Islamic fundamentalism, and this is the one force which the region's rulers cannot overcome. They and the West nurtured it, and now will suffer for it. 2.) The Arab 'elite' (i.e. the Beirut on the Thames,) is so distant from the Arab population, that it is simply unfit to rule it. One senses a strong element of class warfare between the Westernized, hedonistic elites, and the radicalized, puritanical, masses. The former, in countries like Saudi Arabia use Islam to justify their corrupt rule - but it is the latter who are truly Islamic. Given its vast survey of the situation in the Middle East and its origins, I can only conclude that Aburish's book is well worth reading, and is a sharp guide not just to the Middle East, but to the Western powers who must share responsibility for the mess it's in."},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"\\"There are no legitimate regimes in the Arab Middle East\\"The very first statement in the book already makes clear the direction which Aburish's polemic will take. His central thesis is that 'the West' (shorthand for the USA, UK and France) has by a number of means skewed the political processes of the Arab region in its own favour to further geopolitical aims.The West's goal is to maintain political divisions in the region, many of which are artificial and without popular support, so as to allow it untroubled access to its vital resource, oil. The buzzword in this power game is 'stability', taken here to mean a stable succession of pro-Western regimes. In this context the fostering of democratic values would invariably be counterproductive and the West has shown itself willing to cooperate with dictators and despots of any ilk, provided they do not attempt to upset the prevailing order.Aburish claims that this leads to a tacit, and sometimes rather more obvious, cooperation between Arab governments and the West. In order to ensure the continuance of this cooperation, the West has taken to supporting regimes with minority popular acceptance, rendering them more likely to address Western interests ahead of those of their own people. In systematic case studies of each major regime, Aburish shows how the tiny elites of the Lebanese Maronites, Iraqi Sunnis, Saudi Wahabis and Syrian Alawis further Western interests. These elites - hailing from minority groups representing respectively 20%, 25%, 20%, 15% of their countries' populations - further Western interests in return for arms and guarantees against subversive activities by foreign (i.e. Western) intelligence agencies.Major challenges to Western hegemony have come in the form of Nasser's pan-Arabism and the more modern Islamic Fundamentalism. These two movements achieved such potency and proved so dangerous to Western interests because they were blessed with the support of the Arab people. Although Aburish's claim is difficult to substantiate in the absence of any mechanism for determining the will of the Arab people, it nevertheless shows that the common people are systematically excluded from political decisions.Aburish indicates a quasi-conspiracy of interest groups which collectively promote a false image of the Arab Middle East. These range from the governments involved (which draw financial and political benefit), to their field operatives (often driven by their own vanity and desire to enjoy the trappings of power), to the vast majority of journalists who are keen to follow the establishment line or in many cases simply too ignorant or lazy to cut through the tangled web of deception and disinformation. Many wealthy Arab businessmen and intellectuals (with a few notable exceptions), says Aburish, help to perpetuate this false view of the Middle East in which the simple Arabs must be protected from the onslaught of Islamic Fundamentalism and the West's primary goal is to furnish selfless assistance in regional development. Aburish points to the Arab diaspora centred on London which seeks to present itself in a favourable pro-Western light, and even sometimes Westernises aspects of itself.Finally, no investigation into the Middle East would be complete without considering the Israeli and Zionist agendas. Aburish shows how Arab divisions have led to the consolidation of the Israeli state, with one Arab regime being played off against another. Whilst some are content to live with Israel so long as it does not threaten their own power bases (e.g. Suadi Arabia), other countries have behaved much more complicitly to the point of direct cooperation with Israel (eg. Jordan). Israel, in dealing with each Arab state separately, paradoxically creates further regional disunity.In the end the losers are the Arab people who remain exploited and voiceless in the great melee of Middle Eastern politics. The winners are the corrupt governments of the Middle East, and the Western multinationals and shareholders to whose interests they pander."},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"I have spent 11 years in Israel. 4 of these years I served in the Israeli Defense Forces in the occupied Gaza Strip as assistant Military Attorney General. Thereafter, in private practise, as alwyer in Israel - Gazan businessmen used me as their interlocutor in Israel and in the world. I forged deep and lasting friendships in Gaza - and managed to gain a refreshing insight into the mainstream mindframe of leading Palestinian businessmen - the men who, before the advent of Arafat, were sustaining the Gazan people. Said Aburish more or less articulates the thoughts and feelings of this business class. He misses the mark - as far as I can discern - mainly in the sense that the majority of the thinking Palestinians I encountered are not familiar with the history upon which his thesis is predicated. He is accurate in his contempt for the illigetimate Arab regimes and has hit the nail on the head when he claims that the majority of Palestinians see Arafat as a brutal traitor. The true leaders of Gaza - Heider Abdel Shafi - for example (whom I prosecuted) - have been silenced by Arafat. Not being an Arab- and being on the opposing side - I venture to say that - in so far as the Gazan business elite is concerned - Aburish is off the mark. This elite - especially in Gaza - has seen the benifits of western democracies - having lived under Israeli rule which can be compared to Arafat's rule - and they so despearately want to be part of that world. Aburish is eloquent. There are truths in what he says. To me as an Israeli - he is a more formidable foe than Arafat BUT Aburish - like those he speaks for - has integrity and honesty. I'd rather him as a partner than Arafat."},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"Post 9/11 and during the infancy of the 'interim government' in Afghanistan we can see two major points of this book illustrated succinctly.Firstly, the colonisation of the old Ottaman Empire awarding local rule to gangs and ascribing them legitimacy based on some flimsy genealogical or religious claim is being duplicated almost exactly in Afghanistan over 80 years later by picking leaders from the representatives of the politically-correct-sounding 'ethnic groups'.Rather more urgently for us (the West), the massive destruction visited upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon may well be the beginning of 'the fire', the whole-scale clash of civilisations bred from the total dissatisfaction of an Arab majority who feel entirely unrepresented by what they see as Western backed dictatorships. 15 Saudis out of 19 hijackers looks like more than a coincidence and despite almost uniform condemnation throughout the 'Arab World' (well the leaders of it anyway) of the attack, Osama Bin Laden and his top men are hiding somewhere. Add to this the Arab governments' (understandable) unease about any US plans to attack Iraq (without the right provocation this time), popular Arab despair about any possibility of peace between the Palestinians and Israel, the effective fusing of Palestinian secular groups with their Islamist 'enemies' and you have a Middle East ready to completely explode. Let's see what happens dudes!"},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"Aburish provides a good survey of the political history of Arab regimes for much of the 20th century. He provides good detail in particular on various frivolous interventions by the British and Americans. One can see some of the real historical basis of Arab paranoia against the west in these pages. At the same time, the worldview Aburish is illustrating has some major hollowness in it. He goes on ad infinitum about how the US and Britain are always thwarting the genuine ambitions of the Arab masses, and any genuine political reform. Yet what are the major goals he is championing? Democracy? Minority rights? Economic social justice? Transparency and accountability in government?Nope, Aburish doesn't say word one about these things, apparently to him and the Arab masses, the only genuine ambition, the only goal of any political reform, is to allow Arab states to fully express the hatred their people have of the West and Israel. This seems to be the sole criterion he is using to measure an Arab regime's authenticity.If that's what the Arab people's want, that's fine. But what's in it for the western reader, who actually stops a minute to think about what kind of world they want to live in? NOTHING. It was foolish for Aburish to even write this book in english if he intends it to influence western policies. Westerners who read this and who care at all about the well-being of their own societies, will probably come around to support Daniel Pipes positions on the Middle East, will have less faith in an understanding between civilizations, and will conclude, quite contrarily to Mr. Aburish's intent, that it is only by backing these regimes through cynical short-term meneuvers, that the west can protect itself against the fury that would surely come out of a democratized Arab world."},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"This is a damning expose of the relationship between the pro-west governments/establishments of the middle east and the west.

Although it is a couple of years old, it still heavily bears on the current situation on the ground.Furthermore, for a scholarly work it is an incredibly easy read."},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"This book seeks to critique the west for its support of Arab regimes who have frequently abused human rights. Aburish draws a parallel between American support for radical Islamic fundamentalists and minority leaders against the \`masses' who would have selected someone else. Several nations are picked out for criticism among them Lebanon's Maronites, Syria's Alewite Asad, Saudis Wahabis, Iraq's Sunni Saddam and Jordan's King Hussien and even Arafat. While true that all these leaders were corrupt and probably didn't have the average Arab in his best interest it is a clich&eacute; to simply blame the west.The reality is the House of Saud established itself, without western support, in the 1920s. The Jordanian Hashemite King was installed by the British but the majority of Jordanians are Palestinians. Is the argument that Jordan should become a Palestinian state? Wouldn't this mean that the Palestinians would no longer be able to complain that they were \`stateless' and \`refugees'? Although the Sunni's of Iraq are the minority it was Sunni wealth and traditions of governance that brought them, rather then the mountain Kurds or \`Swamp' Shia Arabs to power. The West actually supported King Faisal in Iraq only to see him overthrown by the Sunni Ba'athists. In Lebanon it is true the West supported the Maronites but it is also true the west abandoned the Maronites during the Lebanese Civil War. In Syria the west played almost no role in putting Asad, an Alewite, into power. And the west certainly played no role in choosing Arafat as leader of the PLO.So this book is a wonderful study. The character assassinations and descriptions of fumbling, barbaric Arab leaders and strongmen is refreshing from the usual hum-drum academic works on these regimes. The text is lively and fast paced, but unlike most Aburish books, the critiques have been heard before and most of them don't entirely stand up to scrutiny. In the end the West did support Saddam and the Saudis, but this was only after most of these strongmen had already put themselves into power, rather then the west conspiring to suppress the Arab majorities. With the obvious exception of Jordan's King Hussien, who actually runs one of the more free and open Arab countries, so in reality the west has helped those Arab masses. Also not touched on is the fact that the Western support for Islamic fundamentalism against communism has recently backfired in the rise of Osama and anti-western fundamentalism. Here the book shows that it is outdated. And probably the book is also flawed in not acknowledging that the west cleared retreated and failed to install its leaders in Lebanon, despite intervention in the 50s and 80s.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"The Independent (London), August 2, 1997Middle Eastern reigns of error; Lawrence Joffe wonders why the West always backs crooks and creeps in the Arab world;A Brutal Friendship: the West and the Arab elite by Said K AburishFrom the opening sentence of A Brutal Friendship, it is clear that Said Aburish intends to be the Emile Zola of Araby. \\"There are no legitimate regimes in the Arab Middle East\\", he states; and few escape his ire. He spares neither Whitehall mandarins, nor mendacious arms dealers, nor Israeli-sponsored think-tanks, nor wheeler-dealer CIA agents, nor well-tailored Arabs in London's \\"Beirut-on-Thames\\". Not even that perennial British favourite, \\"plucky little\\" King Hussein of Jordan, emerges unscathed. As if to clinch the point, the gruesome dustjacket shows two hands shaking, one smeared in oil, the other in blood.Yet throughout its 360 exhaustive pages, A Brutal Friendship is informative, engrossing and entertaining. Aburish, a Palestinian writer whose book attacking the House of Saud established him as a leading Arab dissident, now extends his offensive to all \\"pro-West\\" regimes. His thesis seems obvious. Arab people deserve as much dignity and liberty as anyone else. For Aburish, this alone is the litmus test for a government's legitimacy. The \\"street\\", he implies, is always right, and whichever leader it adopts is therefore legitimate. Even bogey figures such as Saddam Hussein do better than King Fahd when it comes to spending on education or economic development.Aburish accuses the West of moulding the Arab world to further its own interests, handpicking minority elements and criminals as leaders while denying Arab people their basic rights. From Britain encouraging the slaying of popular King Ghazi of Iraq in 1938 to the CIA instigating coup after coup in Syria, such interventions \\"almost became a bad habit\\". Then comes another, somewhat paradoxical argument: apart from being immoral, to mollycoddle dictators is to endanger long-term Western interests. Now that London has become \\"the new capital of the Middle East\\", Arab corruption has started \\"infecting the hosts\\" - witness Jonathan Aitken. And the Arab-Israeli peace process, Aburish warns, is doomed unless and until the parties heed the voices of ordinary people.\\"Arming friends\\" - such as Britain's multi-billion weapons supply to Saudi Arabia - is equally short-sighted. The average Saudi soldier costs five times as much to maintain as his US equivalent, but poor training renders him useless in battle. The most obvious example is Saddam himself, who eventually bit the Western hand that had fed him with arms. Aburish unveils an entire hidden history of mendacity, as the CIA nurtured the young thug in the Sixties as their secret weapon against the anti-Western Iraqi leader Kassem.Curiously enough, Western powers follow no Machiavellian master-plan, but rely on the improvisations of field officers and PR agents. Thus Britain's Harry Philby and the CIA's Miles Copeland could change history merely by exploiting personal ties with their Arab \\"pets\\". Given this accidental quality, Arab acquiescence seems all the more shameful.Aburish may be quirky - having condemned \\"commission-skimming\\" arms-brokers, he suddenly reveals himself as one of their number - yet it is his keen eye for personal foibles, and the psychological background to political developments, which brings the book to life. His rogues' gallery includes \\"the gun-toting, whiskey-swigging, skirt-chasing\\" PLO agent, Hassan Ali Salameh; and the roving Orientalist, Gertrude Bell. She dined off the finest silverware in her desert tent and made blunder after blunder, yet created the State of Iraq from nothing. Meanwhile, Lebanese delegates to France wore an assortment of fezzes, baggy trousers, turbans and lounge suits to express their ethnic diversity, prompting Aburish to comment that \\"Prime Minister Clemenceau must have thought he was facing a collection of circus performers\\".Aburish incisively queries received wisdom. For instance, King Hussein's historic peace \\"breakthrough\\" with Israel in 1994 merely concluded a process which began in secret decades earlier. Britain and the US may bewail the danger of Islamic fundamentalism, but it was they who nurtured the zealots in order to undermine Nasser's nationalists and his Soviet ally. And, in noting that Egypt's 1967 war against Israel coincided with her sponsorship of rebels in Saudi-backed Yemen, Aburish deduces: \\"Fighting Israel and Islam at the same time defeated Nasser and broke the back of the Arab nationalist movement.\\"Too often, though, Aburish tries to shoehorn the facts to fit his thesis. He maintains that Maronites still run Lebanon - despite intracommunal murders, the disarmed militias and boycotted elections, the erosion of Christian presidential powers, and Syria's displacement of France as Lebanon's mentor. Likewise, Aburish wants to portray Arafat and King Hussein as archetypal Arab dictators. But what of Arafat's convincing electoral mandate in January 1996, or Hussein's own attempts, albeit halting, to introduce multi-party democracy in his kingdom?Two nagging questions remain. Are Arab governments illegitimate because they are in cahoots with a corrupting West; or is the West corrupt because it is in cahoots with illegitimate governments? Aburish's answer seems to be: guilty on both counts.Accepting that A Brutal Friendship is polemic, we can learn much about the Middle East from it - and enjoy a good read. Aburish is either brave or foolhardy (perhaps a bit of both). (...)---A Brutal Friendship: The West and the Arab Elite; book reviews Commentary September, 1998\\"There are no legitimate regimes in the Arab Middle East.\\" With this eye-opening first line, Said Aburish, an independent-minded Palestinian writer long resident in London, promises something fresh: an insider's expose of the tyrannical governments that dominate his region. Aburish is, indeed, in a good position to document a sordid political history that harks back to World War I, and he is also no stranger to the form: his previous book, The Rise, Corruption and Coming Fall of the House of Saud (1994), was an important if over-the-top denunciation of the Saudi ruling family.In A Brutal Friendship, Aburish sets out to deliver on his promise by offering biting assessments of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia, plus Yasir Arafat's Palestinian Authority. But, alas, his indictment is brief and superficial, consisting mostly of criticisms of the region's rulers for not following their real interests. And that sets the stage for Aburish's true topic, which is to find a scapegoat for this dismal state of affairs.Here, to put it charitably, he is less than enlightening. His explanation for Arab tyranny dwells not on the foibles of culture in Arabic-speaking countries; not on their premodern legacy of dictatorship; and not on the winner-take-all atmosphere that dominates their politics. In fact, Aburish has almost nothing to say about the motor forces of Arab life; his attention is focused outward.What emerges from Aburish's pages, in a nutshell, is that nearly all the problems of the Middle East are due to a vast British and American conspiracy that aims to perpetuate \\"Western political hegemony\\" in the regime. The British and American governments are not alone in pursuing their greedy goals; oil companies, too, are complicit, and are blamed by Aburish for, in particular, the \\"moral degradation\\" of Arab leaders. As for the citizens of Western countries, they have been too thoroughly brainwashed to resist the corrupt imperialism of their rulers. The only Westerners identified by Aburish as seeing through the vast deception are Noam Chomsky and Edward Said, two stars in the firmament of the conspiracist Left.In pursuit of its aims, the West does not rely on anything so crude or transparent as direct rule. Instead, writes Aburish, the Anglo powers get Arab stooges to do their work for them, teaching them how to \\"suppress their people to stay in power and use their control of their countries to provide a stability which serves Western political and economic interests.\\" By this means, generations of Arab elites have become nothing more than \\"deputy sheriffs,\\" or, more pungently, the losing partners in a \\"master-slave relationship.\\"Blaming the West leads Aburish into some strange byways. In order to differentiate among Arab leaders, for instance, he constructs a topsy-turvy moral calculus. Those who have explicitly aligned themselves with the West--King Hussein of Jordan, various Egyptian governments, and the like--he castigates as \\"hideous\\" and \\"abominable\\"; even Yasir Arafat is put down as \\"a tool\\" of Western power. By contrast, Saddam Hussein is praised for his \\"eradication of illiteracy, his health-care programs, and his championing of women's rights,\\" while the fundamentalist Muslim movements are designated the Arabs' one remaining hope. As for Israel, that country. all but disappears from the Middle East picture as Aburish draws it. However much he may loathe the Jewish state, he sees it as only another client of the West and therefore not a power in its own right.To anyone not versed in matters Middle Eastern, the extremist bent of A Brutal Friendship might make it seem like the slightly deranged musings of one out-of-touch intellectual. Unhappily, its outlook cannot be so easily dismissed. Outlandish as it may be, the book represents a main line of Arab thinking, one that (as Fouad Ajami has noted in his recent book, The Dream Palace of the Arabs, which I reviewed in the March 1998 Commentary) is embraced as well by any number of leading politicians, military officers, religious authorities, journalists, and academics. Moreover, the principal points made"},{"Title":"A Brutal Friendship: The West and The Arab Elite","review":"I sent an online review 3 weeks ago. How come it was never published"},{"Title":"Failure of a revolution: Germany, 1918-19","review":"Sebastian Haffner offers us compellingly his vision of the German Revolution of 1918-9.His conclusion is straightforward: the Revolution was betrayed by the leaders of the Social Democratic Party (Friedrich Ebert, Gustav Noske, Philipp Scheidemann), who lacked the vision and the will to turn the Revolution into a mass democracy after the breakdown of the German empire.On the contrary, they provoked a deadly division of the left, when Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg founded the Spartakus Bund in order to install a democracy of councils.Ebert killed the revolution with paramilitary troops which became the basis of Hitler's SA.Sebastian Haffner sees in the failure of the SPD leadership in 1919 an omen of things to come in Germany in 1933, when a desperately divided left together with the other democratic parties handed the power over to Hitler without the slightest struggle.This book contains also an excellent analysis of the political situation in Germany during and just after WWI when general Ludendorff acted as the strong man.Sebastian Haffner presents history as a drama with its villains, conspirators, bystanders and victims.His book is a model historical tale and should be an example (like the books of W. Manchester or R. Tawney) for all historians, because it shows magnificently how to turn historical events into a fascinating read."},{"Title":"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It","review":"There's probably some stuff in here that would be useful for a manager who is completely clueless, but I didn't find much that would be useful insight for someone further along than that. I gave it a few chapters, because a friend I respect recommended it, but then gave up. I guess the book is okay for what it is, but it isn't likely to make any lasting improvement in your relationship with your employees. It generally comes from a perspective that has been somewhat popular in recent years, to the detriment of business, one that says:- Process is more important than substance.- Management can be detached from leadership.- Management is more about skill than about character.Employees follow and build loyalty to leaders who lead, not administrators who manage. When you've proved yourself as a leader, when you've proved (by consistent actions over time) to your employees that you really have their best interests at heart, and when you've shown that you'll work with those who want to improve, but will deal decisively with those who poison the work environment, then amazingly enough, employees tend to start doing what they ARE supposed to do.I'd recommend skipping this one and picking up a copy of Leadership as a Lifestyle, by Hawkins, instead."},{"Title":"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It","review":"Talk about a super long title that clearly states what a book is about! When you pick up \\"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It\\" by Ferdinand F. Fournies, there's no doubt what you think you are getting. The question is of course if you DO get that and how valuable the information is.There are apparently 16 different reasons why an employee might not do what they should. These are: They don't know why, they don't know how, they don't know what, they think your way won't work, they think their way is better, they think something else is more important, there are no positive consequences, they think they ARE doing it, they are rewarded for NOT doing it, they are punished for doing it, they anticipate negative consequences, there are no negative consequences for NOT doing it, there are obstacles they can't fix, they have personal limits, they have personal problems, and the task is simply impossible. That's quite a lot of reasons for one \\"problem\\"! Just having that list can really be helpful. A manager who thinks \\"My employee is simply an idiot! I told him what to do!\\" might take a step back and realize there really IS a problem that can be fixed, once it is identified.I realize that a lot of these items are common sense - but it's amazing how many times in the workplace that I've seen bad managers completely ignore the real problem and just yell at an employee. That rarely helps!Now, while the basic list is good, I do have some issues with this book. The first is that the book opens telling you \\"Now a manager could be assaulted or killed by the employee [for not handling problems effectively].\\" Good God Almighty. Talk about a nasty way to sell a book - \\"read me or you could DIE!!!\\"The book does a good job of laying out each type of problem in detail, and then giving specific solutions. You might say \\"they're common sense\\" but obviously if so many managers out there are NOT handling these situations well, they need a little kick in the behind. Maybe they're just too stressed and aren't actually thinking about the problem. Maybe this book will help give them that extra insight they need into using a good solution.One thing that bothers me is that the book makes it seem that every problem CAN be solved by following these few easy steps. There's a small FAQ in the back that says in essence \\"Oh yeah, sometimes this fails and you'll have to demote or fire the person.\\" It would have been more helpful if in each section there were the regular tips, but also \\"drastic steps\\" and then \\"when to give up\\". I suppose they want to be positive - but if they give you only a few things to try, and they aren't working, it would be good to have a progression of what to do next. To keep trying those same things becomes an exercise in futility and frustration. In fact, it's sort of funny, he says at one point that, if these tips don't work, go buy my next book to learn what to do then :)Still, it's a good basic primer for the new manager of how to handle a variety of situations. I definitely have worked in many situations where managers did NOT know these things and the environment suffered because of it. If you feel like you already know these things, borrow the book at the library and skim through - you might pick up a tip or two. If you're a new manager, then I would suggest buying this. It's the sort of book that you read in the bathroom, going just over a single chapter, and focussing on how to handle that one specific issue. You're probably going to run into all of these issues over time, if you stay on a managerial path."},{"Title":"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It","review":"Really helpful book! Fournies gives 16 reasons why employees (and maybe peers or others) fail to meet expectations. The book doesn't just give a list, though. It gives succinct insight into how to tell which is the reason in a particular case. Then, once we have the cause identified, it gives good advice on how to correct the root cause. I found it very helpful in handling failed expectations of others -- sort of Sun Tsu's *The Art of War* without the executions. &lt;grin&gt; I recommend this book as a tool for managers at all levels to turn frustration into solutions."},{"Title":"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It","review":"This is a basic book for all new managers.

I am recommending it to my students."},{"Title":"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It","review":"Reading Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To...and What To Do About It is just one book out of a \\"set\\" that I checked out from our local library that I am currently reading my way through. My housemate was recently promoted to a general manager position at a national pizza chain and was supposed to receive on the job training...but typically, has received none. So, we thought it might be helpful to do some reading on the subject of leadership, management and supervision of employees. This is our second read and overall, I'd say it covers the basics and is a great lead off for doing a reading set (as we are) but this book would probably be useless to anyone who had had adequate management experience or for those who have already done extensive reading in this area.Fourines leads off with the premise that there are essentially 16 reasons or \\"root causes\\" for conflict between employees and managers and he sets out to systematically explain, clarify and give examples for each. It might have been nice for the author to acknowledge that his moderate and positive approach to these issues and problems do not always work...and he offers no progression or escalation of steps beyond the very basics...so if you have one of the problems he's describing and the solution given doesn't work, the author really hadn't helped delineate what the progression from there might or should be. The writing here is simple, concise and accessible and the author makes his point very well (with the exception of escalation of problems beyond the scope given). We both enjoyed reading this and feel it's best used by those new to management who are not receiving mentoring or adequate on the job training as they are starting out. Long-time managers or those well read in this area might enjoy it as a reminder or refresher for the basics of management but won't find much else to inspire or learn in these pages.

During such unpleasant circumstances, I've often wondered if the individual in question really didn't get how their behavior and habits were adversely affecting morale and productivity.I'm not currently in such a situation, but if I were, I'd carefully study these simple solutions to the common management problems, and try to gently make suggestions toward their implementation by the manager with whom I'm struggling.What seems like common sense to someone actively pursuing self-improvement, might not be so common to the hopelessly mediocre manager. It might not make so much sense to them either.

Sadly, \\"common sense\\" is too often an oxymoron when it comes to addressing performance issues.I have been recommending this book to both new and veteran managers for years for a number of reasons.1. It helps managers reduce the emotional component that may exist when an employee \\"screws up.\\" As a result it becomes easier for the manager to approach corrective action in a calm and reasoned way.2. It helps managers think through challenges that may exist for repeated underperformers. The performance may not be poor enough to cause the employee to be fired but is defintely unsatisfactory.3. It helps managers consider that there may be environmental issues that impede optimal performance. Sometimes the process is the problem, not the employee.4. It's a little like a cookbook. Once a manager has identified a possible issue, there are suggestions about how to deal with it.Frankly, I use the table of contents as a troubleshooting checklist whenever I encounter any performance issues - including my own. It's somewhat like using the decision tree the Bob Mager created to determine whether a problem requires a training solution.Simply asking (to oneself) could this be it? Or this? Or this? is a valuable exercise.While this book is certainly not the be-all, end-all management textbook, it belongs on the shelf of every decent manager."},{"Title":"Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed To Do and What To Do About It","review":"The truth is that in this book, as in others expressing simple truth, the value may be in the reminder.

It turns out that I enjoyed reading Amanda Rose and am happy that I downloaded it. I didn't read where there was any forced sex between Amanda and Matt. From the beginning, when Amanda rescued Matt on the beach, there was a mutual and physical attraction between them.In 1840, Lady Amanda Rose Culver was a thirteen-year old orphan when her mean and hateful brother, the sixth Duke of Brookshire, took her to the convent to live after their father, the fifth Duke of Brookshire, had died. Edward became Amanda's legal guardian. Amanda's father left her an inheritance that would automatically go to her husband when she married.Amanda at seventeen had not heard from her brother in five years, until she received a letter from Edward just a week before she turned eighteen. Edward had made an arrangement for her to married widower Lord Robert Turnbull, a forty-year old nephew to Edward's late mother. Lord Turnbull agreed that when he marries Amanda that he would turn over the inheritance to Edward who has a gambling debt to pay off. Amanda is determined not to wed Robert, who is too old for her, and is someone she could not stand.Matt Grayson is a ship owner and merchant from New Orleans who was in England on business. He stopped at a bar to get a drink when he checked his watch for the time. Someone in the bar left, then came back with the police. The watch and a knife they found on Matt belonged to an aristocratic family he was supposed to have killed.Matt managed to escape the hanging, but the police shot him while he was escaping and the bullet clipped his side. Amanda was walking on the beach late at night in violation of the nuns' curfew. She discovered Matt's battered body which was washed up on the shore near the convent. Matt was waiting for his ship and brother to pick him up. He was bleeding from his side and had a fever. Amanda knew that Matt was a convicted murder and he had escaped the hanging. Amanda took him to a cave that no one knew about, and nursed him back to health.Amanda was awakened by her friend Susan who told her that Mother Superior wants us all to come downstairs as soon as possible. The constable is here, and he's brought the local police with him. They believe the murderer Matt Matthew Grayson is at the convert. When Amanda went downstairs, her brother and Lord Turnbull were there to take Amanda off for the day. Amanda excused herself to warn Matt, but she was too late as the police were already chasing him down the beach. Matt tumbled right into the waves and the current brought him out into the high waters. Matt thinks Amanda had betrayed him.Three days later, Amanda was walking on the beach late at night. Matt's brother Zeke, ordered his men to go on the beach and kidnapped Amanda. She tried to escape, but it was useless. Her mouthed was covered so she couldn't scream and her feet and hands were bound behind her back. Amanda was taken on one of Matt Grayson's ships heading for New Orleans, Louisiana. Matt was right there in his cabin when his brother brought Amanda to him. Then she realized that Matt was alive. Matt is angry with her, thinking that she betrayed him. Amanda was talking to deaf ears, trying to convince him that it was Edward and not her.I recommend Amanda Rose. It is well written without unnecessary twists or turns.

Set in the 1840s, between England and New Orleans, Matt Grayson is our handsome hero, who is sought after by the English police for a crime he didn't commit. He manages to escape a hanging but not without getting a shot in the side by the guards. It is Amanda Rose Culver, an orphan living in a convent, who discovers Matt's limp and battered body washed up by the shores near her convent. Though she knows the danger she's getting herself into, through her kind and sweet heart she rescues Matt and heals him. As the two get to know each other better, Amanda realizes that she's falling in love with Matt and Matt realizes how much he's come to cherish her and yearns to protect her with his life. But when one morning Amanda realizes that the authorities have found Matt's hidden place (a cave under the convent) she immediately runs down to warn him, but unfortunately for her she didn't know she was leading the authorities straight to Matt. Matt believing that Amanda has betrayed him manages to barely escape again. It is when Amanda, thinking Matt is dead, is ready to move on in life, she is captured by Matt's brother and is held captive on Matt's ship to New Orleans. It is there on the ship she comes face-to-face with Matt again. Matt treats Amanda horribly, but through it all Amanda realizes that she still loves him. How Matt gets over his misunderstanding, and how the two fall deeper and deeper in love, is so well-written by Ms. Robards that all the dialogue and scenes that take place will have your heart thumping and tummy fluttering! When you find out why Amanda was really capture and brought to Matt's ship, it'll have you hoping that there were more characters like his! This is a romance story not to be missed!!! It's incredibly romantic."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"It's the 1840's at a convent in England where Amanda Rose was taken to live by her hateful half-brother years ago after her father's death. She just received notice that he has arranged a marriage for her. Thru this marriage he will be able to obtain her inheritance money. Being the free spirit that she is, she wonders the beach when she can escape without notice by the nuns. It is during one of these times that Amanda runs upon Matt Grayson's battered body. He reveals to her the trouble that he is in but there is something about him that makes her want to help him. For this reason Amanda takes Matt to a cave that she knows about for hiding.Matt Grayson is a ship & merchant owner from New Orleans and has been to England on business. During a business deal Matt was drugged, later to be woken up to police arresting him for the murder of an influencial family in England. Thru chance he escapes the hangman's rope (being shot during the escape) and ends up on a beach down below a convent while trying to wait for his ship to return for him.Matt trust Amanda not to turn him in when police show up at the convent to arrest him. Amanda runs to warn Matt, leading the police right to him. Matt thinking Amanda has turned him in runs out to the sea to escape. His body isn't found but is believed to have drowned. Amanda's brother finds out that she has been hiding Matt and threatens to turn her in if she doesn't cooperate by marrying his suitor. Mourning Matt's death and her future, Amanda wonders out on the beach one night to be kidnapped by some of Matt's men and brother. She is taken to his ship to sail to New Orleans. Amanda finds out that Matt is still alive. And thinking Amanda turned him in, Matt is out for revenge. He will use Amanda sexually until he tires of her than plans to \\"throw her to the side.\\" Those are his plans until feelings get in the way and Amanda's brother shows up in New Orleans to take her back to England. Matt's brother is really my favorite. It was a good story but was pretty chopped up at times, which normally isn't like KB's writing.I really would like to rate this one a 3 1/2 stars. It is a sweet read, but there are so many better ones out there. I would recommend reading it but it is not a keeper for me. And it's not KR's best."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"The pages were steaming with the chemistry between Matt and Amanda Rose. I enjoy all of Karen Robards novels (both regency and modern). Amanda Rose resuces Matt, and then he kidnaps her to America. The plot of the story is somewhat weak...conflict arises from Matt's distrust of Amanda, who he believes betrayed him to the British authorities. Otherwise, the novel is well written with wonderful scenes of passion! Definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I enjoyed the book from beginning to the end. It has good character development and a romantic story line. Amanda was spirited, yet lovely and sweet. She literally saved the life of Matt. Matt was overwhelmed, almost could not believe that Amanda could be such an angel. But he did not want to love, because he was scared of being hurt when he loved another woman again. When he found out that he was in love with Amanda, he tried to rein his heart and clinged on a misunderstanding to keep him from falling head over heel with Amanda. Amanda was much more courageous in love, even making the painful decision to leave Matt, because she thought Matt did not love her and it would be a torture to be with him. The climax of such romance was when the hard hero finally came to term with his intense feelings which made those words many times more touching. A story with a happy ending, leaving a sweet smile on your face when you close the book."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I've read a few stories by Karen Robards, and this is one of my favorites. Matt is a great hero, even though it takes him awhile to come around. Throughout the book you can feel the intensity of his love for Amanda, even when he's being mean. Amanda is the perfect innocent young girl who takes you through her blossoming into womanhood and newly found love chapter by chapter. Everyone remembers the earth shattering experience of your first love. This book demonstrates it perfectly!"},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I dont care what anyone has to say about this book, it is my all time favorite book and will never leave my keeper shelf. No, it is not all mushy, nothing but romance. There are problems, Matt can be too hardheaded and Amanda too immature at times. But it goes with the story. I dont know about you, but I do not liek every book I read to be just like the one before it, with a plot that is only a little different. I love this book."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I liked the book, with just three exceptions. I don't find forced sex, sexy & I could not see how Matt could believe for a minute Amanda betrayed him. After all the trouble she went to, to hide and save him and throughout the book it said she was a poor liar (blushing and so forth) and finally Amanda was always thinking how she wanted Matt no matter what and then she leaves him for England no less, where her half brother wants to get his hands on her again."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I sailed through the first 1/3 of this book so fast. No one could have torn it outta my hands! Beginning scenes: at the hanging, in the cave, and within the convent; so exciting, seductive, & humorous. I really liked Amanda and I could see how Matt found her charming and felt for her plight -- especialy when she's so good to him in his hours of need - 'an angel with red hair.' He warns her not to fall in love with him. I just wish someone would have warned me. After the kidnapping and aboard his ship the middle of the book becomes painful. He is mean & distant, so the story suffers,Amanda suffers,you suffer. Not so fun. But it does pick up again."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I have read several of Ms. Robards modern day novels, and they were great. The ones I read that were supposed to be historical were not and this was no exception.The pitiful part of it was that this could have been such a good book, but it fell apart when Amanda went to warn Matt of the police hunting for him. What sort of a jerk was he? She had done all these daring things to take care of him and he stupidly gets it in his head that she has betrayed him and then he can't forgive her. Well, Duh! Who did he think kept him alive all that time? The idiot!This book did have a first though. This was the first book that I have read that had an entire chapter devoted to a SEXscene, and I could have surely done without that one. First he forces her, and then somewhere along the way, she wants him in her bed. I must have missed something, but then it's like that when I speed read something I don't care for.I love historical romance, but I was so disappointed in this one. Wish I could find a good one."},{"Title":"Amanda Rose (Premier Series)","review":"I usually don't take the time to write a review but after I finished this one, I felt compelled to!! This was a great read, full of suspense and love!! I was appalled at times the way Matt was treating Amanda, but glad Amanda didn't let him back so easily!! Glad to see the heroine didn't just come rushing back to him when all was forgiven!!I would recommend this!!"},{"Title":"Black Thursday","review":"In this book, the eminent historian Martin Caidin concentrates on one of the most brutal air battles in history-Schweinfurt. At a time when the B-17's flew with little or no fighter escort, and the German Luftwaffe had not yet been all but chased from the sky, the 8th Air Force launched a raid on the ball-bearing plants at Schweinfurt, Germany. The result is a story that is at once tragic and heroic. This is a well-researched book, full of first-person accounts of the battle. It reads like a good thriller and leaves the reader with a new respect and appreciation for the brave men on both sides who fought their war five miles above the earth not so many years ago. Highly recommended reading for anyone interested in the air war."},{"Title":"Black Thursday","review":"I happened to find my 1960 copy of BLACK THURSDAY in an antique store and could not pass up the 2 dollar price. Got it home and could not put it down. This is the historical account of the Oct.14,1943 daylight bombing raid on the ball-bearing factory in Schweinfurt,Germany. Mission 115 was to have 384 bombers, 324 B-17's and 60 B-24's. By the time they hit the coast, 33 B-17's had turned back or never left England due to mechanical and engineering failures, with only 29 of the B-24's being able to assemble in the heavy cloud cover and then rerouted to an alternative objective. The 291 B-17's were to take on \\"a German fighter force of 1,100 fighter aircraft\\"(pg 80)based within 85 miles of the flight path. The author calls upon historical documents from both the American and German accounts of the raid, as well as first-hand air crew reports,personal notes,intelligence reports,gun camera film,and from those who survived the mission. The story is then written in a manner that prepares the reader for the mission and why,what to expect from the defending German Air Force and ground batteries,the take-off,and then into battle and return. The air scenes are graphic,well versed,vividly created in a way that every mind can picture the action,feel the emotions,smell the battle,hear the attacks,and taste the tension of survival. Plane after plane is shot up on both sides. Men bailing out only to be shredded by the propellers of B-17's as they free fall through the stacked height formations;others to never bail and become incinerated. Of the 291 B-17's to fly this mission,65 would not return to England with 594 crew members listed as Missing In Action. It was the greatest single mission loss the 8th Air Force ever suffered during the entire war. The results of the bombing were at first thought decisive and effective,but later accounts would show that the results were less than had been hoped as Germany quickly recovered in the manufacture of ball-bearings. The title of this review comes from page 263,\\"On October 18,four days after Mission 115 had become history,the commanding general of the Army Air Forces,Henry H.Arnold,made this statement to the press:\\"Regardless of our losses,I'm ready to send replacements of planes and crews and continue building up our strength.The opposition isn't nearly what it was,and we are wearing them down.The loss of 60 American bombers in the Schweinfurt raid was incidental.\\" I suppose 60 bombers lost sounds better than 594 crew members MIA,5 KIA,and 43 wounded. A FANTASTIC read with 24 B&W photos,23 drawings,2 maps,and statistics - the 1960 Ballantine edition."},{"Title":"Black Thursday","review":"I first read Black Thursday in 1962 at age 13. Rereading it again was pure joy. If you are a WWII Aviation buff, then this should be one of the must reads on your list. Very well written and still accurate after almost 50 years."},{"Title":"Black Thursday","review":"Same as Schweinfurt - Disaster in the Sky - book a bit more worn than expected but no real physical damage. Reads fine but won't look as good on the shelf."},{"Title":"The Savvy Woman Patient: How and Why Your Sex Matters to Your Health (Capital Savvy)","review":"Well to begin with, you sort of have to ask yourself why a man would be writing a review on a book devoted to women's health issues. The simple answer to that is that I have a wife, daughter, sister, mother (who passed away in the not so distant past), nieces, potential granddaughters and on top of that, probably more than half of my close friends are women. Needless to say, women make up a very important part (well over half) of my life. It is only prudent to know as much about something that is extremely important to me and you, and affects all of our lives in so many ways. That is why a guy is writing a review on this subject.I must say that this work has been quite an eye opener. My wife, for many years, has observed that there seems to be almost a double standard in health care in this country which is based on many factors, but that gender is certainly one of the primary dividing points, along with social, racial, financial and culturally dividers. Now this problem seems to her (and me) to be increased if a combination of these factors are present, e.g. a lower income and lower educated black woman versus a higher income, higher educated white guy, as an example. It is an absolute proven fact that African American women share a gigantic disproportionate burden of health problems compared to other groups of women and this burden becomes even greater when compared to that of the care given to white males. But the thrust of this book and our primary interest in this case is not racial or economic, but rather women general, and women specifically. This is the area, on a personal level, that she, (and by association and projection and concern), I are most interested in at this time.This single volume, The Savvy Woman Patient is an excellent primer; indeed, it went far beyond the primer stage, in answering many of my questions. As we all know, or as we all should know, women are different than men in many ways. Their physical and mental reaction as too many disease processes and conditions are quite different than men. So often this is completely overlooked, even by the most astute health care professional, both men and women, I fear. How a woman's body reacts to a disease process in many cases, is quite different than the reaction of a man's.These differences we are talking about go even deeper than end results and begin in early adolescence. Facts such as that girls may quite likely develop symptoms of nicotine addiction faster than boys and can in fact become addicted to nicotine even before they become regular smokers is not a bit of information to take lightly. The same holds true with the speed and susceptibility to health disorders due to alcohol and is really a rather good thing to know. It is interesting and vital to note such information that although more men than women have hypertention at younger ages, women develop hypertension at a greater rate than men as they age; it is more common in women older than age 60 than in similarly aged men. Now what is odd here is the fact that women are far more likely than men to be aware that they have hypertension and to seek and receive treatment. Yet, surprisingly women are less likely to have their blood pressure adequately controlled! It is good to ask the question, Why?It is also a proven fact that health care professionals are much more likely to pay less attention to the health complaints of women than they are men. Study after study has proven this beyond all possible doubt. Now granted, things are getting better in this area, but we yet have a long, long way to go. Information is nothing but pure power and empowerment. Conditions and attitudes simply will not change unless power is exerted in one form or another. This work gives women, and the men to care about them, a great deal of the power needed to create positive change.In a very readable and understandable way, this work addresses issues such as Bone and Muscle Health, Cancer, Digestive Tract and Liver Disease, Eye Disease, Heart Diseases, Autoimmunity, Mental Health and Mental Illness, Oral Health, Painful Conditions, Pulmonary Diseases, Sexual Dissatisfactions, Sexual Health, Sleep Disorders, stroke and Urinary and Bladder Health. Each and every one of these conditions or concerns are different in women than in men and this is not always considered in their assessments, evaluations and treatment regimens. There is a wonderful section of this book that sheds much light on hormonal differences and how they affect the body along with related problems.Now do not think that this is one of those books that some of our lesser enlighten fellow humans chalk off as \\"just another women's lib book.\\" Oh my no! This work lays out cold hard, thoroughly researched facts. This works gives sound practical advice to women; information to well arm them in their encounters with physicians and other healthcare professional, who knowingly, or which is more often the case, unknowingly give short change when it comes to the diagnoses, treatment and follow up of women's health issues. This work is absolutely packed with the right questions, the right concerns and the right approaches for women dealing with our health care system. No complaining is found in this work; just pragmatic reality and how to react to this reality.This is a very professionally done work and for its size, only 366 pages, packs a wealth of vital, practical and life saving information.This work should be on the reading shelf of every woman and on the reading shelf of every man concerned about women.Remember, women are different than men and it is about time our health delivery system became fully aware of that fact. A knowing, educated patient, asking the right questions and demanding the correct answers and care will bring us much closer to an equitable system and we will all benefit from this. I do highly recommend this work!Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Eva Luna (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book is a very different approach to writing..."},{"Title":"Eva Luna (Spanish Edition)","review":"I loved the House of Spirits, and count it among my top favorites, but Eva Luna was disappointing.

EVA LUNA did not appear on the USA Today top 150 best sellers list, which was started four years after this book was published. However, four of the author's other novels have appeared on the list.EVA LUNA is the story of an impoverished, illegitimate servant girl, orphaned at age six, illiterate in her formative years for lack of formal education, who simply loves to tell stories and becomes a TV scriptwriter. She is mentored by the evasive ghost of her mother, an opportunistic godmother, a quirky woman who sleeps in a coffin and a confused female transvestite dressed as a woman. The time span is roughly three decades that include the Vietnam War, jet planes, soap operas and the United States meddling in Latin American affairs, which is perhaps not terribly definitive. The setting is supposedly the Caribbean, but the topography is reminiscent of tropical Peru with the politics of Colombia and the economy of Venezuela. The writing style is magical realism and the theme is melancholy.EVA LUNA is scrambled eggs with a dash of Tabasco, tropical fruit and an aphrodisiac, which turns out tasty and delectable. It reminds me of a quote attributed to Napoleon: You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs."},{"Title":"Eva Luna (Spanish Edition)","review":"Magical realism pushed to another level, it is difficult not to get entangled in this fabulous account of two different hemispheres.

My desire to purchase this book is based on an interest in sailing ships of this period and I had purchased the paper back version of this book. The drawings were too small and thus I decided to go to the next step and spend the money to get the best. I was not disappointed. The layout of the text starting from the choice of ship and Cook's organisation of the voyage through to the description of life on board and the technologies of the day gives a good foundation to understanding of the hardships of sailing those ships. The departure from England to the arrival off the Australian coast is covered in a fair amount of detail but the nitty gritty starts with the voyage along Australia's east coast. Here the detail is provided by the actual journal entries of Cook, Banks, Parkinson and others as well as the entries in the ship's log. Ray Parkin writes, after the journal and log entries, to explain certain terms and conditions of the time compared to the situation today and turns the somewhat dry eighteenth centaury language into clear and understandable live history.

Three cheers to Mr. Berry for his published novel."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Karol Borya lived through World War II, spending part of it in a Nazi prison camp. One night, Borya and his bunkmates were roused from their sleep to torture 3 german guards for information at the behest of a Nazi General. The conversation that Borya head that night would send him on a harrowing journey to find the famed Amber Room.Borya, now an old man in his 80s, has been keeping the secret of that night during WWII and his experiences looking for the Amber Room for most of his life. Borya hoped to spare his daughter Rachel from the danger that surrounded the hunt. But Borya is found dead, apparently murdered, and Rachel and her ex-husband stumble across the information regarding the Amber Room. Soon, they are on the trail of the infamous treasure, and their lives are on the line.\\"The Amber Room\\" is the second Steve Berry novel I have read, and the second time was most definitely not the charm. I find Berry's writing to be lackluster. His plot ideas are excellent and intriguing, but his execution of those wonderful ideas fall very flat. The plot for this novel was so contrived, the characters were not likeable, and overall this novel was just disappointing.I can't honestly say I would recommend this novel to anyone. I am not sure that I will attempt to read another Steve Berry novel myself."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"My interest was piqued after seeing the Amber Room on the Today Show. I had never before heard of this great treasure. After reading Berry's book, I wonder if this treasure is still out there for someone to find.The book is well researched and filled with excitement and suspense. I read it the first night."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Berry's first book, and look forward to more novels written by him...if he continues in this type of writing..Compares somewhat to DeVinci Code, not quite as detailed, or educational, due to too much romantic involvement between two main characters..and not enough descriptive writing regarding the now most interesting subjects, art and the Catholic artifacts."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"If you are looking for the best new book of the fall, this is it. In my opinion, Berry is the nations best new writer. He has written an international thriller that is a classic tale of suspense. His impeccable research into the history of the Amber Room took me to places I never knew existed. The thrill of the hunt for the Amber Room had me lost in time until I turned the last page. Let me assure thrill seekers, their year is not complete without this book."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"THE AMBER ROOM begins with concentration camp survivor Karol Borya being murdered by acquisitor Christian Knoll. From there, the bodies pile up like cord wood. Knoll works for Franz Fellner a member of a group called die Retter der Verlorenen Antiquitaten, the Retrievers of Lost Antiquities.Apparently Karol Borya knows too much about what happened to the Amber Room, but why would an investigator of lost antiquities destroy one of his only leads? Proper motivation is only one of the many problems I had with Perry's thriller.Knoll's main competition for the Amber Room is Suzanne Danzer, another acquisitor who works for another member of the Retrievers of Lost Antiquities, Ernst Loring.Two other characters complete the cast: Judge Rachel Cutler, Karol's daughter, and her ex-husband Paul travel to Germany to find the Amber Room after they discover clues in Karol's safety deposit box.Early on, Perry provides some historical background about the Amber Room. It was given to Peter the Great by Frederick William of Prussia to celebrate an alliance with Russia against Sweden. Peter's daughter, Empress Elizabeth, had it perfected at her summer palace, Tsarskoe Selo. During WWII, German art scroungers pilfered the Amber Room. It disappeared after WWII.The Retrievers of Lost Antiquities were nine of the wealthiest men in Europe. Industrialists, financiers, a land baron, and a doctor who would do anything to outdo each other.Suzanne Danzer and Christian Knoll act more like psychopaths than antiquities investigators. They just aren't believable, or interesting for that matter. \\"B\\" movies have more realistic characters. Perry doesn't help himself when he includes an early scene where a lawyer goes on an obscene rant in Rachel Cutler's chambers. She rightfully puts him in jail. For a couple of hours. I'm thinking disbarment would have been a more suitable punishment.Despite the above, I must admit, Perry does keep you turning pages. The romantics among us want to know whether Rachel and Paul will get back together, and although the real Amber Room, was never found, Perry uses poetic license to eventually reveal what happened to it."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"It is a sad state of affairs when you can tell that a book is being written with the expectation of it being turned into a movie. We probably have Stephen King to thank for this trend, but that is off the subject.This book started out decently enough. The Amber Room is still obscure enough in the U.S. that the historical background kept me interested--the first time. To have it repeated ad nauseum was a bit of overkill. One time for information, two times maybe to reinforce the point. More than that is just literary laziness. I got the feeling he kept repeating information in an attempt to make the book longer.The characters were paper thin and oh-so-cliched. The pretty heroine. The wistful ex-husband. The loyal father. The ruthless killers working for a \\"win at any cost\\" rich tycoons. The redneck thrown in for (I assume) comic relief. The problem is, the author didn't make us care about the heroes, or hate the villians. I just wanted the book to end. I didn't care how. For a story like this to be compelling, there should at least be a hint of some danger or intrigue. There wasn't. The characters stumble along from one mishap to the next with little problem or consequence of what occurred in the previous chapters. Everybody miraculously ends up in the same place, every time, and for some reason, they're all surprised by it every single time. In some cases with plot holes large enough to drive a truck through.My advice: Don't waste your time. Eventually it will be a movie starring Julianne Moore or Julia Roberts, and you can get through it in two hours instead of the hours of excruciating reading it takes to end up in a place you could see coming before you even read the back cover synopsis."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I had a hard time with this one. As a lover of amber and history, I was excited about The Amber Room immediately upon hearing of it. I bought it. After retrieving it from the elderly lady to whom I'd given it as a gift (She hadn't gotten around to reading it yet, thank goodness!), it took me six months to finish it. The first chapter about the events at Mauthausen Concentration Camp and Karol Borya was a great beginning. I was hooked and eager for more, but then it got slow-w-w. It wasn't until the author got back to the subject at hand, several chapters later, that my interest was rekindled. I found Christian Knoll, Suzanne Danzer and Monika Fellner to be so decadent and devoid of humanity that I could not identify with or feel any empathy for them at all. Karol Borya, Judge Rachel Cutler's father, was the character I cared about the most, and those of us who stuck with the story know what happens to him.I believe Steve Berry is better than this book. There should be enough genuine international intrigue surrounding the Amber Room to write an inspired, even sexy, international thriller about a fascinating subject. However, resorting to so much gratuitous and violent sexual content demeans a good body of work.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The Amber Room starts off slow, revealing its status as a first novel by an author who hasn't yet learned to pick an choose his scenes. Fortunately Mr. Berry learns as the book progresses, so this novel slowly gets better with each page. To that end, the second half is a distant cousin to The DaVinci Code, explaining Dan Brown's endorsemet.I'd recommend The Amber Room to people who enjoy novels with a lot of descriptive detail or to those who would like to learn about the amber room, and likewise discourage those who want a fast-paced breezy read.All will learn something reading this book, but like a tour through a museaum, most will be instantly forgotten."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"To borrow an old radio show title, \\"I Love A Mystery\\"! For me, the mystery is even more intriguing when it is based on an actual occurrence, a crime that to date remains unsolved. So often in the case of an event that has garnered much newsprint, many will offer solutions or imagined scenarios based on the incident. Such is the case with this suspenseful debut novel, superbly read by actor/writer Scott Brick.In actuality, the Amber Room was a hall like structure with walls covered in amber and semiprecious stones. Presented by Germany to Russia's Czar Peter the Great in 1716, it was lost when the Germans overran Russia during World War II. Theories abound as to its fate, and Steve Berry's well thought tale brings it to the fore once again.Judge Rachel Cutler is one tough cookie as we learn in the opening of The Amber Room. She's good at what she does and enjoys doing it. Her father has what he believes are clues as to the location of the Amber Room and when he dies unexpectedly, the secrets he has kept are made known.Cutler doesn't believe for a moment that her father's death was due to natural causes, so she and her ex husband, Paul, go to Germany in search of answers. Little do they know that they're not alone in their quest - others seek to discover the whereabouts of the Amber Room, including two unscrupulous collectors who compete to find lost or stolen pieces of art.Thus begins an exciting danger filled chase throughout Europe. Stakes are high and lives imperiled in this quest for a treasure. Narrator Scott Brick has a mantel crowded with awards for his voice performances. One more may well be on its way for his reading of The Amber Room.Highly recommended.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Being that this was Steve Berry's first book and I read his books out of order, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was as well-written as his more recent outings. I read Berry's other three books before reading this and the only fault that I can find in this book is that he has outdone himself with each subsequent release. Basically, because he has gotten so good at the thriller genre, he makes his older books seem a little less impressive; thankfully, this book was still excellent. It kept me on edge from start to finish. This book was just another example of his unique writing style that keeps the reader entertained and enthralled from cover to cover.I cannot wait for Berry's next book. I am now a life-long Steve Berry fan.An excellent read with unexpected plot twists, vivid descriptions and excellent character development. Just shy of a 5/5 I would rate this as a 4.5/5"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Fact: Three hundred years ago, Frederick of Prussia commissioned it; for centuries, the Romanovs cherished and protected it; Hitler seized it; Goring coveted it; the Russians wanted it back...but in the final days of World War II, the fabulous Amber Room was disassembled and vanished. Fiction: in the grand tradition of Ludlum and Le Carre, Steve Berry's engrossing debut novel presupposes the possibility of the Room's resurfacing almost sixty years later as the object of a killer-take-all, international treasure hunt with its naive protagonists, Judge Rachel Cutler and her ex-husband Paul, being inexorably drawn deeper and deeper into the dark and deadly world of art collectors who will stop at nothing to further their mania. Rachel and Paul still have a live-and-let-live relationship, so when her adored father, Russian emigre/Holocaust survivor Karol Borya, dies suddenly under questionable circumstances, Rachel asks Paul for help in settling his estate. Borya has left her an enigmatic legacy: letters and documentation which identify and speak of but warn her against the Amber Room...a tentative connecting link between it and the recent, inexplicable deaths of Paul's parents...and the unavoidable conclusion that Borya and at least one of his contemporaries knew where the priceless amber panels comprising the Room had been hidden by the Nazis. Was Borya murdered for this knowledge? Determined to find some answers, Rachel impulsively sets out to try and locate her father's old friend and is manipulated into acquiring a treacherous new one in her quest for the truth: amoral Christian Knoll, hired assassin for one of the ringleaders in a highly-secret, international art cartel aka The Retrievers of Lost Antiquities. While Rachel is learning a terrifying lesson about trust, Paul has an equally unfortunate encounter with exotic Suzanne Danzer, Knoll's bitter enemy and rival. Convinced that Rachel is in real trouble, Paul follows her to Germany. Reluctantly they join forces with likeable but unscrupulous entrepreneur, Wayland Drew (who has his own plans for the Room), and together they manage to track it to a cavern deep in the Harz Mountains only to discover that they have arrived too late...the panels have disappeared again...and the trail that will eventually lead them to the legendary artifact in situ is both perilous and bloody. \\"Over my dead body\\" acquires a whole new meaning within the walls of the Amber Room.It's really hard to believe that this is a first novel. Its fast-moving, complex plot is tightly and beautifully structured for maximum emotional impact; the central characters (both heroic and villainous) seem totally real within the context of the storyline, and its high-powered combination of fact with fiction overlaid with romance and genuinely chilling suspense make for a real nail-biter of a reading experience. I'm a thriller fan, fairly choosy about what I expect from the genre, and I found it very hard to put this book down. I'm looking forward to reading more by multi-talented Steve Berry...and, hopefully, soon!"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The Amber Room was a treasure looted by the Nazis and lost during the end of WW2. Worth an on-line search to understand the background, it's quite interesting.And Steve Berry's debut novel is a thriller based around the story. While there are similarities to the many types of book dealing with lost treasures, it was refreshing and interesting to have the WW2 elements and for it not to be the usual search for Jesus' sandal, Hercules lunch box or the lost MacDonald's of Atlantis. Yep, we do have a couple involved (I think that must be in the unofficial rules) and ruthless killers, but this is actually well written and well researched. The \\"suddely, as rare things will, it vanished\\" is a quote from Browning and is used during the book, it's an apt and appropriate quote.US Judge follows the trail of the Amber Room once her father is killed and she discovers he was involved in the search for the room at the back end of the war. It appears he had a secret that he kept until his death. Judge's estranged husband joins her as they follow the trail through the types of adventures and close calls that we have now come to expect of these books.Well written and quite good fun if you like these kind of things."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book offers an intriguing start. But the story is quickly unraveled by the \\"convenience of coincidence\\" to tie characters and situations together to further develop the storyline. Too many coincidences and predictable events ultimately make the storyline appear like a collage of several other novels. The ending was a huge disappointment - a heartless killer suddenly becomes more obsessed with a woman's body than completing his mission; a divorced couple who seemingly have nothing in common except loneliness are suddenly madly in love (again); a man who has been \\"protecting\\" the Amber Room for decades decides to shoot a pursuer in the shoulder at close range rather than kill as planned. Many entertaining chapters, but the story quickly becomes a fairy-tale rather than an adventure novel."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This was my summer read and I loved every second of it.

At first, the subject Berry chose to write about had seemed exciting and original. The first chapter was compelling, and it drew me into the book. I settled in for what I thought would be a can't-put-down mystery. However, by chapter three, this novel developed into a very bad version of \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\" The characters reminded me of a hodge-podge of action movie personas. The plot was over dramatic. Besides the topic, this book lacked originality.I would have enjoyed this book more if the characters were original, the events described were more believable, and the overall tone of the book was much less Hollywood."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Steve Berry has written an excellent debut novel that rivals Grisham's, Patterson's and Clancy's thrillers. His presentation of the historical aspects included in the novel leaves the reader hurriedly turning to the next page. I found the knowledge of the Amber Room fascinating. This was a part of history that I was not familiar with. It is hard to believe that Berry has never been published before. I can't wait for his next book to be released."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Karol \\"Ears\\" Borya had survived many months in the Mauthausen Concentration Camp during the Second World War. It was there that he first heard mention of The Amber Room, and after his release from the camp he went searching for the treasure. It was never found, however, and forty years later Borya is convinced that the past is behind him - until one day, he gets a visit from Christian Knoll, an \\"Acquisitor\\" interested in information about The Amber Room.Soon after, Borya is found dead, and it's up to his daughter and her ex-husband to undertake a dangerous trip to discover the secret of the long lost artifact. Add into the mix two very dangerous \\"Acquisitors\\" who will do anything to obtain the treasure for their employers, and you have the makings of a captivating thriller.Unfortunately, Steve Berry's debut novel reads like an unpolished first attempt. Full of plot inconsistencies, a great deal of repetition, one-dimensional, unengaging characters and descriptions better suited to a travelogue, THE AMBER ROOM is frustrating to read. None of the characters are in the least bit appealing, which results in complete apathy for the \\"climax\\" of the novel.The pace is slow throughout, and the plot lacks any real plot twists or unexpected surprises which are much needed in this otherwise bland work of fiction.What would have been an interesting non-fiction account of the disappearance of a precious artifact falls flat as an attempt at a mystery novel."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"See storyline above.This being Steve Berry's first novel, I think he did a fine job.A well researched story about the Amber Room along with an illuminating look at the world of treasure hunters and lost treasures makes for interesting reading. It also makes a good thriller.Don't expect a Dan Brown novel just because he wrote a positive blurb.Though not as riveting as some, this novel kept me entertained.I will read his next novel knowing it will be as good or better than the first.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Mr. Berry has written a book that combines historical facts with a compelling storyline. His knowledge of the history of the Amber Room and the facts of the time has enabled him to write a thrilling story. I highly recommend this book and look forward to the next book from this first-time author."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I spent so much time reading this book in the bathroom, the only quiet place in my house, that my children thought I was suffering from food poisoning. I have always been fascinated by lost treasures and especially the Amber Room. The attention to detail of the characters and exotic locations made me feel like I was there and during many parts of the book left me physically and emotionally drained. Very few books of fiction can capture my interest unless it is sprinkled with nonfiction accounts of people, places, or things. This book was not just a joy to read but I got a history lesson at the same time."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This is a book that I should have gotten through in 2 days. Yet after 2 weeks I still can't seem to care enough to finish. The subject of the Amber Room is interesting. But the writing and plot are predictable, repetitive and sophomoric at times. The characters are one-dimensional, and there are some odd mistakes that his editor should have caught. (Once inside the closed cave door, how *did* the character manage to redrape the outside chains as to make the entrance still appear locked from the outside? Was the rushing river hundreds of meters or hundreds of feet below the 3 story church veranda? Depends on which page you're on.)Yeah, petty, but I'd rather be scratching my head over am intriguing plot twist, but since there are none, I got bogged down in stuff like that."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book is typical of modern American fiction: Predictable. The protaganists, Rachel and Paul Cutler, are a divorced couple. It's obvious from the outset that these two will wind up finding out that they really love each other. Boring.And then there's the long passages of European Art History/Nazi Art Theft History. I'm an avid reader of just about anything I can get my hands on, and very few pieces of writing put me to sleep on the commuter train as quickly as these passages did. I love history, and I love fiction, but this author put them together in a way that isn't even remotely interesting."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This is quite an engrossing novel by the author of \\"The Romanov Prophecy.\\" Much like the later Romanov book, it is carefully researched so that historically (to a certain point)it is factually accurate to the smallest detail. As the author writes in an afterword, \\"Of course the primary goal of a novel is to entertain, but I also wanted to accurately inform.\\" The novel's focus is the breathtaking Amber Room contained in the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoe Selo, near St. Petersburg, which was removed during World War II and subsequently disappeared. Fortunately, the Russians had photographed the room before dismantling it and if you visit the palace today, these extensive photos are on display and have been utilized in reconstructing the room. So, the mystery of the vanishing amber sheets used in the room is the driving force in the novel. It jumps from a concentration camp, to current day Atlanta, to Germany and the Czech republic. It is somewhat violent and more sex intrudes than in the Romanov novel. While it is seriously contrived at points, so was James Bond and this book is just as much a page turner as Ian Fleming every turned out. So, just sit back and start reading and you will soon find yourself engrossed in this fascinating yarn."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I too bought this book due to the endorsement from Dan Brown on the cover. I thought it unusual on some levels and interesting regarding the lost Amber Room. However, the writing is inconsistent in parts. And, Steve Berry obviously has a problem with women. His main character Rachel is an unlikeable bitch called the \\"Ice Queen\\" by her co-workers. As a judge, she pisses off both police and attorneys and has few supporters. She's treated her kind ex-husband (who is still holding a torch) like crap. She can't hold her tongue and makes one bitchy comment after another..and then says she doesn't know why she has to act like that. I think Berry enjoyed creating such a detestable character and no surprise when she was set up for a rape. Other female characters are also abused in other scenes. I found it disturbing and a little sick."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"My wife liked this book, it kept her interested the whole time. It reminded her a movie (like one of the reviews mentioned that it is like a movie script): a lot of action, fast moving, chapters end at the most interesting part then continue in a few chapters, a lot of fiction, exaduration, and history - she loves history! It was easy and plesant to read - for her :)"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book has a lot to recommend it: action and suspense, a plethora of interesting characters, and a mystery surrounding the disappearance of a great work of art in the waning years of World War II. I've always had a soft spot for fiction centered around great art & literature; in this case, the amber room, a Russian treasure commissioned by the tsars and composed of a room of panels made of--no shock here--amber. Even better when it's a piece of art I know little about so I feel like I'm learning something as I read. This one fit the bill.My only complaint is that a book like this forces me to suspend my disbelief a little farther than my usual wont. Murders spread across America and Europe with the police almost completely kept in the dark, when they show any interest at all. An estranged couple stumbling upon a great mystery and outwitting amoral professional killers multiple times. It boggles the mind. I don't mind stetching myself a bit. Secret societies and the innocent everyman taking on the rich & careless make for great reading. But an author does have to be careful, I think, on how much he asks of his reader.Still, why complain? There's plenty of fun to be had here. If this is not a perfect book, it is a good one and a solid addition to its genre."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Excellent parts: the Amber Room mystery itself, travels in and around Russian (current & ex-territories), World War II stories.Other than the above, all other seemed unnecessary and boring. I actually picked up this novel cause Dan Brown put his remarks on it. If the Amber Room subject is to be written more adeptly, I think it has a chance to become blockbuster novel and movie, alike. Not the case with this version. Waste of time reading. Sorry, 2 stars only."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I know nothing about art. Well, almost nothing. I have this wonderfully huge coffee table book that reproduces the work of Hieronymus Bosch and that I consult on occasion for inspiration (I never claimed to be wrapped too tightly). I also have a basement full of \\"sequential art\\" --- that's what fans of comic books call them when they wish to be pretentious. That's it. So I didn't even know there was such a thing as the Amber Room. It is accordingly a measure of the strength of this fine first novel by Stephen Berry that while reading it I spent hours on the Internet delving further into the history of it, and will continue to do so.The Amber Room --- the art object, that is --- has not received much press in the United States but is very well known in Europe. It is a work of art with a rich and enigmatic history. It is, in actuality, a room constructed out of amber, with artwork carved into the amber. Berry drops little nuggets of information about amber throughout THE AMBER ROOM, and for those of us who thought amber was only good for trapping flies, it's fascinating info. But THE AMBER ROOM is not an art or science textbook. The Amber Room of history and of this novel disappeared during World War II while in the possession of Nazi Germany. There are several theories regarding what happened to it. It may have been destroyed, it may have been hidden too well, or it may be in the hands of a private collector. No one really knows for sure.Berry takes this mystery and cleverly uses it to build a novel around. THE AMBER ROOM involves an unlikely protagonist, Atlanta Judge Rachel Cutler, and her attorney ex-husband Paul. Rachel has an interesting connection to the Amber Room: her father, a White Russian who was taken prisoner by the German Army during World War II, has some clues as to the location of the Amber Room that he has kept to himself for decades. When he dies suddenly and mysteriously, the information that he kept hidden is revealed.Cutler, doubting that her father's death was an accident, travels to Germany with Paul sensing that danger is following close behind. They are unaware that they are on a collision course with two art collectors who have made the acquisition of stolen or supposedly lost art treasures a competition, and that they both will acquire what they seek by any means necessary. Berry leads the Cutlers, and his readers, on a thrilling chase through a Europe that is off the guidebook path and through the world of clandestine art collecting before revealing the surprising final fate of the Amber Room.Berry's writing is surprisingly surefooted and confident as he takes a subject that is of limited and specialized interest and uses it as a vehicle for a thrilling debut novel with certain widespread appeal. There are not many writers working today with the ability to do this --- Jeffery Deaver comes most immediately to mind --- but Berry certainly joins those talented ranks with THE AMBER ROOM. Let's look, and hope, for more from Berry soon.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub from Bookreporter.com"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"An excellent combination of true history woven neatly together with exciting, fast moving action.

What was Dan Brown thinking putting his endorsement on the cover? Some of the problems I had with this novel: the characters we were supposed to like were consistently making completely unrealistically stupid choices; the characters we were supposed to hate were 100% one-dimensional; entire chapters slogged along (I was skimming by this point) without even one mention of the main characters, particularly near the end of the book; the editing was terrible, with many errors and spelling of names changing throughout (sometimes Monika was Monica, etc.) This book started out with some promise, but the only truly interesting character was killed off.

All of his characters are stereotypes and his female characters (in nearly all his books) are all the same bitchy, arrogant, sexpots who need a man to rescue them. The main female character in this book was about the most objectionable. She is a high powered judge (so of course she has let the power go to her head and it has ruined her marriage to the likable attorney.) However, after she is drugged, raped and saved by her ex husband she realizes she should give up her high powered career, go to work for her husband,and concentrate on being a wife and mother. Wow -- the more-powerful-and successful-than her spouse is given what she had coming (a rape --which is just a man asserting his power over a woman) and then she all of a sudden realizes her place in the world. Nice. If this kind of characterization was an isolated incident in his books, I'd say, \\"Overlook it as bad writing\\" but since it is sort of the norm, I think Mr. Berry might need some professional help.BTW-- The virgin Mary comes off pretty good in The Third Secret so it isn't ALL his female characters, but any character less than the mother of God is characterized very badly."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Online reviewer Amorae pretty much says it all, but I would add that the gratuitous sex scenes interrupt what plot Berry has going. The descriptions are predictable and banal and their inclusion seems counterproductive for the author if he wishes to reach a wide audience of male and famale mystery novel readers. The topic of The Amber Room is certainly intriguing, but it deserves a better mystery woven around its disappearance."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Divorced judge Rachel Cutler has her life in order; she loves her job, her children, and remains friends with her ex-husband. Everything seems perfect until the mysterious death of her father exposes secrets that will have her questioning all she thought she knew about him.A survivor of World War II, Karol Bora has lived with a secret all his life, now after his death the secrets of the past will come crashing into the future sending his daughter Rachel into a spiral of deception and intrigue.Desperate for the answers surrounding the death of her father, as well as the information he held on a secret called the Amber Room, Rachel takes off for Germany, with her ex-husband Paul closely behind her, and within minutes of her arrival becomes the target of an evil force hell bent on finding the treasure of the Amber Room.\`The Amber Room' is a well written, expertly paced, and highly original thriller. From the first page to the explosive climax readers will be held captive by action, suspense, great characters, and masterful plot twists. Steve Berry has written an excellent debut novel, one that should fly up the bestseller lists, and firmly place him among the elite authors of international intrigue.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I know this is a mystery thriller, but does the author have to make it so violent and bloody? I enjoyed the plot and the history that goes behind it but the vivid descriptions of the killings and rape just didn't sit well with me. It's actually pretty disturbing. I wouldn't recommend reading this book as a weekend reading."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book is really only worth 2 1/2 stars. Rachel Cutler is a prominent judge in Atlanta. Her ex-husband, Paul, is a lawyer there. Her immigrant father had always talked in vague terms about the Amber Room. After he was murdered, letters were found about it, including a warning for Rachel to forget about finding it. So she runs off to Germany to find it and Paul soon follows her.The story drags on, dead bodies pile up, and Rachel and Paul admit they're in way over their heads. This tale is heavy on WWII history, short on suspense, and full of unbelievable situations."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book was very entertaining indeed. I have now read all of Steve Berry's books and I have to say the Third Secret was my favorite. This author is very good. I recommend all 4 of his books to everyone.

Get one, you won't be disappointed.Paula"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"A stunning range of characters mixed with an enlightened look at history, all jumbled together to make a delectable detailed adventure."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"A very interesting book with enough truth in the story to make you think. We ;must rember that it is still fiction."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"As with any book there are parts you like and parts you don't. I thought this was slow to start and then a bit predictable before the end, but I did enjoy it"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"this is one of Berry's better stories, interest is quickly aroused and maintained, however it follows Berry's plot, an ill prepared protagonist, an almost superhuman antagonist and a well forecast outcome. But the plot is well developed and leads well up to its conclusion."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I enjoy Russian history a lot, so when a friend lent me this book, I was eager to read it despite it not being a genre I generally read. I'm not even sure what to call it. Fiction Thriller? It's very much in the vein of The DaVinci code. I don't know if that book's popularity has created its own sub-genre yet or not.I thought Berry's prose was pretty tight. It was a fast read with a spare style that I quite enjoyed. I will say that it was obviously written by a man. And I don't mean that in any sort of derogatory way. It's just that I generally read women authors and stylistically (in the stuff I've read), the gender divide in prose is pretty pronounced. At one point, he used the term \\"inviting crotch\\" to describe a woman's appeal. That did make me cringe. But I'm also not too fond of \\"velvet swords\\" either.I thought the history of the Amber Room was handled very well within the plot of the book. It felt as though Berry really went out of his way to include a good deal of historical fact and as someone who enjoys Russian history, I liked that. As a reader, I enjoyed that Berry managed to convey the information without having his characters turn into talking heads.The fictional story itself was okay. Not great. Not awful, just okay, though it did really wane toward the end of the book. And let me clarify that by wane, I mean in interest. I felt the book went from having some pretty compelling, realistic characters to being off the charts absurd action.The book ostensibly centers around the Cutler family, Rachel and Paul (divorced), their children and both of their deceased (and possibly murdered) parents. Truth be told, the Cutlers don't get the majority of the plot time. There is a lot of plot involving this secret society of European billionaire art collectors and their staff.All of the connections between the characters were messy. It seemed there was a push-pull between every set of characters. I'm not sure if that was realistic, or just sloppy. Most of the characters were working on their own agendas. I found it interesting that while the male characters could quite cheerfully smile and laugh with each other and then turn around and stab one another in the back, none of them ever seemed to take it personally. The female characters were every bit as self-involved and murderous, but the readers were often privy to them thinking of each other as bitches and whores. That didn't particularly impress me.The historical perspective on the Amber Room was well done. All in all, it was a decent read even if I did roll an eye or two toward the end."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"In this, his debut novel, the author delivers a highly entertaining thriller that will keep the reader compulsively turning the pages. As with all of his books, history plays an important role in the theme of the book. This one focuses a lost treasure known as the \\"Amber Room\\".I myself had no idea what the Amber Room was until I read this book. In 1716, the King of Prussia made a gift of the Amber Room to the then Tsar of Russia, Peter the Great. Apparently, they were panels of amber that were used to wall an entire room. Peter the Great kept the amber panels in storage, until about 1746, when his daughter, the Empress Elizabeth, decided to use the panels to wall a study in the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. In 1755, Elizabeth moved the Amber Room from the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg to what would later be known as the Catherine Palace, where the amber panels were installed. The Amber Room was embellished with semi-precious stones and perfected, a masterpiece of Baroque artistry.It was there, at Catherine Palace, that the Amber Room remained until 1941, when the Nazis invaded Russia and reclaimed the Amber Room as theirs. The Nazi's had a proclivity for acquiring great works of art from those whom they conquered. At Hitler's express direction, the Amber Room was dismantled, panel by panel, and twenty tons of the precious amber panels were shipped to Germany by truck and rail. The amber panels were eventually installed in Konigsberg Castle, where they remained until early 1945. After Allied bombardment and the march of the Soviet army upon Konigsberg, the amber panels were once again removed, crated, and put on a truck convoy, where they were to have been taken to safety. To this day, its fate remains unknown, as the amber panels were never again seen.It is around this intriguing real life mystery that the author builds his story. Atlanta judge, Rachel Cutler, and her ex-husband, Paul, get swept away by international intrigue, when Karol Borya, her eighty three year old father dies unexpectedly, leaving behind some intriguing information about the Amber Room. Rachel decides to pick up the trail her father left and head off to Germany, unaware that her movements are being tracked by two competing, ruthless individuals, Suzanne Danzer and Christian Knoll, who are also looking to solve the mystery of the Amber Room. They each hold the position of Aquisitor, a person who works for an individual member of a consortium of nine wealthy individuals known as the Retrievers of Lost Antiquities. The Acquisitor is the one who recovers stolen art treasures on behalf of a member of this consortium for that individual's private collection. They will stop at nothing to get that which they seek. Paul, sensing something is not quite right, joins Rachel in Germany. A dangerous cat and mouse game ensues, as they try to make sense of the hand that fate has dealt them.There are many twists and turns in this action packed thriller, and a lot of historical information is woven into the fabric of this intricately plotted novel. I was hooked once I read the gripping prologue that sets the tone for the book. I found that I simply could not stop turning the pages of this engrossing thriller. This is a plot driven book, so while it may fall a little short in the area of character development, it does not for one moment diminish the enjoyment that the reader will get from reading this immensely interesting work of fiction. It is simply an amazing debut novel. Those who enjoyed \\"The Da VInci Code\\" will, undoubtedly, enjoy this book, as well."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Historical fiction pieces are my favorite niche novel's and this one rates pretty well, but a full notch below the likes of Arturo Perez-Reverte, Iain Pears, and Anne Perry. The three mentioned above setting scenes and locations much better in opinion. Then again this was a debut novel, and I will probably check out another Berry book to read. I would like to add two things that I not seen mentioned in other reviews. First is that the chapters in this book are very short, which is great for someone like myself who has thirty minutes during lunch to get my reading in. The second is that I thought the way one key plot twist was revealed to Christian Knoll was very uninspired, but did not take away from a otherwise fast paced book. Writers notes at the end of the book were also very revealing."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"How true. And how sad.These are the last five words in the book, and they pretty much sum up this 'novel of suspense'. The Amber Room was built over a period of years in the Catherine Palace in St. Petersberg. Originally started by Frederick of Prussia, it was finished at the behest of Peter the Great's daughter Elisabeth. During WWII the Germans dismantled the room and brought it back to Konigsberg (Kaliningrad), from where it disappeared near the end of the war. Over the last sixty years there has been all kinds of speculation as to what happened to it. Most likely, it was sold off piece by piece.This basis of this story is that it was hidden in the mining tunnels of the Harz Mountains, in what became East Germany. With the unification of Germany, it is now easier to explore this area even though some of the mines are still booby-trapped with explosives. Once again, there is a group of ultra-rich art collectors who vie for stolen treasures amongst themselves. Their associates are called 'Acquirers' and do all the dirty work.OK, quickly, two americans from Atlanta get involved through her father who was part of a soviet group looking for looted treasures after the war. She's a judge, he's a lawyer, their divorced. Bad people, Czechs and Germans, looking for the room. Chase chase, bang bang, people dead all around. Americans triumph, room returned to Russia, bad guys all dead. Judge and lawyer remarry.Would make a weak 'movie of the week', maybe something for the 'Lifetime' channel."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The Amber Room was an OK read. I enjoyed the Third Secret better. I am really looking forward to reading the Templar Legacy. Mr. Berry improves his stories with each new book."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The Amber Room is one of history's greatest treasures. It disappeared from the Soviet Union during W.W.II. It is worth a fortune and is actively being sought after by two collectors of stolen art, Ernest Loring and Franz Fellner. Through their loyal assassins and employees, Christian Knoll for Fellner and Suzanne Danzer for Loring, they dangerously battle each other for clues to the room's location. Their search takes them to Atlanta, Georgia where Karol Borya lives. Karol is said to know something about the location of the Amber Room. A secret he has kept from his daughter, Judge Rachel Cutler. When Karol dies suspiciously, Rachel travels to Europe to seek answers. Pursuing her is her ex-husband Paul who wants to protect her while Knoll and Danzer want to do her harm. Unknowingly, Rachel walks into a fatally dangerous situation.THE AMBER ROOM is an epic thriller. It is very well done with all the elements that make it an excellent example of what is good in the sub genre. Characters are well developed but exaggerated as would be proper to make them larger than life. Exotic locales throughout Europe give the aire of elegance The villains are evil and will stop at nothing to possess the Amber Room. The problem with this debut effort is the sheer volume of the book. To call it merely lengthy would be an exaggeration. The book has weight- much of it excessive. The plot, though written with a rapid pacing, meanders. Mr. Berry, however, has written a superior thriller and with some tightening of his plot should prove to be a highly successful thriller writer. He is definitely one to watch."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Steve Berry delights his readers with this fast paced novel with exotic venues, intiguing history, and a suspenseful storyline. I had the pleasure of reading this book while crossing the country to California most recently and found this time to be one of the best parts of my trip. Kudos to Mr. Berry, the book moves with the same pace as the works of another attorney, John Grisham. Great Job Steve."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"During World War II, the Nazis stripped the incredibly complex relief designed panels crafted from the Amber Room of St. Petersburg, Russia's Catherine Palace. Now decades later few survivors know what the Nazi art vampires did with the precious panels made from Baltic amber, but concentration camp survivor Karol Borya knows a few secrets about the lost set, but others are aware of that. Agents of those who want ownership of the precious panels kill him.Karol's daughter, Atlanta judge Rachel Cutler, enlists her ex-husband Paul to help her learn why her father was murdered in Europe. They head to Germany where they soon stumble into a deadly race between two wealthy rivals intent of owning the panels to reconstruct their own Amber Room. Both sides are willing to kill the amateur Americans to win the race.This is an exciting by the numbers thriller that incorporates much, if not all, of the known facts about the Amber Room. That makes for a two edged sword as readers will be fascinated with what Steve Berry provides about the panels and the room they created, but also will find the action abruptly sidebarred as if the author could not decide between nonfiction and a thriller. Still the characters make for a delightful ensemble, the historical tidbits enticing, and the thrills fun so that the audience receives a solid somewhat disrupted tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"... There are many other books on the market addressing similar topics, virtually all are better than this book. Far too many gratuitous (not to mention annoying) sex scenes, far too little plot development. A huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book is a fast read, entertaining, and is not a bad first attempt at writing a novel. I agree with some of the other reviewers, though, Berry seems to have major, MAJOR issues with the opposite sex. I do not like his female characters in this book, but still do not want to see them raped or killed so violently. One thing that has definitely improved over time with Berry's subsequent books, however, is that he doesn't kill off his most valuable and most interesting characters right away. In the Amber Room, unfortunately, Berry quickly and violently kills off the two most intriguing characters, the two old men who could offer the most help in finding this treasure. I have read several of Berry's books and I always ask myself, why do his protagonists (and his villians) have such incredibly bad judgement? They are unbelievably stupid people. If I were Berry, I would ask a friend to read these books before I submitted them to the publisher, you know, to get their opinion. Sometimes I just have to laugh and shake my head at the stupidity of his characters, and I somehow don't think Berry intended for them to be funny! (Sorry Steve!) I will keep reading Berry's books though, and pray that he eventually gets it right."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This was my first Steve Berry Book and I loved it. It was intriguing and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"More thriller than mystery, Berry's debut novel feels fairly familiar, but adds some interesting aspects. The historical, World War II angle, along with the more legendary mystery of the Amber Room itself certainly is a unique frame for what would otherwise be a rather cliched thriller. The characters, though they don't feel particularly convincing as parents or credible in their careers, somehow still manage to be just engaging enough to keep you interested in what will happen to them. The romantic thread, though also not very believable, makes a nice touch and rounds the book out to appeal to a wider base of thriller fans. It's an interesting premise and though its execution certainly isn't flawless, for a fast and fun read, it fits the bill. Perfect for a plane ride or a beach read, I will be keeping an eye out to see what Berry follows this debut up with."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This is a great book, you are hooked from the 1st page, I even went on the internet in search of the Amber room and saw the only original picture of it. He is such a good writer, all his material is great."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"\\"The Amber Room' starts very well - its premises are to be found in the history of the end of WW2 and they set the stage for a modern day thriller that takes us over the whole Europe in search of a lost art treasure looted by the Nazis. Rival art bounty chasers fight one another in a lethal competition that engulfs also a broken couple of American lawyers. It is when we get to these 'positive' characters that the flaws of Berry's writing start to show up, or maybe it's his lack of experience. There are also some historical research flaws. While the Nazi period is well reasearched and known by the author the more recent Eastern European history seems to be less familiar to Berry - a big industrialist and weapons manufacturer could not have kept his business during Communist rule as one of the vilains of the story does, he would have simply put to jail and killed or let die there as an enemy capitalist while his property and business would have been confiscated.By the end of the book the logic of the story is also fading, the characters behave too much in an expected manner, and the ending lacks credibility. I am a fan of the historical thriller genre, and the subjects of Steve Berry's books seemed all appealing to me - so I bought his first four books - but now after reading this first I think that I should have been more cautious. Or maybe, the flaws of this book are caused mainly by his lack of experience at debut.

Another great read!Prince Michael Romanoff Ilyinsky"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"First, a rule of thumb. Consider any recommendation from another author -- I don't care how much you like him -- as a negative. When a book is so desperate for positive press that it puts blurbs from other authors on the cover, I mark it down in my mind. Really good books will usually have a review from the NY Times, or another major publication. The second tier of review is smaller newspapers or professional review publications like Kirkus. Don't think you are going to get a Tom Clancey or Steven King novel because they are quoted positively.The book itself is not very good, in my opinion. The characters are shallow even by the standards of a suspense/thriller genre novel. They all have larger-than-life characteristics -- remorseless killers with special talents, etc. Think &quot;Robert Ludlum&quot; here and you won't be far wrong. If you are a big Ludlum fan, you will probably like &quot;Amber Room&quot;. The plot is not bad, and the setting is pretty good.There is something else that really irritates me about The Amber Room, which is the two-paragraph specific descriptions of cities, hotels, restaurants, etc. I once heard this called the &quot;Form 1040 School of Literature&quot; -- authors do it to justify deducting their holidays from their income taxes. Sometimes, of course, a thorough description of a city can be both fascinating and important -- just think of John LeCarre's Berlin, or even Elmore Leonard's Miami/Detroit. But here, it is nothing but a couple of paragraphs awkwardly inserted into the narrative."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Berry's book is lengthy and tedious, with far too much historical enlightenment and not nearly enough character plot. The few central members of his cast become stale about a third of the way into the book, leaving the reader to question whether the rest of The Amber Room deserves the time and effort necessary to finish reading the novel. With two other books by the same title available for mass consumption, one might also question if redundancy is beginning to take hold."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Just finished The Amber Room and enjoyed it very much.

In Romanov, the fact that the children of the last Tsar may have survived; in Rozabal the fact that Jesus may have children in India who are Islamic terrorists; In Amber, the possibility that exquisite art panels from Catherine's palace in Russia may survive.

We've seen a lot of these lately, and I've always enjoyed Steve Berry's books. His writing has progressed through each novel he's put out, but the Amber Room is only his 2nd book, and wasn't as strong as say, The Templar Legacy. I enjoyed the Amber Room as it was not a story I was familiar with. Plus I love the mystery behind Nazi pilfered art during WWII. There were great descriptors about how the Nazi's affected post-war art and antiques and the mystery behind the Amber Room, which disappeared at the end of the war. It included a good deal of historical locations, and plenty of action with a high body count, but there were some moderately corny parts. Our heroes Rachel and Paul are divorced, but their inner dialogues are contemplating their relationship throughout the entire novel.

There's just something missing."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"First off, I find it rather funny that people criticize the book for its historical accuracy or other such items, given that it's quite obviously a work of fiction designed as escapist entertainment. To that end, it succeeds despite its too-perfect characters and more-than-unlikely action sequences.I'm not going to regurgitate the plot, but I will say that Berry does an excellent job of describing the various European settings and the art pieces included in the book. The premise itself isn't completely original, but it's still interesting. Characterization is a bit of a weak spot in the book, with beautiful villains, the divorced couple that still loves each other, and the redneck explorer. However, that can be forgiven since the book is not about action more than character development.If you're looking for a complex literary thriller, you're likely to be disappointed.

I'd never heard of the amber room, and I learned enough to make me search out more information. Granted, the writing is not exactly Dickens, but when I want to read Great Literature, I read the Greats.People have a tendency to want to group novels rather than to take each story on its own merits. I've seen this book compared to \\"The DaVinci Code\\". I recognize the comparison, since its a mystery/thriller set in the art world, but that's where the similarities end. If you liked \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" you might like this book, but if you're someone who has the need to compare everything and rank preferences, I can't say which is \\"better\\".If I were required to complain about something, it might be that the bad guys (as in many stories) are more interesting than the good guys. I really didn't care too much about what happened to the protagonists, but I did find myself intrigued by the cat and mouse game played by the acquisitors. The concept of a group of Europeans sending operatives all over the world to obtain treasures that have already been stolen is intriguing. I'd like to see it explored further. Maybe in a future Berry book."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Steve Berry weaves a fictional thriller around the true saga of the famous Russian Amber Room, and provides a real treat for his readers.Originally in the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoe Selo, the Amber Room was a true wonder. The wall panels were made of amber, pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle. During World War II, German soldiers made off with the panels and the decorative items inside (also made of amber). They have never been discovered, and their disappearance remains one of the great mysteries of the war.Rachael Cutler is a judge in Atlanta, Georgia and her father, Karol Borya, was originally part of a Soviet group trying to find the Amber Room and other antiquities stolen by the Nazi's during the war. When her father dies under suspicious circumstances, he leaves her clues about the location of the Amber Room. Unfortunately, two unsavory characters are also involved in the search. Suzanne Danzer and Christian Knoll are \\"Acquisitors\\" who work for entrepreneurs who belong to a group called Retrievers of Lost Antiquities. The nine men who make up this group accumulate stolen treasures (with the help of their Acquisitors) for their private collections. Rachael and her ex-husband, Paul, take off for Germany to follow leads left by Borya. Unfortunately, Knoll and Danzer are following close behind, leaving many dead bodies in their wake. How this story plays out will have you quickly turning pages.I like stories with Russian themes and also, books that weave true events into the story. Berry gives the reader both in The Amber Room. The history of the Amber Room is a fascinating one, as is the story of amber itself. Berry also gives us some history on the plundering of art by the Nazi's throughout Europe. With any thriller, you have to expect some liberties with the true story, as well as some incredulity. Berry gives us some of both, although I'm not sure I like the revisionist history at the end. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed The Amber Room and thought it was even better than The Romanov Prophecy."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Like many, I was (and remain) intrigued by the mystery of the Amber Room, but even that premise could not get me through this tedious, poorly-written \\"thriller.\\" My disappointment has nothing to do with comparisons with the DaVinci Code. This book stinks entirely on its own merits.First, and foremost, let's start with the characters. Either Steve Berry has never met a woman, or he's never met a woman he liked. In his book, they're all ball-breaking bitches. The only difference between the \\"heroine\\" and the villianess is which side of the law they happen to be on. Also, the heroine acts in ways which are unbelieveably stupid. For example, she suspects foul play in the death of her father and believes the Amber Room has something to do with it. In the next minute, she tells a total stranger everything he could ever want to know about the Amber Room, and worse yet, goes off with this total stranger in the middle of Europe to an abandoned mine in the mountains without telling anyone her whereabouts? And this woman is a Judge?!?! Ooookay. The husband does almost the same thing, showing every single letter related to the Amber Room to some random woman he's known for about 5 minutes. I hope this lawyer never practices anywhere near me!And the villians? The villians are a shade or two slightly more interesting than the main protagonists, but their actions are too stupid to be believed. They want to find the Amber Room, right? They find the only two living people in the world who might know its whereabouts and what do they do almost immediately? That's right, kill them! Of course! That makes perfect sense. Or, you know, they might've maybe held them and tortured them for information. Just a little suggestion.The plot is what it is, but even Green Eggs and Ham had more twists than this one did. And to add insult to injury, the writing style was just so unimaginative, dry, and choppy, with paragraph after paragraph of tedious descriptions of surroundings.If it's been awhile since you've seen the back of your brain, give the Amber Room a read, because surely you will be rolling your eyes very far back into your head every other page or so."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"There is much positive to be said of this work, and, as several reviewer's have pointed out, a few negatives also. This, for me was not one of those books I picked up expecting to be dazzled by the author's brilliant literary tallents. If I want to be bored out of my mind I will pick up some of James Joyce's work. I chose this one because I felt it would be a fun read, and it was. From a historical point, the author obviously did his home work. This was impressive. Yes, I agree with another reviewer's assessment that the author certainly has a problem with women and yet another, in that the few sex scenes were pretty poorly done and more than just a bit gratuitous, floating somewhere between silly and gross. On the other hand, this was a first novel, and I am sure his publisher wanted to get as much bang for the buck as they could...ergo, \\"lets throw in some sex.\\"The book did offer entertainment, held my interest, and I certainly did not regrete reading it. It was a good first try. I must admit to being a bit shocked at the apparent absolute venom injected into some of the reviews of this book. Hey, even at worse it was not all that bad. Perhaps it was because the author is a lawyer...hmmmm...just a thought. Anyway, I do recommend it as a pleasant way to drift through a weekend. Overall recommend. Just a note: Perhaps in future novels, the author could perhaps make at least one or two of his characters a bit more likeable. In this work, you really did not care if any or all of them made it alive through to the end, with the possible exception of the old man's cat."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"After reading some of the amazon reviews of this book I almost didn't read it; I'm glad I followed my intuition and not some of the reviews found here.Before reading this novel I had heard of the Amber Room, but only in passing. I now know much more because this book piqued my interested so a little research was in order. Contrary to some reviews, this book makes complete sense (even the murders that some found confusing), it doesn't telegraph coming events and is tightly woven for a first novel.I throughly enjoyed it and can recommended it without hesitation. I can't understand those who found it sexy - though there is some discreet sex but it is far from erotic; those who found it overly violent - much less so than the DiVinci Code or the Scarpetta books to name a few; boring - did they really read the book; or poorly written - not every book can win a Pulitzer though this one is much better than some that receive accolades in these reviews. (To the reader who referenced Dickens, get real, he wrote the original pulp fiction. And talk about boring!)This is a good mystery. I hope that you give it a chance. Me? I'm on my way to get another Steve Berry novel."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"My family is East Prussian, and most folks on this side of the Atlantic have never heard of the Amber Room, so I was intrigued by the title. The first few chapters promise a good plot and implied sub-plots. Then, the book waivers. To enjoy a book, you need to know the characters and care about them. The principal characters are described in caricature. At one point, the principals disappear while the sub-plot takes over, and after several chapters they resurfaced. Truthfully, the principal characters were so annoying and predictable, I did not miss them from the story. Its not a great novel, but its not a bad read for a long Sunday afternoon and one wants a novel that is not going to tax the mind."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I bought this book in error. I thought it was another book I had seen months before (also titled The Amber Room). I noted my error within a few pages of opening the book but thought, \\"What the heck. It still looks good or I wouldn't have bought it.\\"As someone who loves reading (lives for it!) I had to stop reading this book, perhaps before it ever really got started. (I stopped even before the page numbers reached three digits.) It wasn't so much the writing (or was it?) as the lack of solid editing that annoyed me. If I can read a book just for pleasure and notice flaws in the little things without even trying, the publisher should be ashamed. The final straw for me was when one of the characters had an age that kept fluctuating (if you can't keep the age of your character right througout the first couple of chapters, *don't* mention it at all!)The little flaws began to eat at me and I lost interest in continuing. Eventually I just gave up and decided to return it to the store (something I have never, ever done). It is so rare when I even stop reading a book without finishing it, but to return it is unheard of. (The only other book I can think of that I just couldn't keep grinding through was The Fig Eater - very long, very slow, with no end in sight even half way through the book.) It is against my nature to be defeated by a book, but this one did it.There are other books out there I would rather spend my time enjoying. Sadly, I may think twice before buying one from Ballantine again."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I probably shouldn't even be writing a review because after reading part one I literally skimmed through the rest of the novel. Why do mystery/thriller writers do this-especially men-write these seemingly superhuman bitch female characters lacking a degree of humanness. And the male character is always kind, compassionate and for some unimaginative reason totally devoted/fascinated/in love/whatever and puts up, which if the shoe were on the other foot,would be charged with emotional abuse. Not only are they suppose to be in their forties but well educated legal eagles.There is a basic thriller story which could have been so much more. Rachel irritated me so much I really didn't care what happened to her -with her treatment of just about everyone around her, dumping her two children on her dependable,good hearted ex,to go after an adventure defying her father's very last wish that she not and abandoning a political campaign to boot. Of course her ex husband, Dudley Do Right follows to save the day and in the final cell we are to assume they go off into the sunset to live happily ever after. Real fantasy-in real life-after a short honeymoon period-I am sure Rachel would once again become bored witht the ex-start the verbal battery again and they would be separated once again -although I am sure she would keep the happy family portraits decorating the house.I almost bought Berry's lastest since the new subject,the Templars,is an interest of mine but I told myself I should read the one I had sitting around. I guess I saved myself $25."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The \\"Amber Room\\" of the Tsars is famous all over the world, but its story is not really known to many. This well-written book gives a concise history of the room, anf then goes into a taut drama of the search by several people for this \\"lost\\" treasure. There's action aplenty, of the page-turning variety, and the characters are very well-written and defined. Once you begin this book, you get immediately pulled into the plot, and spend many extra hours reading it, when you should probably be sleeping. You just can't help wondering what's going to happen on the next page, so you just keep going. Isn't that the best that can be said of a thriller?"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"If this doesn't make the NYT best sellers listing, I'll eat my hat. If Steve Berry's first book is any indication, he'll rise to stellar heights in the industry. If you haven't bought your &quot;First Edition&quot; yet, get it before it's too late. Those who bought J.K. Rowling's first Harry Potter book know what I mean. The book is informative, believable, and well-researched. Apart from the fascinating history lessons, I found the protagonists to be characters that will grow on you. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I enjoy Steve Berry and it is fun to see how much he has grown, as a writer, since this, his first book."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"stumbled across this book while waiting for my other books to get released. Good story, lags in some parts but the overall story was solid."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"What I appreciate most is how well research Steve Berry's books are. As a history major, I realize that he has taken the liberties of an author and tied some ends together and formulated some theories. But his real skill lies in how he weaves it all into a coherent, organized and very believable tale.I had no idea about all of the art that was missing following World War II, and the fact that an entire underground economy arose from it all.His characters are believable, likeable and I feel for them, never hesitating to turn the page to find out what happens next for themIt is a good starting point for a new Steve Berry reader"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"BOOK RECIEVED. READ IT IN TWO DAYS. AS LIKE ALL STEVE BERRY BOOKS IT DID NOT LET ME DOWN. RECENTLY ORDERED NEW BOOK CAN HARDLY WAIT. I RECOMMENED THIS SELLER AND THIS BOOK WHOLE HEARTEDLY."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This a typical Berry book that draws on a historical situation and builds from there. The book is easy reading and has a good amount of action scenes. Those who have read his Cotton Malone books will enjoy this as well."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I just discovered Steve Berry! What a perfect weekend book - a little history, a little violence, a little sex, a few castles, a little fetching, a little not...but, hey. The Amber Room is fast and entertaining and arouses just enough curiousity re:war-time treasures to pursue further reading on the topic as well as a second Steve Berry novel. Will recommend him to our Book Club. A good bounce-back for readers who found The DaVinci Code \\"a bit much\\". To those negative critiques I read, puh-leeze! This is FICTION, folks..."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Fail. I couldn't buy it - like a lot of thrillers this novel was too contrived to like. For example - a main character, who is a judge, can clearly see that her father was murdered; but when she speaks to a homicide detective about it she agrees with him that it must have been accident. Why? She didn't want to have to tell him the unlikely, fantastic story that lead to his death. But then the reader of *The Amber Room* is supposed to buy into an ongoing fantastic, unlikely story. No thanks."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Although my husband enjoyed this book, I found it just \\"ok\\" and a little tedious to get through. I've read all the books in the series now, and this one still had interesting info, enough for me to Google the Amber Room. Wish I'd had more background on the Amber Room when I visited it in 1997 ! It would have been even more amazing to have known the facts Steve includes."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't a \\"stay up all night because you can't stop reading it\\" book, but I did have fun reading it and it did go by pretty quickly. I didn't know anything about the historical Amber Room until I started reading this, either. Maybe that's why I only \\"liked\\" it instead of \\"really liked\\" it. I had to stop and wonder if what Berry was telling me were the historical facts or the fictional historical facts.Berry reads a lot like Dan Brown novels. The chapters are on the short side and the pacing is very fast. There's a love interest, a mystery, and a revelation at the end. That's pretty much the standard formula for suspense thrillers like this. Berry doesn't seem to have as much of an ego as Brown, though. I find this refreshing. Do you know what I mean? Dan Brown has this way of writing like he's the king of the universe with the BEST and most controversial ideas. Sometimes it's a little daunting. Yet, Berry is a very natural writer whose ego never comes through (at least not yet, anyway. It is his first book).The story itself seems a bit contrived in places, especially with regard to the love story between Rachel and her ex-husband. It comes across as too simple and too fabricated. But, I think this a genre convention. Plot devices drive these novels.Here's what I did like: the research. Berry is meticulous with his research. Other than what happened to the Amber Room, I'm fairly certain the other details of the time period and the history behind the room are correct. He even distinguishes between fact and fiction at the end of the novel in an author's afterward. I do wish I had known about that before I started reading. It would have saved me a lot of time asking my husband if the facts were true. Alas. I also like the characters. They were interesting and didn't feel fake. I got emotionally involved with this, which is a mark of a good read, to me.Overall, this is a good read. If you love historical thrillers like Dan Brown's novels, then chances are you'll like this book, too."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Fast paced and interesting story about the missing Amber Room of Russia. It held my attention to the end. An excellent effort, especially as it is the first book Mr. Berry had published. I plan to read the rest of his books."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This was Mr. Berry's first book and it was, in my opinion, very good. Fast paced with each page making you want the next one. I have read some of his later books and they were a bit more polished. Thus the 4 stars as opposed to five."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I loved the historical background of the Amber Room, interwoven with suspense. I was barely able to ever put it down"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This is the third novel by Steve Berry that I have read. In general, they are far from being high literature but they are entertaining. Easy reading material for the train, doctor's office or wherever one needs to kill time. The plot is always the same scheme: some damaged people end up in a chase for a historical thingy while having to &#34;battle&#34; some crazies. So far, so good. Once in a while, I like to read something inconsequetial.Steve Berry loves to give detailed descriptions. He even mentions in the Author's Note that he traveled through Europe and Germany to do research for his book. Did he really? Maybe with his finger on a map!At first, the idiocies he put on paper really annoyed me. Later, I read the book just to see if he can still top it. Obviously, the author has no clue about cars, the German police or culture, architecture, art, art history, or history. I know that if you got it you should flaunt it. The author, however, flaunts what he does NOT possess: an idea, knowledge, common sense. He puts baroque in the middle ages, puts the border patrol (federal police) in charge of a murder investigation, makes laziness a German state of mind. He rewrites history by finding a new birthplace for Hitler, by describing mediaeval porcelain figurines when European porcelain was not invented until 1708. Strangely, he describes Munich as having a mediaeval flair and having half-timber houses. All that would not matter much, had the author not claimed having done extensive research. Picking up a generic travel guide would have eliminated most mistakes. However, the author seems to do his research mainly in the place where the sun never shines.Ultimately, if you have no clue about Europe, don't care about being force-fed BS and like to read about crazies on a treasure hunt, then this book is clearly for you."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Recommened by friends who know of my love for Brad Thor, Vince Flynn and Daniel Flynn.

Another of a long line of great books by Steve Berry."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This was the first Steve Barry I read and it hooked me. The story takes you thru the USSR (Russia) in the time of the world war occupation. The Amber Room keeps you looking to the next chapter, hard to put down.I recommend all Stevey Barry books.

Good discriptions of the scenery, towns and mountains. Loved the describing of the castles."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I started reading Steve Berry with the Cotton Malone series, but this one I felt was just as good. Being a history buff I always enjoy how he brings a myth, legend, or actual part of history into the story. I have always felt that his character development is very well done, and he doesn't spend 3 pages describing a room; he gives a few sentences about where they are then continues with the story. I love how I don't have to skip over paragraphs because I am bored (which I have to do with a lot of books).Also, these books make me want to travel a lot more than I already do.All in all, a very good read!"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"THE AMBER ROOM by Steve Berry, is labeled by the library as a Mystery, but it could have been labeled a Historical Mystery. The Amber Room is an art artifact that before WW2 was displayed in one of the palaces in Russia. Its history is quite unclear, and Berry has researched the unclear history and has used it as the basis for this partly fictional novel, his first (copyright 2003).The jacket calls it a novel of suspense. It is, and pulled me along from page to page. Many speed readers would undoubtedly zip through it in a single evening's reading. I read more slowly, and savored the author's technique in creating suspense. It's a simple one: sections in each of the fifty chapters are of varying length, and each shifts to the viewpoint of a different character, different location, and/or a different time.My count is that there are 10 major characters: that means that they are depicted well enough to stick in my aging memory. The action takes place in numerous locations, giving the author the opportunity to do a lot of descriptive writing, a bit too much for my taste since some of it is repetitive. I did read every word despite the repitition. My library hardback copy is 389 pages. I think it would sell as well without the padding to make it longer. I'll blame the editors for this, not the author.I can't count the locations, they're too numerous, but they include many in Europe, a few in the United States. Many different times are included from the present back to the 18th century. In an 2 page epilogue, Berry clarifies to some degree which parts are accurate or accepted history and which fiction. I would have appreciated a longer epilogue.I hope I've created enough suspense so you'll rush to the library. I'll rate it as an 8 or 9."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"In this suspenseful novel, several sets of people are racing to uncover the Amber Room, which has been lost since World War II. The book manages to impart quite a lot of factual information about the Amber Room while also being a readable, fictional, thriller. The amber itself has still not been found (in real life), but the series of events laid out in this imagining seem, at least to a layperson like me, quite plausible. The one complaint I have is that there were several \\"mini-climaxes\\" in the book, a couple of which were quite a bit more suspenseful than the final one...it was kind of like a roller coaster. Besides that it was an entertaining and informative book with decent characters and an engaging plot. Recommended to any reader of the mystery/thriller genre."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It started off as a potentially good read but the characters are kind of comical. It's pretty daft that the treasure seekers seem to enjoy killing so much, and have bosses that don't really mind killing - and then to find the two killers have a sexual history. I could go on but you get the drift.Also, the times and dates at the start of each chapter were completely meaningless. I guess you're supposed to follow this timeline???I'll try another Berry book sometime but I hope he improves with experience."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I previously read several Steve Berry books from his Cotton Malone series. They were good enough to keep me coming back for more, so I decided to start at the beginning. The Amber Room is not a Cotton Malone story, but a stand alone novel. It is Steve Berry's first published novel and, considering this, a surprisingly good effort. I think it's my favorite Steve Berry book to date."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book got me hooked on Steve Berry. It's full of history and plenty of mystery when it comes to finding the lost Amber Room. Great book, I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This is a good read and the plot is more believable than some others by this author."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Anyone who has seen the reconstituted Amber Room in the Catherine Palace outside St. Petersburg will be intrigued by this mystery which ties it in a convoluted plot populated with a cast of villains of an international stripe and an American judge and her husband. Backed by a fair rendering of the history of the original Amber Room and its removal by the Nazi in the battle of Leningrad, the stereotyped characters are the meanest of the mean, the truest of true Americans and a North Carolina bumpkin. The ending, garnished with sex, is awkward but entertaining as one drifts off to slumberland."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"While imprisoned in a concentration camp during World War II, Karol Borya first hears reference to the Amber Room, which went missing in 1945. He searched for it as a treasure hunter for Russia's Extraordinary Commission, but by the time the old man is murdered at the age of 83, his only interest in the missing Russian treasure is a few newspaper articles. Borya's daughter Rachel is prodded to ignore his advice to stay away from the Amber Room when his \\"accidental\\" death seems suspicious, so she is soon on her way to Germany to interview an old friend of his. Little does Rachel know that she's got two rival professional killers on her tail, and she isn't much safer when she is joined unexpectedly by her ex-husband Paul. Together, they unravel the secrets of the long missing Amber Room, while dodging danger from their adversaries every step of the way. Though the protagonists were far too trusting and clueless and the bad guys were far too invincible, somehow everything fell into place and everyone got what they deserved in the end.This was a fairly well written novel with many different points of view to liven up the story. My only complaints are that a lawyer and a judge were far too nave and trusting, particularly of people they've just met, despite suspecting that Rachel's father may have been murdered. The bad guys, on the other hand, were extremely sophisticated and savvy, not to mention well-funded, and none of them was terribly unusual for a villain. The plot was also not terribly original, and everything wrapped up almost too neatly in the end, but the action does keep moving, and places are described in a way that transported me there. In all, this was a satisfying thriller playing on a real-life unsolved mystery. The Amber Room is worth the read."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"very sloppy research and problems with the story further spoil a weak plot. skip this one and read his later books which are slightly improved."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book was recommended after reading the Divinci Code and all of Dan Browns books.

It was an entertaining and thrilling book, very much a similar read to Dan Brown's Angels and Demons. In some ways, it was better. Either way, I highly recommend this if you are a Dan Brown or Daniel Silva fan!"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Rudyard Kipling summed it up in his poem, \\"Loot\\" -...\\"So, if my song you'll 'ear, I will learn you plain an' clear, 'Ow to pay yourself for fightin' overtime.\\" Invading armies have collected the spoils of war since the beginning of recorded history. It used to include slaves, but in recent times has been loot, aka, plunder, booty, or other names that apply. Nazi Germany did acquire slave labor during World War II, but this novel is concerned with art treasures. Individual soldiers often picked up what they could conveniently carry, but governments tend to engage in organized looting in a systematic large scale effort. That was true of Napolean, and it was certainly true of Hitler and his cohorts. Much remains missing, but occasionally something will turn up. Among the things missing are the panels from the fabled Amber RoomThis novel is well researched in regard to the Amber Room, and provides a fictional account, A superior court judge from Atlanta and her ex-husband, an attorney, are drawn into the search and plunge headlong into danger in Germany. It is a thriller novel, as they contend with bad guys competing with each other for the treasure. It is an interestng page turner, although the characters may seem a little bit too bumbling at times. Various dead bodies litter the landscape. The novel has violence, some language, and some sexual content (perhaps about average for this type novel).\\"Mosaic,\\" by Gayle Lynds, is an earlier novel dealing with the Amber Room providing a different fictional account with some similar outcomes."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This was Berry's first effort and like the others is a fast-paced thriller with some history as the backdrop. Perhaps not as polished as the later books, but just as over-the-top. Only in the world of movies and fiction does one find stories like this. The pacing which propels you ahead is what more writers need to study. You shouldn't have to force yourself through chapters. WWII-Nazi-Cold War mysteries are always a nice touch. Read more inHitler's Holy Relics: A True Story of Nazi Plunder and the Race to Recover the Crown Jewels of the Holy Roman Empireor if you like the tech end readHitler's Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology. A lot of mysteries still out there and perhaps we'll learn more as things filter out of the ex-Eastern Bloc nations and the archives of the West. Berry continues the secret-Nazi-mission theme in a later book,The Charlemagne Pursuit."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Let me just say that this has to be the best Steve Berry novel that I have read to date!Art historians everywhere would love to know what happened to the Amber Room after it disappeared during WWII. Berry paints a wonderful tale of what might have happened to it in a story that chronicles the adventures of Atlanta judge Rachel Cutler when she travels to Europe to get to the bottom of this mystery after her father Karol Borya, was killed because of what he knew about the Amber Room's whereabouts. Rachel gets mixed up in the race between two European industrialists/art collectors to find the Amber Room, and almost loses her life in the process. The big question is who will find it first, and does it actually exist?For art history buffs, this novel offers an entertaining and intriguing look at one of the art world's most famous mysteries. I was sitting on the edge of my seat through at least half the novel! If you like this novel, I also recommend Jeffrey Archer."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I had high hopes for this novel, given the caliber of Mr. Berry's other novels. However, the number of illogical situations and conclusions were too high.1. What woman doesn't know the difference between her husband and a stranger when making love?2. How can it be expected that a suspected murderer will tell you they are responsible for a death just because you want to know?3. How many billionares will invite three strangers, who accuse murder, to spend the night?4. Why would parents assume that their children's uncle (who has no mention of special skills/employment/security system) could keep them safe from killers?Unfortunately, these are just a few of the many times the reader is requested to accept situations or conclusions that do not make sense.

He generally had his characters make normal rational choices and perform normal human feats. The result?....humdrum. The amber room topic is great, a lot of potential. Berry's two main characters are like-able and you can identify with them....good. And...they're normal, not so good. I always thought that someone should write a book with more realistic characters. It's now been done. The result? You need a bit of the fantastic...or at least I do.You may want to try this anyway. Berry seems to be quite capable in the historical adventure genre. However, hopefully he's learned that novels need a touch of the fantastic."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I was one of the first people I know of to have read Steve Berry's Debut Amber Room.

No one will be disappointed in buying it."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This is a wonderful first book by a new author. It is fast paced, exciting and I really liked the characters. I did feel as if the author wasn't through with the these characters though, I hope I'm right, I would like to see them in another adventure with their &quot;new friend&quot;.

This book will keep readers turning pages until the end. Art lovers will especially enjoy the wealth of art history. Berry is the new best writer since Dan Brown. I can't wait to read more from this &quot;Five Star&quot; writer."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The Amber Room is my second and last visit to BerryLand. Life is simply too short to spend it reading badly written books. Mr. Berry is not a writer; if he were a chef, his skills would be strictly limited to microwave fare--fast, tasteless, and forgotten. I am not being too hard on the \\"writer\\" since he has no claim to that title. His books are not just formulaic, but lacking in imagination and momentum--I'm surprised he hasn't addressed sunken treasure in the Bermuda Triangle yet (if, by chance, he has, please forgive my oversight). Avoid this stuff if you value the hours of your life at all."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"The basis of this book was extrememly interesting since it dealt with the Amber Room.THe elements of mystery, suspense, a certain bit of spy genere made this book excellent till the end, which I found was a complete let down, since there was not the least bit of plausability in it. There is another book being written about the Amber Room, same title, coming out in the next 3 months.Wait for that one."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Author Steve Berry has a lot of talent. His concept is good and the aura of the Amber Room itself is a compelling mystery. However his plot is filled with contrived characters and situations that hold few surprise and creat little momentum. Considering this is his first effort I would have thought his editor could have helped more with suggestions and cutting out the filler.Even so, I will look forward to his subsequent efforts."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"I have to say I agree with the editorial review. I liked the idea of finding lost treasure, but by the end, I really didn't care anymore who did. The villains had interesting action (not only that, I found myself rooting for them), but I found their character development (Knoll especially) lacking. The plot depends on geography somewhat, and I wasn't able to get a grasp of it without pulling out a map. It is a decent debut for this new author, and I think I will check out any books he writes in the future, but having just finished reading The Da Vinci Code, and reading The Amber Room based on the recommendation of Dan Brown on the cover, I was dissappointed."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Although this book got some less than flatering reviews, I really enjoyed it. I have been an avid reader of historic novels for years, and appreciated Steve Berry's charactor development, and interweaving of historic events. I understand Rachel Cutler, and I understand the relationship she had with her X-husband, and I found his other charactors endearing.Yes, there was a fair amount of violence and some sex, but whether you like it or not- it's part of the lives of these kinds of people. I did really enjoyed Berry's display of knowledge over what could have happened to the Amber Room, and I am looking forward to his next book The Romanov Prophecy!"},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"This book is a decent attempt at a first novel. I think Mr. Berry has probably done a lot of writing as an attorney and decided why not give commerical writing a try? It's not such an obvious craft though.The story is not bad. It's follows the same pattern as countless others bestsellers, and I don't have too much of an issue with it. I've spent time in Russia, and found that aspect of the book to be accurate. Overall, I think Mr. Berry did a pretty good job researching the book. There is one chase scene in a European town that was very suspenseful and well-written.The most glaring flaw in the book is the horrible cast of characters. These are a bunch of losers, who are unlikable, unbelievable, and frequently a combination of both. An abrasive judge (who alienates her husband by her bossy attitude) as the \\"heroine\\" isn't exactly the kind of person I see myself bonding with. The husband, inexplicably, loves her despite her general meanness. The \\"nasty\\" killers are comically nasty. It's really too bad. The book would have been pretty enjoyable if I didn't have to roll my eyes every couple of pages or so at the ridiculous dialogue between \\"Mr. Evil\\" and \\"Mrs. Beautiful Evil Witch\\".The other major thing that irked me are the utterly gratuitous sex scenes. I can't help but think Mr. Berry's editor suggested he spice up the book, and Mr. Berry went back and pasted a couple of these in to sell a few more. The scenes are really cheaply written, even disgusting, I think, and add absolutely nothing except a bad taste in the mouth.To conclude: it's perfectly acceptable airport reading."},{"Title":"The Amber Room","review":"Good prologue and first few chapters withered slowly and painfully died at the end. What kind of insane, non violent woman would retaliate and try to attack a stiletto killer after she has been warned; what kind of woman (judge no less) would traipse off with a stranger in a strange country to try and find the amber room supposedly concealed in a mountain cave which could explode at will, to finish the search of her deceased father, unbeknownst to her killed by her companion). I did find descriptions of the origin of amber instructive."},{"Title":"Texas Reds (Saltwater Strategies)","review":"This book is great. This book is a must have for both the beginner and the expert redfish angler. It includes all of the basics for someone just starting out, as well as some good tips and secrets for folks that grew up fishing for reds on the Texas coast. Not only is it full of excellent facts, it's Mr. Moore's writing style is very entertaining, making it a book that I had trouble putting down. Also, unlike other books on the subject, the pictures and maps make you want to take the week off and head to the coast."},{"Title":"Texas Reds (Saltwater Strategies)","review":"This books is not just wonderful for the fishermen in your life. Chester Moore weaves lyrical writing into the fishing instruction and experience. My husband was dazzled!"},{"Title":"Texas Reds (Saltwater Strategies)","review":"I found this book superficial, not very well written, and full of useless filler (like poor quality copies of readily available maps with no added information, like target areas). I fish with both lures and bait, but prefer active fishing in the shallow bays, particularly those of the Texas Coastal Bend. I am no pro or tournament fisherman. I did hope to learn some new tricks. The book is a major disappointment in that regard and I do not recommend it to anyone but a novice and perhaps those not yet familiar with the upper Texas coast."},{"Title":"Texas Reds (Saltwater Strategies)","review":"Another reviewer argued that this book would best serve the novice redfisher. I think that would be the case, as I am one and found this book to be useful. However, I do recognize some limits to the book straight off the bat. One, most of the detail is only skin deep. The author offers tips, but only a few. So when these fail to work one must wonder what to do next. (I know, buy the magazine for which the author writes.) Second, the author assumes that the reader is aware of the insider lingo he uses, which if you are a novice is somewhat confusing. Third, the book mentions too many locations without going into a great deal of detail in discussing anyone of them. These all served as red flags pointing out that this is a very good first book, but one not worthy of someone with more experience under their belt. Anyway, very readable, enjoyable, and only contains a few typos. More current the Sargent's book, but not at deep as that older tome. So get it if you are just cutting your teeth on this fish."},{"Title":"Texas Reds (Saltwater Strategies)","review":"This book presents some modern views on fishing the Texas coastal waters of Galveston Bay and other local waters."},{"Title":"The Fine Artist's Career Guide, 2nd Edition: Making Money in the Arts and Beyond","review":"This book would be great for any highschool students considering what/where to study for university or college. It provided more information about art in the United States more so than Canada.Overall, I thought the information the book provided was very brief towards what a career actually entails. It did go more in depth however, with real life examples of someone in the business, and provided good sources if you want to look into what schools offer such programs to lead to that specific career.I would consider the actual careers very general knowledge -- unfortunately it was nothing I didn't know before I had purchased this book. However, it may be helpful to someone who is clueless about the art world.In the end, it was an okay book; I dont regret the purchse."},{"Title":"Atlas of Medieval Europe","review":"The Atlas of Medieval Europe is a terrific historical resource. It contains maps and explanations of a wide variety of events and topics about medieval history. There are maps showing the most interesting and specific trends, like the spread of anti-Semitism, and the raising of provisions for war in England.I purchased this book for a specific research project, but am delighted to find that it is an informative and engaging supplement to my library. I would heartily recommend this title to anyone interested in medieval Europe. By studying the wide range of subjects covered in this atlas, one can get a feel for medieval history without trying to digest volumes of dry text.That said, nothing is perfect. I found the organization of this text to be a little clumsy at times. There is such a wide variety of topics and the topics for each period of time are not consistent. Also, with the quantity of data in some of the maps, color would be a boon.The other works on this subject are usually very brief in their descriptions and contain a grade school report level of information. In contrast, The Atlas of Medieval History is a comprehensive, adult reference that, despite a few minor shortcomings, does justice to the complexity of the subject matter."},{"Title":"Atlas of Medieval Europe","review":"This \\"atlas\\" contains only black and white sketch maps, which give no indication of actual geographical and topological conditions. It has a fairly decent discussion of the history connected with each map, but this is necessarily short. This book should cost about 5 times less than it does, if it were about $7.00 it might be worth buying."},{"Title":"Atlas of Medieval Europe","review":"This 280 page book is a useful reference as an overview of Medieval Europe but is very dry as a read because of the necessary brevity in this small book. Thirty-seven different Scottish university scholars contributed to the work so it is uneven in its textual presentation and illustration. The sections of the book are Early Medieval (from the fall of the western Roman empire to ca 1100), Central Middle Ages (c 1100 - c 1300), and Late Middle Ages (c 1300 - c 1500) and each of these sections is broken down into Politics; Religion; Government, Society and Economy; and Culture.One of the principal strengths of the work is the profusion of maps - well over a hundred I should think. They are, however of widely varying quality. Some are very well done and readable but others are essentially impossible to interpret either because of large amounts of detail in a small space or because of lack of references such as rivers and cities with names that can be recognized by the non-specialist modern reader.I would recommend it to the amateur historian as a reference but not to a reader who is simply interested in a good read about the people and lives of the Middle Ages."},{"Title":"Forty years a gambler on the Mississippi, (Rediscovering America series)","review":"Loved the book, understand why the author has such a big ego- He lived in an awsome time and was at the top.

I ended up buying it on Amazon when I got back home. Very glad I did (although I hear the Free Kindle version is just as good). This is not so much a book narrative his life as it is a collection of anecdotes and stories from that life, broken up in one to two page sections. What a life. Duval ran away from home as a young boy and worked on a ship. There he learned how to deal cards and also, how to cheat. The thing they say about cons, at least 19th and early 20th century cons, (readThe Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Manif interested) is they never worked on an honest mark. Almost all of them depended on presenting low but illegal hanging fruit in front of a greedy man and then parting him from his money while he grabbed at it. One of Duval's most successful was to conspicuously mark a card in his deck and deal until he knew the victim had spotted the pattern. He'd wait until the man placed a huge bet, certain to win with his inside knowledge, and then deal him a losing hand. Duval seems to have been the embodiment of Roosevelt's expression about walking softly but carrying a big stick. He'd always give some of the winnings back if it was all the loser had in the world, or if he'd bet his wife's jewelry and lost, Duval would send it back to her stateroom later that night. But if they wouldn't take their turn of the cards with some dignity he had no problem fighting or draw his pistol (which he called Betsy Jane but never used). In fact, his favorite weapon was his head, and the book must detail 20 instances where he wins a fight with a solid headbutt. There is a lot of great history in here since he experienced the South both pre, during and post-Civil war (was actually imprisoned by the occupying Union forces for nearly a year). My only criticism is that after about 150 pages the stories all seem to blur together. You can only hear about an overconfident guy falling for a trick and then fighting about the money he lost so many times. But if you read it sporadically or non-linearly it's an excellent book to have."},{"Title":"Forty years a gambler on the Mississippi, (Rediscovering America series)","review":"The guy is actually more of a cheat with 3 card monte than a poker player.

A cute story, though they never exactly explain how froople is played."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Being a fan of Lindsey Davis' series of historic mysteries of Marcus Didius Falco, and also having recently read &quot;Vespasian&quot; by Barbara Levick, I found this novel to be an acurate and entertaining portrayal of the long time relationship of Vespasian and Caenis. It is neither the rollicking, irreverant narrative of Falco, or the dry statement of historical footnotes in a textbook; &quot;Course of Honor&quot; combines the best of both in a tale that gives a wonderful perspective on the life of one of Rome's better emperors through the eyes of the woman who truly stood by his side."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Fans of Lindsey Davis' rollicking Falco novels will find here a more restrained style, as she polishes up a small lost history into a life's love. The care used to tell the tale befits the main players on the stage. We meet Caenis, an intelligent, resolute woman who happens to be a slave in Rome's Imperial household; hand in hand with that, we meet a steady, decent young soldier named Vespasian. (That name's familiar for a reason, Latin students.) The skein of attraction, duty, forsaking, and fulfillment that will drive these two apart and together over their lifetimes plays out with even pace against the nasty backdrop provided by Rome in the time of the Claudians. Vespasian's fate won't surprise the reader, but as for Caenis: will she or won't she? Loyal readers of Davis may be taken by surprise at the almost Victorian gravitas of her style in this work. I found it soothing, but I could note that she does tend to overuse a few favorite phrases. Still, I don't hesitate to recommend it; it's refreshing to read a love story in which restraint is an almost tangible third partner."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"The (true) story on which this novel is based -- the decades-long love affair between the impoverished nobleman/unlikely emperor Vespasian and the freed slave Caenis -- is inherently compelling, and the author of the &quot;Falco&quot; mysteries seems like the perfect writer to retell it. Unfortunately, I felt that the novel fell flat. Choosing to tell the story in the third person (why?) meant that Davis spent far too much time on rather dry exposition -- in the first few chapters there were about 10 pages of background for every page of dialog. She falls into this same habit in some of the Falco novels (e.g. &quot;The Iron Hand of Mars&quot;), but there the expository bits are more fun because they're told in the narrator's cynical, wise-cracking voice. The historical characters are engaging enough when they're allowed to speak for themselves -- the straight-arrow Vespasian (I kept seeing John Wayne playing him), the loving but all-too-intelligent Caenis, her sorely tried royal mistress Antonia -- and even the made-up ones, such as her gold-digger friend Veronica and her manipulative mentor Narcissus, have considerable depth. Occasional scenes -- such as Vespasian's triumphal return from Britain -- came vividly alive, and the conclusion kept me up past my bedtime. But I suspect that Davis, in trying to write a &quot;serious&quot; novel rather than Philip Marlowe in a toga, went too far in the opposite direction. She seems to have forgotten a couple of basic principles of fiction writing: (1) A novel should be entertaining, and (2) Show, don't tell. I would have found the story much more absorbing if it had been told from Caenis' point of view; I'm sorry Davis decided to play it safe and go for Victorian omniscience and excruciating dignity."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Many stories written about Ancient Rome are from the man'spoint of view with little or no attention paid to the strong womenbehind the men. Lindsey Davis has done excellent work in incorporating women in the Marcus Didius Falco books with Helena, but this book is riviting and a wonderful story. Vespatians mistress, Caenis is the main character and Davis does an excellent job portraying a strong woman in the man's world of Ancient Rome. A must read for anyone interested in the female voice in Ancient Rome!"},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"In an interview with Davis that appeared on the web, she said that she originally set out to write historical fiction (as in the Course of Honor) that was closely based on actual events and that provided an accurate perspective on Roman life. However, her Marcus Didius Falco books attracted a much wider audience, and so her subsequent writing has followed that character. I enjoy the anachronistic, wise-cracking Falco; but I wish Davis would also write more fiction that takes us back to the \\"real\\" Rome. Caenis was an actual historical figure, about whom very little is known. Davis used accounts by Tacitus as sources of major events in Vespasian's life, and those events provided an interesting story line. I thoroughly enjoyed the feisty, independent Caenis; it's so rare to see a strong independent woman in stories set in the ancient world (other notable examples are Bradshaw's female physician in A Beacon at Alexandria, and Brenda Jagger's Antonia, and of course, the strong women who appear in Colleen McCullough's novels. The middle part of Caenis's life (in the novel) was not as interesting as the periods when she was involved with Vespasian; I would have liked to see something more inventive here, because the pace was rather slow in some parts of the story. In spite of that, this remains one of my favorite ancient world novels, and I hope that someday Lindsey Davis writes additional books outside the Falco series."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"This is the only Lindsey Davis novel I have seen that is not one of the Falco series. It is a fictionalized biography of a Roman freedwoman who was a the concubine of the emperor Vespasian. She was apparently a real person and is mentioned in Suetonius' The Twelve Emperors just as is stated in the book. There is, of course, too little documentation to do a genuine biography, but Davis had done an excellent job of integrating the scanty documentation on her subject with other research on the time period to create versimilitude. The characterization is well done, both of the subject, and of the emperor and his two sons."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"This is an amazingly sweet book.Two people, one a bad tempered angry slave and one the unimportant son of a provincial tax collector meet when the man and his brother get lost in the imperial palace in Rome. They come across a young slave girl cooking sausages and an attraction is formed for life between the young man and the slave.Vespasian is not an important man in Rome when he meets Caenis. In fact, though he is later and senator and she is later a freewoman, there is a long span of time where her connections to the royal family make her important than he is. But they loved each other deeply their whole lives in spite of their long separation of twenty years when he married, and she even helped him raise his children. When Nero died and Vespasian took the purple in a military coup, he has his beloved move into the palace with him-defying all social conventions to be with her.The absolute only thing I think could have made this book more sweetly romantic would be Vespasian overruling the law that members of the senate couldn't marry freedwoman. But hey, perhaps that was a more drastic step that it seems it would have been. Roman society confuses me, but in this book it is clear, wonderful, corrupt and a place where even social opposites can fall in love.Five stars.For more reading on Vespasian's younger son corrupt and disastrous rule of Rome check out The Light Bearer by Donna Gillespie."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"The Course of Honor is an engaging novel which elucidates the typical lifestyle of a Roman. The love story between the two main characters, Caenis and Vespasian, is sentimental and charming. The plot is entertaining. The only part of the book that is dissatisfactory is that Lindsey tends to drone on and on about what Caenis sees in the city and what the current emperor is doing. It is, for the most part, historically accurate and the main characters are real people. Overall, I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"I almost didn't want to read this book since it wasn't part of the Didius Falco series, but decided to go ahead because Ms. Davis is such a wonderful writer. Am I ever glad that I did! This is a marvellous book. It so richly descibes the life of ancient Rome, and the many coups, killings, wars and public displays that went on then in the Imperial city. It also richly describes a great love story. This is a love story between a freed woman and a future emporer of Rome - Vespasian. It is a love story that survives for decades. What a wonderful woman Caenis must have been - a true partner for a great and wonderful leader. The author depicts her characters so well that they appear to come alive in this beautiful story. I feel privileged that I was able to read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"I fell in love with Lindsey Davis' writing for her Marcus Didius Falco novels, but what always appealed to me in her writing was the rich historical details and the very real characters and, in this regard, \\"The Course of Honor\\" is no different. Based loosely on the true story of the Roman Emperor Vespasian and his life-long love the freedwoman Caenis, this is a sweet and genuine love-story of the sort that usually doesn't move me but manages to in this case.Lindsey Davis is obviously a devotee of the Emperor Vespasian given that the Falco novels are written during his reign and \\"The Course of Honor\\" is about his rise to power. I once saw a historian on television describe Vespasian as \\"the kind of Emperor you'd knock back beer with while watching the football game\\" and that IS the man whom the slave (and later freedwoman) Caenis comes to know and love in the course of this novel.This is a romance and I don't normally enjoy \\"romance novels\\" (which are too frequently just excuses for pointless sex-scenes), but this one is different. It's more about heart than heat and takes decades to unfold fully. This story shows a relationship evolve, from familiarity to friendship to love to life-partnership, with devotion and patience playing key roles.Caenis is a Palace slave when the Senator Sabinus and his younger brother Vespasian stumble across her. It is by no means love at first sight. Her first words to the future Emperor are, in fact, \\"skip over the Styx!\\"Since young Vespasian is expected to pursue a political career, he is about to embark upon the Cursus Honorum (the \\"Course of Honor\\"), the mandatory step-by-step political path that any young Roman politician is expected to take. This absents him from Rome for a year, but, at the end of that time, he seeks Caenis out again.From there, they embark upon a cautious courtship, both well-aware that a relationship between them may be allowed but it will never be ACCEPTED. Vespasian comes and goes in Rome, doing what his family expects of him, absenting himself from the city for months or years at a time.But, whenever he comes home, he seeks out Caenis. Neither waits for the other. She takes lovers and he marries, but they remain friends throughout.They fall out of touch. They reconnect. They remain friends.With Caenis' intercession, Vespasian gains honors under Tiberius and Claudius. Perhaps because of THOSE connections, he falls out of favor under Caligula and again later under Nero. For a time, he is in fear for his life due to Nero's jealousy.Then the Year of the Four Emperors comes and Vespasian suddenly finds himself acclaimed Emperor by his troops. And, as is written in actual history, the new Emperor refuses to move into the palace without his loyal lover and his best friend in the world...On a historical note, the true Caenis remained in the Imperial Palace until her death a few years after Vespasian's accession to the throne. This is one of those love stories where, while difficult, everything went right for both characters. And Lindsey Davis does a beautiful and moving job of capturing it without being remotely sappy or fake. And, as always, she immerses you right in the era."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"One of the very best of this type that I have rea"},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Before she started her witty and successful Falco series, Lindsey Davis wrote this book, but couldn't get it published.

Caenis remains interesting to him throughout the book and throughout her life--in the way we could all hope to remain interesting to those we love. The book, too, held my attention from beginning to end and actually caused me to cry several times (and I don't normally cry over books). Davis has a fantastic command of historical events and everyday detail, her characters are wonderfully alive and worthy of our sympathy. I would even go so far as to suggest that Falco--much as I love him--does not measure up."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"After chewing through all of MuCullough's Roman books, and waiting for a new one, I chanced across this one and decided to give Lindsey Davis a try. I was not dissapointed. A different perspective and a story I was not familiar with, I devoured it. Just a tiny bit romantic for my taste, but certinaly worth the read. If you have ever felt anything like Caenis and Vespasian felt for each other, this story will hit close to home. I now find myself compelled to investigate the Marcus Didius Falco books!"},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Junkies of anything related to ancient Rome will enjoy this. Unfortunately, Marcus Didius Falco this ain't. The only exciting part of the book comes at the very end when the main character's fate is, only temporarily, up in the air. Hopefully, Caenus and Vespian, the two protaganists, will be included in future Falco entries, all of which are far superior to this effort. I kept feeling like this story had been greatly edited, leaving out large chunks of time and action. Maybe if Caenus had babysat Falco this could have been more interesting. Nevertheless, Miss Davis remains a marvelous writer with a God-given talent for bringing the Classical Era to life. This book just needed more of her customary humor. I want Falco! I want Helena to have that damn baby! Amazon.com, please let us know when the next Falco novel is coming out!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"I like Lindsey Davis's Falco series, but I must agree whole-heartedly with \\"A Reader's\\" comments. This book drags, particularly in the middle section (when Vespasian is absent). In addition, like the Falco series and Steven Saylor, the protagonists have too much of politically-correct agenda (feminism, democracy, and, in Saylor's case, anti-slavery) to be really belivable First Century Romans. Robert Graves does it better."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Unlike other reviewrs here, I had never before heard of Lindsey Davis. So I approached this book with no preconceptions, except, perhaps, a desire to like it becasue I love hisotry and reading about the Roman Empire.I was very disappointed.This book plunged right into the trap that lays in wait for all writers of historical fiction -- getting believable characters into the right situations such as to enable the author to say what he/she wants to say on the history front.Davis had a better chance than most to make it work becasue the main character here was a real-life person who was directly involved with the imperial family. It would have been a lot harder had the protaginist been an ordinary person.Still, I beleive the book did not work. Too much historical information is delivered via (i) the dropping of any reasonable fiction &quot;point of view&quot; and morphing into textbook mode or (ii) long conversation in which a character relates major events to other characters. I found it boring. And the relationship between Vespasian and Caenis lacked the sort of story power it ought to have had.Frankly, I would have found a straight non-fiction history more satisfying. That way, we could have delved into the facts n a deep way without the &quot;burden&quot; of trying to charry a story. For those who want a good story along with their history, try the Robert Gravces books; &quot;I Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius The God&quot; (these two novels form the basis of the old BBC Masterpiece Theater mega-hit &quot;I Claudius&quot;).Graves combines the level of hisotrical analysis we'd expect to see in a quality scholarly work with a story that packs breathtaking dramatic and narrative power. Reading just the first few chapters of &quot;I Claudius&quot; will show exactly what is missing from &quot;The Course of Honor.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"It is rare to find a historical romance that is both so insightful as a book of history and believable as a love story. Davis accomplishes one of the most difficult tasks in romance -- she tells the story of a lifelong love affair, which begins while Vespasian and Caenis are young and does not end until they are both in their 60s. We see the ups and downs of the relationship, follow the long periods of time when they are apart (and not necessarily dwelling on one another) and believe in them both as hopeful young lovers and people who have decades of knowledge about each other. The historical detail is excellent; this Rome feels vivid and real without ever stooping to include extraneous, schoolbook info. People who complain about the pace seem to have mistaken this for a thriller, which it is not; besides, it includes poisonings, assassinations, secret trysts, letters written in code -- not my idea of slow! Anyone who enjoys either the history of the early Empire or a mature, intelligent love story will like this very much."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"For readers of the author's Falco historical mysteries, this book provides a look at the life and times of Vespasian, Falco's sometime employer, as seem through the eyes of Antonia Caenis, Vespasian's long-term mistress. The mix of biography, historical fiction and romance will please all but the most pedantic. Readers learn the quick version of the history of first century CE Rome and not have to bother with footnotes and references. Readers, too, will be caught up in the fates of the main characters. A thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"This novel is about the career of the emperor Vespasianus, as witnessed by his mistress, Antonia Caenis. This freedwoman is the real focus of the book, and I think it is a good job, and it complements McCullough's &quot;Masters of Rome&quot; nicely although it cannot match her breadth and erudition. Davis is an Oxford scholar of English and has written several titles of mystery novels all set in ancient Rome, the protagonist being a Didius Falco. Those may be entertaining enough, but this one is a different category, and I'd recommend it above the others."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"If you are a Falco fan and have not read this, do so. It provides wonderful background material for Vespasian. He's not just an old man, but a fellow who lived and loved the best. In fact, he's more like Falco than he would like to admit. The details only hinted at in the Falco books are here: Vespasian's survival in a time of 'really strange' and dangerous emperors, his rise to power, and his inherent humanity in the face of a vicious age. The tale has a different style than the Falco books. It's difficult to desribe, but it's \\"sweeter,\\" a love story between Caenis and Vespasian that survived decades of events. Falco is Falco and he and Helena are fun. It's a great adventure series. But this one? It will put a lump in your throat and tears in your eyes. But that's a good thing. They made it. It worked. A love story in the time of turmoil is a great thing. Thank you to Lindsey Davis with sharing this."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"This is an excellent book, a departure from Davis' Falco stories, not only in central character, but in tone. It is deeply romantic at its core, the love of a Roman Emperor, Vespatian, for a slave-born woman, Caenis. He could not marry her, as Roman law was quite strict as to whom a member of the Senatorial class could and could not marry. He could not make her his wife, but he loved her all his life. This is a great read, but it is also informative. Most moderns would think that slavery was an altogether wreched existence, but Caenis, the favorite of one of the Roman royals, not only has a dignified, comfortable life, but buys her own freedom at a relatively young age. This is a book that people who think the Romans were just as you and I will find a bit of a shock, but humans are humans, and their essential humanity shines through. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Lindsey Davis, whose mysteries I have enjoyed more than any others I have read, here demonstrates a remarkably sure hand at material which, if it shares a common historical setting with her mysteries, is nevertheless quite different in its emotional contours, time scale, and character dynamics. The light tone of her mysteries makes it especially rewarding -- albeit not surprising to those who know her work well -- to find here such a moving and mature account of love and separation. Also deserving special praise is the way in which Davis' characters believably age over the course of the book, remaining recognizably the same people while also reaching milestones in their life which allow no simple return to past ways."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"In ancient Rome, the Course of Honor was the path a young man from a noble family took to gain political prestige. First, the young man would serve in the army. Upon his return, the young man would work in public service, marry well, and eventually get elected to the senate. There was one unbreakable rule. The young man could not marry a slave or a freed woman.This is a story of two people who form a great friendship, and love. One is a slave girl working in the palace. The other is other is a young man just starting his course of honor. Caenis is a young woman with a head on her shoulders. She is not a great beauty. She is well educated, and has planned a future for herself that doesn't rely on men. Titus is a poor young noble planning a future in public service, the army and the senate.When they meet they are attracted to each other. But they both understand that there can be no future in their relationship. They first form a solid friendship. This makes their love deeper and more true.The novel describes how they move in and out of each other's lives. They both understand the realities of their relationship. They are honest with each other. And they accept what fate gives them, and make the most of their time together.I don't usually read romances, but I enjoyed this novel. It is a nice story about two realistic people. It is not a story of a torrid romance in which lovers fall passionately, then regret it for the rest of their lives. This is a tale of two people who are prevented from marriage, yet who create a life long friendship and love.Lyndsey Davis is one of my favorite authors. She is the author of the Falco historical mystery series. She has a nice readable style."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"I really liked this book. It tells a wonderful story of two people growing and developping, over beyond 40 years, (thank God not another of those books that end when people are young and beautiful - here, they grow up) without ever becoming unbearably long or dull, quite the contrary, it leaves you wanting to know more about that time and those characters, but still, it is somehow enough to know that much. My complaints: I lost the thread a bit when Caenis was living first in that slum appartement, then did not want to move back to Antonia's house, but still moved out of the slum. I either overlooked something or she was living somewhere (where?) for a few years; the other one: I never quite figured out what Caenis lived on: those occasional pieces of dictation and the (explicitly) unpaid lessons to the Imperial children - these inconsistencies make me rate the book only a 4, but extremely enjoyable still - if you like Ancient Rome, this is a treat!"},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It has a little bit of everything while being very well written and a very fast read. First there is this remarkable romance. Ceanis is a character I will never forget. We have the joy of watching her grow and mature as she goes from slave to freedwoman. Then there is the setting: ancient Rome, with all its political intrigue and violence. I first read this book when it was published some 10 years ago and I have never forgotten it. When I recently reread it, I was once again reminded why it had always stayed with me."},{"Title":"The Course of Honor","review":"Author is very good.

However, after purchasing and reading the Kaplan comprehensive review study guide, I realized that the Columbia Review book is NOT very intensive and does not thoroughly explain some scientific concepts (especially in the biology section). Specific details include the muscular/skeletal system and the nervous system. Bresnick's book is like glossary of terms with simple definitions with inadequate scientific background. Save your money. Buy the Kaplan book."},{"Title":"COLUMBIA REVIEW INTENSIVE PREPARATION FOR THE MCAT","review":"I received the Columbia Review book as part of an MCAT course I'm taking. The book is out of print, but just in case anyone is thinking about special-ordering it, DON'T!The book provides a decent overview of MCAT science, but the subject area practice tests that follow each section are full of errors. Some of the questions don't have a single &quot;best&quot; answer, while others don't seem to have any correct answers at all. I'm not talking about typographical errors; I'm talking about poorly written questions that do not reflect the level of difficulty of the real MCAT.Preparing for the MCAT is hard enough. You don't need review materials that make it even harder.

I had 4 weeks to concentrate on studying for the MCAt after my summer session last year. I have a great grasp of the concepts in the pre-med courses and just needed the STRATEGY of how to do well for the MCAt. This is THE book. If you really understood the stuff in your classes the first time around, this book gives an excellent review and supplements the stuff you didn't learn but need for the MCAT. All in all I did 1 week non-stop studying/section then a week of tests I went over with friends. With such intensive studying, I fared well [9v 11p 11b]. I know of one person who got a 37 using this alone to study! Good luck to all."},{"Title":"COLUMBIA REVIEW INTENSIVE PREPARATION FOR THE MCAT","review":"This book was a dissappointment. I found the chemistry and biology sections to be lacking in their explinations of concepts vital to the MCAT. The testing sections were full of mistakes, something I found to be quite frustrating.

In addition, the tests have many mistakes! After having done a few passages, I started carefully picking through them after I had finished and found a few answers which directly contradicted the passages - these practice tests served only to confuse me. It feels as though no one proofed this book.

This is the most dry, overly clinical, forgettable retelling of these stories -- geez, of any murder story -- that I can imagine. There is no suspense, no insight, no artifice, no writer's voice.

I can't underline enough how dry this work is."},{"Title":"Murder in the Heartland","review":"I bought this book because I am a forensic pathologist and wished to learn what another professional chose to write and how he wrote it. I could not have been more disappointed! While an average reader such as the one who wrote the review I read might not notice the inconsistencies, they ruined the book for me. I would have been quite willing to accept one or two, but when the number became much, much higher, I found myself wishing that Dr. Dix had chosen not to write a book at all. I have no knowledge of him, even though we are a relatively small group, perhaps 4-500, and over time we do get to know one another. He may be one of the best forensic pathologists in the country, but that did not come across in the book, in my opinion.

Very cute story!"},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel (Picture Puffins)","review":"I was reluctant to pick up this copy of Hansel and Gretel because of the illustrations. I thought they were too comic, really. Hansel and Gretel is supposed to be a dark, scary story with mean mommies, starvation, and cannibalism! I was sure that the cartoony illustrations portrayed a light and funny version. And while some people prefer light and funny versions, I'm not one of those people.Well, I was wrong! This version hews very closely to the one I learned as a young kid reading a tattered fairy tale collection. The mother is wicked, the father is weak-willed, the witch eats children (nobody turns into cookies, thank you very much). The author even remembered the detail about Hansel originally leaving out pebbles, and about a bird bringing them across the lake to home!This was a very pleasant surprise for me, let me tell you.The illustrations still aren't my thing, but this book has a well-deserved place on my bookshelf.A word of warning: Obviously, this story can be scary for some children. While many children LIKE scary stories with their chills and thrills, just as many don't. I assume you know your own kid best, so please just use your judgment about this book, and if in doubt, read it before you buy it :)"},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel (Picture Puffins)","review":"Hansel and Gretel *is* a scary story, but James Marshall (\\"Miss Nelson is Missing!\\") illustrates it marvellously. At first I thought the illustrations were going to be too clownish and cartoony, but there is a lot going on in every illustration. The forest is dark, the candy house is irresistable, and the witch is not nearly as scary as the mother. (!)Kids are resilient and good at solving problems in their own ways. That goes for Gretel -- this book shows her trusting her instincts. And for Hansel -- he figures out how to track his way back through the woods. Of course, you can't always plan for those unintended consequences.Very well done fairy tale. Much longer than our other James Marshall fairy tales. We like it very well."},{"Title":"Hansel and Gretel (Picture Puffins)","review":"I love this book....great illustrations...perfect for catching the imagination of my speech delayed 4 year old...but I agree with the first reviewer who said that the words are a bit scary...a la fratured fairy tales..so no problem, I changed the words as I read the story...because I don't want to explain why the woodcutter's wife actually was bad and wanted to leave the kids in the woods..but here is the funny part, my son figured out the whole story anywau and he loves it.

[To me the mother is portrayed as being scarier than the witch.] In mom's case, faced with starvation, it is she who suggests leaving the children in the woods. In dad's case, he doesn't have the backbone to stand up to her, and thus he falls to villainy as well.James Marshall stays with the original aspects of the story although he gives it his own twist with his highly distinctive art style.On the positive side, the story highlights the children's creativeness in solving their problems. It ends with them coming home to the loving arms of their father. Their so-called mother has died while they were being held captive by the witch.Four Stars. [B-] Marshall's usual clever artwork.

They have a wonderful funny twist whereby the characters are drawn from ancient mythology and placed in present-day Thailand, but you don't need to know anything about Thai literature to enjoy them. Reading these stories, I felt as though I were in the presence of a Thai Eudora Welty, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to share in her world."},{"Title":"Education for an Information Age: Teaching in the Computerized Classroom","review":"This book presents an introduction to the field of educational technology. The table of contents, with all of its varied topics is quite promising. However, the execution is not very satisfying. Much of the text seems to be descriptive, presenting historical details of educational technology, instead of instructing teachers how to use it, or getting them to think about it. For this reason, it's rather dry and un-engaging-it seems to approach the issues but never quite meets them head on with details.The book is filled with inaccuracies or ambiguities. For example, on p. 278 Poole writes \\"Ironically, whereas in 1950 three out of four high school graduates went on to pursue a college education, by 1900 that ratio had fallen to two out of every four, a drop of 25 percent!\\" Hmmmm. As an example of computers helping students with disabilities, the author draws repeatedly on an article about facilitated communication. Wasn't that disproven with double-blind tests years ago? (In facilitated communication an aide helps a student with severe communication difficulties to type by \\"holding their hands steady\\" as they type. Some researchers didn't believe it was really the students typing, so they showed pictures to both aides and students, individually so that they couldn't see each others' pictures. Then they had the students type what they saw with the aides' help. Funny enough, the students \\"typed\\" only what the aides saw, never what the students saw, despite the fact that the students never saw what the aides saw.) The book includes questions at the end of chapter. Sometimes the questions are about the material in the chapter itself, and sometimes about the feature article at the end of the chapter (not always related).Some of the graphics in the book are blurry, and a few are illegible. However, the pictures are great, and would be useful as discussion starters. In general, though, I wouldn't recommend this text. Instead, I would choose alternatives such as Geisert &amp; Futrell's Teachers, Computers, and Curriculum, Morrison's Integrating Computer Technology into the Classroom, or Jonassen's Learning with Technology."},{"Title":"The Interlinear Hebrew-Greek English Bible: Vol. 2: I Samuel-Psalms","review":"This Interlinear is an absolute must for anyone studying to show themselves approved.

If you want a brief, graphic outline effective at stirring your emotion and imagination stay away from this book. If you want in depth and have the time... check this out.Boyce Thorne-0Miller took a interesting approach to a difficult assignment. She sets out to catalogue man's negative impacts of the sea and threats to oceanic biodiversity. She begins by outlining the definitions and necessity of biodiversity. Then chapter by chapter, topic by topic gives us the potential for various human-ocean interaction to damage it. She backs up her conclusions well with explanation and statistics and goes to great length to explain her deductive reasoning. This book would only be a bore to a person who doesn't have a serious interest in the subject and a little bit of a biology background. I would use this as a text for an undergraduate course on marine conservation biology. I would also suggest it for people with more than a cursory interest in marine conservation.

I have a BS in Marine Science and I found that this book shows the reader how complex and inter-related the oceanic systems are and how many of our activities can, AND DO, adversely affect those ecosystems. I feel this book would be a great way for anyone interested in protecting the ocean to become familiar with the spectrum of destructive activities affecting the one element that allows for life to live on this planet. Chapter by chapter there is a different ecosystem and how it is in danger of losing its marine biodiversity. In addition, the author does a great job defining many of the science terms. However, not all casual readers may find this book an easy read because they may not have the understanding of the various oceanic ecosystems."},{"Title":"A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion","review":"This piece of pro-abortion propaganda, charading as scholarship, is seriously misleading. Some problems:1) The authors ignore the anti-abortion position of the early, patristic church. The Didache, Tertullian, and Athenagoras categorically condemn all abortion, regardless of what stage at which it is performed.2) The authors rightly show that Augustine and Aquinas supported the theory of delayed animation, but they fail to show that these authors also categorically condemned abortion at all stages. Later abortion was more gravely evil than an early abortion (just as first-degree murder is more evil than second-degree murder), but all abortion was condemned as wrong. The canon law of the same period showed the same graded but clear condemnation of all abortion.3) The authors fail to explain to the reader the absurd biology on which delayed animation was based. Aquinas (following Aristotle), thought the female fetus became &quot;human&quot; later than a male fetus because the woman contributed nothing to conception! He also thought that the early human fetus was some sort of vegetable! No one today disputes the fact that from the moment of conception a huam fetus is purely human. It is not a tiny grapefruit or cat that suddenly becomes human at some later stage of gestation.4) From the beginning of its existence the Catholic Church has strongly condemned abortion at every stage. While its reasons for condemnation and the degree of condemnation have varied, its position has remained remarkably consistent. Its strengthened opposition to abortion at every stage is completely justified by new knowledge in genetics and gestation. Every human person's history has a radical beginning at the moment of conception."},{"Title":"A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion","review":"The authors of this book go into great detail on the history of abortion in the Catholic Church and Catholic tradition. They look at the views of St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas and trace thinking on abortion throughout history. They show how Catholic thinking has changed as scientific and medical knowledge increased and changed as well as looking at the views of society. Although the book can be slow in places, the author's points are very interesting and show that the abortion debate within the Catholic Church is not a simple, clear-cut issue. While the authors are not theologians, and do not pretend to be, their discussion is interesting, informative and relevant."},{"Title":"A Brief, Liberal, Catholic Defense of Abortion","review":"It's enlightening to learn the gradual ensoulment of the fetus was Catholic dogma before the 17th cent, taught by Augustine &amp; Thomas Aquinas.After that time the immediate infusion of the human soul was taught to occur at conception. A strong case can be made for a vegetative soul, then an animal soul, preceding to the human soul in the last trimester. &quot;the moral permissibility of abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is, AT THE VERY LEAST, an intellectually respectable view when the history of Catholic thought on abortion is considered in its relation to the history of science&quot; the philosopher authors conclude.

George's 'The Clash of Orthodoxies.' George, a Roman Catholic, is a professor at Princeton University.The following is an excerpt from the Seattle Catholic article by Anne Barbeau Gardiner:The authors make a sharp distinction between the unborn child being \\"merely human\\" (i.e., having human parents and genes) and being \\"a human person in some morally relevant sense.\\" Their most striking and pervasive analogy in support of this distinction is the one between an unborn child and vegetation, as when they say, \\"The early fetus is obviously alive, as is grass.\\"In their view, the unborn child is like vegetation until very late in the pregnancy when sentience begins, a term they define as the capacity to perceive pain. They argue that sentience arises only when the central nervous system is functioning. Oh, but what a slippery slope this is! They keep shifting the date when the unborn child attains this mysterious quality. First they say it is hard to tell if there is \\"a morally considerable being at twenty-four weeks of pregnancy or not until twenty-eight weeks.\\" As it turns out, they are unsure the unborn child has sentience until the eighth month. Even then they declare vaguely that \\"the fetus becomes morally considerable between twenty-four and thirty-two weeks when sentiency, and then the cerebral cortex, starts to function.\\" The thirty-second week verges on the ninth month!The authors inform us that performing an abortion on a \\"nonsentient\\" child (which, as we have just seen, can be up to the eighth month) is like mowing the lawn. Here are their very words: \\"It is unclear to us, however, why killing a nonsentient being is rash or precipitous. We do it all the time with equanimity when we mow the grass.\\" Elsewhere they say that an abortion is \\"like pruning one's rose bush.\\" These are chilling analogies. But do they actually work as analogies? No. For when one prunes a rosebush, it is to make it bloom more abundantly; when one mows the grass, it is to make it grow thicker and stronger. But when one aborts a child, does that child's capacity to grow improve? Not a bit. Little wonder that the authors attack the pro-life film The Silent Scream as being \\"at best, misleading, and, at worst, fraudulent.\\" This heartrending film shows an unborn child in the throes of an abortion and makes it plain that there is no likeness here to grass or a rosebush. As ultrasounds reveal, a child in the womb reacts to touch after eight weeks, something that grass and a rosebush cannot do at any stage. ..."},{"Title":"Coaching Football's Midline Option","review":"The good news: This book is, by far, the best coaching resourceavailable for the midline option.The bad news: The book fails to adequately discuss complimentarygameplanning; namely, coaching points for the midlinebelly, and QB technique on playaction passes fromthe midline fake."},{"Title":"Coaching Football's Midline Option","review":"After reading Coaching Football's 50 Defense I picked this up, as well written as I had hoped it would be."},{"Title":"Coaching Football's Midline Option","review":"Great book to read for all coaches interisted in the Midline."},{"Title":"Mathematical Techniques","review":"Whether your personal focus is upon mathematics, engineering, physics, or even computer science or the arts, this work provides a superb instructional foundation for applied mathematics.Beginning with differentiation and integration, the text continues on its mathematical journey, taking the reader through complex numbers, linear algebra, differential equations, even LaPlace transforms and Fourier series. It then ends with overview chapters on such varied topics as graph theory, set theory, boolean algebra, probability and statistics. In addition there is a section devoted to using symbolic computing with applications such as Mathematica, which are essential to anyone interested in learning or using mathematics today.The overall look of the book is exquisite. The typefaces, equations and graphs are a pleasure to the eye (even as they grow substantially in complexity). The prose discusses the subject matter with rigor, yet is easy to read and guides gradually and carefully.Anyone wishing to review the fundamentals of mathematics or to further the education started through school will find this book to be a joy to go through. Solutions to many exercises are provided in an appendix.The softcover edition is highly durable. Upon completion of every chapter the reader will have substantial expertise in or exposure to major branches and topics of mathematics. For this wealth of information to have so low a cost is remarkable.Highest possible recommendation, with superlative marks in virtually all categories of review.** UPDATE FOR THIRD EDITION :The formatting of the book has been changed subtly but noticeably, maintaining the original elegance. Content has been changed and restructured minimally.Perhaps the most significant change, is that every one of the hundreds of exercises in the 41 chapters of this book has now been solved, and is available at the publisher's website in Acrobat (.PDF) format. The link is provided in the book itself.Additionally, there are far more Mathematica projects than earlier editions, several per each chapter in fact, and again, programmatic-solutions for all of these are provided at another site, its link also in the book. These are in .NB (Mathematica NoteBook) format, and can be read by any text-editor including Notepad. They can also be viewed and tested using Mathematica Reader, a free program distributed by Mathematica's author, available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.These significant updates fully address what was arguably the only previous weakness in this fine work."},{"Title":"Mathematical Techniques","review":"First, if you haven't noticed yet, this is NOT an advanced math book. Don't expect detailed demonstrations or complexe problems to solve. It is a global reference for engineers or anyone dealing with intermediate maths. If you want to explore the subjects covered in this book with deep details, you should buy a book per chapter.The content is well divided in numerous chapters, each covering a specific field like geometry, linear and vector algebra, calculus, Laplace and Fourier transforms and series, statistics (less useful, a complete reference is better). The book starts with a good introduction recalling important concepts required to understand the following chapters (partial fractions expansion, functions, complex numbers, matrix, algebra, etc.) Once you master these, you can move throughout the chapters and master or revise the math techniques with the great examples (well explained, they generally cover most of the possible cases).A complete set of problems with answers is available at the end of each chapter. The book is well illustrated, but a few graphs could have been more clear.A great reference book for any math user. Complete, it is an extended summary of a dozen of other \\"specific subject\\" books."},{"Title":"Mathematical Techniques","review":"Good comprehensive coverage of most things you'll need in 1st and 2nd year sci/tech courses in top end Uni's. However it lacks the rigorous formality of the more hardcore texts for Math degrees but will serve you well for engineering and physics related stuff (like it says on the cover).It's useful to note that this book won't guide you through the concepts and problems in an 'idiot's guide' step-by-step fashion. It's written under the assumption that you've done some higher+ maths for a while and have had some experiencing in muddling through things on your own. Moreover, much of the format is laid out in a summary type fashion with breif intros and a few examples culminating in a lucid statement of concepts. This approach is usefull especially after you've waded through heavy class notes and are gagging for something concise that puts the stuff in a nutshell....much needed clarity, like finally seeing through the smoke.The exercise problems are tough, ball breakingly hard in fact! Often leaping beyond the seemingly easy illustrations of the examples. You'll need help from other resources to get through them. Maybe this is deliberate as it get's you desperately banging your head against the wall and /if when you finally get the method right - you won't make the same mistake again.keep this book after you're done, it'll serve as a good reference thing as well."},{"Title":"Mathematical Techniques","review":"If you need as few texts as possible that cover all the maths you need for engineering purposes, this book is a must buy. Adding Kreyzig's Advanced Engineering Mathematics and maybe a Statistics text to it and you should have no problems with 99% of the maths for the rest of your life (unless you want to do substantial computer program design, in which a discrete maths text may help).A few problems though: a proper treatment on sequences and series is absent, l'Hopital's rule is not discussed either (both presumably because they are too pure maths for engineering, but some advanced engineering maths courses do use them), and there are some topics (like Simpson's rule) that are only discussed in problems sections but not in the main text."},{"Title":"Mathematical Techniques","review":"One big disappointment about the book is that, not only are few solutions to problems provided, there are a relatively large number of errors in the solutions which are presented.

It's an attack on Platinga and Forbes' views (well, and of course Lewis as well) concerning actualism, possibilism, modal realism, and related areas. It is poorly written, the arguments are unconvincing, and the logic, where it occurs, is unmotivated and uninteresting. There is virtually nothing novel to be found in the whole book, though I confess to not having read the *whole* thing. I made it roughly half way, and that was quite unbearable.

The story itself is a step down from the adventure that is The Gods of Mars and fails to come close to the excellence of A Princess of Mars. That being said, this is still a fun story.Burroughs concludes his trilogy with a chase across Mars. The story picks up 6 months after The Gods of Mars. John Carter follows the kidnappers of his wife across river, desert, jungle, fortress and ice. The story itself is, as with all the Martian Trilogy, quite entertaining. However, this book cuts almost all the human interaction out that made the first two books the classics they are.I have read this book some ten times, and I still enjoy it. As I've grown older I have discovered many Sci Fi authors and stories, but none that enrapture my imagination like the original Martian Trilogy by Edgar Rice Burroughs. This is a must read for anyone who enjoyed the first two books, as it actually has a final conclusion."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs did not intended to write a trilogy, but his 1914 pulp novel &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; completes the story begun in &quot;A Princess of Mars&quot; and continued in &quot;The Gods of Mars&quot; and finally brings John Carter and his beloved Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium (i.e., no cliffhanger this time around, boys and girls). The story picks up six months after the conclusion of &quot;The Gods of Mars,&quot; with our hero not knowing whether she is dead or alive in the Temple of the Sun of the Holy Therns where he last saw here with the blade of Phaidor was descending towards her heart as the evil Issus, queen of the First Born, had locked his mate in a cell that would not open for another year. However, it turns out that the exiled leader of the Therns has reached the trapped women to rescue his daughter and to seek revenge on Carter for exposing his evil cult.The focus of &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; is on Carter's relentless pursuit of the villainous Thurid who have taken his beloved princess from the south pole of Barsoom across rivers, desert, jungles, and ice to the forbidden lands of the north in the city of Kadabra where the combined armies of the green, red and black races attack the yellow tribes of the north, thereby justifying the book's title. It is interesting to note that Carter's heroics in this novel have the same sort of over the top implausibility we find in contemporary Hollywood blockbusters as ERB pours on the action sequences one on top of another. Whether he is scaling towers in the dark of night or surviving in a pit for over a week without food and water, John Carter is a manly hero in the great pulp fiction tradition of which ERB was an admitted master. Overall, the Martian series is Burrough's best work, avoiding the repetition that overwhelmed his Tarzan series and providing a lot more creativity (ever play Martian chess?). There is also, Dejah Thoris, one of the great names in science fiction history."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"If I had to be stuck on a desert island with only ten books, the Barsoomian trilogy (Princess of Mars, Gods of Mars, and Warlord of Mars) would be three of them. Warlord wraps up the tale as Carter takes up the trail of the incomparable Dejah Thoris, following her captors to the hidden cities of the polar regions, culminating in a battle that settles the future of Barsoom. All the breathless adventure, daring swordplay, hairsbreadth escapes, and dry humor you could ask for. Even more in control of his material than in the other two excellent volumes, Burroughs challenges himself both to keep in the established material about Barsoom and still invent new elements. If you have not read the Barsoomian trilogy, and you love SF adventure, buy it NOW! You will re-read it with delight the rest of your life."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"I will be 70 in three weeks and in that time I have never read any book or books by any writer that has ever held me \\" in the ready to defend myself while reading \\". I have many times while reading ERB books found myself at a point of feeling the excitement and the emotion of the moment, to the extent of having my hand knotted-up as if I were holding a sward and fighting for my life. He has such a way with words that he brings the moment alive in your mind. I love to read any of his books above any other writer.

No - I doubt even his most devoted fans would say so. Was he, in Mr. King's amusing phrase, a &quot;Great World Writer&quot;? Again, no - even the most forgiving literary critic probably wouldn't bestow that title upon him. Was he, however, a born storyteller with a (literally) wonderful imagination? That I don't think anyone would seriously argue.Burroughs' Martian novels, as I have said elsewhere, are great fun for both the the young and young at heart. Think Errol Flynn in outer space and you've got the basic idea. Escapist fiction doesn't get much better than this."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"This book was written in 1913 and is still being read today, in 2011. It lacks the punch it carried when written, everyone knows too much now about the conditions on Venus and Mars but when we read fantasy we set aside certain facts, Hence Burroughs writes as though the conditions on Mars are earthlike, except for gravity, permitting John Carter to be Superman for his day. Earth at that time gloried in war, although face to face combat was disappearing. But not so on Burroughs worlds, his hero John Carter gloried in his fighting ability, using antique weapons. The warriors of Venus and mars acknowledged his prowess and spread his fame all over. How then did Burroughs create tension, and hold interest? Carter's opponents were not his physical equals, so there were more of them. Also knowledge not known to Carter was available to them which they could exploit to their advantage and impede John Carter, Burroughs never let this knowledge be great enough to defeat Carter.So it was in Warlord of Mars. He sought his wife, the beautiful Dejah Thoris, so beautiful that she was stolen (kidnapped) and taken with some of the highest rulers of Mars to become their wife, not polyandrous, but one would prevail. So John sets out to foil their plans. He trails these men. Along the way he determines their purpose. He makes friends with various Martians, some piratical, some unknown to the other nations of Mars, but he unites them and unites Mars as much as possible given its warrior culture. If you like action there is a lot of fighting. Coincidences occur to allow the story to proceed but after all this is almost one hundred years ago, time enough for almost anything to happen. Frankly I read it for its old time appeal, or I should say reread it from seventy or eighty years ago. Try it, you might like it."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Sometimes the first three books are referred to as a trilogy as the first two books have cliff hangers.

Soon John, while in the process of chasing the capturers of Dejah Thoris, will come up against untold and unfathomed barriers to the end of the world.

Mullen (1969-70) gives a detailed table of Edgar Rice Burroughs novels from 1911 through 1915. In them, he lists the times and circumstances in which a heroine is threatened with rape (the \\"fate worse than death\\") and how she is saved in the proverbial nick of time. (As you may know, an Edgar Rice Burroughs heroine is frequently unclothed but always pure and virtuous.) For those readers interested in such statistics, there are 76 cases recorded by Mullen.In _The Warlord of Mars_ (_Argosy_, 1913-14), there are at least three such incidents recorded for our moral edification. In each case, Dejah Thoris is the threatened heroine. In the first case, she is threatened by the yellow Martian king Salensus Oll (even his name is oily). In the second instance, she is kidnapped by the white Martian Matai Shang, his brave but ruthless daughter Phaidor, and the black Martian Thurid. And in the third case, she is menaced by a band of yellow Martians, who plan to preserve her \\"as a plaything for [the] nobles\\" (151).Mullen states that in each case, Dejah Thoris is rescued by the stalwart John Carter. This is certainly true of the first and third cases. But it is not strictly true in the second case. Carter certainly _attempts_ to save her, but he is not really very effective. It is disagreement and double-crossing among the villains that really preserves the honor of the Princess. (Burroughs heroines are frequently rescued by the hero, or they may save themselves. On rare occasions, the menacer may have a change of heart. Sometimes Providence-- in the form of lions, earthquakes, or passing pterodactyls-- may lend a hand.)All of the previous incidents occur in the latter chapters of the novel. But the sharp-eyed reader may have noted that I said that there were \\"at least three\\" fate-worse-than death scenarios in _Warlord_. There is in fact a fourth one as well, and it is truly remarkable. Near the end of chapter one, Matai Shang and Thurid, on friendier terms than they are at the close of the novel, are in a boat plotting how to make John Carter's life more miserable. Unbeknownst to them, Carter is following in another boat and listening to them. They have Dejah Thoris prisoner. Thurid generously allows Matai Shang first turn: \\"You shall have your way with her before another day has passed\\" (15). Carter refrains from slaying \\"the vile plotters\\" (16) only because they are the only ones who can lead him to Dejah Thoris. And then... _Matai Shang never gets around to having his way with the princess for the next twelve chapters_! This is not quite a record in Burroughs's novels. In _The Gods of Mars_, we learn that Thuvia has been a slave to the white Martians for 15 years without being molested. Still Dejah Thoris's good fortune is certainly worthy of comment.One final note. The female speaking in the quote above is _not_ a virtuous heroine. It is the imperious, willful, sometimes villainous Phaidor who will attempt to kill Dejah Thoris on several occasions. Perhaps some future Burroughs scholar will compile a list of Not So Nice Girls who are menaced by the fate worse than death."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"I downloaded the book so that I will have something that I may want to read.

The fact that the first three books cover a continuous story, with a definite conclusion in this third book, also points to it being written a true trilogy.

It finds our hero, John Carter, awaiting the barsoomian year out, in hopes of finding Dejah Thoris still alive. This book has several twists and turns in it, as expected for those who read the first two books.Like the two books before this, the author has created a superb mix of science fiction and adventure. The fast moving action in this book did cause me to read it much quicker than I planned. Once I started, I had a difficult time putting the Kindle down to take a break. Rather than repeat what was in the other books, this one takes us further around Barsoom, and explores the polar regions. Along the way, John Carter managers to unite the various fighting tribes and cultures into a single force.Although these books were written almost a century ago, they are timeless. I constantly marvel at the author that imagined the possibility that earthlings were not the only inhabitants of the universe, before space travel was even remotely possible. Today, we have Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Gallactica and numerous other space travel shows to help generate the idea that we could travel to unknown planets in the future. For Edgar Rice Burroughs to have imagined the travel and characters he did was truly amazing, in my humble opinion. I believe only more time will tell us if he was correct in choosing Mars as a habitable planet.Upon completing this, the third book in the Princess of Mars/John Carter series, one could easily conclude the series is finished. This volume has a definite ending, unlike those first two books. Enjoy this book, but be warned, there are 8 more books in the series, to be read with joy and amazement."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"I first read one of this series when a kid. I don't know how I came across it, but I was so fascinated that I read every one I could get from the library -- probably most of the series. That was a long, long time ago.I often thought of John Carter, and even started a book of my own based on similar principles. Nothing much came of it, except that my son and his friends would pass around and read each chapter as soon as I finished typing. I would sit with them and tell them about John Carter of Mars. They were very interested but, unfortunately, the local library did not stock any of the series.When I searched Burroughs on Amazon, I came across the John Carter series and felt as if I had found an old friend, missing for sixty years. I downloaded them and once again read every volume, almost straight through.Burroughs knew how to tell a story, and freed himself from the constraints of earth gave free rein to his imagination -- which never was that much tethered. A key attraction to Burroughs is that he feels no need to be politically correct. Even in his own time, much of his theories were out-of-date. His concepts of race, honor and merit cannot be expressed today, even in fiction. I suspect this is why the libraries do not make his books as available as they should be.I particularly think these books make good reading for young teenage boys. Some would object to the racial overtones, but these are part of the plot. Mainly, Burroughs teaches honor, bravery and loyalty -- traits that are considered quaint and antiquated today.This is the last of the series, and should be read last.

Very fun to teh point of being silly."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Barsoom100 Years ago, Edgar Rice Burroughs started writing stories of John Carter and Mars. 100 Years later, people are still thrilled to read the books that came from these stories. I have seen one movie made from this series, and it wasn't that good. Now, Disney has gone all out to film \\"John Carter\\". Yes, there will be differences in the film as opposed to the book. But from what I have seen, there are many characters in the movie that I feel I know personally. I am looking forward to seeing this film like no other that I can remember.I first read the second and third of these books when I was just a kid more than 45 years ago. I had no idea, at the time, that there was a third book in the original trilogy. I eventually bought a \\"two-in-one\\" hard copy (from a book club) of what I thought was the only two books in the series (The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars). I read that book so many times that I had to apply glue to the spine a few times to keep pages from falling out.A great many years later, I was in a book store and decided to look for copies of the book that I had bought and loved as a boy, as my copy was getting pretty worn. Imagine my surprise when I saw a shelf full of the tales of John Carter and Mars.I was thrilled about finding that there was a book that predated the two that I had, and I strained my bank account when I found the rest of the series on the same shelf. I bought every book in the series that day.1 - A Princess of Mars2 - The Warlord of Mars3 - The Gods of Mars4 - Thuvia, Maid of Mars5 - The Chessmen of Mars6 - The Master Mind of Mars7 - A Fighting man of Mars8 - Swords of Mars9 - Synthetic Men of Mars10 - Llana of Gathol11 - John Carter of MarsSince then, I have read and reread those books a great many times.The books I bought way back then still have a lot of life in them after all these years. After I read the entire series, I wrap them in plastic wrap and put them in a drawer beside my bed. Every few years, I get them out and read them again. You just can't beat a classic.One would hope that with the new movie coming out that Ballantine will maybe offer a complete set of these books. I know that I will be one of the first to buy them if they do.And yes, I still have that very first book that I bought when I was a very young man a great many years ago. :-)"},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"I felt really good while reading the third book and I really loved the ending. Somehow the adventures managed to stay fresh even when they were outwardly the same. (Even though John Carter gets thrown into yet another dungeon, his experience and rescue is original.) I really liked the description of a camera that could take a picture and have five copies arrive at five different places that are all far away! I can't imagine anyone reading the first two books and not following them with this one but I'll make it formal: I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"I'm a fan of Burroughs and the Mars series, but I can't give this book five stars. One of Burroughs great strengths is his sense of drama, and his ability to make fantastic heroes believable.But in Warlord of Mars, he goes just a bit overboard. Coincidence as a major plot device was always one of ERB's weaknesses. In Warlord nary an event goes by that isn't influenced in a major way by unlikely coincidence. Because his books are so much fun, we forgive him for this. But it just happens too often in Warlord, and it detracts from the book.Still, this is a fun read, and a must read after the first two books, because you are going to have to follow through to see when and how John Carter and Dejah Thoris finally are reunited. We meet a new Barsoomian race, and have a final confrontation with villains we first met in \\"The Gods of Mars\\". Its nonstop action from start to finish, and introduces what was undoubtedly one of the first, if not the first, \\"dungeon crawls\\" in fantasy literature.Warlord concludes the opening trilogy of John Carter and Dejah Thoris. Warlord is in the public domain, so make sure to get the free Kindle edition, or download it for free also from Operation Gutenberg's web site."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"John Carter starts out mourning the loss of his beloved Dejah Thoris, trapped by some bad guy at the end of the last book with an evil tempered competitor for John Carter's affections. Our hero chases his beloved from one pole of Barsoom to another, encounters another race of Mars, the yellow men, and kills, cliff-hangs, occasionally stumbles, and eventually rescues his princess.On the one hand, only one new race was introduced in this book, the yellow men, to compliment the green, red, white, and black men (and I'm limiting it to sentients). This is a little disappointing, as his average is down, but some of the monsterous creatures introduced, like the sith (lower case to distinguish them from the Sith ofStar Wars Prequel Trilogy), are very impressive and add to the story.Like all of the Barsoom stories, \\"Warlord of Mars\\" has the values of a different era. These are not self-rescuing princesses, everyone recognizes John Carter's Earthly superiority, combat is recognized as a viable approach to problem solving, and so forth. But the series is free of the sarcasm, irony, and self-righteousness that are hallmarks of contemporary fiction. These books have an authenticity that has been lost in an era of over-sensitivity and pessimism.Leave critical thought and excessive sensitivity on the porch, go on to Barsoom and enjoy.E. M.

I decided to read it to my 11-year-old son as a father-son bedtime story activity. We just finished Llana of Gathol. This book had the drama, action, and adventure that my son and I will remember together for a lifetime. You certainly would want to read the first books in the series ('Princess of Mars' and 'Gods of Mars') prior to this one. Warlord gives you the continuity of the first two books in the full ERB style. By the time you get to Warlord you're ready for a conclusion to John Carters adventurous rescue of his prized desire, Dejah Thoris. This is the culmination of what feels like unending high (and sometimes over the top) adventure resulting in John Carters ultimate recognition as Warlord.

It has pretty awesome descriptions, and is endlessly creative in the people, and places he visits on his escapades. There is never a boring moment, and there are very few breaks in action. Read it at a time when there will be few interruptions because it is hard to put down (as the hero is almost always in mortal peril)"},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs concluded John Carter's first cycle of adventures on Mars -- sometimes referred to as the Martian Trilogy -- with the serialized publication of The Warlord of Mars in 1913-1914. At the conclusion of the previous installment, The Gods of Mars, the future of John Carter's beloved princess Dejah Thoris was in grave doubt. Having proven that the centuries-old Martian worship of Issus was falsehood perpetuated by power-hungry members of the Holy Therns and the First Born races, Carter set about destroying the religious infrastructure in order to free Barsoom from the false promises of the Issus-worshippers, where devotion is repaid with slavery and violent death. But Carter's quest to spread the truth is not without a price, as in repayment for his actions Carter's enemies lock the one he holds most dear in the vault at the center of the Temple of the Sun -- a room that can only be accessed once per Martian year. Seconds before the door closed, Carter saw Dejah Thoris nearly stabbed by Phaidor, the daughter of the head of the Therns and his avowed enemy since he spurned her romantic overtures. Living with the torment of not knowing whether his beloved wife is alive or dead, Carter has worked furiously to discover a way to free Dejah from her prison -- but his enemies will do anything to get to her first and claim her as their own. Fighting men who have nothing to lose, Carter chases news of Dejah across Barsoom, confronting countless new enemies, challenges, and even climates in his single-minded quest to save his imprisoned wife.The Warlord of Mars is the slimmest of the first three volumes in Burroughs's John Carter of Mars series, but it is every bit as action-packed as its predecessors. Unlike the first two Carter novels, there is no prologue from Edgar Rice Burroughs, no preface to the following action from Carter to his \\"nephew\\" and guardian. The action opens a few months after Carter deposed the fake goddess Issus , with our hero deep in the throes of his search for a way to rescue the imprisoned Dejah and Thuvia, the latter a former Thern slave instrumental in aiding Carter when he returned to Mars in hostile territory at the beginning of the second novel. Whereas the previous novel saw Carter dealing essentially a death blow to the age-old Martian religion, exposing it as a cult, this follow-up adventure is largely concerned with the fall-out of that successful assault and sets up endless possibilities for future battle with the false religion's deposed leaders. Is there ever any question of Carter's ultimate success? No -- but that is part of the fun and magic of these books. Burroughs was a master craftig non-stop action sequences and building tension and suspense in his novels. Just when you think that surely Burroughs's imagination must be tapped out, he introduces new people, places, and customs to challenge Carter's seeming invincibility. Predictable? Sure, such is perhaps the nature of pulp fiction. But in the hands of a master like Burroughs, he proves that the journey is always a worthwhile and entertaining ride.John Carter's third Martian adventure is just as fast-paced a rollicking adventure ride as its predecessors, and serves as a fitting capstone to the first \\"trilogy\\" within the overall series. When he was first introduced in A Princess of Mars, Carter was a man without a country or purpose, forced to make his way in a wholly alien world. In The Gods of Mars, Carter returns to Barsoom after an absence of ten years, and has to fight to reclaim the life he built with Dejah Thoris's people. The Warlord of Mars brings Carter full circle, forcing him to fight for the life he wants on his new home, culminating in a rather touching recognition of Carter's place and the esteem in which he's held by his adopted countrymen and friends. Having never explored pulp fiction of this ilk until recently, I remain thorougly impressed by Burroughs's work and in no little awe of his standing as a trailblazer in the science-fiction world. Barsoom is peopled with colorful peoples of wildly varied cultures, fascinating landscapes, and never-ending posibilities for adventure and death-defying escapades.These novels are sheer fun from start to finish. I adore John Carter's completely over-the-top, unbelievable invincibility and his old-fashioned heroic charm. I love how much he adores Dejah Thoris -- it could be argued that he's the anti-James Bond, since Carter is just as ridiculously perfect and appealing to women, but he's very much a one-woman man, and his love story appeals to the old-fashioned romantic in me. :) Snappily plotted, well-written, imaginative, and endlessly adventurous, The Warlord of Mars confirms me as an avid John Carter fan, and happily there is no end in sight when it comes to exploring Burroughs's backlist. Barsoom and its people are a world I love getting lost in -- escapist entertainment of the highest order."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"It is just fun, that John Carter can come back to earth and tell his experiences on Mars and that go back to have more adventures."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"This book (as part of the series) created the genre.

This is no Lord of the Rings but then again...it wasn't intended to be.The is a fun story with the universal theme of good vs evil.

He had begun three of his four primary series and was rapidly gaining fame and fortune because of his breathtaking tales of adventure and romance. This displays no flagging of his creative juices. Burroughs takes Carter from one end of Mars to the other with some amazing creations on display in the interim. Here Carter has matured and but for two slips, betrays none of the stupidity usually associated with pulp heroes. (Unfortunately Burroughs made up for Carter's intelligence in later books by having Gahan of Gathol and Tan Hadron of Hastor become just shy of braindead.) With all the wonders on display in the book, though, one major flaw shines through: the ending. For those who have not read the book, you may want to look away at this point. Right after a spectacular extended fight scene which must leave the reader breathless, Burroughs has Carter face Thurid and Matai Shang in what one would expect to be the tour de force finale when good conquers evil and makes all well in the world. Only--well, it doesn't quite happen. Thurid and Matai Shang are running like scared rabbits when Carter catches them just as they turn against each other. Then someone else saves the day. Why Burroughs ended the book this way will always mystify me unless he really felt the butchery Carter would wreak on these two villains would offend sensibilities. The bloody deaths of both Thurid and Matai Shang at Carter's hands would have made for a great passage in the book. Instead, a literal deus ex machina appears to rescue our superman hero. If not for this anticlimactic scene, the book would deserve five stars. Ah, well..."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs novels have been handed down to me from my father who received them from his father. I just wanted to let readers know that around the age of 15 or so, I read all of Buroughs' novels. From the Tarzan stories to Carson of Venus to John Carter and Mars to the westerns to everything. Even though you can see the similiarities in all in how they were written with the same segments, I thought all the books were fascinating and well done. Considering the fact that these were written as early as 1900, the stories of Mars and Venus show the brilliance of Rice Burroughs. Lets not forget about David Ins ( i believe that was his name ) and the stories of the earths core. Burroughs was well ahead of his time and I am greatful that I was able to enjoy them."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"First written in 1914, this series of John Carter novels is perhaps the start of the science fiction writing about Mars.

John Carter \\"the prince of Helium\\" must fight with his beloved \\"pet\\" Woola, \\"As large as a Shetland pony, with hideous head and frightful fangs, he was indeed an awesome spectacle, as he crept after me on his ten short, muscular legs; but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty\\". One review called John Carter \\"a natural man\\", which seems appropriate. There is the undying love for Dejah Thorus and the final sly \\"Why not?\\" as he draws her close after the triumphs. Carter is a man of courage, and that word spoken from an unknown ally, leads him out of the tortuous Pit of Plenty.

Burroughs began writing it in June, 1913, going through five working titles; Yellow Men of Barsoom, The Fighting Prince of Mars, Across Savage Mars, The Prince of Helium, and The War Lord of Mars.The finished story was first published in All-Story Magazine as a four-part serial in the issues for December, 1913-March, 1914. It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in September, 1919This novel continues where the previous one in the series, The Gods of Mars abruptly ended. At the end of the previous book, John Carter's wife, the princess Dejah Thoris, is imprisoned in the Temple of the Sun by the vile pretender goddess Issus. It is said one has to wait an entire Barsoomian year before the room the prisoner is in revolves back to the entranceJohn Carter discovers that a First Born knows the secret of the Temple of the Sun and he and the Holy Hekkador Matai Shang want to rescue the Holy Thern's daughter, who is imprisoned with Dejah Thoris and another Barsoomian princess, Thuvia of Ptarth. John Carter follows them in the hope of liberating his beloved wife. His antagonists flee to the north, taking the three women along. Thereafter John Carter follows them untiring into the north polar regions where he discovers more fantastic creatures and ancient, mysterious Martian races. These he overcomes in battle, and is later proclaimed \\"Warlord of Barsoom\\" by his allies. This book is the last to feature Tars Tarkas, John Carter's ally, in any major role; indeed, the green Barsoomians of whom Tars Tarkas is an oligarch disappear altogether from most of the later novels.Characters* John Carter: Protagonist of the first three novels. Carter is an American Civil War veteran, transported to the planet Mars by a form of astral projection. There, he encounters both formidable alien creatures and various waring Martian races, wins the hand of Martian princess Dejah Thoris, and rises to the position of Warlord of Mars.* Dejah Thoris: A Martian Princess of Helium, who is courageous, tough and always holds her resolve, despite being frequently placed in both mortal danger and the threat of being dishonored by the lust of villains. She is the daughter of Mors Kajak, jed of Lesser Helium and granddaughter of Tardos Mors, jeddak of Helium; highly aristocratic; and fiercely proud of her heritage. She is the love interest of John Carter. She was imprisoned by the Martian false deity Issus, at the end of The Gods of Mars. A central character in the first three Barsoom novels, whose capture by various enemies, and subsequent pursuit by John Carter, is a constant motivating force in these tales.* Tars Tarkas: A Green Martian, who becomes the ally of John Carter and at his behest, the overlord of his clan. An archetypal noble savage, and considered John Carter's first and closest friend upon Barsoom.* Thuvia of Ptarth: A Princess of Ptarth, who appears in The Gods of Mars as a slave girl rescued by John Carter from the Therns. She is later imprisoned with Carter's wife Dejah Thoris, in a prison which can only be opened once per year and remains by her side until the conclusion of The Warlord of Mars. Like many of Burroughs' heroines, she is tough, courageous, proud, and strongly identified with her aristocratic position in Martian society.Burroughs vision of Mars was loosely inspired by astronomical speculation of the time, especially that of Percival Lowell, who saw the planet as a formerly Earthlike world now becoming less hospitable to life due to its advanced age, whose inhabitants had built canals to bring water from the polar caps to irrigate the remaining arable land. [ Lowell was influenced by Italian astronomer, Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, who in 1878, had observed features on Mars he called canali (Italian for \\"channels\\"). Mistranslated of this into English as \\"canals\\" fueled belief the planet was inhabited. The theory of an inhabited planet with flowing water was disproved by data provided by Russian and American probes such as the two Viking missions which found a dead, frozen world where water could not exist in a fluid stateA million years before the narrative commences, Mars was a lush world with oceans. As the oceans receded, and the atmosphere grew thin, the planet has devolved into a landscape of partial barbarism; living on an aging planet, with dwindling resources, the inhabitants of Barsoom have become hardened and warlike, fighting one another to survive. Barsoomians distribute scarce water supplies via a worldwide system of canals, controlled by quarreling city-states. The thinning Martian atmosphere is artificially replenished from an \\"atmosphere plant\\".RaceThe world of Barsoom is divided by the territory of White, Yellow, Black, Red and Green skinned races. Each has particular traits and qualities, which seem to define most individuals within them. This concept of race is more like a division between species than ethnicity.The Warlord of Mars introduces the Yellow Martians, supposedly extinct, whom John Carter finds in secret domed cities at the poles. They are black-bearded, exceptionally cruel, and keep slaves, acquiring these by using a giant magnetic device which sends fliers off course, and allows the Yellow Martians to capture the occupantsNumerous novels and series by others were inspired by Burroughs' Mars books: the Radio Planet trilogy of Ralph Milne Farley; the Mars and Venus novels of Otis Adelbert Kline; Almuric by Robert E. Howard; Warrior of Llarn and Thief of Llarn by Gardner Fox; Tarzan on Mars, Go-Man and Thundar, Man of Two Worlds by John Bloodstone; the Michael Kane trilogy of Michael Moorcock; The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath, Through the Gates of the Silver Key by H.P. Lovecraft, the Gor series of John Norman; the Callisto series and Green Star series of Lin Carter; The Goddess of Ganymede and Pursuit on Ganymede by Mike Resnick; and the Dray Prescot series of Alan Burt Akers (Kenneth Bulmer). In addition, Leigh Brackett, Ray Bradbury, Andre Norton, Marion Zimmer Bradley, and Alan Dean Foster show Burroughs' influence in their development of alien cultures and worlds.A. Bertram Chandler's pulp novels The Alternate Martians and The Empress of Outer Space overtly borrow a number of characters and situations from Burroughs' Barsoom series.Robert A. Heinlein's novelsGlory Roadand , and Alan Moore's graphic novels of Allan and the Sundered Veil and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II directly reference Barsoom.In Philip Jos&eacute; Farmer's World of Tiers series (1965-1993) Kickaha, the seriThe Number of the Beastes' adventurer protagonist, asks his friend The Creator of Universes to create for him a Barsoom. The latter agrees only to make an empty world, since \\"It would go too far for me to create all these fabulous creatures only for you to amuse yourself by running your sword through them.\\" Kickaha visits from time to time the empty Barsoom, complete with beautiful palaces in which nobody ever lived, but goes away frustrated.L. Sprague de Camp's story \\"Sir Harold of Zodanga\\" recasts and rationalizes Barsoom as a parallel world visited by his dimension-hopping hero Harold Shea. De Camp accounts for Burroughs' departures from physics or logic by portraying both Burroughs and Carter as having a tendency to exaggerate in their storytelling, and Barsoomian technology as less advanced than usually presented.Furthermore, his Viagens Interplanetarias series of novels and short stories, especially those set on Krishna, one of Tau Ceti's inhabited planets, owe much to the premise of feudal co-existence alongside advanced technology pioneered within the Barsoom series.In 1989 Larry Niven and Steven Barnes published \\"The Barsoom Project\\", where a futuristic form of live action role-playing games (LARPs) is based on the Barsoom books.The Mars-based novels of Kim Stanley Robinson (published from 1992 to 1999) also offer several nods in Burroughs' direction.The 2008 novel In the Courts of the Crimson Kings by S.F. writer S. M. Stirling is an alternate telling of the Princess of Mars story but this time the princess is a very powerful character indeed.DC Comics character Adam Strange's method of transportation, the Zeta Beam, recalls the way Carter is transported to Mars.In the Commonwealth Saga novels by Peter F. Hamilton a group of humans who undertake unprecedented and often illegal genetic modifications of their own bodies are known as the Barsoomians, in apparent reference to Burroughs' creation.Richard Corben's Den series also appears to be inspired by the Barsoom series. It features a hero, Den, who mysteriously arrives naked on a (largely) desert planet where he becomes a great warrior and where the humanoids wear no clothes. Many of the creatures resemble the description of the white apes of the Gods of Mars. Like John Carter, he also receives great physical prowess from arriving in Neverwhere, although Carter's prowess stems from gravity, whereas Den undergoes a complete physical transformation.In Stephen King's novel The Dark Tower II: The Drawing of the Three, Eddie Dean compares the All-World and the quest for the Dark Tower to a Barsoom novel.The John Carter of Mars series was also felt to be one of the inspirations for the Dark Sun Dungeons & Dragons game world setting.In A Wizard of Mars by Diane Duane, the main character Kit is a major fan of the Barsoom series and a long dormant wizard artifact recreates Barsoom as Kit imagines it to communicate with him.I highly recommend this book and series to 12 -18 year olds who enjoy swashbuckling adventures and tales of derring-do.Gunner March, 2012"},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"ERB continues his epic adventure of John Carter into the Gods of Mars.

However, it turns out that the exiled leader of the Therns has reached the trapped women to rescue his daughter and to seek revenge on Carter for exposing his evil cult.The focus of &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; is on Carter's relentless pursuit of the villainous Thurid who have taken his beloved princess from the south pole of Barsoom across rivers, desert, jungles, and ice to the forbidden lands of the north in the city of Kadabra where the combined armies of the green, red and black races attack the yellow tribes of the north, thereby justifying the book's title. It is interesting to note that Carter's heroics in this novel have the same sort of over the top implausibility we find in contemporary Hollywood blockbusters as ERB pours on the action sequences one on top of another. Whether he is scaling towers in the dark of night or surviving in a pit for over a week without food and water, John Carter is a manly hero in the great pulp fiction tradition of which ERB was an admitted master. Overall, the Martian series is Burrough's best work, avoiding the repetition that overwhelmed his Tarzan series and providing a lot more creativity (ever play Martian chess?). There is also, Dejah Thoris, one of the great names in science fiction history."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Edgar Rice Burroughs covers vast expanses of Barsoomian territory in John Carter's whirlwind pursuit of his beloved Dejah Thoris. The gentle pokes in the eye at religion, evolution, science, and even racism continue but do not impede the readability of the story. Burroughs demonstrates his superb grasp of story-telling and the construction of adventure settings with a flair unsurpassed by any other writer of the 20th century.Carter finds himself charging headline into a myterious northern world where ancient and legendary yellow men have survived in the harshest Barsoomian environment imaginable. Coincidentally, in classic Burroughsian fashion, Carter uncovers an incredible weapon which could destroy the fragile alliance of Barsoomian nations he has assembled in his long battle with the evil Therns.The first three books of the John Carter series (A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars, and The Warlord of Mars) foreshadow the most breath-taking adventures that role-playing gamers could imagine three generations after ERB wrote these stories. These books also provide a glimpse into one of the most amazing and detailed worlds of fantasy and space opera ever to see publication. It's hard to imagine how anyone who loves action adventure, swashbuckling stories could go wrong in purchasing these books."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"It starts with a chase that doesn't slow down until the very end.In this third of many tales that occur on Barsoom (Mars), John Carter is hunting down his beloved princess, Dejah Thoris and Thuvia, Maid of Mars.Just barely over 100 pages, this is yet another quick, enjoyable read in the Sword and Planet subgenre of Science Fiction. Having read all but two of the Martian Tales of ERB I felt a bit too much Dejah Vu, if you catch my meaning. Indeed it makes one wonder why and how these women manage to get captured so frequently.There are a few notable moments to be had. I especially liked the brief encounter of John Carter with Torkar Bar and the scene in the appropriately named Pit of Plenty.There are also a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of the STAR WARS movies. The land of Okar reminded me at times of Hoth, with its cave creatures. Also the scene before John Carter is cast into the Pit reminded me a little of Jabba's palace with Princess Leia.John Carter himself comes across as a very strange character indeed. On the one hand he is clumsy enough to sneeze at the most inopportune moments, fails to realize why his Princess can't recognize him and completely forgets about things lurking behind curtains that he just spotted a moment before.On the other hand, Luck seems to favor John Carter in that despite some of these fumbles, he always manages to get out of a bind.It's hard to criticize these tales for what they are--Science Fiction of the light, buttery, fluffy popcorn variety--but just once I'd like to see John Carter get into a truly nasty situation.One where he may not even come out physically and mentally unscathed."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"\\"The Warlord of Mars\\" (1914) is the 3rd of ll John Carter novels from the pen of Edgar Rice Burroughs. It is a direct continuation of the first two in the series--\\"A Princess of Mars\\" and \\"The Gods of Mars\\"--and a reading of those earlier titles is absolutely essential before going into this one. Here, Carter tries to rescue his princess, Dejah Thoris, from the clutches of some particularly nasty villains. In his relentless pursuit, one that makes Indiana Jones look like a slacker, Carter travels from the south pole of Mars to the forbidden lands of the north. He encounters many varieties of monster, such as the apt and the sith, and gets into more fights and cliffhanging situations than a reader would believe could be packed into a mere 160 pages. The pace of the book is furious, never pausing for breath, and the final battle in the north polar city of Kadabra, in which the combined armies of Barsoomian green, red and black men attack the yellow tribes of the north, is thrilling in the extreme. What amazing films these first three John Carter novels would make, if done faithfully and with the requisite ... million thrown into each one!So why the 3-star rating? Well, there are numerous problems with the book that prevent me from giving it top grades, despite the fun I had reading it. For one, there are countless inconsistencies and implausibilities. For example, it is difficult for the reader to accept that Carter's enemies cannot recognize him, just because he has smeared some red tint over his skin. Difficult to believe that Carter is able to scale the side of a tower in the pitch black of night. Difficult to believe that Carter (or any man) could live in a pit for nine days without food and especially water. Verrry hard to believe that Thurid, Carter's archenemy, could carry the struggling captive princess over a foot-wide ledge without toppling into the abyss beneath. Impossible to believe that Dejah Thoris couldn't recognize Carter by his voice alone, despite his yellow-man disguise. All these are hard to swallow in the extreme. As for the inconsistencies: It is stated that Carter saved Thuvia from the Warhoons in book 2, when in actuality it was Carthoris, Carter's son. The city of Kaol is said to be rendered invisible by the forest that surrounds and tops it, but later it is stated that this forest is cut back from the city. Huh? Worst of all is the aforementioned tower-scaling scene, in which dusk becomes early afternoon in a matter of minutes. Here's something that Ed Wood would have appreciated! This day/night confusion is straight out of \\"Plan 9,\\" but for me is the hallmark of incredibly sloppy writing and even poorer copyediting. Further, Burroughs' descriptions of the Valley of the Therns, and its geographic proximity to the land of the First Born, are simply impossible to visualize. Throw in a bunch of misplaced modifiers and some awkward turns of phrase and you've got a real mess of a manuscript. So why did I have a tear in my eye by the book's end, when Carter gets his rewards and the entire city of Helium turns out to greet him? I guess that the power of storytelling can outweigh petty matters of consistency and grammar. And Burroughs WAS a great teller of tales, and this book IS as thrilling as they come."},{"Title":"Warlord of Mars (Martian Series #3)","review":"Keeping in mind that much of the outer space and Mars-related science fiction in this book is far out-dated--almost comically so--Warlord of Mars is really a quite enjoyable book, even today. Edgar Rice Burroughs, perhaps more famously known as the creator of Tarzan, is the consummate story-teller. This is richly plotted fantasy with highly suspenseful action scenes; strong imagery; clearly defined characters; and an inexhaustible pool of creative names like Barsoom, Dejah Thoris, and the Therns, which sink into a reader's psyche and never wear away. Burroughs is one of the classic writers of yore, capable of putting their hero in one seemingly impossible predicament after another, yet managing to extricate them at the height of suspense by some clever trick every time. No matter how many times we read this stuff, it never gets old.The John Carter series is mandatory reading for all serious sci-fi buffs. And one should definitely read the first two books in the trilogy before taking on this third and final edition.

For the serious student of geology or the traveller, this book provides technical information and excellent descriptions of the islands. It also illustrates the geological differences in the region. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Graphic design for the electronic age","review":"First of all, if you're in doubt about whether this book could still be useful 17 years after its publication, the answer is 'yes'. The author gives a reasonably thorough introduction to the production of printed matter (especially books), discussing such \\"timeless\\" topics as typography and page layout. He doesn't dwell on the technology of the time, so almost all the information contained in the book is still applicable today.The book was born out of an introductory design manual prepared by Xerox for its customers. It's informal in tone and all the jargon used is explained by the author, who assumes that his readers are new to the trade. Rather than prescribe exactly how a page should be laid out and what kind of typeface should be used in each situation, the author discusses traditional solutions and tries to give the reader enough information to enable him or her to make his or her own decisions. The author gives tips, but never presents them as the only, or even the best, solutions -- a refreshing approach for people who can't stand Robin Williams's arrogance (not the actor, but the author of 'The non-designer's design book' and 'The non-designer's type book').Now a warning: this book has a rather inappropriate title. For one thing, you'll find but passing remarks about anything electronic in the book (which is good, since that would have made the book completely obsolete for our day and age). But most significantly, this is not a book on graphic design in general: it's really an introduction to page layout and typography, with an emphasis on text-intensive publications, particularly books."},{"Title":"Graphic design for the electronic age","review":"This book is fun to read, with its ever tongue-in-cheeky sense of humor, yet all the while it provides a clear, authoritative explanation to not only the history and the WHY behind superior typographic style, but explains how to do it. I have used this book as a guide throughout my 16-year career in graphic design and advertising. As a creative director and layout manager, I make this book required reading for every designer who works with me. Even those with degrees in graphic design thank me, saying they learned a lot of things they never would have considered."},{"Title":"Gypsy at Almack's","review":"This is a perfect little gem of a Regency romance, a model of how very, very good this genre can be. Although I was led to believe---by several fellow writers who recommended it---that it was hilarious, it is not so much hilarious as tongue-in-cheek funny. Very funny. The author has an accomplished sense of humor. Lucy Saint-Clair, after 4 Seasons, has not taken. No suitors save an elderly baron one step away from sticking his spoon in the wall. Her Godmother Tabitha Theale, desperate, seeks help from her dissolute brother, Ernest, Lord Rune, to bring Lucy into fashion. Lucy is overweight, opinionated, devoid of most of the social graces, and equipped with fearsome, forbidding, thick, dark eyebrows. She is pitifully unaware of how to play the game at Almack's marriage mart. Ernest, jaded, older, tired of life, is jolted back to that life by the unexpected originality of this woman. Nothing he had ever thought he wanted, but, when the realization does hit that she is the only woman on God's sweet earth for him, he goes after her with a vengeance. (Takes him too long, but Regency heroes---think Mr. Darcy---are obtuse in the extreme.) This novel is peopled with wonderful secondary characters with wonderful names. Laurence Feather; Diligence, his housemaid and other; Cassy and Grace, the Theale sisters; Mina and Letty, who make too brief an appearance, Lucy's twin sisters; Tabitha, a determined mother and matchmaker; Sybil Rant, the unaccommodating modiste, who knows everything about everybody; Bibble, Puffwort, Pudder, and a slew of other well-meaning (and put-upon) servants. A delight for those who value well written prose and unusually lovely turns of phrase. It is a perfect little book. In romance novel parlance, a keeper. According to what I've heard, Chloe Cheshire aka Laura Amy Schlitz, is no longer writing Regencies. Now, that IS a shame!"},{"Title":"Gypsy at Almack's","review":"Brilliantly witty period piece; cure for Austen withdrawal.This is a brilliantly witty period piece; once you've read and re-read Jane Austen, this gives yousomething to read!

The author traces this back to Churchill's experience as a journalist in the Cuban revolt against Spain. His romantic nature, combined with the undisputed effectiveness of the guerillas, instilled in him a faith in guerilla warfare and its requirement of good intelligence. The book continues through Churchill's association with &quot;room 40&quot; during WWI, and his continued receipt of intelligence reports during the years &quot;in the wilderness&quot;. Naturally the bulk of the work concerns itself with the Second World War, the creation of SOE and the secret armies. The author delves into the &quot;special relationship&quot; between the UK and US and reveals in detail the serious conflicts between SIS/SOE and the OSS-an area that often does not receive much attention by historians. Churchill's second term as prime minister,and subsequent retirement conclude the work. What it shows is that Churchill, probably more than any other political leader, understood the value and the dangers of secret intelligence, and knew how to employ it (most of the time). His experience provides excellent lessons to those who collect or use strategic/operational intelligence,&quot;intelligence was not an end in itself and did not belong to those who produced it.&quot; Would that our current intelligence structure followed this advice..."},{"Title":"Churchill and Secret Service","review":"This is an excellent work from an author that thoroughly researches every detail of the subject before it is put to print. As all of Staffords work, the factual basis is unquestionable. Anyone that reads this work will have a deep understanding of the time period and the personalities involved."},{"Title":"Churchill and Secret Service","review":"As Stafford says that Churchill appreciated the value of good intelligence and how it could influence the outcome of any struggle .But on the whole I must express my profound disagreement on some of the information contained in this book. The LUSITANIA episode: Fortuitously-Magdeburg incident 26th August 1914- the Room no.40 of the British Admiralty cracked German Navy's tactical codes .Bulk of naval traffic related to the movements of U-boats and German High Seas Fleet it was able to read .Churchill as the First Lord of Admiralty was privy to this fact .What now follows is difficult to digest for a rational mind .If one were to believe the author the movement of U-20(which sank the American ship)was detected and all ships in the immediate vicinity warned of its presence.Message received by LUSITANIA but ship's captain instead of changing course continued with the voyage thus courting disaster. In other words author has implied the American ship was commanded by a mad man who sent her to the watery grave, a chain of reasoning difficult to follow.It looks as though Stafford wanted to defend the British leader from accusations of his detractors who have claimed the latter staged the incident to bring America on a collision course with Germany. It is very hard to accept Churchill's innocence in certain matters because I know him as a shrewd practitioner of Realpolitik .Desmond Morton ( an influential figure in the Whitehall corridors of power and later SIS officer )connived with Churchill to forge Zinoviev's letter which damaged Labour Party's electoral prospects in the early 20's. Coming to the Second World War, soon after the captitulation of France there came invasion hysteria . Now it must be said when it came to invading Britain the Nazi dictator was strangely reluctant . Early July 1940 Hitler disclosed his intention of invading Soviet Union to Schmundt his chief-adjutant and Von Brauchitsch the Army Commander-in-Chief .Churchill via ULTRA decrypts knew that much of German troop deployments along Channel coast was sham. Yet he kept up the invasion bogey because this was bringing public support. Later in January 1941U.S.Presidential envoy Harry Hopkins visit to war-torn Britain was stage-managed to draw American support for Britains' war effort. Author has demolished claims that Churchill sacrificed Coventry (heavily bombed by Luftwaffe on 14 November 1940) for protecting ULTRA. The target was identified very late but the argument that it was not brought to PM's attention sounds skeptical. Instead Crete was sacrificed .However I am of the view that Britsh Commonwealth forces could have defended the island without blowing ULTRA.The battle for Crete hinged upon the possession of Maleme airfield . A spotter aircraft could have been sent to show it had detected the approach of German aerial armada carrying elite paratroops instead of denuding Maleme defences for masking ULTRA.The exercise is cleverly contrived attempt to cover up British Middle East Command's lack of resolve in defending Crete.I endorse Stafford's view that British leader was not knowing Japanese plans to attack Pearl Harbor.However it is difficult to accept the naivete of US political establishment in this matter . Suffice to say the US intelligence had broken codes used by Tokyo to exchange information with Consul -General Kita in Honolulu.String of messages showing Japan taking unusual interest in Pearl Harbor were intercepted . One such message intercepted divided the place into five areas asked for exact location of Pacific Fleet warships and carriers . Washington correctly guessed this could be a grid system for a bombing attack.Had Roosevelt and his men been shrewd ,vigilant, the ensuing tragedy could have been averted The author has misinterpreted the train of events that led to the German intervention in the Balkans April-May 1941. It was Mussolini who dragged Hitler into the Balkan mess .On 28 October 1940 Italian troopsinvaded Greece . Invaders were soon bogged down which gave British the pretext to land troops in that country .Besides RAF bombers started operating from bases in Crete.They had the range to strike Ploesti in Rumania from where Wehrmacht drew bulk of its oil..British deployment also menaced the southern flank of German armies slated to take part in Barbarossa :invasion of Soviet Union .Germany intervened to neutralise the flank threat . Churchill's role in fomenting guerilla warfare in Nazi-occupied Europe forms underlying theme of this book. British leader's brush with partisans in the far reaches of the Empire during heydays of his youth made him advocate this mode of fighting. It must be said , however , in the final analysis the role of the guerillas in the victory over Nazi Germany appears minimal.Owing to reasons of geography guerilla warfare never struck roots in Europe,much of the continent lay inert under the Nazi jackboot.Exceptions being Greece , Yugoslavia where mountainous terrain favoured large -scale guerilla operations .Finally a few things I like about this book: Churchill during prewar years exaggerated the capabilities of Luftwaffe,failed to appreciate the role tanks would play in the coming war ,underestimated the threat posed by Japan . Information such as that he bought Spain's neutrality in the war through bribes , came very close to compromising ULTRA during the speech marking German invasion of Soviet Union , approved a plan to assassinate Hitler , 'Operation Foxley', came close to carrying it out. Upon reading this book I gained the impression that Stafford has condoned the British leader's misdemeanours ,author no doubt is a Churchill apologist. To me Churchill was the most reactionary politician thrown up by the Western World. He stroved to ensure the Britains' domination of the post war world .He resisted Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy not because they were fascist regimes rather to their interference with Britains' imperial interests. Neverthless a remarkable man ,patriot who presided his country's fortune at a critical time of her existence .To his credit it must also be said Churchill realised, unlike other leaders of the Conservative party, the threat posed by Nazi Germany could only be contained by entering into a defence alliance with the Soviet union .In June1940 he took the decisive step in his career by deciding to continue the war against Germany."},{"Title":"The Madonna of the Future: Essays in a Pluralistic Art World","review":"This book is a collection of articles and essays, most of which must have been published in The Nation, for which Danto is an art critic. They cannot and will not reveal any structured and clearly defined approach of art. They are an impressionistic progress through Danto's own writings. But Danto ignores anything that does not go his way. He ignores Bosch who is the negation of his beauty definition of Renaissance art. He ignores all those who deal with ugly subjects, even Goya and his drawings about the horror of war and many other subjects. He ignores television and video art, directly on these media (there is one instance in this book of the use of video art in a museum presentation : that is not television and video art, that is the use of video and television technology within the museum). He even relegates video and television art in the demotic field, that is to say art for the people, and this approach, borrowed from Hegel, is absolutely condescendent towards the people : people can only suck on the television pacifier because they are not able to understand and enter the sphere of real art. Danto is an aristocrat, like all art critics. He thus ignores the audience of art, the people who are bombarded with artistic forms everyday in the supermarkets, in films, on TV, and in all kinds of mediatic channels. Danto is a typical university professor turned into an art critic and who advocates and illustrates the dominant vision that art is IN the artist, IN the official art circulating system, IN the critic's analysis of it. I dream of a real republic of arts, arts FOR the people, WITH the people and BY the people. Not a submission of artists to the uneducated people but a constant permanent intercourse (and this implies exchange, and personal - even sexually and emotionally motivated - connection) between the artists and the wide audience that is bombarded with artistic productions. When I read Danto I think of what Spiro Agnew said about ephete intellectuals . Agnew was not a very kosher and clean character but he definitely had one point here : what is important in art is the effect it has on the widest audience possible through the various media that use artistic concepts and constructs to be effective. What I am interested in is not the self-satisfied belly-button titillation of artists or art critics but the real effect art forms have on people in general through channels that Danto does not even know, because he is totally locked up in his artistic ghetto. It's a shame because some of his ideas are interesting, orginal and even explosive. But he does not even know about it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Farewell: A Memoir of a Texas Childhood","review":"Three nights ago I had the pleasure of meeting Horton Foote when he spoke and signed at an Austin bookstore. One hears his clear, distinctive voice in the cadence of his prose. Mr. Foote doesn't romanticize the past; he just tells the story of his childhood, leaving the reader with a vision of life in a time when family counted for all and people spoke in whispers about the same types of violence, bigotry, and family secrets that now assail us in the media. For an established playwright, Foote meets the challenge of prose writing successfully. Readers of this book will want a sequel--to know what happened to the teenage Foote who says &quot;Farewell&quot; to small town Wharton, TX and travels by bus to Pasadena, CA intending to launch a career as an actor. Including a geneology page would have helped this reader.

If you didn't grow up in this era or in a small town, these stories may not have the charm I feel about them, but Horton Foote could bring a tear to a glass eye with his charming memories, and I will bet that he can tug at your heartstrings as well. There is a place for sentiment and burnished memories in this busy life of ours, and I found myself wanting more after reading this memoir.

Udall","review":"Its amazing how quickly we forget our leaders. After serving 31 years in Congress, running one of the most likeable Presidential campaigns in history, and nearly getting elected majority leader of the U.S. House of Represenatives, Democrat Morris Udall's political career was cruelly and tragically brought to a halt by Parkinson's disease. Once famed as perhaps the wittiest man in Congress (as well as one of the most effective), Udall died seven years after his retirement -- his sterling wit permanently silenced as the disease robbed him of his ability to speak. Most tragically, this man who -- with his brother Stewart -- co-founded both the current conservation movement and America's first Mormon political clan, died a forgotten figure, remembered only by a few political junkies like myself. Fortunately, however, Donald Carson and James Johnson have produced a wonderfully engaging biography of this man that gives us a warts-and-all portrait of a remarkable public servant. While giving ample reason why the man was so beloved, they also don't flinch from revealing why Morris Udall ultimately remained a mystery to even his own family. Unlike other political biographies, this book neither sets out to debunk or canonize Rep. Udall but instead stands as a sharp portrait of a complex man whose public service -- whether you agreed with his liberal politics or not (I certainly don't) -- made this country a better place.Written in a breezy, conversational tone that still manages to maintain a proper biographical distance, Mo follows Udall from his strict Mormon childhood in Arizona to his first election to the U.S. House. While a great deal of the book focuses on Udall's legislative achievements -- Udall was an environmentalist before it become trendy -- the best of the early chapters deal with Udall as a liberal upstart setting out to reform the stodgy House. As Udall himself would often wryly point out, his political life was often a bizarre tragic comedy of second-place finishes that ultimately became victories for others. Both of Udall's insurgent campaigns for both Speaker and Majority Leader ended in failure but sparked the revolution that overthrew (however briefly) the Congressional seniority system. The book's highlight is the detailing of Udall's 1976 campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination where he managed to finish second in a record number of primaries without ever once finishing first. If Udall didn't set the electorate on fire, he did distinguish himself by revealing himself to be one of the most genuinely witty Presidential wanna-bes to ever pop up on a primary ballot (or, as one columnist put it, &quot;Is Morris Udall to funny to be President?&quot; That's the 70s talking. As of late, some genuine and intentional humor in American politics would be a bit of a relief, I'd think.) The campaign made Udall famous for his wit but as this biography reveals, that wit often concealed a rather distant temperment that so focused on work that even his own children grew up calling him &quot;Mo.&quot; As a politician, Udall was that rare thing -- an honest and sincere compassionate liberal who actually saw big government as a way to help the downtrodden. Yet this same man who dedicated his life to helping strangers drove one wife to divorce and another to alcoholism and suicide. The dichotomy makes for a fascinating read and Carson and Johnson explore these issues without ever descending into lurid muckracking. The book concludes with a touching (and quite frankly heartbreaking) section dealing with Udall's final, brave, and tragic battle with Parkinson's Disease (which, as I read it, was also sadly reminicent of Ronald Reagan's -- another politician never given the respect that was his due -- current battle with Alzheimer's; another nefarious disease that, like Parkinson's, cruelly robs men and women of their dignity without reason or warning.)Despite the fact that, politically, I'm probably about as far to the right as the late Congressman Morris Udall was to the left, I still find myself mourning the comically tragic failure of his 1976 campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination. As the election was the first post-Watergate election and the Republican Party was going through one of its periodic near-deaths, the election of a Democrat was pretty much assured. All Udall had to do was win the nomination and, for four years at least, a one-eyed, 6'5, former probasketball player and nonpracticing Mormon named Mo Udall would have been President. Of course, the nomination didn't go to Udall but instead went to the far less witty Jimmy Carter. Considering the way the world was in the late 70s, its doubtful Udall would have had any a better time of it than Carter but instead of hearing that America's problems were due to &quot;malaise,&quot; a President Udall would at least find time to tell at least one corny, Ayatollah joke.

Udall","review":"Every student of U.S. politics or Arizona history should read this book. Carson and Johnson thoroughly and brilliantly chronicle the life of a man who profoundly influenced the course of America in ways that politicians of greater renown never did. The authors reveal how Mo Udall could champion the most liberal causes and yet gain the respect of someone as conservative as Barry Goldwater. Read this book and you'll wonder what turns America might have taken had Udall fulfilled his dream of becoming president."},{"Title":"Mo: The Life and Times of Morris K. Udall","review":"Morris King Udall was one of the great Democrats of the 20th century. After reading this book, you will see why - and you will also regard \\"Mo\\" as one of the greatest legislators of the last century. Rep. Udall certainly was one of the most complicated.The strength of this book rests in the writing style as the authors present a human portrait of a legendary politician who is model public servant. The writing is tight and the story is brisk. The book is a solid work that covers all the facts in Udall's public and private lives - warts and all. It is a perfect blend of personality and public policy as the book discusses Udall's towering legislative achievements regarding environmental protection and Native American rights, his legendary and futile White House run, all the while describing the price his career cost his family and, with heart-breaking impact, the toll Parkinson's Disease took on the legendary Arizonan and his unrelenting battle against the illness.By the end of the book, regardless of political persuasion, you will regret that there are no more Mo Udalls in public life today. And, you may lament, as I did, that Morris Udall never achieved his dream of serving as President of the United States."},{"Title":"Mo: The Life and Times of Morris K.

Udall","review":"Mo Udall receives comprehensive treatment by two authors who obviously respected and admired him a great deal in Mo: The Life & Times of Morris K. Udall. The book is organized into different sections: Mo's early life as a young man in Arizona, in the military and as a basketball player; Mo's efforts to reform the House of Representatives and his efforts to enter the leadership including a quixotic run for Speaker and a more serious effort for Majority Leader; some of his policy work, particularly on Arizona and Alaska interior projects culminating in the Alaska land preservation law of 1980; his run for the presidency in 1976 and aborted run in 1984; and his personal life including his three marriages and battle with Parkinson's. Mo Udall was considered a House leader despite never serving in the leadership. He was known for his sense of humor and was respected by people of both parties, including ideological opposite (on most issues) Barry Goldwater. Udall made a serious effort at being nominated to the presidency, a rare feat for a House member, particularly one not in the leadership. The Udall family dynamic, the sometimes rivalry, sometimes collaboration with his brother Stewart who left the House for the Kennedy Cabinet, is also on display. Serious biographies of House members are rare, but a great one of Mo Udall is offered here."},{"Title":"Dream Catcher","review":"This was a very interesting book because it had the ability to keep you focused on the objective at hand and still transform you from one setting to another in a very fluid manner.

On one occasion I noticed that a sentence went on for an entire paragraph. But once you think through the difficult verbiage, the content is gold. I've rarely read such profound insights into Christ, even from Puritan authors.One of the best things about the book is that Martin analyzes Gethsemane with the Deity of Christ in mind. He skilfully deals with questions like \\"Isn't it an imperfection in Jesus to request that the cup pass from him?\\" \\"Why would Christ need an angel to strengthen him?\\" \\"Why would Jesus, if He were God, be 'sorrowful to death'?

Unable to discover who she is or where she comes from, they take her in, calling her Chita (short for Conchita), and raise her as their own child. Chita learns about the sea, learns Spanish and mixes it with her own Creole patois. Her father, whom everyone thought was dead, coincidentally meets her toward the conclusion of the book, but dies before being able to tell her.There's not much else to the story. Lafcadio Hearn was passionate about languages, and that comes across clearly with this short novel. The descriptions of the islands, the waterways, the plant life are wonderfully detailed. Also, his telling of the storm and the havoc it wreaks are quite vivid and probably the best description of a storm in any book.Good as the descriptions are, they sometimes drag on and seem unnecessary, especially at the beginning of the story. And, as I said before, there's not much to the story. Events happen and that's that. No real conflict or resolution.The novel is a great look at the environment of the Louisiana bayous is the 1860's, but left me wanting something more."},{"Title":"Chita: A Memory of Last Island","review":"I have a keen interest in both hurricanes and South Louisiana.

This well-writen book may be dated with respect to some of its topical discussions, but remains highly relevant thanks to its excellent perspective and thoughtful conclusions.Laqueur, an experienced historian and political commentator, closely examines the uses and limits of intelligence in this 400-page book, including its excellent endnotes. His context is the spate of intelligence \\"failures\\" associated with the Vietnam and Cold Wars, and the investigations into those failures. The author spends some useful time on commonsense definitions, but the heart of the book is a series of case studies, including the so-called missile gap of the 1950's and the Cuban missile crisis. His analysis is pitched at the strategic level, and his findings are a recognition of the reality of life in the intelligence business, and of the limitations of what intelligence can accomplish for decision-makers. The Cold War was still undecided when Laqueur wrote this book; much attention is paid to the then-ongoing competition with the Soviet Union and its intelligence agencies. The closing chapter, with its eleven principles of intelligence, is worth the price of the book all by itself. There are no photographs or other graphic aids.\\"A World of Secrets\\" is highly recommended to students of the intelligence community as a clear-eyed look at a difficult but essential business, well worth purchasing even in used condition."},{"Title":"A World of Secrets: The Uses and Limits of Intelligence","review":"I continue to regard this book as one of the best available textbooks for inspiring informed student and entry-level employee discussion about the intelligence professional and its role in supporting policy-making.

I found both to be highly informative and helpful in taking care of my OMC engine and stern drive. If you want to completely overhaul the engine and/or stern drive, get the Clymers. The Seloc will show you how to overhaul your engine, too, but, if you want do routine maintenance on the entire boat; such as the steering, shift boxes, tilt, propeller, engine and stern drives, get the Seloc. The pictures are a little clearer and more crisp with the Clymers, but the Seloc is my pick for the most useful information. I have no intention of pulling the engine and tearing it down to the main bearings which the Clymers does an excellent job of explaining. I did want to know how to pull the exhaust manifolds and a general diagram of the workings of the engine and stern drive. The Seloc does it for me. It is about a fourth of an inch thicker than the Clymers and has all the specification in the back. Clymers has specifications dispursed throughout the book. The Seloc (which is Coles spelled backwards)does a good job of separating the differences in parts and procedures between the pre-1978 models and the post-1978 models. (Personally, I feel there is enough differences between the two to warrant a separate manual for each.)

The final verdict should be to find the two eras to be one and the same era, by a concordance of rational skepticisms. This collection of essays, perchance the philosophes to strike back, shows the inevitable reaction to the postmodern turn, with a return to renewed consideration of the original culprit history. We find there the birth of the modern and the postmodern together, witness the scrutiny of rationality in the period condemned for this trait. One should think Rousseau has outsmarted the lot, as he was pre-modern and the first postmodern, and the very one to ignite the modern, as a principal suspect. The problem was never the Enlightenment as much as the mechanized version of its significance.

However re-reading it I'm like, duh, it isn't that good after all.Well, what's good about it? As usual, the spooky, creepy atmosphere Carter Dickson (pen name for John Dickson Carr) could evoke at the drop of a hat. He can build it up so that you fairly scream at the end of a chapter, and a lot of the writing in SEEING IS BELIEVING is very effective. This is the book in which a stage hypnotist elects to entertain a house party with his celebrated vaudeville act, persuading suggestible Vicky Fane to try to kill her husband, who stands by like an idiot, with her choice of revolver or dagger. Dr Rich, the hypnotist (a sympathetic portrayal of a figure often written as a charlatan in the Golden Age literature) has substituted a rubber dagger that couldn't hurt a fly for the real thing, and yet when Vicky thrusts the dagger into her husband's heart it is discovered that someone invisible has switched the daggers yet again, and Arthur Fane lies dead on the floor in a circle of lamplight.Afterwards, to shut her up, the killer tries to give poor Vicky a severe case of lockjaw (tetanus) with the pin that her girlfriend has poked into her as a test to see if she was really \\"out\\" during the hypnosis or was she just faking.I have to say that, when the revelations finally came at the end of the book, Carter Dickson cheated like crazy. Could Dr. Rich's celebrated stage act be timed within seconds as Sir Henry Merrivale asserts? It had to be, otherwise the killer couldn't have proceeded with Plan A, but it's extremely unbelievable. And the killer had forty seconds to make everything work. Ridiculous. Plus, we find out that (a la Hitchcock's STAGE FRIGHT) the narration contains two basic lies, one in each of the first two paragraphs, and that is definitely not fair play.Finally, the heroine, Vicky's girlfriend Ann Browning, is one of Carr's most unappealing and nasty female characters. Usually his women characters are feisty, and bawdy, often in a way Jay-Z would approve of. Here, Ann is a drip who for some reason keeps unaccountably silent when a man tries to molest her. She's severely neurotic, and Phil Courtney, the hero, deserves better. I'm talking as if these were real people which I suppose is some kind of tribute to their creator.

A church as a member of the Church (of Jesus Christ)!Doing a search on Carl E.

The price is right too."},{"Title":"Principles of Lutheran theology","review":"Carl E. Braaten, Principles of Lutheran Theology (Philadelphia, Fortress Press, 1983)Professor (Systematic Theology at the Chicago Lutheran School of Theology) Braaten neatly divides the major issues of theology into seven key issues which are central to the Lutheran way of thinking. The title is slightly misleading, as the good doctor does take a few digressions to show the wider world views some of these principles, but these are useful to our end of understanding the subject.For a card-carrying Lutheran who has been through the drill with the Shorter Catechism and many, many sermons, this book has a few surprises, especially in the relation between Lutheranism and Catholicism. These are Dr. Braaten's seven principles:1. The Canonical Principle. Lutheranism is all about the authority of the scripture, but with several very important qualifications, which firmly separate the Lutheran way of reading the scripture from those who abide by an unvarnished sola scriptura (scripture alone). Luther believed the scripture said what it meant, and meant what it said. This principle discards centuries of allegorical readings of scripture, which began as early as the second century CE, with Clement of Alexandria and Origen. Balanced against this literalism is the realization that you still have to read the scripture with a critical eye. It can discount an elaborate allegorical reading of The Song of Solomon, yet be content with treating the Genesis story as metaphor, if that is what the original author intended! Luther's most important lens for examining scripture was that it must be a witness to the gospel and divinity of Jesus Christ. Luther showed great restraint in not excising James and Revelation from the canon (due to tradition) because they did not profess this gospel. Critical reading, plus Luther's primary theological insight, yielded \`the canon within the canon', comprised of John, 1 John, Romans, Galatians, and 1 Peter. Luther's second lens was the doctrine that \`scripture interprets itself'. This is the keystone behind virtually all modern Biblical scholarship. If a statement is difficult (and many are), see how the same words and ideas are used elsewhere in similar passages. This scrutiny feeds both theory (orthodoxy) and practice (orthopraxy), and our practice is superior to our theory.2. The Confessional Principle. I suspect that many practicing Lutherans are unaware of The Book of Concord, even if they are quite familiar with the Apostle and Nicene creeds and Luther's Shorter Catechism. From the outset, even before Luther's death, the reformers insisted on a doctrinal consensus, which brought together several \`Lutheran' factions in 1580, under the Articles of Concord. Even compared to other denominations which have confessions, the Lutherans elevate their creed to a place second only to scripture. The Book of Concord is not theology, but Braaten states that it's importance generates a lot of systems of dogmatics. And yet, there are several attitudes among Lutherans. These are a) repristination (neo-Lutheranism), a return to the doctrines of Luther and the confessions. b) liberal nonconfessional Lutheranism, a return to the writings of Luther himself, discarding the confessions. c) hypothetical confessional Lutheranism, discarding the confessions as statements from a pre-scientific age, hopelessly out of date today. They hold them as traditions, relevant where possible, but not \`normative'. d) anti-confessional Biblicism. Return to the Bible itself, getting their \`signals' directly from the Spirit itself', discarding tradition (what is not clear is if these people also discard Luther's guidance on scholarship). and e) constructive confessional Lutheranism, which the author considers the most adequate, and most consistent with the ecumenical principle (see below).3. The Ecumenical Principle This idea should be clear to all Lutherans who recite the Apostle's creed and say \`catholic church'. Luther and his early supporters had no intention of forming a new church. They stressed a reform of the Roman church, and considered themselves consistent with the first five centuries of catholic tradition. Per Article VII of the Augsburg Confession \`...the true unity of the church it is enough to agree concerning the teaching of the gospel and the administration of the sacraments.' To be sure, Luther said lots of things which rubbed the Roman church the wrong way. One of his central ideas was the \`priesthood of all believers' which erased the essential difference between the clergy and the laity. Ironically, modern Lutheran church practice puts enormous emphasis on the importance and unique status of a highly educated clergy. This \`small footprint' ecclesiology (doctrine of the church) means Lutherans are much more flexible in their relations with secular states (although this had serious repercussions in Nazi Germany). This principle is alive and well in the modern Lutheran church, which constantly builds bridges to other confessional churches.4. The Christocentric Principle This principle may be even more important than the canonical principle, as it defines what is scripture, and devalues parts of scripture which do not forward the gospel of Christ. The problem with the principle is that once we confess to the gift of salvation through faith in Christ, we are not really sure what \`salvation' is, and concrete talk of \`salvation' sounds strange to modern ears. And yet, this doctrine, soteriology, is bound up with two of Christianity's most important dogmas, the trinity and the incarnation of Christ the Son, as the man, Jesus. Things get even stickier when this doctrine supports a dual nature of man (essential in Luther's writings), which is less and less comfortable in our modern mind's furnishings. Oddly, one path to resolving this problem may be to revisit the OT, where this dualism was not so fundamental.5. The Sacramental Principle Here is where we are in for some surprises. Some modern Lutheran theologians such as Paul Tillich have proclaimed \`the death of the sacraments' in protestant churches. Well, no one told us about it, as we celebrate communion at every service, and we trip over the baptismal font at the back of the sanctuary, right where Luther said it should be. Here, I suspect Prof. Braaten is not well connected to what is happening in the hinterlands, or, things have changed since 1983. A second surprise is that Luther was really not at all far, in his conception of the Eucharist, from Roman Catholic theology. I find this an enormous relief. I could simply never see the pragmatic difference between Luther's \`dual nature' of the bread and wine and the Catholic doctrine based on Aristotle's metaphysics. It turns out that we are hard pressed to fit the thinnest of paper between the two dogmas. All of the heat over the Eucharist was with the Reformed theologians, and not with the Romans. The modern problem of the Eucharist is the same as the problem with the dual nature of Christ.6. The Law / Gospel Principle This is as much an issue of pastoral hermeneutics as it is of theology. We were raised on the notion that we contribute nothing to our attaining the gift of grace through Christ's sacrifice, and our pastors tend to sidestep issues of the law. Braaten says \`We are lulling people to sleep with the gospel when they should be roused by means of the law'. This is the age-old basis of OT wisdom, which is based on the fear of the LORD as in Psalm 2:11 \`Serve the LORD with fear, with trembling kiss his feet, or he will be angry, and you will perish in the way; for his wrath is quickly kindled'. Of course, the other extreme here is \`pharisaism', which reappeared with 19th century Pietism. The middle path of discipleship, such as that taught by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, may be the solution to being true to this principle.7. The Two-Kingdoms Principle This is not Augustine's vision of two cities. It is the problem of the interaction of dogma with both human rights and civil authority. Luther and his Reformation were saved by an alliance with the interests of the northern German princes, and he was inclined to separate their interests and allegiances. This, however, lead to cooperation between the German evangelical church with the acts of Hitler's Nazi government. Braaten professes that the church doctrines demand human rights for everyone, and it needs a policy which will stay by that principle, even if it opposes civil authority.This edition may not be up to date, but he does offer a very good picture of unresolved issues in Lutheran theology. For a practical look, see On Being Lutheran: Reflections on Church, Theology, and Faith (Lutheran Voices) by Timothy F. Lull and Mark S. Hanson"},{"Title":"Principles of Lutheran theology","review":"Carl Braaten is one of the leading Lutheran theologians in America today. This book is an excellent statement of theology, though it would be dry and technical for the regular lay person.It should not be the first such book that one reads. Still, it is solid theology."},{"Title":"Principles of Lutheran theology","review":"Excellent piece. But could have been written in a simpler language for someone with a limited background in apologetics."},{"Title":"Principles of Lutheran theology","review":"(Note: I read the old, 1980s edition of this book. I understand that the newer edition has been somewhat refined or padded out but I have not read it personally and so cannot compare.)This was a daunting read for me, even with a fair amount of hobbyist theological reading under my belt already. It definitely seems like a seminary intro text, or perhaps even adapted lecture series. However I was mostly able to stay with Braaten all the way through. The one exception was when he would take off in great detail about some 20th century theologians who I am not yet familiar with, but those digressions were not central to the discussion at hand. I found \\"The Ecumenical Principle\\" to be quite a slog and I almost gave up, but I am glad I did not as he saves some of his most interesting points for the remaining chapters.To a well-read or politically savvy Lutheran, Braaten's point of view, which he does not try to hide, is apparent throughout the text. At least he is honest about it, so I do not find that slant obnoxious, but if you were expecting a completely impartial introduction, this will bother you. He does side very heavily on the \\"evangelical catholic\\" side of things, as you can see from his other works in particular in tandem with Robert Jenson.He has a lot of scathing words for modern fads in theology, and the fact that so much of what he takes aim at (in the 1980s) has by now, some thirty years later already become obsolete to the point of sounding silly or laughable very much makes his point for him.I found that when Braaten is succinct he is highly quotable and have filed away many beautifully worded distillations of Lutheran theology--particularly Sacramental theology--for later reference.There are few books like this accessible to the lay Lutheran who wants to delve deeper, and I recommend this one for Braaten's eloquence, succinct moments, and learnedness, even though it is far from easy to read even at less than 200 pages. I will be reading Lutheran Theology by Steven Paulson later this year to compare--stay tuned for a review of that later."},{"Title":"Principles of Lutheran theology","review":"I recommend it to every Christian.

I still have to read it, but I recommend the Venerable Fulton Sheen to anyone! His works are so poetic! :)"},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"Home on leave from the Air Force in 1961, I was so arrogant, self impressed and (I now know) in the early stages of depression, that my Mother took me out in the back yard one summer evening an said that if I couldn't change the way I treated my family I could just go back to the Air Force base and never return. I was shattered (I knew, of course, that I was right...about everthing...and everyone else was screwed up). I left on a Greyhound bus the next morning, sadder and more despondant than I had ever been. At the first stop I went into the bus station, walked up to the book rack and saw Bishop Sheen's Way to Happiness. Out of desparation as much as anything else, I bought it and read it though several times. I'd like to tell you that it changed my life instantly. It didn't...but over the years that followed the effect of this wonderful book was magnificent. I did return home, many times over the years and my Mother and I developed a relationship that was beyond anything either of us could have expected. It ultimately lead to her conversion to Catholicism when she was in her mid sixties (I had converted at 18). One of the last things I ever did for this wonderful woman (who loved me enough to take the chance of possibily sending me away forever), was to bring her Holy Communion a short time before she died. Bishop Sheen's little book made all the difference in the world."},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"Years ago my mother gave me a copy of &quot;Way to Happiness&quot;, but it wasn't until she passed away that I actually read it. And it blew my mind!Although it was written in the early '50s, Fulton Sheen had his finger on the pulse of man's discontent. But more than pointing out our emptiness, Sheen offers sound solutions &quot;Until the &quot;For Sale&quot; sign is hung on a soul emptied of preoccupation with self, the Divine Tenant cannot move in&quot; Wisdom like that is timeless.I have since given this book to freinds, who are also blessed. Some books are good reads, some are interesting, but few touch your soul, and call for action. &quot;Way to Happiness&quot; is one of those books."},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"Like others of the younger generation, I was unfamiliar with Fulton Sheen until the internet brought his fine lessons to light again.The book is modest in length but is able to communicate a complex ideas in ways the average person can readily understand.Although a great read for anyone, it would also be a timely gift for someone struggling with depression."},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"I recently became a fan of Fulton Sheen after seeing an old broadcast from the 1960's.

It's short, but the message within these lines speak volumes."},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"This book was originally published in 1953.

All is not black on one side, and all is not white on another . . . So the evil of our day is the evil not of the East or the West, but of the world.\\" Bishop Sheen's study of a broad spectrum of knowledge and thought is reflected in his writing. We have benefit of his self-disciplined study. He was no doubt one of the most, if not the most, learned, articulate persons of the Twentieth Century. It is wonderful to see his books selling so well. This is one to keep close at hand and reread often."},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"This is the type of book that will draw you back time after time. We all have doubts at some time in our life. Bishop Sheen helps to identify the reasons for some of our unhappiness and then outlines methods to overcome our barriers. It is simplistic in it's content and short in length. Everything he says seems to fit. Then again, his college degree was in philosophy. When you combine that with the spirituality gained in studying for the priesthood, you have a powerful tool to help with the everyday ups and downs. Once again, a religious base is necessary to really benefit but even people with no religious tradition can be helped."},{"Title":"Way to happiness","review":"Truly this phenomenal read was written by the Holy Spirit with the help of Bishop Fulton Sheen.

He was a television sensation on his show \\"Life is Worth Living.\\" He influenced a whole generation of Catholics with his monologues that were both passionate and compassionate.Sheen was able to connect with the masses. He was an erudite scholar, but he never came across as being arrogant. He presented a common-sense message of relying on God and living out a practical Christianity.Sheen had his finger on the pulse of the primary issues that Christians face in day to day life. He always presented wise advice for handling life's challenges. Sheen was deeply troubled by the moral decline of the day. However, he was a guy with a positive attitude. He always made the believer feel like an overcomer. He was a terrific motivator and reading his commentaries and watching his television show is always a shot in the arm.Sheen is a great encourager. The Way to Happiness is typical of his outstanding insights. He reminds the reader that strength can be found in God. God is all-sufficient and can help the believer deal with all the challenges of life. Sheen was an unselfish minister who enjoyed life to the fullest because he was always thinking of helping others.

Where they dropped the ball, in my opinion, was not including the Forgotten Realms Adventures hardcover material, as well as the Faiths &amp; Avatars and Powers &amp; Pantheons supplements. These three books contain loads of invaluable source info for mages and specialty priests. Second, the fact that the program seems to lack the ability to factor in kit bonuses during PC/NPC creation is, well, annoying at the least, and frustrating at its worst.That said, the rest of the product is wonderful. The hyper-linked, help file version of the books is awesome; I carry my laptop loaded with this program to every gaming session I go to, whether I'm playing or GMing. No longer do I have to carry 4 hardcovers and multiple softcovers to have the information I need. I have stats, indexed and searchable documents, dice rollers, maps, and PC/NPC character sheets all at my beckon call. And, in most cases, I can find an item, spell description, or rule in one of the books in less time than someone else can whip out their book and look it up.One of the knocks I've heard about the Expansion is that, since 3rd edition will render it obsolete in less than a year, it's not worth buying. Please, people! Its a small price to pay for the convience of having all these resources at your finger-tips, even if it is only for the next 9 months.

For Dungeon Masters who have created their own world, the expansion is an invaluable tool. The most disappointing feature is that the manual is very limited and gives you very little useful information; however, if you spend some time digging around in the on-line help files, you will be well served.

The high quality of this new release is a great relief after the poor showing of the first version.Program tools include complete text of nine key rule books, a character generator, improved dungeon, city and wilderness mapmakers, dice roller software, and a DM's toolkit with programs for automatically generating encounters, treasure troves, spells, NPCs, and more.Mapping is provided through two different programs, the Map Maker and the Campaign Mapper. The former quickly creates City, Dungeon, and Overland maps, with neatly detailed symbols and some randomized variety in repetitive, placed features such as trees, houses, and mountains. The Campaign Mapper is much more complex, and will be very familiar to users of ProFantasy's Campaign Cartographer. In this program, maps are built in multiple layers and encounter data can be linked to the maps. Grids toggle on and off in either program; printing is available in both black-and-white and color. Both programs are miles beyond the original Core Rules map generator and an invaluable aid to the DM tired-to-death of graph paper and smudges.The highly-detailed character generator can be set for either Core or &quot;Player's Option&quot; rules, and quickly creates fully-equipped PCs and any level of NPCs complete with spells, skills, and, if desired, random names (some strange but interesting results, a feature probably of more use to the DM). Twelve methods of characteristic generation are provided, from straight &quot;you're-stuck-with-these-stats&quot; to the manual entry of numbers. An optional \\"city\\" interface provides \\"buildings\\" to visit for creating all of the character's various skills and items.Nine on-line books are included: Monstrous Manual, Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master Guide, Arms &amp; Equipment Guide, Tome of Magic, Dungeon Master Option: High Level Campaigns, and the three Player's Option books: Combat &amp; Tactics, Skills &amp; Powers, and Spells &amp; Magic. No pictures, all text, but quite a treasure trove for the price of the program, considering the price of acquiring physical copies of all of the books.Encounters and monsters (lair and wandering), treasures, and NPCs are quickly set up by the DM toolkit. The installed database is customizable for house rules, letting DMs add their own monsters, character races, equipment, skills/proficiencies, magic items, racial abilities, powers, and spells, a flexibility sorely lacking in the previous version.The value of this CD-ROM for the DM is enormous. Several of the various areas of the program can be run simultaneously, a great convenience for writing an adventure (the cyber equivalent of spreading out your books). For a pressing game deadline, reference sheets can be quickly printed, fast dice \\"rolled,\\" and NPCs and encounters swiftly generated, with the creation of maps probably taking the most time. With all this, all the DM needs is a good idea!--Sharon Daugherty for Skirmisher Online Gaming Magazine"},{"Title":"Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Core Rules 2.0 Expansion CD-ROM","review":"I cannot imagine playing without CR2.

It is great for keeping all information at hand.The biggest praise I have is the books. There is over $100 worth of books in just CR2, and the Expansion at least doubles that.

After writing \\"American Daughter\\", Thompson went on to be associate editor of the newly established EBONY magazine, as just the start of a distinguished publishing and writing career. But it is this memoir, which should be reissued for mainstream attention--that is her great triumph--a touching, beautifully written book that enriches the lives of all who read it."},{"Title":"The man from home,","review":"With Tarkington hitting a kind of rut with his novels, it isn't too surprising that he decided to try a different way of telling a story. He worked with Harry Leon Wilson, the writer of \\"Ruggles of Red Gap\\", to create \\"The Man From Home\\", a play which debuted in 1907 in Chicago and was published in 1908. The two would pair up several more times with such plays as \\"The Gibson Upright\\", \\"Tweedles\\", and \\"How's Your Health?\\", but this was their first venture.The story is pure Tarkington, or so it seems to me. To begin with, you have people from a small town in Indiana, though the scene is the Hotel Regina Margherita in Sorento, Italy. One of Tarkington's common themes of judging people by how they act, rather than by their family history or the money they have, is well in force. And there is some of the identity surprises as well.In the story, there are two Americans from Indiana (Horace Granger-Simpson and his sister Ethel Granger-Simpson) trying to rise above their humble origins by having Ethel marry the Honorable Almeric St. Aubyn, who is the son of Lord Hawcastle. Horace is taken with the Comtesse de Champigny, and all this has been put together by Lady Creech, the sister-in-law of Lord Hawcastle. However, in order for the marriage to happen, Ethel needs to pay a rather large settlement, and for that she needs the approval of Daniel Voorhees Pike, her guardian, whom she fears will be too American and embarrass her. Another subplot is a Russian man travelling under an assumed name and pretending to be German, and who happens to have become friends with Mr. Pike. Another is about a Russian criminal who is being chased by the police.In the first act, we meet the interested parties, and learn at least something about their characters. Tarkington and Wilson set the stage well as they introduce all the major threads, even though one of the characters has not yet arrived. The second act advances the story well, and introduces the last character as well as fills in the back-story a bit. We learn a lot more about Hawcastle's character, or lack thereof. The third act is the meat of the play, as the all three of the plots become joined together. The Hawcastle's are exposed, we learn who Vasili is, and Ethel learns about the shame of the family she was about to marry into, but her own honor does not allow her to back out of the deal. Act four deals with this new development. Ethel refuses to break her promise, and Pike somewhat surprisingly stands with her, and even agrees to the settlement, though it is by doing so that he ultimately frees her from her obligation.There are a couple of subplots, which really aren't needed for the story, but they don't hurt it either. A much bigger weakness is that there are too many amazing coincidences which tie these characters all together. Certainly one can accept Pike being Ethel's guardian, as we know that the guardian was on the way. Vasili's secret identity was also well established and one can accept it, and in fact it Vasili is an important character because he helps establish that it is possible for titled and rich people can still also be good human beings as opposed to the Hawcastles. The relationship between the Russian criminal (Professor Ivanoff) though is problematic. Though certainly an important character to expose the Hawcastles, his presence at this place at this point in time just when Pike can make use of it, is a bit too much to accept.Overall \\"The Man from Home\\" is a decent play, but not as humorous as one might expect from Tarkington and Wilson. The plot is just a bit too far out there to be believable. As a first effort it is interesting. Tarkington's theme of small town common sense and morals being more important than a title and riches is one we have read before, but being put into a play, and having Indiana meet European aristocracy is a different twist than what he has given us before. It is of some interest, but at the same time there is a reason why you don't see this play being performed very often. There were two films based on this play, the first being directed by Cecil B. DeMille in 1914, though the storyline is quite a bit different, and then another film in 1922, with Alfred Hitchcock given credit for title designer, but the film has been lost."},{"Title":"The man from home,","review":"When \\"The Man from Home\\" opened on Broadway in August 1908 at the Astor Theatre, playwright Booth Tarkington and his co-writer Harry Leon Wilson envisioned it as a satire on the coarseness of American manners. Little did they expect American audiences to cheer at the simple homespun common sense wisdom of Daniel Pike. William Hodge played Pike, a lawyer put in charge of a wealthy estate. He makes the trip to Sorrento, Italy because, although not too distant in age, he is the guardian of Ethel Granger-Simpson. Ethel has been hobnobbing with the wealthy European aristocracy, many of whom are unfortunately now broke. They seek \\"alliances\\" with wealthy Americans to replenish the family bank accounts. Ethel plans to marry playboy Almeric. The obstacle to the alliance is the consent of her guardian who must approve the \\"settlement\\" of $750,000. (This is still a lot of money today. In dollars from a hundred years ago, it must have been a whopping fortune!) Ethel petulantly explains that it is not a dowry, but is what she brings to the alliance. When Pike wants to know what Almeric brings to the marriage, Ethel spouts about his ancestors who fought in ancient battles. Pike isn't too anxious to liquidate what is the bulk of Ethel's fortune to her husband-to-be. The plot thickens as an Italian fugitive Georgeopolis, from Greece, shows up on the lamb. Sympathetic to his story, Pike befriends the fugitive and hides him. When Pike won't approve the settlement, Almeric's father, the Earl of Hawcastle who has been watching, uses the threat of aiding and abetting to throw Pike in an Italian jail if he doesn't approve the money transfer. Through a series of devices, Ethel overhears the real greed in the Europeans and gets in touch with her American self, which says you should work for what you earn. The play concludes as Pike approves the settlement just as Ethel breaks off the engagement. The final moments lead us to believe that the future holds something special for Ethel and Daniel Pike. This is a well-made play. It is delightful in its homespun roots and would play well to modern-day American audiences who reflect many of the same values 100 years later.

Of course it's just my humble opinion and someone else may find this book a five star plus type of book. It's all in what resonates with us. Or is it? I've read other books which the writer comes across as offensive and condescending and yet it's tolerable to read. The title does not connect to the content of the book, it's way far removed from what one wanting to know more about Green Witchery is seeking. In other words, it's NOT about Green Witchery but her experiences with the fey and the dark side. But....hey, she serves up sweet treats with the dark side to balance it all out!

I can't thank them enough!Finally, a book that talks about _balance_. Light and dark, male and female; she reminds you that energy itself isn't one or the other, but neutral. It's what you do with it that matters.Moura has a proper yet conversational writing style, which lets you absorb and think about the information presented without stumbling through bad grammar and awkward language. Though I'm not too sure about the faery stuff, much of the rest of what she has to say really hit home for me. Her listing of the basic &quot;laws&quot; of witchcraft is simple, clear, and to the point- probably the best phrasing I've seen.She suggests ways of dealing with your fears via visualization and meditation; offers basic information about ogham, tarot, creating ritual, and obviously, working with both &quot;light&quot; and &quot;dark&quot;. She keeps a balance of male and female, leaving this book pleasantly neutral.A useful book for those looking for &quot;something more&quot; as they wade through the books available about paganism, witchcraft in particular.

What with all the &quot;pink sugar witchie&quot; books appearing on the market lately, it's just great that someone dares to write about &quot;the shadow side&quot;. My problems with this book didn't arise from that. No; I just expected it to be _all_ about what the title says: &quot;Balancing Light &amp; Shadow&quot;, i.e. understanding the Dark as well as the Light in a more general Craft context. Instead, about a half of the book seems to be information on Moura's own Craft tradition. No doubt the book is useful as a whole to those following that specific path, but personally I found no actual use for half of it. The meditations are excellent, though!Moura is also guilty of a very common slip-up - making a mess of Finnish names, Deities and folk beliefs. There were never any Finnish Gods called &quot;Hiesi&quot; and &quot;Tunni&quot;...Oh, but if you feel like buying this book, don't be discouraged by my review.

Very few serious books have been written on the dark aspect of paganism because they don't want people to think of it as \\"black magic,\\" and many (most) that have been written are trashy, focusing only on teenagers who want to [tick] their parents off. It's a side that needs to be explained that's not usually included in 101 books, or anywhere else. I was just glad to see it. The book itself is worth reading, whether you agree with her or not, for another perspective that I believe is widely ignored."},{"Title":"Green Witchcraft II: Balancing Light & Shadow","review":"For many, the Dark side of the Craft is a difficult and fearsome subject.

As a Witch working very much in the folk tradition, and often with the deities often thought of as &quot;darker&quot;, it was a good find, particularly the sections on the Goddess and God.

You will discover just about everything you could imagine or would want to know about Witchcraft from reading her books. However, I strongly urge anyone interested in her books, to purchase all three. Although each book is well written and can be used independently, each book in my opinion compliments the other.

The book probably is intended to be used by teachers in schools to educate pupils on \\"racism\\".The author just utters a series of contradictory theses that are common in the discourse of left wing politicians and political activists; those politicians that are responsible for the influx of immigrants that is destroying Europe.However, he is not a French Frenchman with a left wing thinking but a foreigner pleading his cause.The book takes the form of a dialog between the author and his daughter.Just to illustrate the nonsense that is found in this book:1. He says in one place, that one is not born a \\"racist\\" but becomes one through bad parental education.2. Elsewhere, he says that racism is a natural instinct that prevailed in all human societies.3. Then he says that people cannot change their personality.All these statements together are self-contradictory.He seems to imply that children personality can be moulded through education. (What is the evidence for that? After all the sex drive is a natural instinct too. And races were created partially by sexual selection.)Thomas Hardy was spot on with the quote: \\"After two thousand years of mass / We've got as far as poison-gas.\\"I have found all the content of the book weak and doubtful.

By shifting the emphasis from workplace struggles to conflict over urban space, Meade allows us to rethink dramatic and sometimes puzzling episodes of popular protest in turn-of-the-century Rio de Janeiro (such as the revolt against compulsory smallpox vaccination). Her argument that these protests should be seen as part of the contest over capitalist modernization, and are no less &quot;modern&quot; than workplace struggles in nearby Sao Paulo, adds to the ongoing discussion of political consciousness as forming in struggles both within and beyond the point of production. Meade also explores the implications of &quot;urban beautification&quot; for the popular classes in a way that connects processes in Rio with broader global tendencies during the Age of Imperialism. Finally, the book is highly readable and accessible to the non-specialist, and can be used in courses ranging from introductory undergraduate surveys to graduate seminars."},{"Title":"\\"Civilizing\\" Rio: Reform and Resistance in a Brazilian City 1889-1930","review":"This book provides both a useful overview of urban social history in turn-of-the-century Rio de Janeiro and a unique and convincing analysis of how poor urban and suburban residents responded to urban renewal projects. The author places her analysis in an engaging, accessible, and accurate narrative of the city's broader history, weaving together the findings of a broad array of specialized secondary works. Her own primary research on popular protests provides a crucial part of this history, and her conclusions are suggestive of how popular movements might be understood elsewhere as well. The book shows that the effects of undemocratic urban administration can be disasterous for the least powerful sectors of the population. Yet is also shows that the urban poor were by no means &quot;marginalized,&quot; nor did they decline to participate in orderly, legal forms of protest. Riots and violence exploded in Rio only after poor residents had tolerated arbitrary and violent government implementation of urban policies, and after they had found other avenues of appeal to government officials closed. This book is effective in undergraduate and graduate courses alike. In addition to providing an excellent overview of Rio's early twentieth-century history, the book stimulates students to think critically about urbanization, class conflict, forms of protest, and the peculiar concerns of non-industrial nations to create images of order and civilization in the early twentieth century."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"I'm a historian, who got this book late, but really enjoyed it. I would suggest this book to get a little insight to the culture during the slave trade."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"In the later parts of 1700s some opposition of slavery was developed due to horrendous accounts given by merchants and slaves, like Equiano. That was the first time in history when opposition of slavery grew. And this is one of them.This book gives account of the life of a slave. Before he gets kidnapped, he gives some accounts of slavery back in Africa, which is a lot different than the ones in Americas or England.Many people who have read this book said it's either BORING or VERY INTERESTING. I think this book is interesting, though, but I can't consider it as a favorite book of mine. It has hard to read; lots of big words. There's also a lot of switch-back-and-forths between where events take place and I couldn't really keep it up. Maybe because I was reading too fast or maybe because I wasn't following too well.This book is like a life of a slave. BUT NOT the kind of slave that you would expect. It has no similarities compared to Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. It's totally a different account. So if you expect to read a horrific story about slavery in Americas, don't choose this one. This book will give you a pretty good idea of how Africans were treated. (A lot of times this story takes place on a ship.)"},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"Equiano was kidnapped from his village in Nigeria at 10 years of age - taken into a World of slavery. But he found a way to buy back his freedom. He eventually walked the streets of London as a free man. How? That is why you need to read this book. I highly recommend you read this 200 year old autobiography."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"Many books and movies focus on what slaves in America had to go through, but this book allows us to look at the experience of a slave who came to America to visit, but whose primary experiences of slavery were in Britain. Since the British abolished slavery decades before the U.S. did, people tend to forget that they were part of this terrible aspect of history too! Good for broadening your understanding."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"This is one of my favorite books! This is a wonderful testimony to the saving Grace of Jesus Christ. Equiano makes the statement that while the events that happened to him were tragic, they are the events that led him to a saving relationship with Christ. This book is so well written and filled with adventure. It is hard to put down once you start reading. A wonderful story that mirrors the fact that we are all born in slavery to sin and deserve righteous judgment but there is salvation reserved for those that God redeems and call out to Him for mercy."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"Not much to say.

For comparison, one should also read &quot;ROBINSON CRUSOE&quot; by Daniel Defoe and &quot;PAMELA&quot; by Samuel Richardson."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"The item was fine, but why did it have to be packed in such a big box. It did not fit in the mail box so it had to be picked up at the post office. Smaller packaging please, otherwise, everything was fine."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"As an American who has grown up hearing and learning about slavery and the slave trade in the US, and mainly in the 19th century, I appreciated the insight Equiano's book gives into the institution from other parts of the world, and in particular how racism evolved within an institution that had been taken for granted for centuries and had not been particularly racist.It is not the narrative of a victim. Not only does Equiano purchase his freedom halfway through the book, but also you can tell from the incidents he describes and from reading between the lines that he was a strong, even pugnacious person who didn't take any guff from people he did not respect. He was pragmatic, ambitious, and a fighter. While he accepted the social hierarchies of the time, including slavery itself until the latter part of his life, he shows no humility (except in terms of his spiritual condition). When he proposes to another person that he work for him as a servant, you get the feeling that he has just given that person an honor.Equiano's autobiography is important for many other reasons. It is very much a book of its time, the late 18th century, when spiritual autobiographies were important both to the writers and the readers. (Make sure that when you buy an edition of this book you do not buy an edition that has been abridged, as the account of Equiano's religious/spiritual development is what has been cut, making hamburger of what remains). He has wonderful, sometimes acid, comments, to make on the churches he observes at the time. For example, here's his comment on a church service run by the Rev. George Whitfield, at which people are crowding out into the yard and standing on ladders to see into the church: \\"When I got into the church I saw this pious man exhorting the people with the greatest fervor and earnestness, and sweating as much as ever I did while in slavery....I thought it strange I had never seen divines exert themselves in this manner before; and was no longer at a loss to account for the thin congregations they preached to.\\"Equiano's autobiography is also a tale of his adventures: he served on board battle and merchant ships much of the time and saw action during the French and Indian war. He was also part of Phipps' search for a passge to India through the north pole, where their ship was frozen in ice just as Shackleford's was two centuries later.And finally, Equiano's life and story become entwined with the British abolition movement. His book was intended to serve the movement, raising revulsion by demonstrating the cruel and unethical practices that rose from slavery and appealing to logic and the reader's sense of shame. He is one of the earliest writers to point out a psychological blindess in slave holders, the denial and the double vision they had to develop in order to justify themselves. The very existence of the book, written by a literate, very bright, and comfortably wealthy former slave put the lie to the racist arguments that Africans were best suited to slavery. And in one part of the book that is reminiscent of Mary Wollestonecraft, he speaks passionately that the ignorance and helplessness that was so striking in so many slaves had nothing to do with nature, and everything to do with social conditioning."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"I was doing a search for travel guides to the Dominican Republic, on the hunch that I might like to visit there next winter, and amazon came up with the \\"Life of Olaudah Equiano\\" as a travel recommendation. if you've read Equiano's autobiography, you'll realize just how knee-slapping funny that is. If you haven't, you should know that Equiano was a remarkable, brilliant African, kidnapped and enslaved, befriended but sold, escaped, recaptured, trusted, mistreated, and eventually a major role-player in the abolition crusade in England in the 18th Century. He figures prominently in the great historical account of English abolitionism -- \\"Bury the Chains\\" by Adam Hochschild -- along with Wilberforce and Clarkson and others whose epic courage and humanity should be celebrated forever.Equiano's own life ought to be made into a movie; few people in history have ever been as resourceful, and few have needed to be. It was a matter of amazement to Englishmen (and Americans doubly so) that an African-born slave could write so fluently and so perspicaciously. In fact, once you get used to the 18th C syntax, his life story is on a par with the best nautical adventure writers. And Equiano was ten times the MAN that any scion of plantation Dixie was!"},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"\\"The Interesting Narrative of Olaudah Equiano\\" has always been spoken of in literature courses but to finally read his book gave me good insight into who this man really was. To understand the language used in the 18th century and how that language helped to push the abolitionists into action is key within the study of slavery during this time.

Not only does this book tell a wonderful story of a man who found strength most of us never realize we possess, but in doing so - has proven the power of language, written and spoken. The world can be full of possobilities in even the most impossible situations - to say nothing of the horror we inflict upon each other...but that's another story."},{"Title":"The life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African","review":"This is a book that should be read by everyone.

The book was very easy to read, the subject matter surreal, very difficult. It was hard to accept that he lived like a hunted man and yet, notwithstanding so many barriers, he achieved so much.

Even apart from his riveting descriptions of 18C slavery, OE saw more of the world than almost all other Africans and indeed most people up to his time, successfully negotiating countless challenging cross-cultural encounters. OE offers very perceptive ethnographies of Igbo, Caribbean, North American, British and Miskitu Indian societies, as well as a moving conversion narrative in the classic Augustinian tradition of autobiography.

It helped me in a variety of ways, not the least of which being how similar Lewis' own emotional roller coaster matched my own at the time.This is not a piece that methodically analyzes the philosophical nature of suffering and trials in light of what we know of a loving God. Rather, it is one man's wrestling with these questions on his own, in his own mind and heart. Implied for me through all this, as I, too, wrestled with the idea that God was just plain mean for allowing people who loved Him to undergo pain, was that Lewis was a consummate logician who now had no choice but to field these questions with a mind run through by a mind turned upside down from grief.Yes, the light that shone through this work for me was that Lewis eventually *did* come to a resolution with both God and grief. If, indeed, he could, then the reader knows they can as well. It's understood by the end of the work that love cannot have meaning for us as fallen creatures if there is not the risk of rejection and pain. And it is this very risk that makes love worthwhile.Five stars from me, for its honesty and ability to bring comfort to me in my (then) afflicted afflicted state in the form of validation and hope."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis gives us a deep glimpse into his soul in \\"A Grief Observed.\\" Upon the death of his wife he has a very direct conversation (OK shouting match) with God regarding why the love of his life was taken from him. His journal notes regarding the loss of his lovely wife make up the main bulk of this short text.We are brought into the very personal loss of C.S. Lewis and his ruminating over the depth of pain that can be felt when you loose a loved one. He found himself often calling out, \\"Come back, Come back!\\", only to realize how selfish that request is. He wanted her back for himself, but what pain that would be for her.He makes a stark observation when he states, \\"They call Stephen the first martyr. Hasn't Lazarus the rawer deal?\\" His point being that at least Stephen died and stayed that way in paradise, but poor Lazarus died, went to paradise but then got called back to live several more years on a corrupt earth. Why can't we let the dead go? Why do we cling to them? Why do we wish they were still with us? Don't they have the better deal?After having written \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" C.S. Lewis comes to realize that he didn't fully understand his topic when he wrote that. He now knows and understands the deep depth of grief and anguish that a person can feel over the loss of a loved one. In a very honest moment he pens, \\"don't come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don't understand.\\" Yet, he acknowledges that he was one of those himself.This book is for all who are grieving. It is for those who have lost a loved one and want an honest look into the heart of a Theologian who loves God and how he struggled with grief.This might be the best book for any Christian ever to read, digest and understand. It will help you love God more and understand are pain and anguish over loosing a loved one.Read well for understanding and encouragement !"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When my sister died twenty-six years ago, this book helped me immensely.

It chronicles how he almost completely gave up on God and his faith because of it, and how he worked thru things. On page 81 Lewis writes: \\"When I lay these questions before God, I get no answer. But a rather special sort of no answer. It is not the locked door. It is more like a silent, certainly not uncompassionate, gaze. As though he shook His head not in refusal but waiving the question.

I'd be lying if I told you reading it comforted me and helped ease the grief. But what it did do was give me a sense of someone who understood and was willing to hurt. I didn't expect it to be an easy book to read mainly because I know that it was just collections from his journal. He spilled much in those journals that he probably wouldn't have spilled had it been a well thought out book; his thoughts and purposes would have been more clear. What you see and read is a man hurting and dealing with it how he can. He allows himself to struggle with how he views God for allowing this to happen to \\"H.\\". He was real and honest in this book, something I think is very hard to come by for a lot of authors now. I think the biggest comfort it would bring to Christians struggling with grief is that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to struggle while dealing with grief and that God allows grief, but ultimately you should seek God instead of wallowing in selfish anguish forever."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I did not know what to expect. I knew that this work was Lewis' own situation about his personal grief and not some self-help book. I was amazed at the similarities of the feelings and the questions that I had to his.

I found more help in this book than all the books that were recommended through my grief counseling class.Perhaps you need to have a brief and intensly happy marriage that is cut short to appreciate it as I did; perhaps greif in some ways is just universal.

It is written concerning his thoughts about his deceased wife whom he loved dearly. Tom Dougherty"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book details C.S. Lewis's views on the combination of life, death, and faith during times of suffering or loss. It takes the reader through Lewis's psychological coping with the \\"sudden deprivation [that] brought about a brief loss of faith\\" (xii) for this famed theologian and Narnia creator. Having gone into this marriage with a looming understanding that Joy was going to die, Lewis was unable to enjoy the full benefits of what Madeleine L'Engle calls the \\"feast of marriage\\". Lewis, she continues, had been invited to great feast of marriage, only \\"...the banquet was rudely snatched away before he had done more than sample the hors d'oeuvres\\" (xii). \\"A Grief Observed\\" is a response to that emotion, a chance to sort through this depth of emotion that was new to Jack.There is no real game plan, if you will, when it comes to the course of the book. While the beginning starts with \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear\\" (3), and the general flow of the sentences and tone is very Lewis, including the analogies and word choice; what the reader follows is Lewis making tangible connections with this feeling of grief. As if just as we read it, he is sitting at his desk writing with a general idea, but along the way, finding that these general ideas bring about more understanding for himself than anything. He uses dashes and parenthesis quite often to suggest an author's note or a note that could come on the side to the reader.This is a very reliable account of Lewis's thoughts since he never intended for its publication, writing it for personal benefit; but did so following persuasion from a few of his closest, most intimate friends with the intent of helping those going through the same thing. Even then, however, he published it under the pen name N.W. Clerk to remain anonymous. While originally published nearly half a century ago, the words within the book continue to be prevalent. Grief, such as it is, is something that is continual and that never fades, nor diminishes in its significance in the human life experience. Rather it is something that comes in all shapes and sizes, while carrying the same weight.\\"A Grief Observed\\" pertains to what I am researching because it displays Lewis's feelings directly after the loss of his wife and the loss of faith he is experiencing. Therefore explaining why Lewis wrote it, as a means to grapple with this sudden void.The book was written without any audience in mind except the writer. Since Lewis wrote this technically for no one else to read, there comes a more candid side of him. Readers who are used to the style of \\"Mere Christianity\\" or \\"The Four Loves\\" will feel right at home, while those whom have never picked up a Lewis book ever in their life might find the more educated style uneasy at first. This piece of Lewis however is not nearly as professional as in others. His tone is still there, just as a person's mannerisms are there when they speak and then there is the same flocculation occasionally; yet this is a more demure, more somber Lewis, as if when writing this, his back hunched and head hung low over the paper (since Lewis never learned to type).All around, those looking for a different Lewis, or a chance for a deeper look into whom he was as a man without having to make a trip to Oxford or Wheaten College, may certainly find themselves among the most general of men after this book. It is short and easy to read, and one that any reader of Lewis should have among them."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"*****These reflections on the experience of bereavement following the death of his wife, demonstrate in real, passionate prose-style Lewis' heart. They also illustrate his mind. The style is particularly honest and sparse probably due to the fact that the book was first published in 1961 under the pseudonym N.W. Clerk, since Lewis wished to avoid identification. It might be helpful for readers to know that though republished in 1963 after his death under his own name, the text still refers to his wife as \\"H\\" (her first name, which she rarely used, was Helen).How is a Christian to grieve? Of what should our understanding of death consist? Where should we turn when all is dark? This book is somewhere between a shoulder to cry on and a light at the end of the tunnel.*****"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"In this slender volume, C.S. Lewis shares his personal experience with grief following the death of his wife. This is a grief that has him questioning his belief in God and exposing the raw, painful, angry emotions that accompany his grieving process. There are many ways to grieve, but one thing is certain - it has to be faced, and Lewis has done just that in this book. The harsh reality that everyone who lives will die means that we must all face grief at some time if we haven't already done so. His experiences with grief are not unique, but he is to be applauded for sharing his palpable pain in a way that may help others who suffer a loss of such magnitude."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is a short book. It started as a journal and I'm not sure if Lewis intended to publish it or not when he first wrote down his thoughts after losing his wife. I read this book as research for a project I'm working on, but I finished it thinking it would be a kind gift to anyone suffering from the loss of a loved one.This little book is easier to read and understand than The Problem of Pain, which I think is more theology, even if it was supposed to be simplified for the masses.

I could almost feel my own heart break just reading the authors words. This man--a man who waited a long time to marry, but finally did in the later years of his life--must have had so many feelings wrapped inside of him when he wrote this book. He wrote fiction, fantesy, theology, apologetics, but this book represent C.S. Lewis, the person he was while here on earth.The striking and almost embarassing sincerity of this book is what makes is so wonderful. I often read parts of this book over and cry, because it clearly illustrates our fragility as humans and how God comforts us in the midst of our pain. It's so good to see how the Lord worked in this man's life to overcome despair."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Originally published under the psyudonem N.W. Clerk, 'A Grief Observed' is probably one of the most personal works of literature by C.S. Lewis to date. I am a collecter of Lewis's works and I do not believe that there has ever been a book that has stimulated the mind deeper and touched the heart more intimantly than this beautiful book has. It is a truly touching journal of Lewis's doubts and fears accompaning the death of his beloved wife, Joy and even if you have never experienced a loss of this nature, you will find it difficult not to empathize with him as he leads you through the personal areas of his own sorrow, grief, and ultimate redemption. A lovely book, and a indescribable experience!"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I read this a month after my own wife's death. I found Lewis's sharing of his grief to be comforting. I found his honesty to be refreshing. You do not need to be a Christian or religious to benefit from this book. I also enjoyed the afterword by Walsh. It helped to put Lewis's book into the context of his life."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The wonderful thing about C.S. Lewis was that he put an amazing amount of thought into his faith. He understood better than most that becoming a Christian meant constantly trying to understand more, to examine both one's self and one's relationship to God. His penetrating intellegence towards Christianity is something that is often lacking in religion, and every time I read Lewis I learn something new, both about myself and my faith. Lewis is a true master. Another author who I'd highly recomend to anyone who enjoys Lewis, one who explores the Christian faith as brilliantly as Lewis, is Brian Caldwell. His novel, We All Fall Down is breathtaking. I'd put him on a par with Lewis, both for writing ability and theological brilliance. His novel is one of the few Christian masterpieces. Both Lewis and Caldwell should be read by those who have discovered God and want to explore that faith as deeply as possible, and perhaps more importantly, by those who have not."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book was recommended to me when my wonderful wife died from cancer after our marriage of only 4 1/2 years. We were thoroughly crazy about one another and were childhood friends since the 6th grade. I must admit I waited many years to read this and should have read it much earlier. While I never lost my faith I was so very angry with God (as well as the world in general) for a considerable time. I was simply angry that he allowed a strong young Christian lady to die and I knew He could have prevented this. I later found, in this book, Lewis struggled with similar feelings as well as our mutual feeling of complete isolation and loss (which could not be relieved by friends, family, church, ministers or Scripture, not in the least). Although my wife was very confident in her faith and discussed it openly (as well as Heaven-her approaching home) I failed to look at \\"The Big-Picture\\" while focusing on the immediate gulf and dark pit in my life. It took me many years to read this book, relating to Lewis and getting the big-picture etc.. My wife was right when she said, \\"It actually makes no difference whether we live to be 29 years of age (her age at her death) or 80 years of age, what matters is God and our eternal home since we are ALL simply going to die and this world is a brief visit, regardless of anything else.\\" Lewis and I finally got it........."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Following Lewis' journey of grief after the death of his wife Joy is a tender, awful, experience. No writer in my memory is more exact in capturing and explaining our humanity. Nearly the whole work is quotable, but two I choose that stood out to me:\\"To make an organism which is also a spirit; to make that terrible oxymoron, a 'spiritual animal.' To take a poor primate, a beast with nerve-endings all over it, a creature with a stomach that wants to be filled, a breeding animal that wants its mate, and say, 'Now get on with it. Become a god.'\\"\\"When I lay these questions before God I get no answer. But a rather special sort of 'No answer.' It is not the locked door. It is more like a silent, certainly not uncompassionate, gaze. As though He shook His head not in refusal but waiving the question. Like, 'Peace, child; you don't understand.' Can a mortal ask questions which God finds unanswerable? Quite easily, I should think. All nonsense questions are unanswerable. How many hours are there in a mile? Is yellow square or round? Probably half the questions we ask -- half our great theological and metaphysical problems -- are like that.\\"As with all Lewis' writings, you can't fly through this. Get comfortable, settle in, and savor the English language and one of the greatest minds ever to use it."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book has been invaluble for me in the midst of my own loss. It is uniquely helpful for those actually in the midst of suffering, especially for those who have lost a spouse.

Definately a unique and priceless resource."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"\\"Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.\\" In this book, C.S Lewis allows the reader to glimpse into the grief of losing a loved one, and the unavoidable questions someone will ask when they have lost a loved one. With Lewis' usual depth and insight, he is able to give a voice to his pain, and at many times, the reader is taken to Lewis' doubts about God's ultimate benevolence.At the end, Lewis begins to regain his holding on his faith. It is a powerful little book, with as much insight as anything else Lewis wrote. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"A Grief ObservedOne of Lewis' trademark talents is that of brevity - his theological musings as well as his fictional allegories are always succinct. \\"A Grief Observed\\" is no exception at a mere 60 or so pages. There have been countless books written on the subject of death, and one might been of the opinion that everything that needs to be said has been said already, even before Lewis wrote this particular book. Yet few are indeed so equally human and contain such divine insight as this. Since his own admittedly reluctant conversion to Christianity, Lewis' faith was, in the eyes of his adoring fans and indeed to himself in many respects, tantamount to the Rock of Gibraltar. One could even accuse Lewis of nave arrogance at times, as though he had God \\"sussed out\\". Yet at the death of his wife (though that word today is too empty to describe her relationship to him) Lewis' world came crashing down around him - his \\"deck of cards\\" faith, as he puts it, had been destroyed. It would be very easy for his detractors to say that his faith was false all along and that the volumes of Christian apologetics he wrote were authored on the basis of guesswork instead of divine knowledge. It is doubtful that Lewis would argue with these points - they are hinted at by Lewis both in his lowest and highest moments in the book. And yet that is not quite the whole truth of the situation. This is made clear over the course of \\"A Grief Observed\\". Lewis emerges from his tragedy with his faith not only intact but also wholly reborn. Rather than the stereotypical Christian view that so many non-Christians and Christians take, the \\"family reunion in Heaven\\" (which he rejects are pure fantasy), Lewis accepts (much to his anguish) that God is God, that death is death, and that his wife is indeed in a state of eternal bliss. This reviewer will not spoil how Lewis came to these conclusions, but will say that for those who may doubt the sincerity of his claims there is indeed a \\"Ring of Truth\\" to be heard in his findings. This is a book about one man's struggle to come to terms with the reality of death and what it means for us all. It is heartbreaking and yet imparts a sense of supreme joy that is to be found. Highly recommended reading for anyone."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis is perhaps best known for children's stories that also delight adults; however, during his lifetime he was best known as an inspirational speaker, not quite in the same line as modern televangelists, but nonetheless a crowd-pleaser who had subtle but strong theology to share.C.S. Lewis was a confirmed bachelor (not that he was a 'confirmed bachelor', mind you, just that he had become set enough in his ways over time that he no longer held out the prospect of marriage or relationships). Then, into his comfortable existence, a special woman, Joy Davidson, arrived. They fell in love quickly, and had a brief marriage of only a few years, when Joy died of cancer.This left Lewis inconsolable.For his mother had also died of cancer, when he was very young.Cancer, cancer, cancer!Lewis goes through a dramatic period of grief, from which he never truly recovers (according to the essayist Chad Walsh, who writes a postscript to Lewis' book). He died a few years later, the same day as the assassination of John F. Kennedy.However, Lewis takes the wonderful and dramatic step of writing down his grief to share with others. The fits and starts, the anger, the reconciliation, the pain--all is laid bare for the reader to experience. So high a cost for insight is what true spirituality requires. An awful, awe-ful cost and experience.'Did you know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past...'All that was good paled in comparison to the loss. How can anything be good again? This is such an honest human feeling, that even the past is no longer what is was in relation to the new reality of being alone again.In the end, Lewis reaches a bit of a reconciliation with his feelings, and with God.'How wicked it would be, if we could, to call the dead back. She said not to me, but to the chaplain, \\"I am at peace with God.\\" 'Lewis had a comfortable, routine life that was jolted by love, and then devasted by loss. Through all of this, he took pains to recount what he was going through, that it might not be lost, that it might benefit others, that there might be some small part of his love for Joy that would last forever.I hope it shall."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I have to admit, when I first started this book I was a little surprised. Wasn't this CS Lewis, the man who could take the most complicated issues of religion and explain them in a way that was simple yet easy to understand? Wasn't this the man who had an answer for everything? Didn't he have some kind of impenetrable armor? I guess not.One thing became quickly apparent--Lewis was human. I cannot believe how incredibly candid, how open and honest he was. The death of his wife hurt him deeply and shook his faith, and he was man enough to admit it. The beginning of the book is filled with doubt and questions, yet slowly you can see the change take place. Lewis is rediscovering his faith, and is slowly coming to terms with his wife's death. It's beautiful.Lewis obviously published this book because he wanted to help others through experiences such as his. He wanted this to be comforting, and comforting it is. He explores grief and loss like no other man can, and the result is this priceless little gem that helps us remember that it's okay to grieve.I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to his wife. By releasing this book, he showed the world just how much she meant to him. I cannot praise this book enough. With this short work, Lewis proves he really does have an answer (or at least the power to come up with one) for everything."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"A must-read for anyone mourning the death of a spouse or partner.

It confronts the tough issues surrounding loss and provides an approach to going forward. Worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"For years I've taught this book in an Introduction to Philosophy course, and my admiration for it increases each time. It's a brutally honest testament in which CSL takes a hard look at his own basic assumptions about life, love, God, Christianity, the world, human relationships.Prior to the horrific trauma chronicled in this book (the loss of his wife), CSL had been what I'd call a puglistic Christian. His apologetic writings tended (although not exclusively so) to be a bit heavy-handed and simplistic. Take, for example, his early _The Problem of Pain_. In that book, CSL offers the standard philosophical arguments that attempt to show that the existence of a loving God is compatible with innocent suffering. But he seems to have no feel for the tragedy of suffering. It's a bookish exercise for him, and his ultimate goal is to win an argument. Many of his books are like that.But not _A Grief Observed_. Here, for the first time in his published work, CSL comes face to face with a realworld (as opposed to bookish) situation that causes him to reexamine his earlier, perhaps too easy, too glib, Christian faith. His reflections about the terrible silence of God, the awfulness of loneliness, the feeling of betrayal, the ultimate reawakening of the sense that perhaps he isn't adrift in an indifferent universe: all of these are utterly authentic, and as such go far beyond his earlier work.CSL's faith after his wife's death is one tempered with the hard realization that a great deal of the tragedy and suffering in life can't be glibly explained away. His relation with God is more dependent, more childlike, than it was earlier. CSL doesn't emerge victorious from the dark night of the soul he chronicles in this memoir. He emerges broken, but his very brokenness makes his relationship with God more genuine. And that's a lesson for us all to reflect on. It makes CSL an utterly lovable man, and it reminds all of us of the perils of taking God for granted."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"\\"A Grief Observed\\" is just that, an observation by immersion, recorded in a journal by C.S. Lewis with the great courage it requires to open one's heart in complete vulnerability when in its most raw state. It begins with a listing of physical symptoms of grief - the sense of fear, or something much like fear, in the pit of the stomach, the yawning of an expanding void, the constant swallowing, as if trying to digest and wash away this immense emotion so difficult to process. From the physical, Lewis moves in closer and with more intimate observation on this thing called grief, struggling to cope and understand. Struggling to survive. Struggling to be transformed and healed.To understand this particular struggle, one must understand the love Lewis has lost in the death of his wife. Theirs was a short but meaningful union, one begun as a friendship that only later, after the vows were taken, moved into a love known only by true partners. Rather than modern day reversals - in which lust is too often mistaken for love, and a friendship often does not enter the union at all, and so quickly crumbling without basis to build upon - this couple has the order right. Only true friends can blossom into love. Love grows from the intimacy of knowledge of another being, and this is what this couple has enjoyed, why the one left behind now knows such immense grief. Lewis's grief is deep and now resonates for the remainder of his own life as a constant companion where his wife once was.Few can express in words so well what, in some variation, all of us feel. Lewis is a master with words. His bring healing - to himself, and to those of us who many years later are still graced with his words in our own struggles of loss.\\"The act of living is different all through. Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything. But no, that is not quite accurate. There is one place where her absence comes locally home to me, and it is a place I can't avoid. I mean my own body. It had such a different importance while it was the body of H's lover. Now it's like an empty house.\\"Lewis talks of favorite places, visiting them again, but now without her, and finds his ache does not increase or diminish with place; he aches everywhere. His wife was like a lens through which all places, and all life, was processed for him. He talks of his loneliness, and yet simultaneously, his inability and often lack of desire, to communicate with others about his grief. And still, he says, he longs for the company and comfort of others. If only, he writes, they would go on about their own business and their own conversations around him without directly including him. Just be near him.A large part of Lewis's struggle, as a man with a deep Christian faith, is his need to understand death and God's role in it. Indeed, much of this slim journal is about a man nearly losing his faith, or walking away from it, and then not only returning to it, but returning to a faith strengthened by its testing.\\"Meanwhile, where is God? This is one of the most disquieting symptoms. When you are happy, so happy that you have no sense of needing Him, so happy that you are tempted to feel His claims upon you as an interruption, if you remember yourself and turn to Him with gratitude and praise, you will be - or so it seems - welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you feel? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside...\\"Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing to believe in God. The real danger is of coming to believe such dreadful things about Him...\\"Who of us have not asked such questions in times of suffering? Lewis articulates all our doubts, surely. During any kind of pain or loss, and not just in terms of death, it is human nature to cry out to God and shake a fist at the heavens, daring, wondering, questioning, demanding, even threatening, crying out for answers and response, often feeling like we get none. Lewis describes what answers he does find, what responses he eventually feels, once he is ready for it, over the coming days of his observed and processed grief.Yet one can never return to what was. Rant and carry on as one must, but there is no return. The dead remain dead, the living, still living. \\"Did you ever know, dear, how much you took away with you when you left? You have stripped me even of my past, even of the things we never shared. I was wrong to say the stump was recovering from the pain of amputation. I was deceived because it has so many ways to hurt me that I discover them only one by one. Still, there are the two enormous gains... turned to God, my mind no longer meets that locked door; turned to H., it no longer meets that vacuum...\\"Change is gradual, Lewis writes, and subtle in its progression and healing. One day, you notice you are coping better. Not quite sure when the transition happened, but it has. He is connected with both love and God in a new and changed way, faith restored, and he makes it clear that he will from now on be a man \\"with an amputated limb\\" where his wife once was, forever crippled by her loss, yet he has (re)new(ed) reason to live. In terms of his faith, he has come to realize that one cannot be a Christian in order to be reunited with one's loved ones after death, for faith does not work that way. Faith is about union with God, first and foremost. Have an ulterior motive of reunion with family, and the connection with God instantly crumbles. Yet through his grief, Lewis acknowledges another life lesson learned, and thus a new intimacy with God. And it is in reaching this new place of peace that he realizes, remembers, the peace he witnessed in his loved wife's eyes in dying. It is, in the end, his greatest act of love, then, to let her go, and to go on."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is another amazing book by Lewis, and another that I have read multiple times. I have had to read it for at least three university courses over the last 18 years. This book is unlike anything else that Lewis ever wrote. It is raw, visceral and at times disturbing, unlike most of his other work that is very precise, specific, well argued and clearly laid out.Recently I heard this story: \`Douglas Gresham, C.S. Lewis's stepson recently released a book about Lewis called Jack's Life. It includes a DVD interview, where Gresham states that Lewis did not intend to publish A Grief Observed; it was a personal notebook. When it was published it was under the pseudonym NW Clark and by a publisher Lewis had never published with. Gresham also said that Lewis received numerous copies of the book as gifts from friends who thought it would help.' That speaks to the power in Lewis's writing; even his friends thought the book would be helpful for him as he journeyed through his grief.Lewis states in his book The Four Loves: \\"We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him, throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.\\" That view is drastically changed when he writes Grief. In A Grief Observed we have a very different approach. Lewis presents a very visceral response to the loss of his wife. An example of this is that Lewis states at the beginning of the book: \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.\\" This book shows us more of Lewis's own heart and life than almost anything else he wrote.It is a great book for those dealing with loss - either for yourself or for someone you know and love. It is often used in grief counseling, and one of the courses I read it for was on the spirituality of death and dying. This book is a gem in the cannon of Lewis literature. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Having been through the loss of my spouse to cancer recently, I had a very difficult time even figuring out what it was that I was feeling. I was able to relate so much to C.S. Lewis's account of his own grief.

I highly recommend it for any christian struggling with the grief of their loved ones (especially spouse)."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When I read this book, I had recently lost someone dear to me. Lewis, in words I could not pull from my mental reserves, reflected the pain in my heart and soul. He questioned his faith.

Brilliant book!"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is the first book I have read of CS Lewis's (amazingly enough!) and it won't be my last. I didn't read this at a time of grief, but rather for a book club. However, I am in the process of signing up as a Hospice volunteer, so death and grieving were in my mind when I was reading \\"A Grief Observed.\\" C.S. Lewis doesn't pull any punches with his grief or with God. He asks tough questions of what kind of God allows such immeasurable pain, yet seems to not be there when the pain and grieving are at their worst. By reading this, others would feel they have permission to be angry at God, to let out their pain and frustration and anger. A great book, especially for those whose faith development is at a high level."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As the fine line between life and death causes mortal man to pursue God, so had Lewis when his wife died.

Lewis' honesty is far more helpful to the grieving than the syrupy efforts of pious &quot;believers&quot;, for he deals with life as it is, rather than as religious people wish it were."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Like most reviewers here, I really can't say enough about the powerful impact this book has. It's only 88 pages, but contains more raw emotion, personal introspection/self-examination, and hard-hitting truths than books 4 or 5 times it's size. I was not familiar with C.S. Lewis before reading this book, but will certainly read him now. I will also read this book repeatedly, as I'm sure it's full force can only be realized this way.O.K then, so why only the 4 stars? I suppose if I had known nothing about the book, read none of these reviews (which prompted me to buy it), and most importantly, paid no attention to the \\"subtitle\\", I would have unhesitatingly given it 5 stars. The \\"subtitle\\" on my copy reads \\"A Masterpiece of Rediscovered Faith Which Has Comforted Thousands\\". I must say, I don't find this book all that comforting, at least from a Christian perspective. Yes, Lewis finally comes to the realization that God is not a \\"Cosmic Sadist\\", but, with the author having the reputation of being one of the leading Christian apologists of this century, I was expecting more of a \\"Rediscovered Faith\\" (in Christ) then what gets presented. Lewis' \\"breakthrough\\" seems to consist merely of two points: One, that he finally noticed that the less he grieved, the more he felt the \\"realness\\" of H's (his deceased wifes) presence, and two, he ultimately senses a presence of her that seems \\"business-like\\". Then, the book abruptly ends. (I don't take fault with this as it's really a journal, not a &quot;book&quot;).That being said, the book is simply too powerful to ignore based on this one criticism. Lewis puts into words what most of us can not even fully realize with our minds. And, to be sure, Lewis sees his new found faith as more \\"real\\" and \\"mature\\" than the one \\"built like a house of cards\\".Read it! But a word of warning to Christians - it is not clear, to me at least, that Lewis' \\"Rediscovered Faith\\" has much to do with Jesus."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I read years ago the Screwtape Letters which was very informative and great regarding the works of Satan in our lives and so true. This book has many pearls of wisdom and insight and very relevant regarding processes we go through when losing someone we love."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The book gave me an inside view of grief from a man's point of view. But, more than that, it caused me to have empathy for his devastating feelings of loss and, ultimately, of hope in a new day. The epiphany he shared that when he finally let go of his anger and grief, is when the spirit of his wife became clear and he was able to remember her as she really was, was both inspirational and revealing. He discovered that the grief was keeping him from being able to remember her face and hearing her words clearly. It occurred to me that sometimes one may wallow in grief for a very long time, the grief itself becoming a compensation for the loss one feels. He found that in letting go, finally, he let her in and he was comforted.The book is one to keep and re-read at a time when one may need to remember.Francesca Molanphy"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is the best book ever written to comfort surviving partners after the death of a spouse.Dr S E NeilClinical and Family Psychologist"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.

What an amazing book. I felt like I was reading my own journal. CS Lewis is just showing the world that we are only human and yes christians are human also. I have a feeling that christians feel they must be perfect and that they must never ever get depressed or be sorrowful over a death,etc. We christians should never question anything. Also, more important that if something like death happens we should never grieve. I know personally that I was especially grievious over childhood traumas that stole my whole life. I'm 27 but I feel as if I am seven. My christianity and trust in the Lord has gone astray but not totally shipwrecked as I struggled to understand things. I think God understands our human weaknesses. Isn't this what the whole point of Hebrews was? Jesus, being God in flesh knows our weaknesses. Get this book. I would get anything Lewis wrote anyway."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"If you are not a Lewis fan, and know very little about the author, then I suggest not reading this book. Lewis describes the agony of grief to a tea. His descriptive writing helps the reader understand what he exactly went through. Though I have not gone through the grief he did, reading this book made me understand what grief is, and made me feel closer to this great Author. Lewis often wrote down what bothered him. It was a way to relieve penned up emotions, and this book is Lewis's writing that helps one see just exactly how he probably felt. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Of everything I've read from the pen of C.S. Lewis, this little book most thoroughly illuminated my heart. I want to buy it in bulk and give it to everyone I know.This intimate diary of real grief strips away the sensation of solitary, isolated mourning; gives the grief-stricken the permission to feel; provides true language for the emotions so difficult to articulate in the throes of sorrow; and finally offers realistic, believable hope.This is Lewis' very personal, private writing, something that wasn't written for publication, but for sanity. Those looking for a brilliant story or clever critical essay should look elsewhere, but those seeking understanding of the emotional process of grief ~ or &quot;company for their misery&quot; ~ will find it in this vulnerable, luminous, earnest writing."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As the fine line between life and death causes mortal man to pursue God, so had Lewis when his wife died.

Lewis, a confirmed bachelor, married Joy Davidman [known as H. in the book], an American poet with two small children. After four brief, intensely happy years, Lewis found himself alone again, and inconsolable. To defend himself against the loss of belief in God, Lewis wrote this journal, an eloquent statement of rediscovered faith. In it he freely confesses his doubts, his rage, and his awareness of human frailty. In it he finds again the way back to life\\" writes publisher on the back-cover.I read this book while mourning my grandmother, and I did not find the book as comforting as I thought it would be. I wished so much to give this read a 5 stars like the majority of reviewers, but I cannot, for the following reasons: a) the jacket over-promises (of \\"comforting thousands\\" and \\"will be a comfort and inspiration to anyone who has ever lost a loved one\\"), b) archaic and difficult language, c) short bursts of argumentation without much fill-in explanations and randomness of thought (no clear pattern). Allow me to explain the \\"+\\"es and \\"-\\"es of these reasons in the context of the book with examples, as found under CONTENT.Also, C.S. Lewis's notes on grieving (the 4 chapters that make up \\"A Grief Observed\\") provided me with some good meat for thought, for my soul, and some great QUOTES (see CONCLUSION section).AUTHOR:Most people are familiar with who C.S. Lewis is (a short wikipedia search will provide most info necessary).EDITION:Bantman Books, 14th printing in 1988, with an afterword by Chad Walsh. This edition contains the 4 chapters of C.S. Lewis's grieving notes (pgs.1-89) followed by \\"another book\\" - \\"Afterword by Chad Walsh\\" (pgs.93-151) where Chad (an American professor of English and poet) gives us a very upclose & personal biography of C.S. Lewis as a close friend.CONTENT:\\"The notes have been about myself, about H. [Joy Davidman Lewis], and about God.\\" confesses C.S. Lewis pg.71 - chapter IV. The book is broken into 4 title-less chapters (probably the areas where C.S. Lewis took breaks). He starts the book with the line \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear\\" and goes on discussing his emotions and thoughts and also fears (is God a bad one, a \\"Cosmic Sadist\\" - pg.43,45; do the departed also mourn; normalcy sets in again in one's life).a) overpromises -The four chapters provided me with a picture into C.S. Lewis's mind and emotions. Some of these I could related to, but others were a bit convoluted, distant, or confusing. I believe that each one of us GRIEVES personally and we also draw strength from our community. Being CONSOLED, finding your way through your BEREAVEMENT is a very personal process. Many of us will probably never ask the questions or bring up the arguments found in this book, but nevertheless, they help in having a broader picture on GRIEF.b) language -C.S. Lewis is the Cambridge professor who wrote the textbook for Middle Ages Literature, so as such be expected to find lots of \\"vacuity\\" when the text \\"geometrizes\\" your vocabulary and \\"vivisects\\" your word knowledge. C.S. Lewis also makes some use of mythological figures and contemporary personalities in his analogies (Amazon, Penthesileia, Camilla, Queen Victoria). Also, one should be up on their Bible knowledge (Solomon, St.Paul, Stephen the fist martyr, and Lazarus). Knowledge of Latin is esential to understand the last sentence of the book (pg.89) - \\"Poi si torno all eterna fontana\\" - a quote from Dante's Paradise and means \\"then she turned back to the Eternal Fountain.\\" But if you feel that you are caught in \\"culs de sac\\" (pg.55) you are not alone. Some annotations by the publishers would have been helpful.c) argumentation and randomness of thought -Again, these are the notes of a great literary mind, but that does not mean that they follow logically or have been organized for easy digestion. Even C.S. Lewis admits, after a retrospective reflection \\"Why do I make room in my mind for such filth and nonsense?\\" and \\"these notes the senseless writhings of a man\\" (pg.38 - chapter II). Make no mistake about it, C.S. Lewis will take you on a very interesting journey where he analyzes various thoughts, feelings, moods, emotions, and doubts. Sometimes his arugment is pure madness if not simply blasphamous (\\"We set Christ against it. But how if He were mistaken? .... \\" paragraph in chapter II, my pg. 34). Some arguments are very terse, others long-winded and with some tangents. They all reflect the mind, spirit, and soul of a grieving person.CONCLUSION:Bottom line is, this book is no easy thing to read, let alone understand everything read. Although it must be said, it is a great book to have discussed in a reading club, or for anyone grieving a loved one.The wONDERFUL QUOTES alone are worth the price:Chapter I\\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.\\" (pg.1)\\"Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.\\" (pg.11)\\"You can't share someone else's weakness, or fear or pain.\\" (pg. 13)\\"nature never plays exactly the same tune twice.\\" (pg.16)Chapter II\\"The most precious gift that marriage gave me was this constant impact of something very close and intimate yet all the time unmistakably other, resistant - in a word, real.\\" (pg.20)\\"You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death.\\" (pg.25)\\"the past is the past and that is what time means, and time itself is one more name for death, and Heaven itself is a state where 'the former things have passed away' \\" (pg.28)\\"Talk to me about the truth of religion and I'll listen gladly. Talk to me about the duty of religion and I'll listen submissively. But don't come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don't understand.\\" (pg.28)\\"Aren't all these notes the senseless writhings of a man who won't accept the fact that there is nothing we can do with suffering except to suffer it?\\" (pg.38)\\"It doesn't really matter whether you grip the arms of the dentist's chair or let your hands lie in your lap. The drill drills on.\\" (pg.38)\\"Up till this I always had too little time. Now there is nothing but time. Almost pure time, empty successiveness.\\" (pg.39)Chapter III\\"Grief is like a bomber circling round and dropping its bombs each time the circle brings it overhead; physical pain is like the steady barrage on a trench in World War One, hours of it with no let-up for a moment.\\" (pg.47)\\"My love for H. [Joy Davidman Lewis] was of much the same quality as my faith in God\\" (pg.48)\\"You can't see anything properly while your eyes are blurred with tears. You can't, in most things, get what you want if you want it too desperately\\" (pg.53)\\"passionate grief does not link us with the dead but cuts us off from them\\" (pg.64)\\"the less I mourn her the nearer I seem to her\\" (pg.66)\\"For in grief nothing 'stays put' \\" (pg.67)Chapter IV\\"Grief is like a long valley, a winding valley where any bend may reveal a totally new landscape.\\" (pg.69)\\"If you are approaching Him [God] not as the goal but as a road, not as the end but as a means, you're not really approaching Him [God] at all.\\" (pg.79)\\"this is one of the miracles of love; it gives- to both, .. a power of seeing through its own enchantments and yet not being disenchanted.\\" (pg.84)\\"God. His love and His knowledge are not distinct from one another. .. He sees because He loves, and therefore loves although He sees.\\" (pg.84)\\"We cannot understand. The best is perhaps what we understand least.\\" (pg.89, 3rd last paragraph).( thank you for reading this review and for your vote )"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis published A Grief Observed under the pseudonym N. W. Clerk, (the N. W. is Anglo-Saxon shorthand for nat whilk, \\"I know not whom\\"). In fact, the book was never published under Lewis' name while he lived. First published in 1961, it has been called an unsettling book and the use of a pseudonym seems to indicate that Lewis knew that it would be found so.Some argue that it is not about Lewis' anguish over his wife's, Joy's, death but instead a fictional account of grief. Mary Borhek summarizes the position of those who hold this view: \\"The only reasons I can see for believing the book to be a fictionalized account are a desire to distance oneself from the extreme discomfort of confronting naked agony and an unwillingness to grant a revered spiritual leader and teacher permission to be a real, fallible, intensely real human being.\\"Still others object to Lewis' candid expressions of anger at God, suggesting the book demonstrates Lewis' loss of faith: John Beversluis in his C. S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion states that \\"There is no case for Christianity in this book. Gone are the persuasive arguments and the witty analogies. Gone, too, are the confidence and urbanity evident in The Problem of Pain...The fundamental crisis of the book is a crisis of meaning, a crisis of such paralyzing magnitude that Lewis tries to distance himself from it in every possible way.\\"Noelene Kidd in A Grief Observed: Art, Apology, or Autobiography? argues the book \\"is not simply a record of Lewis's grief at the loss of his beloved wife...but a dissection of grief itself. The work is chiefly an apology concealed by art.\\" Still others find the book, while a deeply moving account of loss, overly introspective and emotional, verging on the maudlin. Yet Lewis avoids bathos in the book at least in part because of a clipped, prose style characterized by short, simple sentences and brief, almost snapshot-like paragraphs. These stylistic devices prevent his wallowing in excessive self-pity; in effect, he becomes a surgeon analyzing a patient's medical chart. Ironically, of course, he is at the same time both surgeon and patient.\\"Don King has written:\\"A close consideration of the prose style of A Grief Observed suggests the book may be read as vers libre or free verse, poetry relying not upon a regular metrical pattern but instead upon pace or cadence. Furthermore, whereas conventional poetry places a premium upon the foot and the line, free verse finds its rhythm in the stanza. Accordingly, the short paragraphs of A Grief Observed function as stanzas linking it with other ostensibly prose works such as Psalms and the Song of Songs. If we read Lewis' book this way, we may find that while his focus upon traditional poetic conventions in his consciously conceived poetry actually restrains his poetic impulse--that is, his concern with form overshadows his poetic sensibilities--the release he experiences unconsciously in free verse liberates his poetic impulse so that A Grief Observed becomes his greatest poem.\\"As I read A Grief Observed I had all this in the back of my mind. Occasionally I would find myself pulling parts of it out and rewriting them in my mind to reflect more of what I saw as in a poetic structure. Here are a few of what I did. I found they made the book more memorable for me, rather than saving a few quotations which is my normal reading practice.Her AbsenceAt first I was very afraid of going to places where H. and I had been happy,Our favorite pub, our favorite wood.But I decided to do it at once,Like sending a pilot up again as soon as possible after he's had a crash.Unexpectedly, it makes no difference.Her absence is no more emphatic in those places than anywhere else.It's not local at all.I suppose that if one were forbidden all salt one wouldn't notice it much more in any one food than in another.Eating in general would be different, every day, at every meal.It is like that.The act of living is different all through.Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.After All Hope Was GoneIt is incredible how much happiness, even how much gaiety, we sometimes had together,After all hope was gone.How long, how tranquilly, how nourishingly,We talked together that last night!And yet, not quite together.There's a limit to the 'one flesh.'You can't really share someone else's weakness, or fear or pain.What you feel may be bad.It might conceivably be as bad as what the other felt,Though I should distrust anyone who claimed that it was.But it would still be quite different.When I speak of fear, I mean the merely animal fear,The recoil of the organism from its destruction;The smothery feeling; the sense of being a rat in a trap.It can't be transferred.The mind can sympathize;The body, less.In one way the bodies of lovers can do it least.All their love passages have trained them to have, not identical, but complementary,Correlative,Even opposite, feelings about one another.We both knew this.I had my miseries, not hers;She had hers, not mine.The end of hers would be the coming-of-age of mine.We were setting out on different roads.This cold truth, this terrible traffic regulation('You, Madam, to the right-- you, Sir, to the left')Is just the beginning of the separationWhich is death itself.Praise Is The Mode Of LovePraise is the mode of love which always has some element of joy in it.Praise in due order;Of Him as the giver,Of her as the gift.Don't we in praise somehow enjoy what we praise,However far we are from it?I must do more of this.I have lost the fruition I once had of H.And I am far, far away in the valley of my unlikeness,From the fruition which,If His mercies are infinite,I may some time have of God.But by praising I can still,In some degree, Enjoy her,And already, In some degree,Enjoy Him.Better than nothing"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis, a confirmed intellectual bachelor, almost comically stumbled into a deeply romantic and erotic marriage late in life. An American poet, Joy Davidman, while visiting him in England was stricken with breast cancer. Her visa expired and she faced a mindlessly bureaucratic forced expulsion which probably would have killed her. Lewis agreed to what he expected to be a marriage of convenience, giving her a right to stay in England long enough to die peaceably. Unaccountably, almost impishly, she recovered and they became man and wife in fact and not just pro forma. Lewis was delighted, swept away and overwhelmed; he became radiantly happy.This brief moment of joy, was snatched from him, however, as the cancer reasserted itself. Lewis poured out his profound grief at the death of his wife on paper, sharing his thoughts, feelings, longings in a journal which became A Grief Observed. Unlike some of his other works, which are witty, philosophical, almost whimsical at times, this book is deeply personal and profoundly painful, almost raw in its emotional intensity. It is also a deep testament to Lewis's faith. Like all humanity, he faced loss and suffering and death. Lewis, like Job, transforms is somehow able to hand over all this darkness to the Lord in an act of sheer faith.My own father recently died. I found Lewis's book to be a great comfort and a powerful guide through the grieving process. I strongly recommend this to anyone who has recently lost a loved one.One note on the edition. This edition contains a foreword by Madeline L'Engle. The foreword enhanced the book, but earlier editions had a longer foreword (or possibly an afterword) by a male friend of Lewis which I found even more moving. I particularly remember a joke in the earlier edition about Lewis being surprised by Joy. If you've read the older edition, know that the supporting material is different."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I read \\"A Grief Observed\\" as part of a study I am making of C.S. Lewis as a Christian apologist. As an atheist, I approach the work as something of an outsider. I found the book very moving. Whatever I may think of Lewis' beliefs, his love for his wife was genuine and profound. I was a little surprised, actually, at how small a role Lewis' Christianity seemed to play in resolving his intense grief.I recommend the book to anyone, Christian or not, who has experienced the loss of someone close to them."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"'The Lord Gives, and the Lord takes away, blessed be the name of the Lord.' The Book of Job 1:21(I am not sure Lewis meant it, but 'observed' also has religious connotations - observing a time of mourning. The ancient traditions were rooted in emotional and spiritual truth.)It is only through great trial and long experience that anyone can say those words, understand their wisdom, and mean them. I can't really explain it to anyone. When I was twelve my best friend died of a congenital heart defect. The experience has shaped who I am, and my faith. For a long time I did not think I would ever even smile again. I knew few other people of any age who had experienced loss. Death is senseless and cruel - I was further reminded of that when a fellow college student was killed in a tragic accident last week. Things like that, like the September 11 attacks can bring back the old pain.Anyone who has experienced grief will truly appreciate this work. It is raw, fresh emotion, a play by play of what grief is at first. But it ends a little further up that road, when one can see that life will go on. Grief does not ever really end. Love is dangerous, to love someone is to risk that loss. But as this book attests God never leaves YOU despite appearances. He is stronger than our most raging emotion and doubt and can take our questions and pain. 'For he was a man acquainted with grief, accustomed to sorrow.' Isaiah 52:3The book is highly recommended, I only wish I could have read and understood it when I was younger."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is the book that helped me forgive God for doing what, at times, seems to be a lousy job. If you have ever railed at God for injustice, you have found a kindred spirit within these pages. C.S. Lewis' small book is journey from that anger to peace again. This is the book I give as a gift to grieving friends. Whether the grief is over the loss of a loved one, or a lost childhood. Buy at least two!"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When my four year-old son, Daniel, in spite of the prayers of many, died in 1997 after cancer treatments, I was angry. I had 'grown up' seeing &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; in my dad's pastoral study but never felt compelled to read it until I was shattered by my son's death. In the pages I related to Lewis' anger at God, his doubt, his fear. As a Christian it is comforting to know other Christians, especially this great man so respected, went through what I went through too. Lewis articulated my feelings about his relationship with God so well. I recommend this helpful book to all who have had to experience an untimely death of a loved one."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis can almost be described as a contradiction. For much of his life, he was an agnostic, eventually coming to accept Christianity not through any miraculous transformation, but through rational thinking. He was a confirmed bachelor, but wound up marrying late in life, to the American divorcee Joy Davidman, his perfect counterpart in almost every manner. His life was awakened by Joy's presence, but their brief marriage (just nearly four years) was terminated when Joy died of cancer. C.S. Lewis kept track of his thoughts and ramblings after this event in a series of notebooks that became \\"A Grief Observed\\".\\"A Grief Observed\\" is at times almost too personal. Lewis leaves nothing hidden, allowing readers access to his anger and his questioning of God. He claims that these are not all his thoughts, merely 'one in a hundred', that he has recorded as he tries to sort through his sorrow and grief. He likens his pain to various metaphors, including that of an amputee who still feels the pain of the lost limb - for Lewis, his lost wife who was part of him. He finds that it is always easy to offer comfort to those who have lost loved ones, to even pray for them, when they are not our loved ones.He questions God at every turn, eventually finding his way back to faith, seeing this challenge as a test of his faith and love. \\"God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality. He knew it already. It was I who didn't. In this trial He makes us occupy the dock, the witness box, and the bench all at once. He always knew that my temple was a house of cards. His only way of making me realize the fact was to knock it down.\\"\\"A Grief Observed\\" is a short book, under one hundred pages, filled out with an afterword that is a brief biographical sketch on Lewis by Chad Walsh, an English professor and friend of Joy Davidman. It is a fitting close to Lewis' thoughts, to take a brief look at his life from a man who knew both husband and wife. For someone of such legendary status as Lewis in the academic and literary worlds, it is a unique experience to see his weaknesses. Lewis acknowledges that there is no map that one can make of sorrow, for it is a process that everyone must go through, and it is reaffirming in faith to travel alongside him through his grief."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"In &quot;A Grief Observed,&quot; C.S. Lewis allows the reader to walk with him on his journey through grief. He was a brilliant scholar and Oxford professor whom people looked to for answers and meaning when suddenly his world was turned upside down by the loss of his wife Joy, who died of cancer in her 40s. In the book, he explores honestly the depth of his anguish and his search to find comfort and hope in the midst of the despair of loss.He describes many of the multitude of emotions that grief can bring, and also the seemingly endless barrage of unanswered questions he found himself asking. Ultimately he finds comfort and hope in his faith, but not before journey through a time of anguish and questioning God- even expressing his anger and shock at the loss.If you have lost a close loved one, or know someone who has, this book may be a great source of comfort in the midst of grief. I facilitate a grief support group, and a number of people have found it to be very helpful in coping with the loss of a family member or close friend. I have also found it to be a helpful source of comfort and hope in facing some of the losses in my life.I would highly recommend it to anyone facing grief and loss, as well as for caregivers, clergy and counselors who work with the bereaved."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"A heart wrenching little book by Jack Lewis. Originally a journal to record his feelings and fears, this is a classic trial of faith. Lewis is well known for his apologetics works, his logic, his wit, and his deep sense of Christianity. Yet here, after losing the woman he had come to love so much, everything is thrown into dismay and despair. God gently takes him by the hand, and walks him through this. To hear Lewis, this great Christian brother, rage and acknowledge his doubt during this trial of faith shows us we are not alone in our own trials. To anyone who has lost a spouse, very highly recommended. To anyone going through a hard time in their lives, recommended. God will always be with you, even if you can't see him. Admit your doubts and work through them, with God as your guide. C. S. Lewis called his faith a \`house of cards'. If yours is knocked down, let God walk you thru it, and have him build your faith on the firm rock of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He loves you - yield."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis wrote this little gem after his beloved wife, Joy, died of cancer. Knowing Lewis to be a man of deep faith and one of the most respected theologians of his day, secure in his beliefs, I was particularly interested in how he would react to such a soul-disemboweling blow. I was not disappointed -- like anyone else, he reeled.In A GRIEF OBSERVED, his struggle to regain his balance, physically and spiritually, is not unlike my own.Speaking of the grieving process he writes, &quot;At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet I want others to be about me. I dread moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me.&quot;He struggles with anger as well as with the things people say to him. His faith is challenged -- he calls God the &quot;great iconoclast,&quot; and he speaks of his fears.Lewis's rambling style is compatible with the confused and jumbled feelings of the bereaved. His anger, sense of bewilderment and suffocation along with recognition and acknowlegment of the feelings and emotions express the too-often inexpressable.This book is a fine and sensitive treatise on the pain of grieving and the soul's journey through the grieving process. I recommend it highly to anyone deep in grief or who is concerned about someone who is grieving."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When it comes to frank discussion of difficult issues, there's often a sense in which no approach will satisfy everyone. Those who offer a polished examination tend to be met with detractors who don't believe the approach was honest or in-depth enough. Those who offer an unpolished but 'brutally honest' approach tend to be met with detractors who think the 'brutal honesty' is questionable in terms of theological or intellectual integrity and could have stood for more sober reflection before being published. Because of this, a mysterious exchange occurs between writer and reader. When writer and reader aren't on the same page in terms of purpose or expectation, a letdown is usually the result. But on those occasions when the writer and reader make an enduring connection based on similar experiences, attitudes, etc, the result is often profound. While such a result can be dangerous since emotional or attitudinal connectivity is not a valid measure of whether the views expressed have a basis in objective truth or not and thus make belief in error all the more easy, the result, when anchored in truth, is formidable.Why do I say all this? Because I think if someone is coming to this book looking for a presentation on suffering that is airtight in its theology, this might be a disappointment. Lewis was no theologian, he was a layman who had an extra-ordinary desire to probe the things of God from the perspective of a layman. As a result, many of his works, while tremendously engaging and insightful, tend to be at least somewhat loose in their fidelity to Scriptural truths, which shouldn't be surprising since Lewis did not believe in the inerrancy of Scripture. Nonetheless, this particular effort is one of the most engaging works on suffering and grief from a Christian perspective and its insights should be taken very seriously.In this book, Lewis laments the vacuum left in his life by the passing of his wife. Along the way, he ponders out loud about a number of basic issues surrounding the goodness of God, the meaning of life, and the purpose of grief. The early chapters tend to be defined more by a spirit of grief resulting from an unsure anchor. This is the section where many of the particularly engaging musings about God and life are asked and not always answered. In the later chapters, as Lewis has further reflected on the goodness of God and the meaning of grief, his faith anchor becomes more stable, his perspective more secure, and his grief more manageable. This is no accident of course. What we see on these pages is one of the better Christian apologists of the 20th century having the sturdiness of his faith put to the ultimate test, and the result is a very penetrating look at grief from someone not removed from it and analyzing it from a distance, but one who is in the middle of it and is struggling with it personally.In the end, the reader might well agree with Lewis that the veridicality of the worldview and value system one adopts is most demonstrated when such things literally become matters of life and death personally. Does it merely work on paper and in the abstract, or is it also a source of absolute truth when brought home to roost in our most desperate hour. This is a formidable test for any worldview, and one that few are willing to honestly grapple with. Lewis does so here, and what we see is a man exposed by his grief, unable to hide behind anything else, and trying to make his worldview make sense in the midst of it. Very penetrating, very honest. A work that should be considered by all, but read with theological discernment."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is another amazing book by Lewis, and another that I have read multiple times. I have had to read it for at least three university courses over the last 18 years. This book is unlike anything else that Lewis ever wrote. It is raw, visceral and at times disturbing, unlike most of his other work that is very precise, specific, well argued and clearly laid out.Recently I heard this story: \`Douglas Gresham, C.S. Lewis's stepson recently released a book about Lewis called Jack's Life. It includes a DVD interview, where Gresham states that Lewis did not intend to publish A Grief Observed; it was a personal notebook. When it was published it was under the pseudonym NW Clark and by a publisher Lewis had never published with. Gresham also said that Lewis received numerous copies of the book as gifts from friends who thought it would help.' That speaks to the power in Lewis's writing; even his friends thought the book would be helpful for him as he journeyed through his grief.Lewis states in his book The Four Loves: \\"We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him, throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.\\" That view is drastically changed when he writes Grief. In A Grief Observed we have a very different approach. Lewis presents a very visceral response to the loss of his wife. An example of this is that Lewis states at the beginning of the book: \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.\\" This book shows us more of Lewis's own heart and life than almost anything else he wrote.It is a great book for those dealing with loss - either for yourself or for someone you know and love. It is often used in grief counseling, and one of the courses I read it for was on the spirituality of death and dying. This book is a gem in the cannon of Lewis literature. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"A Grief Observed is a journal C.S. Lewis kept immediately after the death of his wife. It is heart rending. It is frightening. It is more so if one has read any Lewis apologia prior. C.S. Lewis, a man so clear, so forthright in his beliefs, stumbles when that which he cherished most on earth is taken from him. As well he might.But, Lewis concludes a rousing comeback when he realizes that the suffocation of loss eventually turns to the closeness the passing of time can create. When the stunning horror finally fades, we recommune with our loved one to produce a spiritual unity; a recognition of all we loved, not of all we lost.Lewis points out that every human relationship ends in sorrow. But, in doing so, he charts a course for every mourner through the darkest nights into the light of day. 5 stars."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"In A Grief Observed, the heart of C.S. Lewis has been peeled away, revealing its tender, fragile core--the tender fragile core of a man who fully loved a woman.Lewis writes, \\"The act of living is different all through. Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.\\" (p. 11) Through these few words, Lewis captures for us the depth and breadth of his loss; it is above him, all around him, inescapable.Added to his longing for his beloved Joy, is his almost palpable grief. \\"I not only live each endless day in grief,\\" writes Lewis, \`but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.\\" (p. 10) Such emotional words, coming from a man devoured by grief, a man who usually writes such logically-driven, clear-headed theological expositions.And so is revealed to us C.S. Lewis, the man.Yet even in this time of immense loss, immense sadness, his faculties do not desert him. Lewis' sharp mind cuts through his grief, to once again to dissect theological concepts. Once such concept Lewis dissects is the reality of suffering as it relates to the nature of God.Lewis says \\"The more we believe that God hurts only to heal, the less we can believe that there is any use in begging for tenderness.\\" (p.43) Lewis then concludes that God must be a surgeon. \\"But suppose that what you are up against is a surgeon whose intentions are wholly good. The kinder and more conscientious he is, the more inexorably he will go on cutting.\\" (p.43)With his rapier-sharp mind, Lewis slices away dead dogma to reveal a sliver of the living truth: God is a surgeon who allows suffering for our healing.Sandra EggersAuthorDying Body, Growing Faith"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When suffering from grief who better to place your heart with than C.S. Lewis, the master at heartfelt emotions and faith.C.S. Lewis wrote this little book during the process of grieving for his beloved wife, Joy. He brings his raw emotions forward and shares the act of grief in a very human and profound message. Showing a variety of emotions he spans the process of mourning and makes the act appear \\"normal\\" even when the slightest steps of self-care become a chore. Lewis braves the unthinkable and questions a God that allows despair and refuses to comfort the one left behind. Few would voice this common feeling but Lewis goes beyond simply voicing his doubt and eventually unravels the mystery of faith during the most horrible of times. Jesus Christ even experienced this desolate feeling crying out to God as he hung dying on the cross....so if He must go through such a bitter process why would the average human being expect any different? Realizing this places a perspective on the pain and allows us to stop questioning whether death and loss arrives in a package entirely explainable. It happens at exactly the right time for the one who passes and we must learn to accept this despite our lack of understanding. As Lewis writes so eloquently, \\"Fate (or whatever it is) delights to produce a great capacity and then frustrate it.\\"Lewis takes standard thought processes and analyzes the theories behind their meaning and by doing so he helps the grieving process immensely. Hearing how our beloveds are with God causes one to ask, were they not \\"with God\\" before they died? And all those prayers said at bedsides and funerals, some with \\"miracles\\" attached and others seemingly lost actions are examined by Lewis as a process of torment by God, at once gracious only to prepare another torture in the end. Lewis reveals his anger towards God in hopes of leading to a deeper understanding of what faith really means. Grief becomes an act of desperation according to Lewis and seeing through tears often leads to blurred vision. Grief is merely fear incarnated. Ultimately it is through the observance of the dying that we discover the definitive peace and eventually find solace in faith."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book gave me much more insight into my continued grief based on the loss of my mother to cancer.

We all face the hurt, lonliness and longing for times that will never be shared with our loved one. Knowing that there will come a time when we will meet again is my great comfort.I have found this book and other books to be a great help.[...]"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"In the last book he'd ever write, C. S. Lewis showed a break from his usual encouraging and light-hearted discussions about Christianity in topical essays and fantasy (See The Chronicles of Narnia). A Grief Observed is compiled in the form of a diary, in which much thought and spirit had been commited, evident in the patient development of ideas over the span of days he was grieving his wife's death.I feel it is less an inspirational book than a self-assessment book, for Lewis highlighted a few doubtful questions he had and which he believed everyone should have asked instead of being ignorant or in staunch denial. Controversial questions on God's goodness, His realness and the reasons of [some] sufferings are raised, not to stumble [the reader] but paradoxically uplift.Interestingly, after reading this book, I wanted to know why we have hope in God, why we rejoice in His goodness which when asked about, we can only answer mindlessly with meaningless and bland model answers. Surely a Christian life demands a deeper realm of understanding and intimacy of/with God. Lewis depicted that maturity in his writing, through his boldness to admit his disappointments, his grief - which a Christian shouldn't be deprived of just because he believes in the hope of Heaven - and his doubts.It is not a long piece of literature, nor did it explore all kinds of suffering but only parochially death. Despite that, Lewis had produced yet one of the most honest accounts in the Christian context, about his love for his wife, his faith [which before was a card castle ever so vulnerable], and God's good intention in everything He does. Even in suffering. Even in physical pain. Listen and probably what you hear is not the slam of a door and bolting locks, but a voice that will tell you to continue trusting and be at peace.My salute to one of the most gifted and [Christian-wise] well versed writers."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I recently gave this to my grandmother after my grandfather passed away.

Recommended reading with large parts of the book identifiable for those who have lost any loved one, be it friend, parents, etc.."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As the fine line between life and death causes mortal man to pursue God, so had Lewis when his wife died. He knew God, but need to know God through this, and to believe God had not lost the love for which He sent Christ. Did God still exist enough to make living bearable without Joy, his wife?This book is excellent for any Christian, whether Catholic or Protestant (or any other variation) going through a state of loss. After a hard breakup, this book helped pull me out of the sucking mire of despair, bringing me toward hope.Buy the inexpensive copy, because the pages will be dogeared and well-read, and you'll likely find so healing, you'll buy copies for friends."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Not too much was insightful or original in this book. It seems like the same old trite cliches that have been used before to describe death. I t deals with the ordinary issues of death: Pain, suffering and how to cope with those issues as well as coping with your own mortality. Grief, sadness, heartache and coping. I found this book awfully unoriginal, dreadfully boring and quite unengaging and unappealing. Giving this book two stars is only because the writing was superb. The author articulates emotion so vividly and well. Very realistic. Every emotion was described in detail. I almost felt like it were happening to me, but it was too unrealistic, which was disappointing. Relating to this book is hard however. An interesting, but unnecessary read."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is my first CS Lewis book and this man is true intellectual giant. His train of thought throughout this book is brilliant. He is in such pain and asks the right questions at the right times.

It is a mere 89 pages, but its message is eternal!Even if you have never experienced grief, buy this book.

Indeed, all of us will have to observe our own grief."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Having lost my 13-year old brother in an accident 6 years ago, reading A Grief Observed was like reading my own stream of consciousness. Lewis asked the same questions I did, raged like I did, cried like I did. The Problem of Pain (written earlier by Lewis) addresses an intellectual problem, but A Grief Observed enters into the reality of the hellish world in which we live. And when tragedy comes the way of each person (and it will), Lewis's words offer comfort in a strange way, if only to let us know that we are not alone."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When CS Lewis writes, his words at times, are almost our &quot;other voice&quot;, the one we should probably listen harder for but because we are just earthly human beings do not. His sense of life and lifes multi-purposes permeate your soul and leave you thirsty for more. A GRIEF OBSERVED is an accounting of his beloved wife's death. But it is more than that. It is interesting to see him vacillate between his faith in God and his anger and frustration towards that same God. Although Lewis is not always coherent, the reader will understand especially if they themselves have experienced a devastating loss, that chaotic wavering of thoughts, that weaves in and out in the darkened halls of your mind, hopeful, in bringing you finally to a peaceful clearing. I have the collection of CS Lewis works but if you must have one or two, THE PROBLEM WITH PAIN and A GRIEF OBSERVED is a good place to start."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"For CS Lewis fans I will be slaughtered by this review. I absolutely love \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". Every single thing about it. Recently my son was killed in a tragic accident and searching for some type of comfort I ordered this book. I read this book, I read it very slow to make sure nothing was missed. This book rambled on, with meaningless sentences, very complicated hard to read pages and at the end of it, I had learned nothing except he truly loved his wife and she suffered until the end of her life, and it is his thoughts of her after her death. There was not one single thing I could apply to my own life or use as something to comfort others. The bottom line for me is 1} I would not read it again 2} I would not buy it as a gift for someone enduring grief. sincerely, r. jeansonne"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I had read A Grief Observed many years ago and after recently losing my husband wanted to read it again.

It shows the humanity of grief."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"After the death of his wife, Joy Davidman, in 1960, C. S. Lewis, the widely-read Christian apologist and scholar of medieval literature, used a series of notebook entries to vent, to explore, to question, to explain, and to come to terms with his grief and his God. The result, originally published pseudonymously in 1961, is a deeply personal examination of faith, doubt, pain, and intense love. This short book manifests the same depth and clarity of thought that are the hallmarks of Lewis's most popular works, but it has the added quality of introspection and even expurgation that his other works appropriately do not have. The arresting opening line--\\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear\\"--makes it clear how unexpected Lewis's experience was. It was not the death that was unexpected (indeed, Joy had been ill for some time). Rather, it was the way in which her death reached places inside him that perhaps he had not explored before, simply because he had never loved anyone in that way before. To lose her was to lose a part of himself. No wonder it felt like fear. This is not a book that tries to comfort the reader. It does not minimize the pain of loss, nor does Lewis take refuge in assurances that \\"she is in a better place.\\" It is an honest, tough-minded chronicle of one man's attempt to do justice both to his love for his wife and God's love for His creatures.While exploring his grief and the limits of his willingness to give God the benefit of the doubt, Lewis discovers many things about himself. I liked this one (p. 52): \\"God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality. He knew it already. It was I who didn't.\\" It is typical Lewis, but directed at his own faith rather than at the proposition of faith in general. This is a book well worth reading for anyone who is interested in the spiritual dimension of grief, the resilience of faith through the crucible of pain, or the life of C. S. Lewis."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"A grief observedLewis provided me great comfort with his heart felt, honest appraisal of his own internal processes when confronted with the death of his wife. It renosated powerfully with my own experience and I would suggest the experience of being human."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is by no means a happy book but is excellent for walking through grief or depression. C.S. Lewis does not sugar coat the process by any means and the book journeys through his grief over the loss of his wife. It is a bit easier of an read than some of Lewis's other works, and it is not long at all. I read it during a time of depression, and found it helped me to be much more at peace with the process of grief., and the spiritual questions it raises."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book is one of my absolute favorites by C.S.

This is a very intimate book on his own struggles, and his faith that helped him overcome much of it."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This was, in its own right, a refreshing glimpse of brutal honesty and transparency as Lewis allows us to, in part, enter into grief with him."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S.

It is particularly compelling to read him in such a personal battle of faith, after the loss of his beloved wife. I can't help but be grateful that he was willing to share that with us."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The first time I read this book, I didn't &quot;get it.&quot; I read it again after my grandmother died. Then it made sense. Grief isn't doubting, nor is it questioning, but it is an emotion that is even less rational than most emotions.This book presents Lewis &quot;working through&quot; his grief. He doesn't come to any conclusions per se. In fact, this book doesn't quite have a beginning. But it is a snapshot of a grief-journey that is common to us all.I am amazed at one thing: since grief is so common, why don't we understand it more? This book sheds some light on a faithful man's grief."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C. S. Lewis' book A GRIEF OBSERVED was immeasurably helpful to me as I struggled - and still struggle - to come to grips with the death of my brother. Knowing that Lewis was a deeply religious man, I was reassured that even the religious have doubts about God's goodness. I also found his discussion of the notion of one's faith being tested in times of trouble, highly personal and relevant. I am sending this book to my mother, and others, who still struggles with an abrupt and seemingly final loss."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The synopsis, the publisher, and the reader from Colorado are all right on target with their comments about this honest, emotionally moving book. Lewis does not hid behind a mask of professorial hubris or pull any punches as he openly confesses his doubts about God and vents his grief in the pages of his journal. He pours out his emotions in what is probably the most &quot;personal&quot; of all his books. Both those suffering the loss of a loved one and those who aren't will be helped by reading this book. Certainly worth obtaining."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is probably one of my favorite books CS lewis has written. It is extremely sad and if it were not for CS Lewis's incredible ability to make the most horrific parts of reality poetic and beautiful than it would be hard to get through the book. CS Lewis seems to identify in this book all of the parts of Christianity that really are not rational that he had been blind to when he wrote the books that he is much more famous for. This book is great for someone who is constantly having questions tugging in the back of their minds that Theologians and typical Christians don't ever seem to face directly. Lewis faces these questions with complete honesty oppose to most Christian writers who only bring up the specific parts of the hard questions that they think that they can answer well. I think the reason this book isn't as famous as some of his legendary books is only because the readers are probably uncomfortable with talking about the difficult paradoxes that are impossible to answer perfectly that Lewis brings up."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"\\"A Grief Observed\\" was one of the most powerful books I've ever read. I first read it 5 or 6 years ago. I was amazed at how short the book was but was slammed with the deep grief I felt from Lewis's words. He wrote the book only 4 months after losing his wife Joy. Here was grief displayed in all its rawness and vulnarability. I felt I truly understood this man's heart & soul during his mouring. He questions God &, even, verbally raises his fist to Him. Lewis had written about pain & suffering in his book \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" but I think he was doing just that: writing about it. Other than the lose of his mother as a child, he had not experienced what he wrote about. God took Lewis on a journey of love & suffering when he met & married Joy Gresham. In the play \\"Shadowlands,\\" when Joy is dying of cancer, she asks Lewis if their love was worth the suffering they were going through. That's the question Lewis faces. As the book progesses, one can read how Lewis begins to process his grief. At the end, he doesn't find answers to his deep questions, but He knows that God is God & is still sovereign.Since reading the book, I've lost both parents, one suddenly & one gradually. I've experienced deep grief & now understand Lewis's grief. I have since re-read the book. I didn't go through the questioning that Lewis did, but I understood why he did it. There is an instant brotherhood among those who have experienced lose. Seeing another's pain immediately brings back one's own pain. I think this book would be helpful to those who have suffered the loss of a beloved, however, not until after a period of time. I don't know if the book would be helpful to one, who had recently suffered loss because the words & the person's grief are still painful."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Grief is a vacuum and the mourner is an embarrassment to everyone he meets, Lewis concludes. The bereaved person experiences horror because the she (or he), the decedent, will not live in memory. Impressions will fade.The author's experience was that the consolations of religion were not available. Reality is unbearable, it is asserted. Grief feels like fear. The world seems flat, shabby in grief.When something really happens it is different than what has been bargained for. The author compares God to a surgeon, he keeps on cutting. Grief feels like suspense. (It is a severe interruption of habit.)A wife plays many roles, contains so many persons in herself as Lewis puts the matter. The interest of the book is the psychology in it."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I'm a huge fan of anything by Lewis, and this one is no exception. The book isn't meant to be read as a lesson on how to deal with grief or a comment on the human experience of grief. Rather, it contains the raw emotions of one man's individual experience. You see Lewis's grief, anger and doubts, and you also see how he begins to resolve the issue of pain, death, and separation with his faith. Readers should be advised that the author is a Christian and writes a good deal about his faith and how it is challenged and grown through his grief. I've seen other reviewers complain about the inclusion of his faith, but I don't think that should be unexpected from a Christian author in a book dealing with death. It is intensely personal and beautifully written. In short, it's heartbreaking and challenging, but completely worth the read. It's one that I'll keep around and pull out over and over again."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book simply ripped my heart out when I read it. I cried like a baby. He's so honest about how he feels about God when his wife of 3 years passes away. Lewis is a genius in his other writings, but here, we see a man hurting. We see what grief does to the human soul and the questions that come with it."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I got this for my mother shortly after my beloved dad died in November. They had been married for 57 years. While Lewis' marriage was tragically short by comparison, I suspect many widowers and widows can relate to his anguish. This is a profoundly personal memoir from a brilliant Christian theologian. Yes, he wrestles with theological questions, but in a way many of us can relate to. This is by no means a \\"preachy\\" book, and it's brief, just 70-some-odd pages. Brought low by devastating grief, Lewis' expressions of pain are at times raw and heart-rending. Ultimately, however, his musings are life- and faith-affirming. I recommend this to anyone who has lost a loved one -- I benefited from it as a bereaved daughter -- and particularly to mourners who are Christians."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When my husband died after a long illness, someone recommended this book. One of the hardest parts about beginning to grieve is putting your feelings into words. C S Lewis does so here in his memoir of losing his beloved wife. This quick read helped me make sense of what I was feeling and that I was not alone feeling like this. I give it as a gift to people who suffer and extreme loss."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is another amazing book by Lewis, and another that I have read multiple times. I have had to read it for at least three university courses over the last 18 years. This book is unlike anything else that Lewis ever wrote. It is raw, visceral and at times disturbing, unlike most of his other work that is very precise, specific, well argued and clearly laid out.Recently I heard this story: \`Douglas Gresham, C.S. Lewis's stepson recently released a book about Lewis called Jack's Life. It includes a DVD interview, where Gresham states that Lewis did not intend to publish A Grief Observed; it was a personal notebook. When it was published it was under the pseudonym NW Clark and by a publisher Lewis had never published with. Gresham also said that Lewis received numerous copies of the book as gifts from friends who thought it would help.' That speaks to the power in Lewis's writing; even his friends thought the book would be helpful for him as he journeyed through his grief.Lewis states in his book The Four Loves: \\"We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him, throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.\\" That view is drastically changed when he writes Grief. In A Grief Observed we have a very different approach. Lewis presents a very visceral response to the loss of his wife. An example of this is that Lewis states at the beginning of the book: \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.\\" This book shows us more of Lewis's own heart and life than almost anything else he wrote.It is a great book for those dealing with loss - either for yourself or for someone you know and love. It is often used in grief counseling, and one of the courses I read it for was on the spirituality of death and dying. This book is a gem in the cannon of Lewis literature. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"One of the things I've always loved about C. S. Lewis is that there isn't the slightest hint of fakery in him. When you read his words, you read his heart. This is most true in his book, A Grief Observed.These \\"jottings\\" were made in Lewis's private journals after the death of his wife, Joy, from cancer. They weren't intended for publication when written, but Jack later decided that they might help someone else who might be going through a similar experience as he.This is Jack Lewis as Jacob, wrestling with God. It is not always a pleasant sight to behold, and yet we cannot take our eyes off it. He bites and scratches and yells at God at the top of his lungs, then falls back in a heaving mass of quivering flesh. But like Jacob of old, Lewis will not turn loose until God blesses him. And ultimately God does bless him - and us through him.There are too many profound passages to quote. And we don't really want to quote everything. It would be like uncovering a secret. Lewis honesty sometimes borders on discomfort, a discomfort we feel with him and, if we have experienced a similar loss, understand.The first sentence of the book sent sharp razors of memory through me. \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear.\\" After my father died, I remember that strange sensation myself. I didn't realize that grief manifested itself like fear. Lewis goes on to describe his mourning in terms so eloquent, and yet, when we read them, so real. In speaking about the memory of his wife showing up at particular times and in particular places, Lewis says no. \\"Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.\\" He speaks of how her face is becoming blurred in his memory, while her voice is still vivid. \\"The remembered voice - that can turn me at any moment to a whimpering child.\\"Lewis eventually finds his way through the terrifying maze of grief and finds that the God he was wrestling with was holding him in His arms all the time. \\"God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality. He knew it already. It was I who didn't.\\"The lesson, for me, is that our ideas of how things \\"ought to be\\" are illusions of the truth that really is. God, through the natural process of death and grieving shatters our illusions and causes us to come face to face with truth. This is often extraordinarily painful. Says Lewis, \\"My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast. Could we not almost say that this shattering is one of the marks of His presence?\\"Dr. Mike Kear"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"For starters I would highly encourage anyone who picks up \\"A Grief Observed\\" to read it alonside \\"The Problem of Pain\\". In the introduction to \\"The Problem of Pain\\" Lewis admits that he has not had to deal with the issue of \\"pain\\" very severely in his life; of course this was written prior to \\"A Grief Observed\\", which the read of the two in conjunction so interesting. In \\"The Problem of Pain\\" Lewis tackles the perennial apologetic issue of why does pain, evil, etc. exist. Lewis tackles this problem from a philosophical/theological point of view. In \\"A Grief Observed\\" you have the honest struggles of a man, who has already grappled \\"mentally\\" with this issue, and is now having to grapple with this issue in a real and personal way. Having read many of Lewis' other works it was surprising to me to read \\"A Grief Observed\\" and to see the down right honesty of a man struggling with his pain and his faith in the midst of it. At times you are shocked by what Lewis says, especially since he has been placed on a pedestal for so many years and by many people. But it is also refreshing, in a sense, to read how this \\"great man of faith\\" had to contend with one of the harshest realities of life, which is dealing with the death of a loved one and the aftershocks of pain. His personal ruminations on dealing with the death of Joy reminded me much of the lament psalms of the Old Testament. And yet despite his \\"dark night of the soul\\" you discover that he finds hope in the midst of tragedy...rooted of course in Jesus Christ. By all means don't miss out on reading this little, but powerful book. This book helps to \\"round-out\\" the character of C.S. Lewis even more so."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I am *very* deeply moved by this account of the feelings and thoughts C.S. Lewis shared from his time of grief. It's an extremely brave thing to make himself vulnerable in this way, especially a man who spent so much time weaving a powerfully rational case for the Christian faith. For him to openly reveal his doubt, fear, and even anger is a truly courageous act. Lewis has now gone on to meet his Creator and has the answers to all his questions and the end to all his anguish, but for those of us who live now, he has left an amazing gift.I have not lost a spouse or immediate family member, but not too long ago I went through a three-month period that seemed like some sort of hell on Earth to me where loss seemed to strike everywhere around me. I felt like it was circling me in a very predatory manner. One particular loss hit me with unexpected force (not to diminish any of the others), and perhaps for the very first time in my life I truly grieved for a person, and still do in a way (it never truly ends--we simply find a way of picking up the pieces and putting them into a new pattern). Reading A Grief Obserrved was a tremendous help to me because it helped me not to be ashamed or isolated in the feelings I had--once this is dispensed with, it becomes a bit easier to truly integrate the experience (I say this rather than &quot;move past&quot;...while you ought not &quot;dwell in it&quot; forever, you ought not bury it, either. Neither do any good).Perhaps the bravest part of this journal, in my opinion, is where Lewis admits openly to his anger at God, his doubts. Especialy for someone such as him, this is most courageous. In my case it took a terrible nightmare to truly make me face the fact that I was *angry*. I was sad, I begged God to stop the unbroken chain of losses, but I was *angry* too, angry especially at the fact that every one of the dead was middle-aged, much as Lewis' wife was, and &quot;should have&quot; had much more time. I was terrified, felt my life had gone out of control, that my moods were uncontrollable, and that none of it was at all fair. I wanted peace and reconciliation so terribly much, but it wouldn't come. These are also much like things Lewis describes.One statement of Lewis' hit me very hard and, I think, explained to me why peace wouldn't come. Lewis and I both cried out at one point that we felt we'd found, at the time we needed Him the most, &quot;a door slammed in [our faces]&quot;. But then, he realizes a thing that fits perfectly with my own experiences: &quot;Was it my own frantic need that slammed it in my face? The time when there is nothing in your soul except a cry for help may be just the time when God can't give it: you are like the drowning man who clutches and grabs. Perhaps your own reiterated cries deafen you to the voice you hoped to hear.&quot; For me, true peace is usually heralded by a dream. When I cried to God for it, struggled to create it by force in myself, it wouldn't come. But then one morning as I lay there in a peaceful state, I gently slipped away into it without any effort to get there or, once I realized what it was, any struggle to hold myself in it. It simply *was*--perhaps because I finally just lay back and opened the door to what was there all along...there was never any abandonment by God.This is not to say we should try to curtail the grieving process. We have to endure it--that's how we deal with things. But it can help, even if just a bit, to see your own experiences, even the darkest parts, mirrored in those of another. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has suffered or is suffering from grief. If you're getting it for someone else, please be aware that they will take it in only in their own time, no one else's--or they may ultimately have to find a different way for themselves. Please don't take that as a rejection of you and your gift, or a devaluation of this book. But for those who *do* choose this, I can say I believe it will be meaningful."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is another amazing book by Lewis, and another that I have read multiple times. I have had to read it for at least three university courses over the last 18 years. This book is unlike anything else that Lewis ever wrote. It is raw, visceral and at times disturbing, unlike most of his other work that is very precise, specific, well argued and clearly laid out.Recently I heard this story: \`Douglas Gresham, C.S. Lewis's stepson recently released a book about Lewis called Jack's Life. It includes a DVD interview, where Gresham states that Lewis did not intend to publish A Grief Observed; it was a personal notebook. When it was published it was under the pseudonym NW Clark and by a publisher Lewis had never published with. Gresham also said that Lewis received numerous copies of the book as gifts from friends who thought it would help.'

It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis is now being credited for being Christianity's greatest defender in the 20th century, and the writer who gave faith credibility at a time when faith seemed a childish delusion. The reason so many of Lewis' writings have been a strong defense of faith probably has less to do with his actual beliefs, as much as his skill as an orator and writer. His detractors will readily admit that, knowing that if you may not agree with his conclusions, it is difficult to fault his arguments. Yet for people of faith, logic is nice, but it is often too dry. The lived experience of faith is far more significant than rhetoric. For people of faith who love and admire Lewis, A GRIEF OBSERVED is indispensable. This work, which deals with the grief an loss he experienced when his beloved wife Joy suffers from cancer and eventually dies, demonstrates Lewis' own struggles with belief, and demonstrates that for Lewis, his faith is not a philosophical point of view, but the motivation of his life.Since its publication, readers have turned to this work for a number of reasons. Most have either lost someone they love or are trying to assist someone with loss. Readers soon discover that the book challenges the reader, then consoles the reader, and immediately challenges once again. Readers feel a whirlwind of emotions, giving a glimpse of the emotions we feel in a time of grief. In Lewis we find a person who truly mourns, but one who gives us an example on faith that is shaken and tested, but is ultimately solid. Countless readers have discovered that Lewis' experiences resonate with their own, and have made this work a spiritual classic.When I first read A GRIEF OBSERVED, I had not yet lost anyone significant in my life or at least anyone who was significant who was not aged and had lived a full life. I still had an appreciation for what Lewis had to say, but it was a bookish knowledge. Since that time I have lost loved ones and have seen loved ones suffer, especially my own father, who died young and battled cancer in the form of a brain tumor for nearly twenty years. It was while sitting at his bedside a week before he died that Lewis' words seemed so real to me, and I realized I was not alone in how I felt. I have no idea of whether I recalled Lewis' words as I sat by my father's bedside, but I know my faith was tested at that time, but my faith sustained me as well. I also know that Lewis' struggles in A GRIEF OBSERVED were somewhere in my unconscious mind, helping me though and giving me hope."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis's humanity comes across in A Grief Observed more so than in any of his other books. In most of his work, we get the \\"keep a stiff uppper lip\\" attitude, and even though that is not a completely bad attitude to have, we all must cry sometimes-- even master defenders of the Christian faith like C.S. Lewis. Orginally, Lewis published A Grief Observed using a pseudonym because as the world's foremost Christian writer, he feared he would be labelled an apostate. The first chapters of the book come across as the work of a man who has lost his faith. Lewis says, for instance, that he shouted at God. But by the book's end, (Hope I'm not giving too much away here) Lewis's heart is calmed and his faith is restored to full strength because it is by his faith that he understands that he will get to see his beloved Joy again some day. This book made me cry, but it made me smile too. It is powerful and worthy of being read by all. [...]"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis' \\"A Grief Observed\\" is surely shocking to anyone who has read \\"The Great Divorce\\" or \\"The Screwtape Letters\\". Not merely for the depth of Lewis' crisis of faith, but for the savagery with which he dispatches our common platitudes about loss.This is one area in which Lewis and I diverge in our experience of the death of our wives. Where Lewis is affronted by assurances of salvation, such realities are a great comfort to me. In most other aspects, Lewis does a remarkable job of expressing the inexpressible, and it makes me want to give this book to those around me so that they can understand.I continue to be surprised by the extent to which shared experience is reassuring - I do not think I am the kind of person who needs affirmation of my thoughts or feelings. Either the death of a spouse is so traumatic that I am unable to cope alone, or it has peeled off the veneer of my self-reliance. In any case, reading Lewis, with his wonderful capacity for imagery, expressing what I cannot express, has been a great benefit.\\"A Grief Observed\\" feels compressed. It is a quick read, but surely comprises in its unedited form the many pages of manuscript that Lewis references. There are some uncomfortable moments, such as the mention of \\"the spirtualists\\" and the strange mental encounter that Lewis reports. But though accelerated, both the maddening grief, and the slow healing, are authentic and bear familiar touches. The loss of value in familiar and once-treasured things, the desire for company with the simultaneous resistance to conversation, the sense of wandering the same landscape and going in circles - I share all of these sensations with Lewis. But reading his description allows me to put my finger on things that are otherwise amorphous and ill-related.I have to deduct one star from the review as a protest against the (thankfully brief) foreward by Madeleine L'Engle. As I have repeated complained in reviews on Amazon.com, I do not understand the predilection of publishers for selecting the most inapropriate people to write forewards. Prefacing Lewis' work with a writer who complains of the \\"pre-Copernican attitude toward death\\" of the church strikes me as an attempt by the publisher to recruit Lewis toward the new-age secular spiritualism that would have been anathema. I have to hope for a future Ignatius Press version with a foreward by Joseph Pearce."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who are in grief and those who haven't got a clue. If you're among the latter, I suggest you get down on your knees and thank God, Good Fortune, or whatever you happen to believe for your blessed ignorance. And by all means keep telling yourself your own death is a faraway thing, it'll help you through many a bad night.This book is the howling of a poet in anguish. Perhaps the most powerful journal ever written. The jottings of an acclaimed pop apologist who forsakes lame platitudes from well meaning friends and pat answers from the religion he once championed.\\"It is hard to have patience with people who say 'there is no death' or 'death doesn't matter'. There is death. And whatever is matters. And whatever happens has consequences, and it and they are irrevocable and irreversible. You might as well say that birth does not matter.

A magnificent work of honesty and courage."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"By most accounts, CS Lewis is considered one of the top Christian apologists of the 20th century. This fact makes this book even more powerful than some of his others because even Lewis doubts his faith when faced with an extremely difficult situation, the death of his wife. Also, this book shows a much more personal side to Lewis as he struggles to find God and answers to his questions.This book is somewhat difficult to read for two reasons. First, the subject is tough. I cannot a harder to discuss the death of a loved one, especially a spouse. Second, the book is based on a journal that Lewis kept which means that the text is not as tight as some of his other books. Oddly enough, these two facts actually make the book stronger than some of his other works.The reader gains deep insight into the soul of Lewis as he seeks God for answers. This is more than just an intellectual exercise. Lewis exposes his emotions in a way that is authentic and real - his writing comes across as very honest. Although I have never lost someone close to me I certainly can appreciate the pain that Lewis experienced. As a Christian I am definitely encouraged that someone with a faith as strong as Lewis experienced doubt, but in the end found his way back to God.I highly recommend this book, especially since it shows a side to Lewis that you will not find in his other books. Also, it could minister to you, or others who have lost a loved one."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis journal records his reactions upon the loss of his wife. He had married late in life, and he and his wife were especially close. She opened up to him a world of love and warmth he had never known. The loss of her was the loss of the special blessed life they had found.I was reminded of this book because I read an especially good review of it in 'The New Republic' by Rochelle Gurstein.I quote a passage which has an understanding of the heart of the book I did not get in my own reading.\\" The story moves toward a close with Lewis struggling to put into words a sublime yet terrible paradox: \\"Lord ... can I meet H. again only if I learn to love you so much that I don't care whether I meet her or not?\\" Lewis's capacity to formulate this paradox signals a renewal of his faith. And while it gives him the hope of redemption and a future reunion with his wife, it also makes clear why religion does not offer any consolations, for Lewis must accept precisely what he found most unbearable when he was in the throes of grief: that he will never again meet the particular woman he loved with all his being. Indeed, their eternal reunion is possible only if he gives up all such earthly illusions.\\""},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is a mournful book, but it ends in hope. On the death of his wife, C.S. Lewis went through a time of confusion and penned these expressions of grief in assorted notebooks throughout his house, later collecting them into a book published under another name. In this book he reveals his doubts and worries and despairs and self-reprimands, yet interlaced throughout he maintains (tenuously at times) his hope in God, and comes out more faithful than ever.This book is not a theological or literary treasure like Lewis' other works. This book is a tale of grief. We find in Scripture and all of literature the theme of grief and mourning over the loss of loved ones. Lewis here expresses his own experience with this grief, and seeks to encourage readers with his thoughts."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is C S Lewis at his best, the lose of his wife, and the turning point in his life all discussed in great depth."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"In this genuine diary, C.

Some may be mommified in the past memories, but Lewis refused to let another death take place in his life. His deep belief in God is not a consolation for a better place in paradise. Lewis express his anger, frustration to God who seems to be in &quot;an empty house&quot;. Who knows if pain stops or continues after death? In the midst of our tears there's no place to hear God's answer because we are too self-centered with our pain. If our belief in God is like a &quot;card house&quot; then, let it fall apart. God must be trust for who He is and not for How we can use Him...

I read the Narnia series as a kid, but have not read books for years, until recently. This book was deep, and full of the genius Lewis is known for. He expresses the pain of losing his wife, and the questions that those who mourn often work through, but are too guilty to express publically. The work is awesome, and may help some who are going through similar feelings of greif. Skip the aknowlegement at the beginning by Madeline Engle, I am not familiar with her writing, but have heard the name. I am surprised she was chosen to write the aknowlegement, but it is an amusing contrast to Lewis' intellect and spiritual understanding. The aknowlegement exudes an attitude of confidence in spiritual issues, yet reveals a cluelessness and spiritual blindess found largely in todays new age books. It does not belong in a CS Lewis book."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"A Christain apologist trys to reconcile suffering with the idea that &#34;God is Good&#34;. It doesn't quite do it for me."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"In addition to authoring the Chronicles of Narnia, C. S. Lewis also wrote a number of other good books about the various aspects of Christian life, and the major issues faced by Christianity in the modern age; most of which are even more problematic today. Those books are enlightening, clever and informative.This book, by contrast, is really more of a story about his own spiritual journey through a time of great difficulty for him; the passing away of his wife. The book is therefore, not as instructive to serious students of theology, or to people trying to discern what the true Christian teachings about God, faith and the afterlife really are. It does, however, paint a very vivid picture of what can go through the mind of a suffering Christian.Chapter 1 is the chapter with all the insulting guesses about God. When one suffers badly, one often does this. Even very faithful people sometimes question whether God enjoys watching them suffer, or whether it's possible for God to be evil. This diminishes through chapters 2 and 3, as Lewis continues to reflect on his loss, and to gradually recover from it. Chapter 4 is clearly meant to end on a ray of hope.I say \\"meant to,\\" because I don't really believe that chapter 4 was written after the grief had passed. Much of what Lewis suggests about souls, the afterlife and our relationship with God in this chapter is, I think, theologically-questionable. In fact, I overcame many of these same questions and worries only very recently.In a way, though, I think the fact that I can sympathise with Lewis on his journey of rediscovering the truths of the faith after a shattering tragedy makes it easier for me to appreciate what went into this book. I just don't feel the finished product should be quoted as instructions on anything.I've been in tough times, where I agonized over everything, and some of the stuff I wrote back then, I can barely stand to read anymore. I think our worst writing comes out of the times when we suffer, and while I'm sure this book is a tremendous comfort to many people in their own times of suffering, I found it kind of tough to get through.This may or may not be a reflection on the quality of the book, however. Maybe I'm just not in the right kind of mood to appreciate it. One thing's for sure; the issues raised in the various chapters of this book correspond very closely to the questions that I myself have worried over in the course of my own life; the issues that have gotten between me and the faith.I guess that's a good point in favor of this book. It seems to ask all the right questions. I just wish it offered better answers to them."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I approach every CS Lewis book with a great source of expectations. I still remember the wonder of discovering Prince Caspian as a child and the sheer joy of beginning the trilogy in the middle of the series...!In most of the writing of Lewis there is a lot that people can learn, but there is also a lot that CS Lewis takes for granted.In dealing with the death of a child (my own personal grief). I may have come from a particularly hard death experience... I think in the grand scheme of things a child's death is a somewhat harder prospect than an adult or elderly death --- in the end we were not born to bury our own children. Their line of ancestry is finished forever. They will never grow up, never experience things that even young adults experience... for especially young children with genetic problems, their mere conception dooms them.Is there meaning in any of this? If so what meaning? In the end CS Lewis struggles with an environment and cultural milleiu he feels in some ways confines his grief.To be sure CS Lewis' grief cannot be my grief... or anyone's grief and he does not presuppose so. Some of the topic is however dated: in the early 50s society was more repressed, people were uncomfortable with death and even crying was something that was somewhat shaming for others to witness -- the assumption being that people crying meant one should leave their presence. Society has grown up fortunately. Most people are warm, loving and able to reach out to those in need with little or no sense of embarrassment. That clearly was not the case in CS Lewis' time. So this experience, beautifully related, was of interesting historical note, but little comfort.Also the central question of meaning is where CS Lewis falls ultimately into a sort of neo-traditional Christian interpretation of suffering -- at the end of the day he believes that man was born into sin and therefore born to suffer. For those raised on such cultural suppositories, the literal translation of the scriptures ultimately is a source of comfort.Ultimately you must abandon reason to tread the path of Lewis. And it is here that I personally cannot tread. Without going into detail there are just too many contradictions to believe in such a version of a God. Contradictions will continue and cannot be resolved. In that sense maybe Christianity had it right -- we can never resolve such contradictions -- we are born to relive them... over and over... and over in our head and must have the courage to face them and know that there is no apparent meaning in the traditional western christian conception of suffering that makes any real sense.For me meaning is important, and there must be meaning in the life of such a little girl, or anyone who lived, however short a life. And so... I resolved that I would honour the life and give it meaning within the memory of the living and try as much to construct things that would endure after death. This is really as much as I, or anyone can ever do.One can surrender to all the balms or \\"other worlds\\" but these are not rational constructs. They are cultural myths -- Lewis through grief ultimately swims into the warmth of faith, but it is ultimately a blind leap of logic and something that I could never do without having thoughts I had deceived myself and my deceased daughter's memory. So I honour her with action and rememberance. We place her memories in close contact with us and remember her everyday and make sure that others can do so as well.Lewis had other ideas and I think that he is a wonderful writer. Some of his struggles I have felt in his writing, but I cannot reach the conclusions he has come to without thinking I have somehow betrayed the logic a supreme being may have endowed me with....And that is the lot of mankind. Whether Christian or Humanist, we suffer. It is for each of us to make meaning in the madness of life. CS Lewis has his truth... but it isn't mine... I wish his could be mine...-----------PS: The introduction by his son is particularly bad with references to \\"the Devil\\" as a real entity injecting doubt in grief. This retrograde, medieval interpretation of the Bible certainly is jolting alongside CS Lewis' rather transcendental book -- it should be removed."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"It can be a little unsettling to see one of the paragons of the Christian faith come to terms with grief by asking if God is a cosmic sadist. But it is ultimately comforting to see that even a man that seemed to have all the answers asked the same questions that the rest of us ask and at the end of it, come through with an even stronger faith in God.Lewis goes through all the problems that come with grief and loss. A sense of isolation, annoyance at the pat answers (&quot;They're in a better place..&quot;), and wondering where God is. He expresses a sense of worry at forgetting his wife and being forced to remember her only through inadequate picture albums.Towards the end he rallys, however, and comes to terms with pain.Personally, I am glad the Lewis had the courage to write this book, albeit with a penname. Who would of thought that loss isn't the end?"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Shadowlands has long been one of my favorite movies, so I've always wanted to read the book that inspired.

The emotion displayed is powerful as is the intellect.I'm am currently a college student who (thank God) has not yet had to suffer as much pain and loneliness as is dispayed here. I know that at this point in my life I cannot really relate to this book. But I am so thankful that A Grief Observed will be here to turn to when I do have to live through this type of situation.

Or maybe just his heart. As you turn the pages, it doesn't feel like you are reading a lecture on God or death or the meaning of life. Instead, it is as if you are seeing inside C.S. Lewis' mind, feeling his grief, watching it sculpt and be sculpted by his thoughts. He contradicts himself, changes his mind, wonders out loud. A friend of mine asked me what the book was about, and I told him it was &quot;emotional vomit.&quot; C.S. Lewis, going through a very difficult time in his life, just puked his thoughts onto the page. It isn't always clear what he's saying or where he's headed--it probably wasn't clear to him when he wrote it--but it is genuine. And to read something that pure and heartfealt truly is a rare treat."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Another author I've been reading and loving, Philip Yancey, has admired and quoted C. S. Lewis so often, my curiosity compelled me to read one of his works.Although he's a very thoughtful, spiritual, loving man, and poured his heart out in his grief over the loss of his wife with so much passion, I'm currently in the throes of my new found faith and in such a joyous place that anything to do with grief is lost on me at the present time.I was struck, however with the stark similarity I found in his grief (and possibly the grief of others losing a beloved mate) between what he felt and what it feels like to be in a clinical depression. It's impossible for someone that hasn't been there to understand the depth of alteration a person goes through, but many of the feelings Mr Lewis described brought back a familiar twinge to me. I've been depression-free for many years since the advent of Prozac, and what this book did do for me was to renew my gratitude once again that the disease was treatable for me."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As I write this, I still have my mother. She was diagnosed with cancer not quite a year ago, and she was expected to live until about August. I come from a devout Christian family who believes in prayer, and we all prayed for her as well as a group in another state. One of the members of the group was convinced that she would not die of cancer. At this time she still has cancer, but has outlived the doctor's prediction, and she feels great. Whether or not the cancer will disappear, or whether she will live a long time with it is hard to say. The doctors have given her another somewhere-around-August for things to turn worse or for the worst. All I know is that she is still here, but none of us knows what's going to happen.However, I'm keeping my copy of A GRIEF OBSERVED handy. I may need it. No matter how sick our loved ones are, and no matter how firmly we believe that they are with the Lord, nobody is ever ready for it to happen.I'm sure that was the case with C.S. Lewis. He loved his wife Joy deeply and their marriage, while short, meant a great deal to him, and he simply didn't want to lose her. He took her passing very hard -- maybe harder than a lot of people. But what I appreciate is his honesty about the hard questions that went through his heart and mind, his attempt to cling to God, and at times seemingly to fail.Lewis was in good company. Martin Luther went into a deep depression when his daughter Magdalena died. So if Lewis was depressed and going through despair, he wasn't the only one -- and in my opinion, it did not reflect badly on his love of God. It showed his humanity.I don't know how I will feel the day I do actually lose my mother. It won't be joyful. I'll be glad that she's in the presence of the Lord, but I speak for myself and my family when I say that we will miss her for the rest of our lives and will still wish her to be with us. I will probably read this book. I may or may not feel the same emotions as C. S. Lewis, and I may read other books, too, but I don't think I will ever judge Lewis and his grief. Lewis lived for a short while after Joy passed away, and wrote some spiritually helpful things -- but this experience changed his life forever as well those who knew her. I'm sure that when my mother is gone, I will grieve and then continue on -- my mom would want it that way -- but I'll be changed, as well as the rest of the family and those who knew her.But mostly I will remember the shortest verse in the Bible. When told of the death of Lazarus, the verse says \\"Jesus wept.\\"If Jesus can do that, so can C. S. Lewis, and all of us."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"From his own notes recording his personal tragedy, we read of Lewis' own experience of losing his wife Joy Davidman Gresham to cancer. Most definitely, this is a book that pinpoints the anguish any person would experience upon the death of a beloved spouse. This book is certainly a gift to give to such a grieving purpose.I encountered this for the first time, listening to a talk given by Peter Kreeft on the book. Mr. Kreeft is a philosopher, a prolific writer, author and speaker who teaches at Boston College. He has a way with words, and after a talk of about 45 minutes (which can be easily found on his website), with the most poignant and touching of quotes from Lewis, I was convinced I must read the book. I felt like I devoured it, although you cannot read it too fast because Lewis forces you to enter into his grief and think though it and grapple with it yourself.I reread this soon after as an audiobook,A Grief Observed (Library Edition), and found it to be a longer but similarly rewarding experience as was Peter Kreeft's talk. I went from this to watching Lewis' story portrayed on the screen in the movieShadowlands, with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. I cannot recommend any of these too much. It is not something you will tire of. It sort of etches its way into your life and heart.It's a story that can be told at a sorrowful and tearful funeral and produce great effects. It's one of those books that seem to have a universal appeal, so much so, that if you are a C. S. Lewis fan or not, if you have not read this, my advice is to get it! You will not be sorry."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis' own experience of losing Joy Davidman Gresham to cancer strikes a deep chord with those who have the misfortune of losing someone so close and dear. His raw reflection on his loss brings to the reader a rare and beautiful glimpse of honest pain and questions that death and suffering raise. His willingness to explore his own heart and mind, combined with his learned eloquence and clarity of thought creates a powerful expression of the pain and confusion that death brings into this world.Lewis is quite aware of the norms that theology teaches; yet he wrestles to reconcile these norms with his experience. He doesn't jettison theological truths, yet these doctrines cannot be adequately understood apart from real life experience that brings a depth and breadth to cold orthodoxy. Through the agony of loss, Lewis is not afraid to ask hard questions and in fact, these difficult life experiences reveal a more honest assessment of how deeply one truly believes these doctrines:\\"And you will never discover how serious it was until the stakes are raised horribly high; until you find that you are playing not for counters of for sixpences but for every penny you have in the world. Nothing less will shake a man--or at any rate a man lie me--out of his merely verbal thinking and his merely notional beliefs.... Only torture will bring out the truth. Only under torture does he discover it himself.\\"I believe ministry is in many respects both an art and a science. It is a science in that we have Scriptures that reveal to us truths and norms which are not simply matters of opinion but are universally true whether believed or not. On the other hand, the ability for these truths to point to life and light is shaped by how we embody these truths existentially. Our experience of these truths enable us to artfully present doctrine in a way that people can digest so that it can strength them and not cause them to convulse.Lewis models the importance of wrestling with life and asking difficult questions. He takes the time to ask difficult existential questions, instead of simply turning to the easier \\"right answers\\". Yet, when it comes to death and suffering, the \\"right answers\\" can lead those who suffer in such ways away from the One who is able to provide unique and penetrating comfort."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Read through the very slender A Grief Observed by C. S. Lewis last night. The book records a brief history of time after the death of C. S. Lewis' wife from cancer. It distinguishes between records and maps of griefs (how can one map grief?), and shines a light on faith and God during pain and suffering. It's a very honest, bare-boned look at ourselves as people and as Christians.The book begins with the death, and Lewis' fear that he is dreaming up an image of his wife, and that the representation is far from the reality. Only, the reality is no longer in existence. Lewis records his numerous discomforts and fears: running into people who don't know what to say, or say what they cannot know (She is with God; She feels no pain), or say the wrong thing (There is no God); addressing his sons only to find that they are ashamed when Lewis mentions their dead mother; fearing where his wife is and what state she is in; dreading the midnight hours. There is one beautiful analogy that he makes between the loss of H. and salt. Grief or anxiety is not skirted because he avoids the cafes or parks they visited together. Her absence is like the absence of salt. If there were no more salt on earth, no more salt at all in any food, one would realize it, one would taste it not only in particular foods, but in every food at every meal.Next, Lewis contemplates the divine. Is God a Cosmic Sadist, or is He wholly good? There are many, many good analogies in here that helped me understand Lewis' process and where he stood in the beginning and at the end. Does God give only to take away out of sadistic pleasure? Lewis claims that God sees that one part of life (Lewis' marriage) comes to fruit and perfection, and moves Christians along to other parts of life in order that through suffering (grief and death), new sanctification is realized. He is not a sadist cutting into the flesh of believers, but rather a skilled surgeon who must continue with all of the incisions in order that the surgery be completed. Otherwise, to finish midway and let off because of the patient's complaints would mean something worse. Nothing is arbitrary, nothing is in vain. And if we see God as dark, wicked, mean, cruel, it is only because we do not see at all, according to Lewis. His great fear is, after all, not that there is no God, but that God is cruel and not what Lewis had understood him to be through Scripture and life.It's interesting because he gives a description of God's response to human grief: silence. He comes to realize that his own panic and terror caused him to run and slam the door in his own face. It's difficult to save a terrified drowning man, he will pull you down. The prayers are screams and it's impossible to hear anything but ourselves. He writes that he realized later that God chooses the right time to give comfort or answers.He also says that \\"God is the great Iconoclast,\\" who constantly smashes our erroneous images of Himself. We are image makers, we are constantly categorizing and creating representations of things and beings we cannot see (alive, dead, and divine). We want the images, we are afraid to forget. But what we need is the real thing. We want our loved ones back, pictures don't suffice. And, of greater importance, we don't want something that is like Christ, or something like his life, work, death, and resurrection; we need the real thing.(Is it really true that Lewis prayed for the dead? Did he continue after his wife passed?)The last section is devoted mostly to H., his wife, who is really referred to as H. Lewis is highly cognizant of the triptych he creates. He begins with himself, then looks to God, the Creator, and then appreciates his wife, the created, the gift. He closes the record by stating that it will be a part of his life forever, but that H. did say, not to him, but to the chaplain, I am at peace with God."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Loaned it to a friend before reading myself.

Mr. Lewis described the feelings I was having on the fist page which was very comforting."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The language of the day makes this little book a bit cumbersome to read. However many of the points made in it were ones that mirror my own experience as I walk through the grief process of losing my husband and soul mate. I thought the preface gave interesting information about the author and his relationship with \\"H\\". The used price for this book made it a good purchase for me. I am not sure I would buy it new unless I wanted it for a permanent library. I am on my second read of it and I have found that to be beneficial for me, as I am picking up new insights. I'd recommend this if you are grieving and you like to read or if you are studying the author.

But this is a book for sophisticated adult. If you are grieving, you will be touched by Lewis' words. I found them so tender and sincere, that I cried. It is a short book, but deeply personal. The beauty of it is that anyone who has grieved for the person they deeply cared for will instantly recognise feelings, deep emotions and internal chaos of the grieving person. It is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Lewis' words are magical and transformational."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"After the loss of my husband it was suggested that I read this book. It is a book that should be read several times to get the full impact. Lewis goes through several mood changes in his journal and only after reading this book did I fully realize I shared many of the same feelings in my grief journey. Madeleine L'Engle wrote the foreword and it should also be read after the loss of a loved one."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Easily the saddest book I have ever read, C.S. Lewis' book A Grief Observed is his journal he wrote after his wife Joy died of cancer.It was the first time in his life that he had experienced such a sudden jolt of pain and it is evident in his words that he was completely lost. Lewis' faith was tested and he shares his doubts and anger towards God with readers.\\"What chokes every prayer and every hope is the memory of all the prayers H. and I offered and all the false hopes we had. Not hopes raised merely by our own wishful thinking, hopes encouraged, even forced upon us, by false diagnoses, by X-ray photographs, by strange remissions, by one temporary recovery that might have ranked as a miracle. Step by step we were 'led up the garden path.' Time after time, when He seemed most gracious He was really preparing the next torture.\\"It is a very personal experience that few people are willing to share with the world. As time passes, Lewis comes to conclusions about death and life that will give hope to anyone who has lost a loved one.\\"God has not been trying an experiment on my faith or love in order to find out their quality. He knew it already. It was I who didn't.\\""},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis's \\"A Grief Observed\\" is quite different from most of his other works. It is a thoroughly honest recording of his thoughts about the death of his wife. Whereas Lewis carefully argued for the compatibility of suffering and a loving God in \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" he never claimed that his arguments and philosophical thinking would be any comfort for the actual suffering a person may experience. \\"A Grief Observed\\" reveals this to be the case- Lewis finds himself doubting God (mostly doubting His goodness) because of his tremendous grief.The book is composed of four short chapters, and you can easily see changes in his demeanor and ways of thinking throughout the short book. By the end, Lewis seems to have regained a level of confidence in his faith, although he was shook to the core by the death of his wife.For me, the book was a strange read, and I had little ability to relate to Lewis. I have not experienced such a tragic loss yet, though there is little doubt that one day, this book will connect with me on a deeper level. However, as to whether or not this short book offers a good source of comfort to those who have suffered a great loss, I cannot say. Yet, if you want to see C.S. Lewis at his most human, most honest moments, then \\"A Grief Observed\\" is the book to read."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book really is an aid to anyone experiencing the loss of a loved one.

But taken on its own terms it reads as a searing, painful, and ultimately joyous portrayal of a man battling spiritual crisis as a result of immense loss. I often recommend this book to friends who find themselves angry with God as a result of a family death. It's a brutal read, but at the same time, its honesty and directness are a gift to those who are tired of hearing the same religious consolations and often smug assurances. No one writes about Christianity like C.S. Lewis because he is honest about his faith and his doubt and his honesty lets us in and leads us through the darker corridors of our lives. This book is no exception. No great book is an easy read. Most truths are hard truths. In his observance of his own pain, Lewis serves as an honest guide through our own.--Joel Peckham, JR, author ofResisting Elegy: On Grief and Recovery"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This beautiful C.S.Lewis' diary of intimate thoughts and suspicions after the death of his beloved wife isn't for everyone - I simply wouldn't recommend it to people who haven't ever experienced such a loss as Lewis had. If I hadn't personally lost someone very very close to my heart, especially as I had to deal with almost the same puzzlements as he did, I wouldn't dare to read it. That would seem like an intrusion, because these words he gave permit to be published are so personal, and definitely not for the eyes who wouldn't understand through what he had to go to."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Another excellent book by C.S.

But ultimately, his words helped me appreciate that despite the pain that comes from loss, a spiritual connection is a super-strong coping necessity, and God never abandons. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book was given to me in 1997 at the death of my husband. After putting it aside for months, I finally was ABLE to read it.

Yet, as one who suffered the agony of losing my father at 18 I felt for him.But something inside me still thought, \\"He didn't understand what it meant to suffer\\" or \\"How come he wasn't ready for this?\\" He seemed to be missing the point. As a great Christian thinker I expected more. I was an 18 year old boy who hadn't a thought for God. This man said he knew God. And yet what can I expect from a man going through the anguish of grief? Did not king David also suffer thoughts similar to these? How will I respond to such circumstances in my life when they inevitably come? The last part of the book sees Lewis start to turn the corner.I think about death a lot. I think about my own death and the death of others. I accept it as part of life. It scares me, confuses me, but I accept it and try to prepare for it. So I wondered why a man of his popularity had been so stricken by it. I lost my father before coming to Jesus, and so I have never grieved as a Christian. Maybe I'm not in a place to judge him until I have suffered loss like that in a Christian context.An intense, real look at death and grief.

It's a bit easier to read than other non-fiction books by Lewis and is actually a very fast read. The whole book is only about 75 pages including the forward and introduction. So if you have a hard time getting through other Lewis non-fiction books, like Mere Christianity or The Problem of Pain, this one should be easier for you. My only complaint is the with the style of pages used. The deckle edges are meant to look like old books that were not machine processed so many of the pages are rough cut (almost look torn) and are of slightly different lengths. This makes it tough to flip through the pages and I don't really like the feel. I'd prefer the standard, normal, pages. This is really a minor issue though. This book is definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Over the years, this is probably the most popular book among my clients.Personally I'm not terribly fond of memoirs (thus the 4 stars), because they're only one person's perspective.

Lewis's grief after the loss of his wife to cancer. Lewis had seen suffering before, he had lived through the Western Front in WWI, but Gresham's death may have been the greatest blow of his life. His journal captures some of his reconsiderations of faith, inner sorrow, and finally a return to faith. Overall a concise and interesting personal story of dealing with grief."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This was a deeply personal book about the intense grief Lewis was feeling after losing his wife. This book was written 20 years after The Problem of Pain (see note below), and begun less than a month after losing his wife Helen to Cancer. For the three years prior to her death, Lewis had nursed his wife and watched her slowly die. His thoughts on pain have become quite personal now. He is a grieving Christian man, suffering deep pain at the loss of his wife, his friend, and his lover.The book is a collection of thoughts that he wrote, and as Lewis says, \\"sometimes yelled\\" into his notebooks. It is a brief yet powerful summary of what he describes as \\"one tenth of the thoughts\\" during his period of mourning. Lewis is a profoundly spiritual man who has spent the better part of his career telling the world about the beauty, grace, and consolation of the Christian faith, but in this work you see him as man wrestling with his own faith, doubting not only everything he has believed, but regretting the platitudes and consolations' he has said in the past to other people to comfort their pain. He recoils at the kind words of well meaning friends who mindlessly repeat memorized messages of hope and strength in God, the kind so often heard in funeral parlors and read in greeting cards. He refers to his own faith as a \\"house of cards\\", tumbling at the slightest breeze.He learns about the cycle of sadness and the awful pangs of guilt one feels when, just for a second, they almost forgot to grieve for those they've lost. He wrestles with all of the emotions of grieving while trying to comprehend his own feelings of spiritual doubt and self doubt.Ultimately, his faith once again begins to sustain him. He brings The Lord into his suffering, and he begins to realize that his grief and sorrow were actually keeping him further away from honestly remembering his wife, and truly seeing her in his heart. He learns how to remember his wife without recreating her through distorted memories and imaginings. Finally, he comes to find peace. This little book documents that journey, to the extent that he has allowed us to see.This is a book for those who are suffering. It is for those who have lost someone so near to them that the thought of going on without them seems unbearable. I believe that Lewis' very personal and blatant honesty will help those who are suffering with their own struggles and doubts of faith. Perhaps if they read it completely, they will be comforted in the knowledge they too can find their way back to a loving God, and that they will find Him waiting with opens arms.-------------------NOTE: Prior to reading this book I reviewed C.S. Lewis' The Problem of Pain. I mention this only because many people confuse these two books, and they really couldn't be more different. I ultimately reached the conclusion that that particular work belongs more in the \\"Exploring Christianity\\" section than in the \\"Healing\\" section. To the best of my limited ability I made the case that Lewis' approach to discussing the pain and evil in the world were strong, compelling, and theologically beautiful, but perhaps bit impersonal to be considered appropriate for someone actively in a period of personal suffering. Please refer to that review for a further explanation."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"\\"A Grief Observed\\" is a collection of notebook entries penned by Lewis after the death of his wife. In the introduction Madeleine L'engle writes, \\"I am grateful to Lewis for having the courage to yell, to doubt, to kick at God in angry violence. This is a part of grief which is not often encouraged.\\" When I first encountered Lewis' yelling and kicking, I was not thankful. I was uncomfortable. I didn't want one of my heroes in the faith talking to and about God like this. I wanted him to grieve with sure and steady faith. My discomfort with grief and all that it brings with it was being revealed. As I finished the book I was grateful to have had my own faith poked and proded and my heart exposed. Whereas I didn't agree with all of Lewis' doctrine, I appreciated his willingness to take it out and look at it again.I would offer one recommendation to anyone reading this book. Try to read it in one or two sittings. In doing so you will be able to better see the process of Lewis' grief. You will see that as the process of mourning unfolds there are still questions and doubts, but there are also honest admissions of immaturity and self-pity. You will see how Lewis looks back at earlier entries, written in deep darkness, and sees them more clearly as the sun was beginning to rise. His willingness to deal with his own questions and doubts is refreshing as he comes back to the same, solid truths that he held before and is able to approach them with eyes more widely opened by grief."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"After having lost my wife to cancer a few months ago, I found C.

It made for a very interesting look at the difference between an intellectual understanding of something and actually experiencing it. Lewis eventually ended up where he started in the previous book, but not without first having to go through a major trial of faith.The book is very short and consists of four chapters that consisted of a journal of his thoughts after the death of his wife. They go into very intimate detail of his thoughts including his serious doubts about the existence of God. Each chapter progresses to show peace entering into his soul and his renewal of faith.I sometimes feel that I'm like Lewis was prior to his wife's death; I feel that my faith will be able to take me through the difficult times. I've understood that it will be difficult, but reading this book has made me aware that it will probably be much more difficult than I recognize. It also gives me hope that I will be able to eventually work my way through any future grief.This short little book is a worthwhile experience."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"CS Lewis looks death into the face; he does not flinch and does not console himself with platitudes. He had lost the love of his life and his pain is palpable to the reader. This is a raw and honest book but it is not at all depressing: At the end of the book, Lewis begins to recover: his wish is simply that, on his own death bed, his lover will come back to him and give him the consolation of seeing her face again.Rather surpisingly, I was diagnosed with terminal cancer myself three weeks after doing this review.

If you read this, say a prayer for me that I may die with courage and joy!"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book obviously already has plenty of praising views, but I read this book and found it so great that I can't live with myself if I don't write a review. Coming from a kid who grieved a traumatic death, this book *IS* the book to buy if you're grieving, want to understand death, or want to find a book to help out a confused friend (no matter what age) who's grieving. It's worth the price."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Originally published under a pseudonym, this short book is a thoroughly reasoned but heart-felt analyzation of grief from the private writing journal of intellectual author and academia giant, C.S. Lewis. The object of his grief is the love of his life, his rare intellectual equal and friend whom he met later in life and fell deeply in love with, making her his wife.Born Atheist, C.S. Lewis became a committed Christian, but spent part of his journalized pages in honest reflection of his anger at God and acknowledgement of fragile faith while in the throes of traumatic, life-altering grief. He boldly wonders and writes the thoughts and words most familiarly held at some point in the minds of others bereaved over their most beloved and cherished.From page 23: \\"Only a real risk tests the reality of a belief. Apparently the faith - I thought it faith - which enables me to pray for the other dead has seemed strong only because I have never really cared, not desperately, whether they existed or not. Yet I thought I did.\\"After other thoughts about risks and beliefs, this is said, \\"And you will never discover how serious it was until the stakes are raised horribly high, until you find that you are playing not for counters or for sixpences but for every penny you have in the world. Nothing will shake a man - or at any rate a man like me - out of his merely verbal thinking and his merely notional beliefs. He has to be knocked silly before he comes to his senses. Only torture will bring out the truth. Only under torture does he discover himself.\\"On page 25, C.S. sees the human side of grieving when others try to console him with spiritual avenues of comfort: \\"Talk to me about the truth of religion and I'll listen gladly. Talk to me about the duty of religion and I'll listen submissively. But don't come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don't understand.\\"The social leprosy of bereavement is also mentioned on a couple of pages, including this: \\"Perhaps the bereaved ought to be isolated in special settlements like lepers.\\"At the end, C.S. Lewis seems to reconcile himself to a conclusion about grieving: \\"For, as I have discovered, passionate grief does not link us with the dead but cuts us off from them,\\" as he tries to go about cherishing his beloved's every memory with gladness, a smile and a laugh. Not for long, however, is this a workable plan as he writes the next day's journal entry more in line with the natural phases of grief: \\"An admirable programme. Unfortunately it can't be carried out. tonight al the hells of young grief have opened again; the mad words, the bitter resentment, the fluttering in the stomach, the nightmare unreality, the wallowed-in tears. For in grief nothing \`stays put.' One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs. Round and round. Everything repeats. Am I going in circles, or dare I hope I am on a spiral?\\"As do we all of bereavement ask ourselves when finding that as much as we try clawing our way up the spiral, we suddenly lose our grasp, totally at the mercy of our humanness and that quality that never dies - love."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I read on Wikipedia that Lewis had originally released this book under a pseudonym, N.W. Clerk. But, as it happened, so many of his friends recommended it to him as a way to deal with his own grief that he finally decided to publish it under his own name. I do not know if that was actually true, but it makes a great story. He wrote this book after his wife, Joy, died of cancer.A Grief Observed is one of those books that get recommended in the aftermath of a death. In my case, I think of the books about loss as being divided into two categories: the dead baby books and the \\"oh god why\\" books. This is an \\"oh god why\\" book.My flippancy does not do Lewis any real justice. It is recommended for many good reasons. I am sure that there will be a day when I find myself handing a copy to someone I love who is trying to make sense of what they are going through. But I still find myself wanting to be flippant in this review. It is a difficult book to read, and nearly as difficult to talk about in a public forum like this one. I had made the mistake of reading it during a long train ride-- wiping the tears away with the collar of my winter coat.I would not call it a comfort to read, exactly. I guess that my own grief is still too raw. But he gets it right. He gets the physical arc of grief. He gets the ways in which it changes over time. He gets the way in which loss like this changes and illuminates the nature of the personal relationship that you have with the divine.What I like most is that Lewis does not pull his punches. He does not find himself falling back on the kind of false homilies with which so many treat the death of a loved one. He is not easy on himself, nor is he easy on God. I recognize the bitter anger in so many of these pages. I also recognize the hopeless love for the dead-- the realization that you are lifting your hands to nothing except imagination and the unknown."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I have loved the books by C.S. Lewis for several years now, and I have no disappointment to confess in A Grief Observed. In fact, my feelings are quite the opposite. A Grief Observed has truly helped me, indeed, perhaps not in the sense of the authors original intention. Yet merely in the equalizing grief which every human must succumb to on some level, I have been changed by this book. At times I have wept through it, at others I have sat in chilling reflection. All I can say is read it!! :)"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"this is the second c.s. lewis book i have read, the first being &quot;the four loves.&quot; after the four loves, this book was quite a stark contrast, but it was just as powerful and just as moving. it's short, and a very easy read. i read it in a day. but it's length doesn't matter. every page of this book is packed with profound insights. lewis didn't write this book to be read by others, he wrote it as a journal to vent his feelings over his wife's death. this book is, if nothing else, a window into the soul of a tortured man. quite possibly one of the best books i've ever read."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"For C.S. Lewis, the written word is no different than the thoughts going on in his head and soul. Few people--authors included--have the profound ability to speak simple truths that seem so hard to get out. There are so many things from this book I will take always with me. It gave me a new angle on how great love truly is and ways to love. It is a must read for anyone who has ever lost a loved one. It is a must read for anyone who is alive. You will lose a loved one and to have C.S. Lewis, one of the greatest apologetic writers on your side of doubt and confusion is more than helpful."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I actually read this book in connection with a paper I wrote while in college on writing as therapy. This is an excellent example of that. With this book Lewis shares his pain and thus allows you to see him going through the stages of disbelief, anger, acceptance and accommodation in response to the of a death of a loved one. He is also quite honest with himself when he can be about what he is doing at one point he realizes that he is using her death to keep everything as it was by saying that his deceased wife would not have wanted that change rather then saying that he does not want that change. This book is very well written and quite &quot;raw&quot; with true emotion--something you don't often see in written for regarding this subject."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Although Lewis was, of course, a renowned and devout Christian, this book will speak to anyone who's lost someone with whom they shared real love. All of the questions, angers, and doubts that fill the mind during the numbing time following great loss are shared in the first person, generously, by Lewis. This is, I think, a beautiful, powerful, and deeply healing work."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I bought this book out of curiousity and I was pleasantly surprised. C.S. Lewis is now one of my favorite authors and has a captivating writing style that accurately displays his wisdom. He proposes some questions that people have when they are grieving and then describes the transition he makes to recover from lamenting. The book is a little philosophical at times and can be vague, but this book is definitely the work of genius."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"No matter how hard we try we all have to do our grief work. There is no way to bypass it though we may try. C. S.Lewis shared his grief passage with us in a way that reaches the heart.I too am traveling through grief after the loss of my Dad and I found his book healing. I also am doing my own grief work by journaling in a Christian book, Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal.I have a long way to go but I've also healed a great deal and can look back and smile and rejoice in the memories."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As I have confessed before, I am not a huge fan of CS Lewis. To be more accurate, however, I am not a fan of the Lewis phenomena. Lewis was an admirable man with many gifts. However, I don't think he was the beacon of truth that many have made him out to be. He had an amazing ability to dissect weighty issues with clear-headed thinking, but I have often felt that he didn't understand the depth, complexity and irrationality that creates the tapestry of humanity. That is, until after the loss of his wife Joy and several other disappoinments in his life.In reading this book, then, I was trying to sharpen my own understanding of his transformation at the end of his life. It was, honestly, very refreshing to read a Lewis who was shaken. Rather than everything being obvious and clear to him, Lewis keeps wrestling with himself at the difficult intersection of faith, emotions and logic. As he would come to one conclusion or resolution during one entry, his next journal entry would inevitably dismiss all he had previously written as he would chastise himself and try to make further sense of things. Thus, for anyone who has been cautious of Lewis for the same reasons as I have, this book will give you the human glimpse of him that perhaps you were waiting for.However, I think a Lewis fan would appreciate this work as well, though for very different reasons. If one is a Lewis fan, I would guess that one enjoys his intellectual approach to all issues. Rather than ever let himself just grieve or be emotional or ride out the storm, Lewis takes on the grieving process in a similar way as he has taken on all problems - with honesty, scrutiny and expectation that a solution can be found.On a personal note, I lost three family members in the past year, and learned first hand how long, painful and unexpected the grieving process can be. If you've never gone through it, then you may not understand how it can shake you to the core - even if you think you have a strong faith. Thus, in, around and through all other criticism I may have of Lewis, I do appreciate Lewis' willingness to publish his account which will likely help validate the spiritual journey of many mourners. (For, thanks to the Lewis phenomena, if Lewis went through it, then it's OK to go through.)"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As the other reviewers stated, this has more in the way of home truths and comfort than most books I have come across.I already knew Lewis, from reading the 'CHRONICLES OF NARNIA' as a small boy.It exudes the same, glowing kind of warmth you get when you sit down at an open fire, after trekking in from some cold and far away, emotional place.I recommened this to anyone who needs reminding who they are and why they're here."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book shares the burden of grieving for a spouse, who has suffered an early and painful death. The author manages to convey the complexity and utter hardship of grief, never sounding trite or overly analytical. Like the author, I cared for my spouse, suffering with cancer, only to lose him in the end. I also struggle with the question of God's presence or absence in this experience. But in this book, I discovered true empathy."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"After C. S. Lewis lost his wife, Helen Joy Davidman, he took up a journal. These writings make up A Grief Observed. Lewis refers to his lost beloved as H. in his journal. The title aptly describes this work. It is not about grief in general but about the grief of a specific man at a specific time for a specific loss. The foreword by Madeleine L'Engle makes good observation of the practical application of the book in examining grief and helping others in part to cope. The introduction by Douglas H. Gresham, a son of Joy Davidman, paints an intimate picture of who Lewis and Davidman were. From this, one gets the sense this book is going to be about something real. In the work, Lewis's true colors show through. He is an intellectual individual moving through the grieving process and trying to understand his own thoughts and experience. He displays himself with unabashed openness and honesty (perhaps because he thought these scribblings would never become public). One understands that he is experiencing real loss and pain. Lewis asks \\"Aren't all these notes the senseless writhings of a man who won't accept the fact that there is nothing we can do with suffering except to suffer it?\\" Lewis confronts his faith which may be a \\"house of cards\\" while trying to hold onto the proper memory of H. so that she is never really gone. Both of these seem to be the central themes of the book. In Lewis's examination of his faith and God, he stumbles upon several points of insight into the both of them. For his own part, nearer the beginning of the book, Lewis says \\"You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you.\\" As Lewis putts along his journey of grief, he comes to the point where he begins to see all this in the grand scheme of things for what it is and begins to go on to the next step in his life. For his experience, as for many of the rest of us, \\"Grief is like a long valley, a winding valley where any bend may reveal a totally new landscape.\\"I do not know if this book would be of much consolation, understanding, or catharsis for anyone who is experiencing loss because I did not read it in a period of grief. Looking back, I can see where I would identify with Lewis and if having read it before grieving, it would perhaps have been of benefit. It is amazing what truth can be uncovered when an individual is knocked to the bottom and is brutally honest with him- or herself and the world. A Grief Observed is what it is, and it contains deep spiritual wisdom. The book is short and an excellent read."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I picked this book up my junior year of college. It had been a long day, so I went to Barnes and Noble to relax. I found the book and brought it home, and since I'd just paid for it, I decided to read the first chapter before I passed out(fell asleep). BIG MISTAKE!!! I was so engrossed that I read the entire book before I turned out the light!C.S. Lewis, of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS fame wrote this book right after his wife died from a battle with cancer. Like any human would do, Lewis had settled into grief, and was not able to find comfort. He did not sit down to write this book per se, he just sat down and started pouring his heart into notebooks. What you get is a very honest look into the heart of a man, who is dealing with one of the deepest sorrows that can be felt.I was brought back to this book when I decided to give a message on despair to my Wednesday Night Youth Group. I gave the message, and then finished up with approx. 5 excerpts from the book that took about 5 minutes to read. At the end there were two people who I could see were fighting back tears, and everyone was responding physically to what they were hearing it was that powerful.*****Final Thoughts*****I told my youth group to try to describe grief to me. Not just with words, but in such a way that those words made me understand what grief is really like. I think that one small excerpt from Lewis himself can help you to see that he is not only working through the grief, but that he has the capability to express what he is feeling through to his reader.On the nature of grief:&quot;They say an unhappy man wants distractions--something to take him out of himself. Only as a dog-tired man wants an extra blanket on a cold night; he'd rather lie there shivering than get up and find one.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Written in the aftermath of his beloved wife's death, C.S. Lewis's &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; is the great Christian apologist's literary attempt to make sense of the emotional and mental chaos in which he finds himself following that tragic event. A far cry from the scholarly analysis of most of his other books, &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; is in many ways a book of questions in which the author grapples with trying to understand why God would take his beloved from him, what sort of being God must be, what his wife is now experiencing in the next world and what all this means to his own faith and the rest of his life. Lewis, quite understandably, is not his usual self here, and the voice of &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; is not at all the same one of &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot; or &quot;Mere Christianity.&quot; Indeed, it is the naked, heartbroken pain with which Lewis infuses this book (originally published pseudonymously)that makes it such an important, vital, and universal literary achievement. Unfortunately, there are many (quite a few of them have written Amazon reviews)who seem to take some sort of ghoulish delight in Lewis's anguish, as though &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; in some way invalidates all that Lewis had written before, as if Lewis's other books are all irrelevant because he had not previously suffered enough to have written authoritatively on matters like spirituality, pain, and the afterlife. That is sadistic balderdash, and metaphorically kicking a great man when he is down. But there's no denying this is Lewis's most personal, heartfelt work, and its power is awesome. Ultimately, the reader will see a powerful mind and will &quot;come to misunderstand a little less completely&quot; one of this world's most agonizing puzzles, the paralysis of loss, and that in the end faith and God remain."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"When I went through a time of incredible grief and confusion, this book was a comfort to me. Lewis was able to express what was turning in my head and heart. I underlined sections of this book, and would go back to them time and time again, because no one else seemed to know or understand what I was trying to convey--the depth of pain and confusion I felt. I felt like I was drowning in the middle of a vast ocean, and even if I could swim I had no idea where the shore was.It is sentences like this that I could connect with: \\"How often--will it be for always? How often will the vast emptiness astonish me like a complete novelty and make me say 'I never realized my loss till this moment.'?\\"While it didn't give me insight into how to get out of the grief, it helped me bear it, and maybe that was enough."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The death of a spouse in a so-so marriage brings so-so grief. The death of a spouse in a joyously happy marriage throws the survivor into the extremes of emotional pain. \\"A Grief Observed\\" comes from the pen of the surviving spouse in the latter sort of union.At 58 years of age, resolute bachelor C.S. Lewis surprised himself by falling madly in love and getting married, joyously, blissfully married. Four years later his wife Joy died a painful death. Watching her suffer, then losing her tore at everything Lewis believed. And so he wrote this devastatingly honest journal as his life line to God.Give it somebody you know is suffering. The recipient will recognize their pain and know this is how it works. They will also find a balm in the news that the raw woundedness of it ends.And read it yourself. It'll make your heart hurt in a renewing way."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"There are only two marriages I've ever been interested in: that of Francis and Edith Schaeffer, and that of Lewis and Joy Davidman.This book, while it hints of what the Lewis-Davidson marriage was like, is not about their marriage. Instead, it's an absolutely no b.s. recording of a mind as its world has turned bleakly, seemingly inconsolably, black. But this is no ordinary mind. This is the mind of C.S. Lewis, arguably the greatest Christian apologist of the 20th century, if not all time.If you have read any of Lewis' other books, you will sense that Lewis had some deep personal struggles, going back to his early childhood. It's not obvious. You have to read between the lines, and even then very carefully. But people who have had similar struggles will know what he's communicating to them, consciously or not.When Lewis married Joy, I don't think he knew what he was getting into. Or maybe he did. Whichever, somehow a former Marxist, divorced mother of two boys, and formidable Christian thinker in her own right was able to get in, under and on Lewis' skin. She was God's unlikely choice for him, which is probably the best kind.Theirs was a marriage steeped in levels of love and truth unknown by most couples and certainly most of us unmarried folk. How can you tell? Well, when it ended, it just about ended Lewis' other great and even longer relationship, that of Lewis and his Lord.This is a tough book. The lesson I got from it is: don't put anything above your relationship with Christ. Because when that anything comes to end, which it invariably will, it's only the unfailing grace and love of God that will bring you through it. And even experiencing that will be a battle."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"As a mother of three very young children, I recently faced two extended, near-fatal illnesses in a few short years.Only by the strength of the Almighty was the devastation endurable. So much for the wonders of \\"modern\\" medicine. None of many doctors were able to offer hope or help; no medications worked to provide respite. My husband and parents sacrificed everything, investing themselves fully in caring for the children and doing all they could to keep me alive.Most of the time, it was unclear if death would come - whether by God's hand or by my own, pressed by sheer, relentless agony. To my shame I say this; however, in spite of what some may think, there are tortures brutal enough to destroy any human foundation. Thankfully, the same cannot be said of the heavenly Foundation. The ten Boom sisters were right: \\"There is no pit so deep that God's love is not deeper still.\\"So, then, about \\"A Grief Observed\\"... It may seem strange that a journal on grief, on death, might provide companionship to people who had not literally lost a loved one. Yet, we deeply mourned loss of life, if from a different angle. For whatever reason, this book was just about the only consolation my mother and I found during those endless months.Reading Lewis, we found relief in shared suffering, in expression of the raw agony and devastation of earthly misery. His words spoke what our hearts felt in so many ways. His journal addressed what the vast majority of our Christian friends seemed powerless to grasp - that sometimes, \\"...there is nothing we can do with suffering except to suffer it...It doesn't really matter whether you grip the arms of the dentist's chair or let your hands lie in your lap. The drill drills on.\\"If you are enduring suffering and grief, if the platitudes and pat, religious tramplings of friends ~ however well-meaning ~ only sharpen your isolation, then this may be the book for you.Having lived in the pits of Hell, I would not dare to say that this book is for everyone...only that in my grief, my particular assigned misery, it was an extremely close friend. I very much hope that it will be the same for you."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"\\"A GRIEF OBSERVED\\" is a look through a Christian perspective at loss, grief and recovery. One of the best written books, similar to another deep and emotional book along the same line [...]If you are dealing with grief, and need answers, these books will offer that and much more."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis has, more often than not, been a very accessible writer. In his life he often achieved a balance of writing about some lofty subject matter in a way that the thinking common person could relate, all the while never \\"dumbing down\\" his writings in order to stir up mass appeal (which he got..and much deserved, I might add...all the same).If one has read various writings of C.S. Lewis....whether it be his Science-Ficiton Trilogy, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, his other ventures into fiction (SCREWTAPE LETTERS or THE GREAT DIVORCE), his (for their time) very compassionate/forward-thinking essays on Christianity or even his autobiographical works (such as SURPRISED BY JOY), then an odd thing occurs. It may be completely delusional on the part of the reader, but one does begin to feel a certain kinship or affinity with C.S. Lewis. And though Lewis was, by most accounts, not the most sociable of men (although, by most accounts, a very gracious and kind-hearted man), many a read feels as though he/she knows Lewis based on the wonderful wealth of writings that he left behind.So, with this in mind, A GRIEF OBSERVED succeeds on two levels.For those who have read Lewis over the years, one aches to see a man so often filled with hope and inspiration on the verge of inconsolable desperation. Reading these thoughts that Lewis jotted into his notebook following the death of his wife is much like being a voyeur who witnesses another man's anguish and suffering. On the other hand, Lewis writes what many of those who have lost loved ones often think...but seldom articulate...and that in itself is cause enough for one to read this book.It is not an easy book to read. Lewis is an expressive enough writer..even in the midst of terrible grief...that he is well able to express the sorrow, emptiness and doubt of faith that comes with losing a loved one. Yet this book is completely void of pretenses or airs. What is written on these pages is much like examining a raw nerve beneath a microscope.I've no doubt that a man who so cherished his privacy in the way that C.S. Lewis did must have groped with the thought of having these thoughts...often written in notebooks as a form of therapy for his own self...published for all the world to read.That he, indeed, allowed this work to be published would require a certain amount of humility...not to mention the sense of compassion and empathy that Lewis must have known would be felt by others who've lost loved ones. What Lewis did by allowing this work to be published is to provide a tome that will be read for decades to come by many who experience grief.For those who are interested in the life of C.S. Lewis, then this book would be essential reading, if only to view him in the heart of a tempest to which he is vulnerable. For those who have lost a loved one, I know that no book can work like a potion to help overcome such grief. Still, this book might serve to provide some comfort during the trying days that face those who have experienced a profound loss."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"C.S. Lewis's \\"A Grief Observed\\" is a brief book -- only about 70 pages-- but it contains some of the best metaphors for faith I have ever read. Like his challenging work \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" this book is unsparing in its belief that a good God can will awful things on people. Like death, for instance. Why would an all-powerful God allow people to suffer and die, especially those well before their prime? Lewis went through this questioning himself when his wife died, and his journal of questions and answers fill the pages of this book.How can God remain silent when the ill cry out in pain? Lewis compares God to a surgeon performing open heart surgery. The doctor, knowing best the full process required, can't relieve pain at every cry, or he would never complete the process, and the intended purpose of the pain would never come to fruition. This is a pretty unsparing description -- I wonder how many people in grief feel comfort reading such things. This is where faith comes in -- if you believe that the end result of pain and death is resurrection, and you trust in God's plan, you can find comfort knowing that every death is part of the plan.Not an easy concept to grapple with -- I'm glad I read this book, but I can't help but flinch a bit at Lewis's viewpoint. It is lucid, poetic, and erudite -- and yet I still find myself uncomfortable with a God who would bring suffering on innocent people."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"After reading A Grief Observed, a man expressed how the book impacted him in this way: \\"For me, this little book was a cautionary tale. It illustrated how easy it is to have a faith that is not a faith, but rather a mere deception, a construct made of intellectual effort. When the forces that hold up the construct are taken away...the intellectual faith will vanish. It is only then that real faith can take root. For faith, to be real, can depend upon nothing but the faith itself: a faith in Jesus.\\" This response completely misunderstood Lewis' thought process in this book. Rather than forcing him to discover a new type of faith based entirely on faith, the shattering of his reality ended up enriching and deepening his faith by inextricably linking his emotions with his intellect.In the first place, the view above nonsensically misuses the term faith. By definition, at least to rational thinkers such as Lewis, faith has an object. One has faith in something. If the object of faith is faith, then the object of that faith must be determined. It quickly becomes clear that this leads to an infinite regress of constantly needing to supply an object: faith in faith in faith...ad infinitum. Identifying the object of faith as faith also makes the identity of the object irrelevant. If \\"faith itself\\" is what faith must depend on, than the final identification: \\"a faith in Jesus\\" does not follow.The reviewer above also assumes a false dichotomy between faith and reason that Lewis would be quick to debunk. Lewis had previously outlined his definition of faith as, \\"the power to go on believing not in the teeth of reason but in the teeth of lust and terror and jealousy and boredom and indifference that which reason, authority, or experience, or all three, have once delivered to us for truth.\\" Understanding this definition elucidates some of his more difficult statements. He sorrowfully stated, \\"If my house has collapsed at one blow, that is because it was a house of cards. The faith which 'took these things into account' was not faith but imagination.\\" (42) The fact that he was questioning his faith in God due to emotional pain meant that he had never comprehended how deep such pain might be and how difficult it might be to hold onto the what reason and authority had given him in the face of it. He found his faith woefully unable to withstand such emotional blows. He explained, \\"If I had really cared, as I though I did, about the sorrows of the world, I should not have been so overwhelmed when my own sorrow came.\\" (42) The ease with which true sorrow demolished his ability to trust in what he knew to be true based on reason, authority, and previous experience stunned him.Towards the end of the book, as he emerges from initial astounding pain of Joy's death, he begins to rediscover his faith, but he now exercises his faith with a true understanding of the degree to which pain can be felt. He can now appreciate the depths of agony someone can endure and how difficult it is to have faith in the midst of it. As he said, \\"All reality is iconoclastic.\\" (77) Reality forced him to reevaluate the role of emotion in holding a worldview. It broke apart his unhealthy and intellectually centered view of emotions and wedded them to his intellect.The beginnings of this union can be seen in the way he reasons through his grief in the second half of the book. Many of the arguments he makes prove that his intelect is very much intact, but all of his thinking is tempered with his new understanding of pain. He never abandons reason, such a divorce not even grief could accomplish, but he discovers that it must be balanced by a proper understanding of the immensity and complexity of emotion."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis' book (journal, really) captures the feeling of those in grief, there is no doubt about that. June 16, 2000 my wife left this life, 8 weeks to the day after our first child was born. In the midst of our struggle, there were several books that my family and I found comfort in, and this book was one of them.I rated this book 4 stars because it's difficult. It's not difficult to read, it doesn't contain long arguments or technical language. The content is hard for those in the throws of grief. And yet it is somehow comforting to know that you're not alone, the feelings that you feel aren't the signs of insanity. I remember several times thinking I was going insane, that I'd finally lost it...only to read those exact thoughts from Lewis' journal.Lewis' experience with grief was different from mine, too. I suppose everyone's is different in some way. Lewis is angry with God, and he struggles with his faith. He explains that it wasn't that he was in danger of losing his belief in God, but that he &quot;was in danger of coming to believe such terrible things about him.&quot; You may identify with Lewis' words, and I truly believe you'll find comfort in this book.If I may, I would like to recommend another book for those who suffer and those in ministry to the suffering, as well. Nicholas Wolterstorff's LAMENT FOR A SON captures the intimate details of grief, and in many ways I identified more with Wolterstorff than I did with Lewis.For those who've lost, this book is a difficult and yet rewarding right of passage. You travel down the narrow path, on hallowed ground. You make a journey that those who haven't made cannot speak of, and you can find comfort in the experience of those who travel with you.For those in ministry, this book is an excellent insight into the pain of those to whom you minister. Lewis attempts to coldly analyze his grief, and in the end he cannot. He simply expresses his grief without even attempting to gloss over it. The information you can glean from this book for your ministry is immeasurable.God bless you as you travel down this long and painful road. Remember, as Lewis did, the hope that will sustain you: God who raises the dead. The journey is difficult, but in the end we will see and hold them again. God be with you."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"After having read several of Lewis' books, I read &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; which quickly became my favorite. It is his journal - and almost too personal - where you bear witness to Lewis' progress as he sloughs his way through the deep mire of sorrow and grief.In the first pages of the book, he tells of going to God, seeking relief from the agony he feels in his heart over the fresh loss of his beloved wife, Helen Joy, only to find - the door slammed and the sound of the door being bolted and doubled bolted from the inside.He rails against God and his faith is stirred to its core.In the end, he finds his way back to God, but it is not an easy journey or a primrose path.For all of Lewis' intellectual reasonings and scholarly attainments, I find &quot;A Grief Observed&quot; to be his best work because it comes from the very heart of a man seeking to find the answers to life's hardest questions. It is not a philosophical insight or an intellectual wrangling, but a spirit-filled work that lays bare the heart of a man who loved his wife completely.This is an important book. Read it. You'll be changed."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This work chronicles Lewis' struggle to come to terms with the death of his wife. Because it comes from his private journals, it may not seem as &quot;polished&quot; as some of his other writings. Personally, I appreciate the way it reveals the innerworkings of a very emotional and private man.In contrast to many works, this book doesn't try to simplify grief, justify it, or dance around the issue with pat observations or cheery reminders. Instead, it dares to question those very tactics. Lewis allows himself to feel a broad range of emotions, including doubt and great despair. I love this quality in Lewis: he is one of the few Chrisitian writers who is brutally honest about his fears and anger. His writings allow that God is big enough to handle our toughest questions.This little book is full of images and ideas that will stay with you long after you've finished it. Lewis takes feelings that you can't quite pinpoint and eloquently puts them into words. As I read the book, I kept thinking to myself &quot;Yes, THAT'S what I feel too!&quot; Misery does love company, and Lewis is excellent company.As usual, Lewis is full of astute observations and points to ponder, but don't expect a bunch of clean and pretty answers. At the end, his grief is still very much a work in progress, which is definitely how it has been in my life....a journey."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"For a Cambridge professor, C.S. Lewis writes in simple, clear English free of flourish or pretension, and \\"A Grief Observed\\" is all the more powerful because of its style. It's a straight-forward account of his struggle with faith in the face of tragedy, and one of the best \\"self-help\\" guides available for those dealing with the questions that arise when dealing with the ultimate grief.\\"A Grief Observed\\" is about Lewis' crisis of faith following the death of his wife, poet Joy Davidman, whom he wed in the final decade of his life, well aware she was dying of cancer. Their romance and the tragedy that befell them was later dramatized in the play \\"Shadowlands,\\" and the subsequent film starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger.It's easy to see why Lewis, a famous Christian apologist who also wrote \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" and \\"The Screwtape Letters,\\" first published \\"A Grief Observed\\" under the pseudonym of N.W. Clark. The brutally honest reactions to tragedy and its effect on his definition of God would have shocked his faithful readers and might have tarnished his reputation. We are taught to love God and accept that He loves us. To question that thesis, or to express anger at God or to doubt his character, might be construed as blasphemy.Lewis writes that grief feels much like fear at times. \\"Meanwhile, where is God?\\" he asks. God is present, or seems to be, when all is well. \\"But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence. You may as well turn away.\\"Lewis does not doubt God's existence, but wonders if the Supreme Being is not what He has claimed to be.\\"The conclusion I dread is not 'So there's no God after all,' but 'So this is what God's really like. Deceive yourself no longer.'\\"These are not the kind of thoughts that many Christians would ever dare express which is why they are often of little help to those seeking reassurance or balm for their wounds. Too many self-described \\"Christians\\" are cliquish and cantankerous, professing a belief in the interest of feeling superior to those on the outside of their faith: \\"I'm saved, you're not. Na, na, na, na, na.\\"There is no such boasting from Lewis. Tragedy taught him that faith in God requires hard work, and if C.S. Lewis can struggle with belief, certainly we can, too. A remarkable, comforting book.Brian W. Fairbanks"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I have found much of Lewis' work to be difficult to wade through - style, content, depth. Always worth the wade, it can still be tedious. \\"A Grief Observed,\\" a slender volume, is both direct and compelling. Easily read in a couple of hours, it reveals a more human (doubting) perspective of his own journey. Personally, I can identify with the struggle more than the triumph these days.This book works through the stuggle of coming to grips with grief over the death of his wife - railing at God, feeling the misunderstanding of friends and disorientation of life and faith.It reveals truth that we all move through in resolution of our grief. Not moving too quickly through the process, and ending with yet some doubt I found it genuine, real and felt.I used this with a group and enjoyed the discussion as we discussed a chapter a week. Great Introduction and Foreword, as well. Worthy of discussion, too!The resource of \\"Shadowlands\\" (sreen movie) or \\"Through the Shadowlands\\" (BBC film-for-television) are helpful in contextualizing this book. I showed them after we had read the book and was delighted with the insight it gave persons not familiar with Lewis' life and work."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Five months ago, I lost a dear friend and in that time, many have felt compelled to recommend books to me on grief. It is this one, however, that has helped my wounded heart the most. I consider C.S. Lewis one of the greatest minds and authors ever - and to hear his honesty and questioning of God in the face of great tragedy made me realize that all I was feeling was &quot;okay&quot; in a sense. And so I continue through the pain, comforted by the writings of this man, and learning from him as well. I would recommend this book to anyone going through the mourning process. And even if you are not, it is good to read to help identify with those who are."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"My first introduction to CS Lewis was his famous Chronicals way back when I was in forth grade. I never bothered to read him again until my husband saw me struggling with comparing myself to other women in our church or to my mother-- God help me, she is a brilliant lady-- and seeing my insecurities rise to levels unknown before (I was pregnant.) He brought me the Screwtape Letters and this man whose life had seemed so far from mine reached to my heart and he spoke with elequence yet reached to my level. We shared them with our children and it's a running joke in our family to say, \\"Screwtape's been messing with your mind again. . .\\"A Grief Observed was one of my husband's gifts to me recently after my dad died. I was having nightmares of his death then becoming saddened in the daylight hours when I realised that I couldn't remember what he looked like. I have been trained in Hospice and counseled people through grief, yet was in shock when it happened to me. When my husband gave me this book, I opened it to a page where CS was talking about how he couldn't remember what his wife looked like, that pictures were meaningless-- once again, he was where I was, on my level with me. In spite of me being Russian Orthodox and CS being western in his thought, his writingis influenced by his search for knowing God, not by any particular church and I appreciate that and can relate to him very well.I have perused this book many times. When someone dies in our society, there is no prescribed time for mourning for immediate family members. I found that my mother was the one to be comforted more than anything--- as his widow, she deserves that-- but in spite of being an adult child, I still hurt and cry at different times and the hurt surprises me for when it hits. In spite of CS writing about his wife, this is a great companion for \\"lesser mourners\\" as well as the main person affected. This book is a great comfort to anyone who experiences a loss of someone they love."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is another amazing book by Lewis, and another that I have read multiple times. I have had to read it for at least three university courses over the last 18 years. This book is unlike anything else that Lewis ever wrote. It is raw, visceral and at times disturbing, unlike most of his other work that is very precise, specific, well argued and clearly laid out.Recently I heard this story: \`Douglas Gresham, C.S. Lewis's stepson recently released a book about Lewis called Jack's Life. It includes a DVD interview, where Gresham states that Lewis did not intend to publish A Grief Observed; it was a personal notebook. When it was published it was under the pseudonym NW Clark and by a publisher Lewis had never published with. Gresham also said that Lewis received numerous copies of the book as gifts from friends who thought it would help.' That speaks to the power in Lewis's writing; even his friends thought the book would be helpful for him as he journeyed through his grief.Lewis states in his book The Four Loves: \\"We shall draw nearer to God, not by trying to avoid the sufferings inherent in all loves, but by accepting them and offering them to Him, throwing away all defensive armour. If our hearts need to be broken, and if He chooses this as the way in which they should break, so be it.\\" That view is drastically changed when he writes Grief. In A Grief Observed we have a very different approach. Lewis presents a very visceral response to the loss of his wife. An example of this is that Lewis states at the beginning of the book: \\"No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.\\" This book shows us more of Lewis's own heart and life than almost anything else he wrote.It is a great book for those dealing with loss - either for yourself or for someone you know and love. It is often used in grief counseling, and one of the courses I read it for was on the spirituality of death and dying. This book is a gem in the cannon of Lewis literature. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Everyone has either experienced a tragic loss of life in the family. Perhaps a death in the extended family, or through a friend who might have lost a loved one. For Christians, grief is an especially tough time, taking them through cycles of questions about whether or not God really does love us when such brutally painful events take hold of us.When author Clive Staples Lewis lost his wife to cancer in the 1960's, he was no different than any of us, finding himself asking the same questions about God's goodness and love that a lot of us have. Since Lewis had already lived a full life, his loss was deepened by the lack of promises of future happiness a younger person might find some small comfort in. Yet in the wee hours when his grief and anguish were the most poignant, Lewis - an author all the way - took to filling blank pads of paper in his house with the thoughts and feelings that his bereavement brought.Even though I have not personally experienced anything near the kind of grief that this book deals with, I still found this book to be an amazing read. The deepest grief I've ever experienced was the loss of a family pet, yet from that small sampling I can just barely grasp what Lewis went through. Indeed any person not accustomed to grief can begin to understand it by reading the beautiful language that fills the pages of this book.It is a short book, ringing in with only four chapters, and 76 pages. Yet all of them are filled with the balm of Lewis's reflections and introspection, and all of them are able to help a grieving person, if for nothing else than to know that they're not alone.For any person who might be undergoing a period of sorrow, I highly recommend this book. It is not a lot of heavy reading, thus possibly making it easier on someone who is already in such pain. The wonderfully poetic, graceful language gives body and soul to the multitude of emotions that wash through a grieving person, especially in dark hours. These emotions, I'm sure, are experienced by everyone, but with the comments and insight of one of Christendom's favorite authors, it makes this work a priceless treasure.If you, or someone you know is going through a difficult time of loss and heartache, buy this book for them. It is a must-read for anyone in pain."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis shows enormous honesty and courage as he writes in this little book, a journal expressing his grief, about his faltering faith in God after the loss of his cherished wife. Despite his lifelong career as a writer of the truth of Christian faith, in this journal he expresses doubt about the very existence of a God who would wickedly deprive him of the greatest gift of his life, his wife. But as the months pass after her death, and Lewis further examines himself, he begins to appreciate the degree of personal selfishness wrapped up in his grief, and in his raging at God. As a result, towards the end of the journal he reestablishes his faith in a much more deeply rooted way. For me, this little book was a cautionary tale. It illustrated how easy it is to have a faith that is not a faith, but rather a mere deception, a contruct made of intellectual effort. When the forces that hold up the construct are taken away, such as what happened to Lewis with the loss of his wife, the intellectual faith will vanish. It is only then that real faith can take root. For faith, to be real, can depend upon nothing but the faith itself: a faith in Jesus. God does us an eternal favor when he takes from us those things we would cling to that are other than Himself."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Not every author invites readers into the intimacy of his own most personal and profound loss. But not every confirmed bachelor and university professor marries for immigration rather than for love, and later realizes that his heart belongs to the person to whom he is already married, only to formally take her as a real wife during her hospitalization and treatment for a form of cancer that will eventually end her life. But C.S. Lewis is special, and so are his readers.This personal diary, originally published under a psedonym, offers reassurance that knowing God is good does not preclude feelings of deep sorrow, fear, and uncertainty in the loss of a loved one. Lewis explores the social, emotional, and spiritual earthquakes that are caused by the death of his wife. Losing his intellectual sparring partner, his bedfellow, his friend, and his lover shakes him to the core, yet he clings to Christ as the only source of eteral hope for himself and for his wife Joy.During a season of grief, I read this book every few weeks. It's a classic and not to be missed, not because it's entertaining, but because it acknowleges deep longings and desires that are intended by our Creator to lead us to Truth."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This book was recommended to me when my son died. I found it very helpful in dealing with my sorrow, and I would recommend it to anyone who has lost someone very dear to them."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"The fact that only five stars can be awarded is, in this case, a travesty. The acuity of Lewis' mind, in direct correlation with his ability to transfer his thoughts to paper is that which places him amongst the most riveting authors of the twentieth century, if not of all time. It is by the pen of this individual that many have come to understand the Christian religion with greater confidence due to the fact that Lewis has a way of evoking personal sentiments that may have been otherwise buried in the subconscious. It is from the mind of Lewis that some have come to terms with The Problem of Pain. From this same mind, others have been provided with the information necessary to see through the theological differences across Christian boundaries in an effort to discover Mere Christianity. However, A Grief Observed is a work of art like no other.What differentiates this work from all others is that Lewis applies his amazing ability to the evaluation of his own mind, as opposed to an effort directed towards helping others grasp difficult concepts. A Grief Observed may be the most honest and moving literary masterpiece ever created by a human hand. It appears as if Lewis commenced the documentation of his experience uncertain of whether he would publish it for public consumption, or retain it for his own purposes. It would be difficult to determine if Lewis, himself, knew with any degree of certainty what was to become of his somewhat stream of consciousness jottings when he began. This stream of consciousness, however, could not be compared to that of James Joyce or the like. While it is jumbled at times - as one might expect the mind operating after a significant loss - Lewis maintains a flow of logic and reasoning that is just as seemingly clairvoyant as his most premeditated works.Many may turn to this short work only after themselves suffering a personal loss. While one cannot be certain as to how reading this would affect their grievances; it is fairly apparent throughout this work that Lewis would not expect that anything created by the hands of man could dampen the blow suffered by the loss of a loved one. However, the fortunate might be those that have an opportunity to experience this amazing walk through another man's thoughts while they are free from their own emotional suffering. Whatever it is that might bring an individual to the thought of examining A Grief Observed, it can be assured that they only serve to gain by following through with their initial curiosity. To expect this work to fill a void would be comparable to throwing a penny into the Grand Canyon; outside of this expectation, this text is worth its weight in life."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Anyone struggling with anger, disbelief, and overwhelming saddness from the sickness or death of a loved one should spend the brief time it takes to read the book. A beautiful love story in its own right, C.S. Lewis intimately shares his doubts and at times his rage at his god and his religion. Gripping, poignant, excellent."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"With that opening sentence, Lewis sets the tone for this amazing memoir. How many of us, in our sorrow-filled ramblings, could achieve this much depth and clarity of thought?In the process of trying to understand his pain, Lewis demonstrates that he is, indeed, one of the greatest minds the world has ever known. And through this, we find comfort in the fact that even brilliant men succumb to their emotions. Lewis understands what he is feeling, but he cannot control it. He cannot change it.He is, he writes, on a circle. Just when he feels that the pain is subsiding, it comes back in full force. Perhaps, he theorizes, it is not a circle at all, but a spiral. \\"But if a spiral, am I going up or down?\\"Infinitely more affecting, in many ways, than the film based loosely upon it (Richard Attenborough's 'Shadowlands'), 'A Grief Observed' is one of Lewis' greatest triumphs."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Like C. S. Lewis, I never expected my emotions to be so deep that I wavered in my faith. Fortunatly I realized that God is always there through the deepest of sorrow and turmoil. And knowing that He is the Great Comforter has given me peace.I also recommend Healing Stories of Grief and Faith, From Denial and Despair to Comfort and Peace and Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal. Also, After the Tears, A Gentle Guide to Help Children Understand Death is a great video."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"If you've ever cried out, &quot;Why, God?&quot;, this book will help you see that God did not leave you to suffer for His enjoyment. As C.S. Lewis writes the entries in this journal you can see the mixture of emotions and thoughts; like riding an ocean tossed by intermittent storms. Lewis bares his soul and helps us look at our own. Having read his earlier book, &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot;, before reading this one gave me an even deeper look into his thoughts. I recommend them both. I also recommend the movie &quot;Shadowlands&quot; with the reading of this book. Lewis is brilliant, but he is also very human and very candid."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Most of us know the story of C.S. Lewis and Helen Joy Gresham through the movies &quot;Shadowlands&quot;. This little volume with a forward written by Douglas H. Gresham, is the most poignant expressive, deeply personal accounts of what it means to grieve over someone you love, that I have ever encountered. He gave form to feelings I was unable to express and provided the words that will remain in my heart as the expression of loss I feel, as I faced the final chapter with my husband Tom. Tom died of Alzheimer's disease in his home as he wished. It is rare that a volume such as this one enters one's life."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"Lewis journals the agonized philosophical wrestling with the lucid thought that earmarks his other writings. Having been a long time Lewis fan, I found this book strangly comforting when I lost my wife to cancer.

Unfortunately, my best buddy Kenny, (we all called him Skink) on June 26, 2010, beat her to it, very unexpectedly. Not that it was ever a competition. And thank God it wasn't a suicide either. Like many athletes, he had an enlarged heart, and without warning, it killed him instantly.So you read my first sentence, and you see that this was to be reserved for Grandma. Yep. I actually planned it out. I wanted to find this book, I found it at a Christian book store, and left it on my bookshelf, unblemished, waiting for the day that I got the news. But June 26, 2010, I got other news. My best friend ever, was found with his hands in his lap, and head tilted to the side. His car had been fixed earlier that day. His plans were to go back to camp. He'd ridden home with another friend in the best spirits possible that very day. They'd eaten lunch together. He'd joked around with the little baby in the car. And then it was all over. God had other plans for him.One reviewer said that we're probably not all going to have the same thoughts as C.S. Lewis on how to grieve, and how to get through it. I'm certainly not going to write a book about my experience this time around or the next. But whether I like it or not, Lewis hits this one on the head, because he experienced grief just like any of us. How do you talk to God in a time like this? How are we going to go through life? It might actually feel like a torture, and you might not come to your senses at first. You'll probably feel numb, and wonder over and over and over again if you'll ever feel normal again. Will we ever get over this?C.S. Lewis experienced loss in his life. I'm not even sure if I really REVIEWED this book the way people think it should be reviewed. But I really don't care. What I do care about is that I miss my buddy. I'll always remember my best buddy, and I can't wait to see him once again! I think about him in lots and lots of things I do these days. That's how I'm getting back on my feet, slowly but surely. And with God's grace, I'm taking one step back at a time.This can either mean something to somebody, or they don't have to read it at all. My choice was to read it, and it was as human as ever. And, not being C.S. Lewis, I don't suppose it was all supposed to make sense to me. Will I ever understand why God took my buddy? Nope. It's not for me to understand, except that God has His plans for Kenny up in Heaven. And God still has His plans for me on Earth until He calls me home. So while I'll never see Kenny down here again, I'm always going to have the memories that only him and I had throughout the years of being best buddies. Nobody can take that away! Can't wait to see you again, brother!! You were always the best!!"},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"This is one of the author's best books because it is intended for mature audiences."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"CS Lewis began writing this journal one month after his wife died of cancer. He was distraught, shocked, and confused, especially about the meaning of life. The journal rambles from one throught to another, reflecting his daze and despair.I found the book rather difficult to read. It is only 72 pages long, but each sentence needs to be reread, carefully, in order to follow Lewis' thought processes. He finds no answers to his questions (mainly: How could God take his beloved away from him?); he simply asks them.For me, this was not a particularly helpful or insiteful book on grief, merely one person's thoughts on the subject. I am sure however, that admirers of CS Lewis would find it of interest."},{"Title":"A Grief Observed","review":"I was excited to receive my own, long awaited copy of A Grief Observed.

Other than the confusion I think the book is fantastic!! In fact, it's the best literrary work I've found in dealing with death, the grieving process loved ones go through before death, and what reactions to expect of others after the fact.

Maybe it's because I was told by many that although I'm not a Christian, I can take parts from this book; his words of wisdom, despair and light at the end of the book and apply it to my own experience.Although I didn't lose a spouse like CS Lewis did, I watched my father's pain losing my mother. I had my own pain as well. In reading the first chapter I found myself shaking my head to myself relating to some of his questioning, some of his anger, underlinging some feelings he expressed that felt like my own. This is where I then became annoyed I bought the book. I won't give away the ending, but I will say I didn't find what some said I would.I found after a few pages everything was related to Christianity. I guess I wanted to read about this man's journey without bible quotes. And to be quite frank, after a while I grew weary of his anger.I would recommend this book to someone in the very beginnings of mourning. Someone who lost a spouse. Someone is a Christian.

It's actually fun to read aloud, since \\"Moo Moo Moo\\" and \\"Caw Caw Caw\\" and \\"Squeak Squeak Squeak\\" are fun sounds to make (along with all the other sounds). What is especially sweet is that Goose -- or some part of her -- is on every panel, and she is chasing a little yellow butterfly throughout the book. The repetition of \\"But where's Goose?\\" provides the opportunity to look for her and point out other animals.

Fleming's style of &quot;pulp painting&quot; which she used to create images is very inovative. On each spread is an interesting combination of sculpture, painting and collage using bright colors. Among other natural materials, she used colored cotton pulp, ground coffee, kernels of oats and a piece of burlap potato sack that rendered texture on her artwork that one can almost actually feel and smell! In Barnyard Banter, the cows in the pasture moo, the hens in the henhouse cluck, and the pigs in the wallow muck. While she started the book with familiar animals. Fleming added new animals like the mice in the grain bin that squeak, the peacocks that shriek, the pigeons that coo, the crows that caw and the crickets that chirp. The little readers may have difficulty distiguishing the pigs from the background, but once they find the pigs' eyes and snouts, they will see that the pigs are having fun wallowing in the mud. Adults and kids will have fun sharing this books as they read, play and sing with it. Infants who are attracted with different sounds and voice intonations will be fascinated with the different sounds of the animals, not to mention their bright colors. One-year-olds can start pointing to the animals and later on imitate their sounds. The two's and three's can identify the animals and create their own sounds. Fleming also invites the kids to look for the goose that is hiding among the different animals in each spread. Children between one and two years old ae capable of spotting details and older kids will enjoy looking for partly hidden objects. Fleming made this game more interesting by showing only parts of the goose in some pages. For instance, in one page, only the beak of the goose in showing on the corner of the page. It will also be interesting to see, if the children will notice that a butterfly always hangs around with the goose. Infact, it was the butterfly that sort of provided the prelude and the postlude for the book because it was the only creature in the title page, and at the last page, the butterfly was being chases by the goose. Different kinds of games and activities can be shared between the child and the parent/adult with this book. Fleming's choice of types and size fro her text is also appropriate for the very young readers. Black bold and simple types were used to make it easy for the kids to identify the words or letters. The simple short sentences telling where the animals are located were written on straight lines on the top of the page, but the sounds that they make are written all over, which added interest to the page. The text are interesting and predictable and made use of various letter sound combinations like muck, cluck,moo, coo, caw, haw, squeak and shriek. It will be interesting how kids will react to the words wallow, paddock, hayloft and rafters which may not be common to city children's vocabulary. The bright red color for end pages easily attracts attention and provides a glaring contrast to the sunshiny yellow of the title page and the end page. The book might be too big for small hands but will fit perfectly on adult's lap. The size of the book, the big text and the bright pictures will be good for small group reading. As in other books on farm animals, it will be nice to end the reading with the singing of the old time favorite &quot;Old MacDonald Had a Farm, e-i-e-i-o..."},{"Title":"Barnyard Banter","review":"I love this book--it's beautiful. This book is a delightful romp through the farmyard, with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly, causing the ruckus with all the animals. The abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and, therefore, may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck, the kittens in the hayloft, the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. But a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing Fleming's gorgeous art each time. My nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Barnyard Banter","review":"This book is simple yet fantastically fun and educational.

It is amazing how such a simple idea, so well written, can bring so much fun! You have to get this one!"},{"Title":"Barnyard Banter","review":"It's a back-handed compliment, to say the least, to mention that every time I read a new Denise Fleming book I'm shocked by how much I enjoy reading it. When I haven't perused a Fleming creation in a while, I have a nasty tendency to lump her in with fellow author/illustrators Lois Ehlert or Eric Carle. But Fleming has something those two will never have. A keen sense of what makes a colored cotton pulp illustration funny. Ever since I first laid eyes on her clever \\"Lunch\\" (a title I highly recommend) I became a real fan. And with \\"Barnyard Banter\\", I can clearly state that this is a children's picture book writer with a highly entertaining gaggle of tricks up her sleeve.This is a book that initially seems to be best categorized as one of those baryard sound titles. The first two-page spread shows a three cow herd of red-eyed (some might say demonic) heifers accompanied by the words, \\"Cows in the pasture, moo, moo, moo\\". On the next page are two strutting birds with a, \\"Roosters in the barnyard, cocka-doodle-doo\\". You get the idea. Each two-page spread rhymes with the next, which makes for some creative stretches on the part of the author (apparently frogs say \\"burp burp burp\\"). As this jouncy book continues, once in a while the words, \\"But where's Goose?\\" appear in a corner. The goose, for its part, actually appears in every single animal's spotlight in some way. When we're viewing pigeons in the rafters, goose is far below perpetually chasing an elusive butterfly. When we're amidst the crows of the cornfield, the goose's beak peeks out from the lower right-hand side, stretching towards the flutterby above. This means that kids can have a lot of fun going through the book and finding that semi-obsessive goosey.The words of the book are catchy, especially in a section that is simply every three-letter animal cry we've read combined into a bouncy rhythmic poem. So points should be given for the kind of text that gets little pre-schoolers involved (any book you can sing to usually falls into that category). But many a slap-happy sing-n-dance text has been brought low by dull colorless or otherwise blah illustrations. Not so here. Using her customary technique of (and I'm quoting the book jacket here), \\"pouring colored cotton pulp through hand-cut stencils\\" in a method described as \\"pulp painting\\", this book's a ribald explosion of color and form. Though you'd swear, just glancing at it, that this was yet another cut paper picture book, closer inspection reveals the complicated process that \\"Barnyard Banter\\" required. You've got coffee grounds for soil! You've got kernels of oats for grain bins! You've even got portions of burlap sacks disguised as chicken-wire fences. And the colors... oh the colors. Part of my love for Fleming's other book, \\"Lunch\\" was due to her firm grasp of the primaries. That love can now be transferred to this book as well. The whole tale's awash in bright clear-cut images that could easily leave you blinking your eyes from sunspots.Whether you're searching for a book that follows the whole \\"the &lt;enter obligatory farm animal here> says\\" genre, or you want a book that uses rhythm in a novel way, or even if you just want a story where kids can locate an elusive naughty animal, \\"Barnyard Banter\\" fulfills all these needs and more. I tip my hat to Denise Fleming and promise her that I will never ever ever confuse her again with Lois Ehlert. Ever. In fact I'll do more than that. I'll remember how much I like Fleming's books and recommend them to all I see. That, I feel, is a perfectly appropriate penance. And one that I am not the least bit reluctant about carrying out."},{"Title":"Barnyard Banter","review":"This is one of my toddlers favorite books.

The book is ideal for someone that would like to learn about speculative bubbles without having to spend a lot of time reading through a larger book. With some dry humor he starts off with The Tulip Mania in Holland and ends with the 1987 crash on Wall Street. Galbraith has a unusual writing style, but does a good job of showing the common characteristic of all bubbles. I cannot over emphasize that this small book will show you the fatal flaws of bubble dynamics and their aftermath,in which the authorities and public search for scapegoat's and reason's for the bubble popping. Any reason will do as long as it is external of the market and the public remains blameless. Galbraith makes this point several times.

The elements include use of some kind of leverage, with all participants touting reasons why the bubble is different this time, until it pops, and then a search for reasons why it happened, always excluding the (greedy) people who voluntarily supported and blew the bubble up before it popped.This is the first Galbraith book that I've ever read, and I was surprised at the convoluted and awkward sentence structures and phrasing. Many sentences had no flow to them all, so it was easy to have your mind wander, as it were, without really knowing, if you know what I mean, why all the little intermediate phrases -- both long and short, were injected into sentences, here and there, before the final phrase that completed the sentence arrived, while you were overcoming all the obstacles.I might recommend this book to a friend for the elements of the bubble pattern. But not for a decent summary or history of the bubbles discussed (better summaries can be found on the net), and especially not for well written sentences and a smooth read.

Galbraith, as usual, is accurate and fair. The only problem with the book is that is that it never dives below the surface. Galbraith, like many left-wing critics of capitalism, has a keen eye for interesting facts, but he has little if any theoretical sense of the basic economic principles involved in market euphorias. It is gross credit excess that is fueling the current stock market bubble. The obverse side of credit is debt, and that is precisely where the problem rises. As credit expands, debt expands with it, especially bad debt. Eventually, the bad debt leads to a crisis; if a sizeable amount of debt cancellation occurs, you get deflation and a crisis of epic proportions."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"The point Galbraith makes regarding the specious association of money (wealth) and intelligence is an observation of tremendous socio economic dimensions.Nichola Tesla the father of electromagnetism died poor in a basement, Albert Einstein was not a millionaire .. and the story goes on and on.TIf the markets reward Nicola Tesla with poverty and Koslowski (Tyco) with richness, it says a lot about their efficiency and sanity. Maybe Soros is right. The free market system as a rule is never right but only as an exception."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"If euphoria is the result of unwarranted optimism based on substantial previous achievement, then Galbraith was sadly carried away by the euphoria of his own reputation in attempting this topic.Many of his books are beacons of astute political, economic and social judgment; one of his finest, rarely if ever matched by any author, is 'The Scotch'. This book is more of a Cliff's Notes compilation of financial accidents, concluding with the wise advice to \\"Be Careful\\".To take one example, he doesn't explain the WHY of Tulipomaniaof the 1630s. He merely concludes, \\"Anyone who has seen the tulip fields of this calm and pleasat land in the spring retains forever a feeling that the Tulipomania did foretell nature's true grace.\\" Time and again he walks away from poignant examples with the obvious conclusion that sometimes something nice happens.Financial euphoria, from what I've seen, is very much like the mania for hula hoops, basketball hoops and Beanie Babies and a Google stock IPO. The madness of crowds for new fads is a result of honest and optimistic people who want to share in a good thing. This is the basis of a prosperous society, even if it can lead to occasional financial euphoria.Sadly, he mixes the madness of Tulipomania with the outright fraud of crooks who deliberately create a climate of excited optimism to defraud honest people. Fraud is a circus salesmen who offers \\"a special opportunity\\" to \\"See the Egress\\" for only a small fee. There's a big difference between honest promoters and cynical crooks. It makes me suspect Galbraith was never a salesman, and resolutely ignored the circus if it ever ventured near Harvard.Galbraith ignores the vast difference between the two. One is the enthusiastic optimism of a promoter with a new idea who takes great risks to make it a reality; an example is Thomas Edison and his thousands of attempts to develop ideas into useful products. The second is the enthusiastic illusions of a trickster whose only goal is to separate the honest but optimistic people from their money; an example is Robert Vesco.In the first case, an optimistic society with confidence in a better future can become the victim of the irrational exuberance of its expectations. This phenomena truly needs to be studied to understand irrational financial euphoria. The second is the crook who uses clever words instead of a big club to steal from anyone and everyone.Galbraith failed to distinguish between the two or to explain the nature of either. It makes his book more of a short example of overconfidence in his own ability to be cogent, concise and relevant."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"IN THIS SMALL but witty and well-crafted book, Galbraith chronicles the major speculative episodes, from the seventeenth-century tulipmania to the junk-bond follies of the eighties. The book was first published in 1990 and thus the recent dotcom-bubble burst is not covered. Nevertheless, the Harvard professor's book is still worth reading. A reason is that he claims to have identified common patterns in the history of financial euphoria. \`In small ways the history of the great speculative boom and its aftermath does change. Much, much more remains the same', he predicts.The perennial features are these. Some seemingly new and desirable artifact or development captures the financial imagination of a large number of people (say, group 1). The arrival of tulips in Western Europe, gold in Louisiana, the advent of joint-stock companies (corporations), real estate in Florida, or the economic designs of Reagan are all examples. The price of the object of speculation goes up. The object when bought today is worth more tomorrow. This attracts new buyers and assures a further price increase. Those in group 1 are persuaded that the new price-enhancing circumstance is under control, and expect the market to stay up and go up, perhaps indefinitely. The individual or institution that discovered the novelty (in group 2) is thought to be ahead of the mob. Fewer in number, individuals of group 2 perceive the speculative mood of the moment, try to get the maximum reward from the increase as it continues, and plan to be out before the eventual crash. The affluence of group 2 is wrongly associated, by group 1, with a miraculous financial genius. When something triggers the ultimate reversal, group 2 decides now is time to get out. Group 1 finds its illusion abruptly destroyed. Both groups sell or try to sell. The market collapses.Galbraith observes that, in this process, \`speculation buys up the intelligence of those involved'. The crowd converts the individual in group 1 from possessing reasonable good sense to stupidity. Those in group 2 also make errors of vanity by thinking they will beat the speculative game. It seems that \`all people are most credulous when they are most happy'. Reputable public and financial opinion reinforces euphoria by condemning those who express doubt or dissent by warning of a crash. The celebrated Yale economist Irving Fisher, for instance, spoke out sharply against Roger Babson, who foresaw the crash of 1929. But the critic must wait until after the crash for any approval, Galbraith laments.Despite the fact that common features in speculative episodes recur, history counts little because a financial disaster is quickly forgotten by a new, self-confident generation. Something is perceived as a financial novelty merely because the financial memory is short: \`financial operations do not lend themselves to innovation'. Insightfully, Galbraith notices that all financial innovation involves the creation of debt leveraged against more limited assets. This is the case of banks, whose debt is leveraged on a given volume of hard cash. This is also the case of the holding companies created in the 1920s, whose stockholders issued bonds and preferred stock to buy other stocks. And this is the case, too, of the junk bonds of the mergers-and-acquisitions mania in the 1980s, when high-risk, higher-interest bonds were issued in greater volume against the credit of the companies being taken over. As Galbraith puts it: \`the world of finance hails the invention of the wheel over and over again, often in a slightly more unstable version'.However a crisis may strike at any moment whenever a debt is perceived to become dangerously out of scale in relation to the underlying means of payment. After the crash, group 1 expresses anger against the \`financial genius' of group 2. \`Financial genius is before the fall', Galbraith prophesies. Group 1 finally realizes that having more money may mean that a person in group 2 is indifferent to moral constraints. Group 2 could have even gone beyond the law, as far as leverage is concerned. Incarceration of some individuals of group 2 may follow. Leverage is seen as morally disputable at last.Talks of regulation and reform follow. However, the speculation itself or the aberrant optimism that lay behind it will not be discussed. \`Nothing is more remarkable than this: in the aftermath of speculation, the reality will be all but ignored.' Why? Because it is easier for group 1 to blame one individual or a few individuals in group 2 than to take responsibility for its own widespread naivety. And also because there is a need to find a cause for the crash that is external to the market itself. After all, the market is believed to be \`a neutral and accurate reflection of external influences; it is not supposed to be subject to an inherent and internal dynamic of error'. The deficit in the federal budget was, for instance, blamed for the 1987 crash. Another anecdotal account of Black Monday has been that the crash was caused by portfolio insurance computer programs which sold stocks as the market went lower.Galbraith's book is compulsory reading for economists, especially those working on behavioural finance or econophysics. Being an antidote to illusory financial euphoria, the book is thus of interest to the general public as well. Galbraith's own sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu towards speculative financial bubbles enabled him to predict the crash of 19 October 1987. People really seem to be intrinsically unable to prevent getting stuck in the error-prone dynamics of bull markets, as in his \`bubble story'. But perhaps they have already learned some minor lessons on how to better protect themselves in the aftermath of crashes. Indeed despite the fact that the Black Monday crash was nearly twice as severe as the stock market collapse of 1929, it did not trigger a depression. Likewise the internet-bubble burst of 2000 had a surprisingly modest effect on wealth. Will we finally learn to learn from history?"},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"Galbraith paints a picture of the episodes of financial euphoria that allow one to see the seeds of the next bubble being planted. What Galbraith points out are the common themes of market bubbles. In the end, the same script is run as we hear that \\"this time is different\\" Although published in 1990, this reads like an epilogue to the tech/internet bubble of 1999-2000. The old saying goes that \\"what we learn from history is that we do not learn from history.\\" Galbraith gives us the tools to learn from history. In an age of books like \\"Dow 36,000\\" and other mania induced work, this classic is a reality touchstone for all serious, sophisticated investors - individual and institutional alike. I would rate this book as a **********, but am limited to ***** (5 stars)."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"Galbraith's wonderful little book (Only 110 pages) is a quick guided tour -- with pithy analysis interspersed throughout -- of get-rich-quick movements, and, more importantly, the foolish thinking BEHIND such phenomena. Galbraith takes the reader on brief tours of some of the more notorious financial booms-gone-bad, such as the \\"Tulip Craze\\" in Holland and the Banque Royale bust in France in the 1600's, the South Seas \\"Bubble\\" of the 1700's, and, more importantly, the numerous episodes throughout American financial history, from Colonial times through the busts of 1819, 1837, 1857, 1873, 1907, 1929 -- and 1987 (Galbraith's book was first published in 1990 -- ten years before the dot-com bust....). The source of these rush-to-riches-gone-sour, argues Galbraith, rests on several ever-consistent, historically re-occurring causes: First, the quest for leverage (i.e. generating more funds than having the means to actually support them) and lavish debt spending; Second, the pathological, recurrent inability of the financial world to learn from the past; Third, the silly notion that the possession of wealth is directly equal to a persons' intelligence (Wealthy individuals, contends Galbraith, are not rich because of brains, but more often through chance and circumstance -- a fact the public ignores at their own peril); Fourth, the incessant human desire to become affluent by the easiest means possible; Fifth, the 'religious' quality Americans consistently perscribe to \\"the market,\\" i.e. that free enterprise is 'perfect' -- Corruption, loss, and falling markets are due only to \\"outside forces\\" (Like 'evil CEO's' or 'government intervention') -- rather than the public's endless supply of gullibility, culpability, and simple greed. The financial world, Galbraith brilliantly contends, is rooted in a quasi-theological outlook: Successful Wall Street moguls are treated as divine shamans; dogmatic faith in the latest financial hoopla is considered a virtue; critics are readily condemned as heretics; and once the bubble bursts, there exists a curious religious playing-out of \\"Sin-Fall-Guilt-Punishment,\\" whereby the men who we once revered as financial geniuses are quickly strung-up in the court of public opinion -- sacrificial lambs for the public's own short-sightedness. Galbraith warns his readers that money-making innovations in the world of finance are simply worn-out re-workings of very, very old schemes. New bubbles emerge under new guises and fanciful terminology -- but the game remains forever the same. Once one crisis has passed, a new financial rush soon emerges, and the vicious cycle of irrationality and idiocy (Galbraith's terms) begin again. In the end, Galbraith warns his readers to be very wary of those who promise you easy wealth, and should you jump on the latest money-making bandwagon -- and most likely end up losing in the end -- don't blame anyone or anything except............YOURSELF. Excellent book!!"},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"Reading about the history of speculation is a way to broaden one's critical views of investing.

What you would expect from Galbraith. On the short list of people who can write about finance and keep it entertaining."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"Money makes people stupid, but other people assume the possession of money means the pessessors are smart. There's a good deal of evidence for this proposition, which is repeated over and over in this essay, but in \\"A Short History of Financial Euphoria,\\" John Galbraith was not interested in providing evidence. (You can find plenty in Edward Chancellor's \\"Devil Take the Hindmost.\\") Galbraith was just jeering.Jeering is a worthy exercise, especially if the targets are the morons who run American and world finance. Galbraith has much fun tweaking the self-described geniuses (at Citibank, especially) for taking the deposits of the Arab sheiks after the oil shocks and handing them over to the deadbeats of Latin America. Even when he wrote this long essay, in 1990, most people had forgotten that.The bankers certainly had, since they soon repeated it.We are always being told that business should be given its head, but Galbraith is not too impressed. In his view (matched by my own experience as a news reporter covering business), most managers are more or less incompetent or stupid, and success in business is mostly a matter of luck.The underlying message of \\"A Short History\\" is unsupervised markets fail.Galbraith notes that when markets do fail, there is always a circling of the wagons to protect the myth of the market and to lay the blame on some exogenous event. This sometimes goes to absurd lengths. After the '29 crash, exculpators tried to say that it was foretold by a mild dip in industrial production in the summer; and more recently rightwing and free-market publicists have settled on blaming the Federal Reserve for a slight increase in the discount rate, avowedly meant to curb speculation, that year.The culprit, says Galbraith, is always speculation leading to insanity. Further, he asserts that it is a feature, not a bug; it's built in and there's nothing that can be done about it.This is too pessimistic. Obviously, something can be done, since there were no crashes between the imposition of New Deal measures in the mid-'30s and 1987, shortly after the abandonment of New Deal circuitbreaker measures (either legally or in regulatory practice). In all the rest of American financial history, before and since, crashes have come every 20 years, which Galbraith ascribes to the forgetting time. Also, the passage of a couple of decades provides for the incursion of a new flock of ignorant fools who discover leverage and are persuaded that not only is it the way to easy riches, but that nobody ever thought of it before.My experience of 40 years watching businesses confirms all this.Another thing Galbraith and I agree about is the mystery of bubbles. History - he starts with the Tulipomania of 1736 - shows that anything can be bubblized. But what prevents some high-valued asset - think Picasso daubs - from bubblizing? Neither Galbraith nor I can say.While I find Galbraith amusing, a little goes a long way. Even the little in this volume is more than enough for me.Galbraith wrote this little book in 1990, which allowed him much fun at the expense of Michael Milken and Donald Trump. This demonstrates, I suppose, that even market skeptics are unable to predict the future. Trump is still with us.About the time Galbraith wrote, Salomon Brothers (remember them?) predicted that the overbuilding caused by the savings and loan bubble had left New York City with so much empty office space that it would not be absorbed for 46 years. Forty-six months was more like it, at the cost of, since then, three more crashes.I wouldn't care if only the plungers got hurt."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"This is one of the best books on financial manias. Despite his lifelong promotion of inflationary policies that give rise to bubbles, it is a very insightful, well-written and entertaining book."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"A Short History of Financial EuphoriaJohn Kenneth GalbraithBook ReviewBy Richard E. NobleThis book is indeed a \\"short\\" history of Financial Euphoria. I would have liked a much longer and more detailed history by Mr. Galbraith.In a previous book, \\"The Great Crash 1929,\\" much of what is in this book has already been expressed. In fact, I think most of this work was excerpted directly from the \\"The Great Crash\\" verbatim.The advantages of this little book are that all these cases of speculative mania and fraud are lumped together in this one volume with updated commentary and some modern day comparisons. The author covers these type incidences up to the crash of 1987 in the later part of the Reagan administration.The author makes the point that all of these mania, panics or crashes have similar components. They are all based on speculation and leveraging.The mania is attributed to basic insanity and the misguided notion that because someone is rich he must therefore be wise.\\"In the first forward to this volume, I told of my hope that business executives, the inhabitants of the financial world and the citizens of speculative mood, tendency or temptation might be reminded of the way that not only fools but quite a lot of other people are recurrently separated from their money in the moment of speculative euphoria. I am less certain than when I then wrote of the social and personal value of such a warning. Recurrent speculative insanity and the associated financial depravation and larger devastation are, I am persuaded, inherent in the system. Perhaps it is better that this be recognized and accepted.\\"There are two types of speculators who invariably get involved in these troublesome episodes or \\"bubbles.\\"\\"There are those who are persuaded that some new price-enhancing circumstance is in control, and they expect the market to stay up and go up, perhaps indefinitely. It is adjusting to a new situation, a new world of greatly, even infinitely increasing returns and resulting values. Then there are those, superficially more astute and generally fewer in number, who perceive or believe themselves to perceive the speculative mood of the moment. They are in to ride the upward wave; their particular genius, they are convinced, will allow them to get out before the speculation runs its course. They will get the maximum reward from the increase as it continues; they will be out before the eventual fall.\\"He points out that warnings about the temperamental nature of the present boom are never heeded and those who offer them are looked upon with derision.\\"In the winter of 1929, Paul M. Warburg, the most respected banker of his time and one of the founding parents of the Federal Reserve System spoke critically of the then current orgy ... and said that if it continued, there would ultimately be a disastrous collapse ... He was held to be obsolete in his views, \`he was sandbagging American prosperity.'\\"This danger of speaking out against the speculative orgy as it is taking place often makes the bearer of such tidings the accused when the bubble finally bursts. It is a lose/lose situation in Mr. Galbraith's estimation. Yet he points out that he did the same himself in 1986 ... to no avail and much acrimony.So the speculative bubbles come and go and are endemic to the capitalistic system according to the Professor. He also suggests that they are cyclical. They reoccur every twenty or thirty years. They are directly proportional to the amount of time necessary for the previous fiasco to be forgotten and a new generation of semi-educated fools take their positions in the financial community.\\"The circumstances that induce the current lapses into financial dementia have not changed in any truly operative fashion since the Tulipomania of 1636-1637. Individuals and institutions are captured by the wondrous satisfaction from accruing wealth. The associated illusion of insight is protected, in turn, by the oft noted public impression that intelligence, one's own and that of others, marches in close step with the possession of money...\\"The mistaken notion that since a person is rich he must be intelligent is emphasized over and over throughout the short text.So what is Mr. Galbraith's solution?\\"The only remedy, in fact, is an enhanced skepticism that would resolutely associate intelligence with the acquisition, the deployment, or, for that matter, the administration of large sums of money ... there is the possibility, even the likelihood, of self-approving and extravagantly error-prone behavior on the part of those closely associated with money ... a further rule is that when a mood of excitement pervades a market or surrounds an investment prospect, when there is a claim of unique opportunity based on special foresight, all sensible people should circle the wagons; it is the time for caution ... Yet beyond a better perception of the speculative tendency and process itself, there probably is not a great deal that can be done. Regulation outlawing financial incredulity or mass euphoria is not a practical possibility.\\"This conclusion I find very interesting and extremely disappointing. After all his great insight and explanation of the circumstances precipitating these speculative fiascos he closes with: Regulation outlawing financial incredulity or mass euphoria is not a practical possibility.This conclusion appears somewhat demented also. Mr. Galbraith, it appears, has completely forgotten that in most of these cases a crime was committed and that the euphoria involved was not inclusive of the masses, as he states, but of a select group of people within the masses reigning in the financial community.The Tulipomania is rather unique. It seems to be the perfect example of innocent mass insanity. But most of the other cases involve crime and criminal personalities not simply a massive delusion. There was swamp land in the 20's in Florida involving everyone's favorite con-man, Charles Ponzi. There were gold mines that didn't exist and were never worked or mined. There were worthless stocks and bonds and real criminals involved in the various scams.During the course of the book the author mentions that some of these individuals were punished with prison sentences or ostracized, and \\"justifiably so\\" says he.Instead of fraud he now seems to be defining the criminal behavior involved in each of these scandals as \\"inciting financial incredulity or mass euphoria\\" which, I agree, would be difficult to prosecute.Where is his outrage for the crimes and criminals involved?I find it interesting to note that if a man robs a corner store with a gun and steals one hundred dollars, he will most likely end up in prison. The man or the men who rob millions of innocent people of their assets through fraud and other criminal shenanigans are given an indifferent shrug by Mr. Galbraith. \\"Oh dear, what to do?\\" seems to be the gist of it.In our last scandal that nearly collapsed the economy of the entire world we clearly had criminal fraud, falsifying of documents, false testimony, false accounting procedures and figures and basic embezzlement.Most of us were victims yet not participants in the speculative mass euphoria - just as in 1929 and in other of these big financial calamities.We bought nothing and sold nothing. Yet when the final tabulations were given we lost tens of thousands, and some of us hundreds of thousands on our home equity and life savings. Our retirement pensions were looted.A property that was estimated before the euphoria at $125,000 may now be estimated at $50,000 or less.Because of the indulgences of the speculative euphoria in the financial and real estate sector we are all made to suffer and pay dearly. And the bandits are not even being pursued by a posse.It seems that this was the mindset of those involved. They knew they were acting criminally but made the calculation that as long as the majority in their industry participated in the crime, they would be in effect \\"too many to be prosecuted.\\"It now appears that they were correct. We have an obvious case here of \\"Crime and No Punishment.\\"This indicates to me that this criminal behavior is far from over. The thief who is successful in his thievery is encouraged to rob again. The next massive robbery seems to me to be just a matter of time and manipulation.At the beginning of this review I pointed out that Mr. Galbraith suggested that all of this business is inherent in the capitalist system - it is not only systemic but endemic. And now we find that it is also incurable and beyond regulation and justice.So then we are to sit back and periodically - every twenty years or so - let our wealthier sector rob us of all or part of whatever it is we thought to be our little nest egg or share in this great society. Crime on the part of certain groups among us is inevitable and any type of preventative attempt on the part of us or society is futile.If that is the reality of the capitalistic system, then maybe it is time to take a closer look at this capitalist system.This is like saying: Men will rape women. So girls, ready yourselves for the event and get used to it.This is very poor logic coming from a very intelligent man.I need a better solution than what the good Professor is offering here.Unfortunately, Mr. Galbraith died before this last economic disaster. I wish he lived to tell us his thoughts on this situation.Richard Edward Noble is a writer and author of: \\"Bloggin' Be My Life.\\""},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"John Kenneth Galbraith's short, literary book on financial speculation and the inevitability of subsequent economic catastrophe contends that devastating financial collapse is built into the free-enterprise system - an idea as intriguing today as it was when this book debuted in the mid-1990s. The late famous economist ended this treatise with a chilling question: \\"When will come the next great speculative episode and in what venue will it recur?\\" Everyone now knows the answer to that question all too well. Alarmingly, according to Galbraith, the travails that capitalist economies are now grimly experiencing will recur over and over. getAbstract suggests that anyone who wants to understand the kinks in the system - and human nature - that will continue to lead to hugely devastating, economic train wrecks should read Galbraith's book."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"For those in the market,this is the kind of book one needs to read to remind oneself of the madness, greed and temptation that is still so real in stock markets.Might be real handy read when those sensations start affecting in a frenzy rising market.Good , short and sharp book!"},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"A brief interesting, dare I say entertaining trip through the idiotic financial euphoria of the past...boy am I glad we aren't that stupid anymore, he said sarcastically.

The thing that happens is that people discover that they can increase their profits with leverage: if you own a $1.00 item that appreciates to $1.10, you make a $0.10 profit, but if you can add $9.00 of borrowed funds to your $1.00 and buy 10 items, you can multiply your gain by a factor of 10.Of course, the same thing works in reverse too: if the item drops to $0.90 you're completely wiped out, and if it drops to $0.80 whoever loaned you money gets pretty unhappy too. Given the obvious increased risk of taking on leverage, the key question is why people keep rediscovering the profit side of the equation and reforgetting the risk side. Galbraith has an answer: every new bubble includes a new form of the argument \\"this time it's different.\\" Here's the crucial observation: the very fact that people are saying \\"this time it's different\\" is what makes it exactly the same as every other time. The \\"new new thing,\\" the \\"long boom,\\" I-can-always-refinance-next-year, and so on, have historical analogs every few decades back as long as there's been finance. We really never learn.It's amazing how quickly the real estate bubble followed after the dot-com bubble, and how both of them occurred in an era when the pattern has been so perfectly analyzed and explained. This book was written before a lot of today's behavioral economics work; perhaps these new tools will finally point to how we can avoid the next event?

The 1990s tech bubble, which turned into the housing bubble, was just a classic case of a financial bubble.

The end result was always a financial depression that sometimes lasted for decades.Rather than head scratching about \\"what happened\\", which is also a classic response to the bubble bursting, reading a bit of economic history shows that this is nothing new, and that our generation and our nation is not immune from typical human economic behavior."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"The last page of Galbraith's book denotes that the mania of financial speculation always recurs and is inescapable in human history (P.110). Economists and policy-makers usually attribute the cause of a financial debacle to external influences such as ineffective regulatory mechanism to contain bubble-led investment activities and weakening in economic growth (P.85). By reviewing the major financial debacles of the last three centuries, Galbraith researches on common features of financial debacles and concludes that there are at least two key factors that trigger the debacle: the extreme brevity of the financial memory and the specious association of money and intelligence (P.13).This book is not lengthy but presents all classic cases since the 17th century including tulipomaina in Holland, Banque Royale in France, South Sea Company in England, and spectacular financial debacles in the US. To Galbraith, people have a very brief financial memory of no more than 20 years (P.87) This 20-year cycle from illusion to disillusion makes them forget lessons of the past and continue to invent highly-leveraged financial instruments without self-scrutiny and sanity. Moreover, people blindly believe that money is the measure of the intelligence that supports it (P.14). They applause acolytes of speculation and exclude any adverse opinion in order to justify the circumstances that can make them rich when a mood of optimism and excitement pervades in the financial market. The Schiller's dictum of crowd insanity has been inherent in human history for centuries (P.5).The renowned scientist Issac Newton has remarked that he can measure human motion but he cannot measure human folly. This book was published in the 90s but Galbraith's insights of financial insanity are still relevant to institutional and individual investors nowadays who tend not to be a scapegoat of the next financial crisis."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"This book explains how bubbles develop and crash; it was written in 1990 and it foretells our current mess.

Galbraith puts his inimitably elegant wit and articulacy at the service of the liberal outlook that I myself happen to share. I would not want to see the opposing party able to avail itself of comparable advocacy.This really is a \`short' history, only 100 or so pages. Its topic is recurrent, and seemingly ineradicable, stupidity. In Europe in the 17th century there was speculative frenzy over the introduction of -- can you believe this? - TULIPS. Not long after there was a similar stampede to participate in the hypothetical wealth of South American lands which the promoters neglected to mention were actually claimed by Spain. This was the famed South Sea Bubble, and there were some big names among its credulous participants. There was not only George Frederick Handel for one, there was also - can you now believe this? - Sir Isaac Newton. There is no point in a short review of a short and extremely readable book repeating the complete list. This latter example illustrates one of Galbraith's main points, namely that there is something about financial speculation that turns otherwise intelligent individuals, even men of true and colossal genius, into herds of lemmings. I dare say the Gadarene Swine in the gospel were similarly intent on making a fast shekel as they leapt to perdition over the cliff.The book dates from 1990, since when we have had first the dot-com bubble and now whatever it is that we have as I write this by way of an apotheosis of avaricious folly. This is another of Galbraith's points, that the whole gullible mentality is like some hardy perennial weed, more robust than any tulip. It springs up reinvigorated with practically every new generation, and there seems to be no field of human activity in which history makes itself heard so little with its clear and obvious lessons. Galbraith does not go so far as to say that there is nothing new under the sun, but he leaves no room for doubt that there is really no such thing as innovation when it comes to manipulating debt. If someone were to claim to have a new method of calculating the multiplication tables, presumably nobody would believe him. Similarly with leveraging, which is to say assets secured (if that is any word for it) on debt. It is all smoke and mirrors, but we never seem willing to learn, and the lofty denunciations that over the years have greeted the nay-sayers (to use a popular barbarism) such as Paul M Warburg are no doubt awaiting anybody who will, in years to come, dare to predict the totally predictable when it next comes round and dare to say that if we do exactly the same things, however we dress them up cosmetically, we should not expect a different outcome.This short book is aglow with its author's inimitable wit. You can almost open the book at any page randomly and find a gem or two. Galbraith's barbs are not cosmetic, to mix my metaphors a little. They are in support of his argument, and they are addressed to all of us, the great majority whose supposed wisdom is sometimes invoked when the usual disaster happens and the hunt is set off for individuals as scapegoats. It's all very well to blame it all on the Pied Piper, who is of course entirely guilty, but in this case his followers are free agents.This great sage has now left us, aged 98 and apparently still working on another book when the end came. The collective folly that he pillories here lives on. Dare we hope that his wisdom, never perhaps so well expressed, may live on and flourish as well?"},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book: it explained in simple and plain terms the origins of the major financial crisis over time.

It is a short study of the historical bursting of bubbles. John Galbraith is a renowned economist, and admits he can't predict when bubbles will burst, just that they will. The language you hear during the upward trend of bubbles is exactly the same - that \\"it\\" will never go down. People get into a frenzy or euphoric state and ignore that fact that the bubble will ultimately burst, as it always does. This book was written prior to the Stock Market crash of 1987, the dot com era, the more recent real estate bubble, which ultimately is the root of our current economic woes. This was a very quick read and I enjoyed it tremendously. A friend of mine lent me his copy to read a few years ago, and the recent crash of the real estate market led me to remember how much I enjoyed the book that I bought it for myself to reread."},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"\\"A Short History of Financial Euphoria: Financial Genius is Before the Fall\\" is a book that every financial manager must be required to read. Every financial company must have one copy in its library.The book is powerful in its explanation and predictions of financial speculative episodes. In eight brief chapters, (I wish I could do that), JK Galbraith describes the financial euphoria preceding major financial collapses starting with the Tulipomania in the Netherlands in the 1600s and ending with October 1987.All crashes have common features. First, and nearly always, is a reinvention of a financial instrument sold to investors as the blockbuster wealth-creator of all time. People buy into the instrument in herds, creating a speculative bubble, which in turn leads to \\"mass insanity.\\" Two speculative behaviors characterize all financial euphoria. One involves investors who believe the bubble will last forever. The second relates to those who know the bubble will ultimately burst, but contend \\"they will get the maximum reward from the increase as it continues; they will be out before the eventual fall\\" (p. 4).The two behaviors reinforce one another in two different, but related ways. Because of euphoric \\"mass insanity\\", there is always a strong belief in the unfailing ingenuity of financial geniuses. Partly because of such a belief, a dogmatic theology has emerged that condemns to Hell anyone who dares to caution against excessive speculation and mass euphoria. Critics are generally put down as unpatriotic and against capitalism. The consequence is a crash that \\"always ends not with whimper but with a bang\\" (p.5).Here is the common sequence of speculative episodes: Bubble, then \\"mass insanity\\", then euphoria, then crash, and finally \\"mass memory loss\\". The latter guarantees that there will be another episode just as severe or even more so.Highly recommended!Amavilah, AuthorModeling Determinants of Income in Embedded EconomiesISBN: 1600210465"},{"Title":"A Short History of Financial Euphoria (The Larger Agenda Series)","review":"The real value of this book is that it will hopefully serve as a reminder to the person who has read it when that person happens to find himself in a state of financial euphoria.

Through a complex dialogue, a rabbi-teacher reveals to his student the techniques of ascent, methods for traveling up through the heavens by means of recitation of hymns. The teacher gives vivid descriptions of the heavenly realm, filled with flaming chariots and a chorus of angels engaged in praising the deity.The emphasis in the text is on language, on the correct recitation of the words to achieve the ritual. The particular focus is on the divine Name, which can be employed in unusual ways. The author relates the structures of the text to linguistic ideologies. The complex structures of the text begin to unfold in light of the theories about the ritual function of language.The hymns include praise of the deity and occus magicae, words that have no semantic meaning, but draw attention to sounds of letters in God's name. Since God's name is used to create the world, the sounds of the name are creative, but the Name cannot be spoken. The hymns create a multiplicity of Name-equivalents, words that have the functional status of the divine Name and which can be employed in ritual. Voces magicae are not so much nonsense as they are logical extensions of the linguistic theory. The final chapter surveys recent theories of ritual language and then uses the conclusions from the study to refine the general issue of the relationship between the semantic meaning of words and their ritual efficacy.The dialogic structure of the text permits the reader to become the next student in a chain going back to the deity by means of Moses."},{"Title":"Principles and Development of Jewish Law: The Concepts and History of Rabbinic Jurisprudence from Its Inception to Modern Times","review":"I greatly enjoyed and heartily recommend Mendell Lewittes's _Jewish Law: An Introduction, and had this volume recommended to me as well.

It tells the story of a barber (Hayri) who was raped by his boss. Being very young and ignorant, he wants eye for an eye and plans on doing the same thing to the boss's son. He can't do anything but kills the kid by accident. He is then sentenced for death and spends years in prison waiting for the execution day to come. The life in prison is violent and hostile. He first suffers a lot but then learns the ways of dominating and oppressing others even before they become a threat.After a while, he meets with some people who are held seperately from the ordinary criminals. Those people happen to be he intellectuals and reformists of Turkey who are imprisoned because of their controversial ideas. They become friends and for the first time Hayri feels that there is also beauty and good in life, he learns how to think, how to use his judgement and how to forgive. Finally, when the time comes (it also happens to be the last execution in public), hundreds gather in an arena to celebrate the death of this monster, but is it the same man that they are hanging?I am one of the biggest fans of Aziz Nesin as a person and an author. This book is wonderfully written, very impressive and completely realistic. Despite the tragedy, you can still find traces of Nesin's satiric humor on many pages. It made me laugh and it made me burst into tears, especially at the end.

I bought this book with this specific purpose and I found that I had some of my questions answered, but there were many areas that I felt it could do much better.The book is divided in four parts: The Broader Context, The Technologies, Management Issues and Future Considerations.I found the Broader Context a bit too dry and not very useful. This part is mainly a list of current architecture, operating systems and benign statistics (such as government/non-government library systems parity). Most of the information is an enumeration of well known information and even a non-technical person would find little use in reading it.The Technologies part was more useful, ironically, in the non-technical sections that discussed library systems data structure (records, cataloguing, circulation files, indexes and search). The sections dedicated to technology were pretty useless in my view because they go into low level detail such as network cards, coaxial cable, twisted pair cable, XML and other technical elements. The problem is that the scope of these technologies is so wide (the authors talk either about a PC card or about satellites and ATMs) and because if you are a librarian you would not understand it and if you are a technical person you will find this too simplistic to be meaningfully useful. This part really, is not specific to library systems. If you have someone open those pages in front of you without you knowing what the book is about, you could suspect you read a popular manual about computer science.The Management Issues part suffers of the same problem: too much information about the obvious and too little on the real \\"management issues\\". For instance the authors talk about Usability of Systems spending quite a lot of space on issues like: web sites must be easy to find and access, be well formatted and edited and provide locally developed information. Some of the points are useful, but they are lost in a sea of trivia. To my disbelief, I found a sub-section dedicated to ergonomics issues (how chairs should be designed), backups and managing licenses, all under the same section called Managing Library Information Systems.Future Considerations continues, what seems to be a tradition already with this book: drown the subject into insignificant details. The authors talk about TCP/IP Everywhere, Peer to Peer Networking and XML and Web Services. Finally, the last section talks about Digital Libraries. Unfortunately this section lasts only ten pages, without giving you too much joy in learning something real about digital libraries.Overall, if you are patient you can get something out of this book if you are novice in either technology or in the business of library. The problem is that the book does not seem to align proactively to any project goal or have a practical purpose: if you are a librarian, you will find the pages that talk about technology confusing and unhelpful, unless you have a particular hobby and you are interested to know things like \\"what can a network card do in a library system\\". If you are a technical person you will not learn too much about the library systems and their business."},{"Title":"Orwell (Life & Times Series)","review":"Having read at least 8 excellent biographies in this Haus \\"Life and Times\\" series I was confident the publishers would select a prestigious English man-of-letters to describe Orwell's career and sum up why 62 years after his death the word \\"Orwellian\\" no longer needs an explanation.But for some reason they chose an obscure academic who writes about subjects no one cares about (the Suez crisis etc.) One needs only to skip to the last paragraph \\"Suddenly the Crystal Spirit is not so clear\\" to know this will be an annoying miopic egotistical read. With almost every career move or word Orwell published being dissected rather than appreciated this has to be one of the worst least sympathetic purported biogaphies ever printed. One can only assume he thought by dissing Orwell he might make a literary impact himself. Judging by the minimal reviews either side of the Atlantic it's safe to say Birmingham University made a huge mistake allowing an anti-Orwellian to lecture on their premises.The normal task of going through the same paces as 20 other Orwell biographers was obviously not enough for Mr. Lucas. Instead he decided this was his opportunity to point out the flaws in almost every Orwellian thought process, essay or novel. For instance in the James Joyce biography the writer spends 9 pages outlining the entire plot of \\"Ulysses\\". Lucas spends precisely 2 on \\"1984\\" and then moves on to what interests him - recounting and backing-up all the contemporary criticism of \\"1984\\". Why would readers want to know how many mediocrities failed to understand the true significance of a book which is NOW accepted as a timeless classic?The same goes for Orwell's most famous essay \\"Charles Dickens\\". An incredible writing marathon, with Orwell sitting for hours at an old fashioned typewriter - not to display his encyclopedic knowledge of every Dickens novel - but to seamlessly link a whole raft of illuminating (and humourous) explanations as to why Dickens was both our greatest popular author - and a hugely influential humanitarian. But Mr. Lucas knows better. He contends this essay was not written by Orwell about Dickens but \\"Orwell was recasting of himself through the elevation of Dickens\\". I.e. he was only writing self-promoting propaganda!The irony here must be apparent to all Orwell readers. A minor foreign academic (from his ivory tower) belittling one of the greatest minds England's ever produced sums up why Orwell spent his whole working life campaigning against pretentious commentators who never fought in the trenches.With so many great books written by people who personally knew Orwell it's obvious this small paperback stitched together by someone who knows nothing about Orwell's England has no value. The biggest irritation being this biographer is incapable of analysing how a journeymen writer (who never strayed far from England) could have so accurately predicted how and why certain \\"tendencies\\" would escalate to become ominous threats to the entire future of Western Civilization. Just a few of Orwell's predictions coming true - 60 years after his death.\\"Government Debt\\" is a euphemism for bureaucrats becoming so powerful their budgets cannot be controlled. Yet only in 2010 did we learn (for the first time) the economy of almost every Western country has been brought to its knees by CORRUPT BUREAUCRATS.Machines are so efficient year by year millions of human jobs are disappearing.As in Oceania promoting unsubstantiated FEAR keeps the proles' expectations permanently low. Expensive security measures and distant wars must be paid for with their taxes.Politicians are controlled by an anonymous faceless Inner Party. No legislation emancipates the proles. The only perceptable change is the rich (inner party) continue to get richer.Proles remain servile (non-revolutionary) if fed media garbage. I.e. computer generated music, porn, reality TV.Despite TV being in its infancy Orwell realized such devices would control us - not the other way round. Children are first brainwashed by TV. Subsequently their lives are dependant on de-humanizing computer-driven machines.I believe the reason Orwell virtually committed suicide writing \\"1984\\" was he had to set down on paper all his insights about how 2 tyrants could have extinguished millions of lives before and during WW2. And that they succeeded because they alone knew how to fully exploit the frailties of human nature. Like so many others Lucas does not recognize \\"1984\\" was never intended to be a conventional novel. The storyline was only a pretext for him to describe an imagined future society - and to insert the \\"Emmanuel Goldstein\\" section where he explains how it became this way. With just one outlet for his sense of humor - the inverted logic of Newspeak and doublethink.It came as no surprise Mr. Lucas's background prevented him connecting the obvious dots. Especially this one. Orwell told his publisher \\"I first thought of it in 1943\\". How long did Orwell work at the BBC? From 1941-1943. Does one need to be born in England to grasp \\"1984\\" could never have been written were it not for Orwell's brief exposure to British bureaucracy at the BBC? That Orwell was not describing communist or totalitarian rulers. He simply extrapolated the power structure he observed in London during WW2. His pre-programmed \\"imagination\\" then projected what our entire planet might become if senior bureaucrats could obtain absolute self-perpetuating power.Eric Blair may have made many miscalculations. But in my opinion any biographer who inserts petty nasty stuff about \\"secret lists\\" is not fit to kiss the hem of Orwell's corduroys. The train left the station a long long time ago. George Orwell is one of the greatest Englishmen who ever lived. Remind me again - who is Scott Lucas?I never like to write a negative review without ending on a positive note. Orwell fans can gain a full understanding of every aspect of the great man in \\"The World of George Orwell\\" published in 1971. Easily the best read as most of the 18 essays are contemporaneous."},{"Title":"Orwell (Life & Times Series)","review":"In my youth, after reading Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, I considered George Orwell to be that quintessential beacon of political conscience, that single moral compass, a man with a terrifying awareness of the evils of political subterfuge, a man who left us with an essential warning: be vigilant!A contribution to the Life & Times series, Orwell, by Professor Scott Lucas, is not so much another project of sentimental praise or hagiography of a writer, but a successful attempt at objectivity, revealing a novelist, essayist and critic of popular culture who, at the end of his life, collaborated with \\"Big Brother\\" (British Intelligence) naming names of communists that he believed posed a threat to British (western) democracy. This list of 36 men and women remains a secret, and the British authorities continue to hold on to the list in the name of national security. This is a major contradiction of the man, considering he was the author of Nineteen Eighty-Four.Lucas does not involve himself in petty character assassination, demolishing this twentieth century icon for some sort of personal, political or academic gain. In fact, Professor Lucas reinforces Orwell's \\"decency\\", a man of courageous sensibilities; however, his \\"Englishness\\" as the author points out, remained a staple throughout his writing career.For the most part, this short critical biography touches upon Orwell's major writings, analysing each in a fair and interesting manner. Most twentieth century critics believe Orwell to be an essayist, a political critic, more so than a novelist. I believe Lucas agrees with this assessment, though, when one re-reads, \`Down and Out in Paris and London', \`Homage to Catalonia', \`Animal Farm' or \`Nineteen Eighty-Four', would have to admit that his talent as a novelist, although not genius, is excellent.This is a highly polished work, extremely well written and insightful in terms of the author's goal of objectivity. As an admitted hero-worshiper, it was a learning experience to read a piece on Orwell that attempted to approach the subject from many perspectives, some good, some not so, without bias in any form.That said, my only criticism is that the book should be longer, unpacking a few arguments that required further elaboration, however, it is obvious that the author was under space constraints from his editors. Then again, without question, this is a minor quibble.Although there seems to be many works on George Orwell, and many excellent biographies, (\`Orwell: A Wintry Conscious of a Generation' is noteworthy) this one is surprisingly good: entertaining and educational."},{"Title":"The Fixed Period (The World's Classics)","review":"At the age of 65 and nearing the end of his life, Trollope was facing the inevitable decline in his health and awareness. It is not surprising, then, that in one of his last novels he would tackle the topic of old age and the impact that the elderly have on society.THE FIXED PERIOD stands unique in Trollope's oeuvre in many ways. It's one of the few, perhaps only of his novels told in a strictly first person view - it's set 100 years in the future, so it could marginally be considered sci-fi - and it uses satire and dark irony as it's impetus for communicating its point.In the vein of the infamous MODEST PROPOSAL of Jonathan Swift, Trollope here facetiously advocates for state-sponsored euthanasia. But, rather than writing this as a tongue-and-cheek essay, Trollope creates a story centered on a fictional future society, an offshoot of Britain called Britannula. The nation is presided over by President John Neverbend, whose memoir comprises the entire text of the novel.Thirty years prior to the start of the novel, during the formation of the nation, Neverbend created the concept of state-mandated euthanasia as a method to curb the impact that an aging population has on its youth. In the mind of Neverbend, death would now come not after years of senility at the tax-payers or childrens expense, but would rather be effected in a ceremony of dignity and national celebration of a life lived well, and terminated (at the age of 68) prior to the shameful degradation of old age. Of course, this pageantry is all merely a show to distract the public from what is essentially murder on the state-level. Neverbend later tours the tenements the \\"fixed\\" will occupy prior to their termination, and muses on how each additional set of apartments becomes less and less luxurious, and more rudimentary, hinting at the days to come when the procedure becomes less about \\"dignity\\" and more about the convenience of shuttling the old out of our way - if only Trollope could have seen how our society has essentially done the very same thing with today's nursing homes!In the initial chapter, Trollope (through Neverbend) explains the details of the procedure in a chillingly cold and efficient manner. From there, the story picks up as the first citizen is about to be submitted for termination, who happens to be his friend and proponent of the original law, Gabriel Crasweller. Neverbend is astonished to find that as the day for his \\"depositing\\" into the tenement approaches, the perfectly healthy Crasweller begins stalling and making excuses for why he needs \\"another year.\\" The early chapter in which Neverbend methodically explains to Crasweller the necessity of his \\"sacrifice\\" is indeed one of the most chilling this author ever penned - chilling in it cold logic, and particularly chilling to the modern-day reader who has seen in the intervening years the same logic employed by the Hitlers and Stalins and Milosevics of the world... Even more chilling, as the novel progresses, is Neverbend's increasing belief that, if Crasweller will not go willingly, he will have to be forced.The bulk of the novel follows the weeks leading up to the \\"fixed\\" day of Crasweller's confinement, as Neverbend faces increasing opposition from family, friends, and the very nation that he thought had fully supported his measure. The stage is set for an ideological and physical clash as the day arrives - will Neverbend succeed, or will other forces intervene and common sense be restored? By the novel's end, Trollope not only explores these issues, but also tackles Imperialism and Colonialism as the government of Britain involves itself in the situation.I noted Trollope set the novel 100 years in the future (1980), but imagining what a future society would look like isn't really the main purpose here. Trollope, of course, could only go by the \\"technology\\" of his day, so the few attempts he makes at such imaginings involve steam-powered bicycles and wire-based remote communications. Aside from these \\"innovations\\" (and an odd Cricket match played with mechanical bowlers), Trollope seems to think society will mostly run the same way as it does in his day, including fixed marriages ... which of course enable him to include his required \\"engagement story.\\"Again, with the time setting, Trollope wasn't really trying to write a novel of the future, so much as the 100 year removed setting allowed him to postulate a nation that had time to rise and declare independence from Britain, and where a mindset could have evolved to conceive such a radical idea. Remember, this was the 1880s, long before issues like euthanasia, abortion, and other controversial and divisive issues became everyday conversation.While it does have a story to tell, it certainly isn't as fleshed out as most of his other novels. But it is to his credit that even in its sparse 150 pages, these characters take on a believability as they react to the unique situation they find themselves in, particularly Crasweller. Whether or not Trollope intended any of this to be taken seriously, the World's Classic edition essay suggests the novel was written as a parallel to Trollope's efforts to bring about cremation as a standard practice in England, which itself was highly controversial in its day. As such, while it is doubtful Trollope truly wanted to invoke state-sponsored Euthanasia, still one can imagine Trollope poured a lot of his own frustrations into the character of Neverbend, who begins his quest seemingly with society's best interests in mind, but clearly falls into extreme pride as his ideas come under fire. Through the use of first-person perspective, Trollope gives us a unique understanding of and sympathy for a character that really should be considered a villain!The novel is a fascinating one, and highly recommended! Its various arguments haunt the reader long after the story fades into the background. I could easily write twice as much as I already have about it. It is unlike any other novel in his career, and one that has the potential to spark much debate in an age where issues like abortion and homosexuality have given rise to political factions who enact black-and-white laws, and later find themselves unable to enforce these laws - for, in the end, Trollope's best point in the book is that no issue can be reduced to a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" practice.
