He rebuts Rome in point after point while telling the very readable story of his life's work."},{"Title":"People's Padre","review":"I waited almost 50 years to read this interesting book. When I was 13-14 years old, this book was published in Phoenix where I was born. It was written by a former Franciscan priest who had married my parents and baptized me. The priest was loved for his compassion, aid to the poor of the area, and big personality. As soon as the book was published (or perhaps just before), our monsignor admonished our entire parish from the pulpit that no one was to read or purchase this book because it was written by an excommunicated priest. My mother, a devout Catholic, had always admired and respected this excommunicated priest--but she also followed the dictates of her religion explained by our parish leader.Fifty years later, when she was undergoing treatments for cancer and we were finding interesting books for her (she was 86, still worked every day and was antsy just resting at home), my mother said she'd love to read \\"The People's Padre,\\" and wondered if it was still in libraries. I located a used copy via Amazon and ordered it for her. She loved the book and said that for her it was a wonderful little history of Phoenix in the 30's and 40's when she was a young Catholic wife and mother. Soon thereafter I read the book and loved relating to the various locations and learning of the political climate I was unaware of because I was born in 1940 and too young to know some things. Since ordering that one book I think I have ordered five or six more, sending them to various former classmates. If you lived in Phoenix from the 30's through the 60's, you would find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"People's Padre","review":"This book went through more than 20 printings in ten years. Unfortunately, that means that Amazon Marketplace sellers felt it necessary to create new product pages for each one. The 1963 printing is the same as the 1960 printing is the same as the 1958 printing is the same as the 1954 first printing. Too bad Amazon can't combine these listings and give us a true picture of where it stands on the \\"best seller\\" list."},{"Title":"Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans","review":"It might not have the Greek, but it is outstanding in its use of doctrine.

A great Calvinistic commentary to be added to my library of over 15 commentaries on Romans."},{"Title":"Mother Roots: The Female Ancestors of Jesus","review":"The women's Sunday school class that I teach is enjoying this book study.

At the right time, these women appeared and made decisions that changed the future. They were empowered by God to step beyond the patriarchal structure on which they depended.

I am a high school student, and speeches have always scared me. However, when I began to read Don Aslett's book, I decided that maybe speeches are not so bad after all. This book offers tips on preparing your speech, how to dress, and even ways to &quot;recognize&quot; important people in the audience you are addressing. There is also advice on speech length, adding humor to your speech, visual aids, handouts, and more. At the end of each chapter some questions are included to make sure you paid attention, and understood it. I believe however, that the most important things about the book is that it helps you relax and have fun preparing and presenting your speech. I recommend this book especially to nervous and not-so-nervous high schoolers. It will definitely help you with your speech."},{"Title":"Problem Solving & Comprehension: A Short Course in Analytical Reasoning","review":"I have used Problem Solving and Comprehension since the early 1980's with student populations ranging from 9th graders preparing for the SAT/ACT to medical residents preparing for their boards. It serves well as a stand-alone text for individuals looking to improve their test-taking and problem-solving performance. However, It is really powerful when used with test-takers working in small groups, a group of two is best, in the interactive sessions described in the materials.I've also use Problem-Solving and Comprehension in faculty and staff development sessions to help them become better tutors/facilitators in the area of study skills and test taking. I would, and do, recommend this book to anyone trying to improve test-taking performance."},{"Title":"Problem Solving & Comprehension: A Short Course in Analytical Reasoning","review":"Very interactive read I really enjoy it.

(Millionaires of the Bible)","review":"I have used this book as a guide to keep me on track towards success for over 20 years. I think it's the best prosperity book ever written. It's especially good for people who are in the stages of life like Joshua's--feeling like they are wandering without direction, wondering when they will succeed and how they will do it. Ponder's advice is practical, comforting and inspiring. She tells you how to stay focused and keep planning to reach your goals, even when it seems like everything in life is resisting you or thwarting you. Then she explains the attitudes and actions that help you overcome the obstacles to achieving your goals. It really is a wonderful book. Also, Ponder is the only prosperity author whose books are all different from one another--each one takes a different perspective and adds depth and scope to your understanding, not just of prosperity, but also your health, yourself and all your relationships."},{"Title":"The Millionaire Joshua: His Prosperity Secrets for You!

I'm certain the book will benefit any that believe that positive thinking will make positive things happen, and that thinking happy thoughts will enable you to fly. There is a certain amount of truth to that, but the author claims to base her philosophies on the Bible and then exercises extreme creative license in her interpretation of the scripture. She in fact gives suggestions and direction that are in direct contradiction to it often enough that I felt her validity was compromised, and I won't purchase any of her other books in the \\"millionaires of the Bible\\" series."},{"Title":"Austrian Army of the Napoleonic Wars (1) : Infantry (Men-At-Arms Series, 176)","review":"The only disadvantage of this volume is that the Author tried to discuss literally all \\"foot\\" units, including irregulars, militia and volunteers (in my opinion - these units need to be treated in separate volume).

Its more than a cook book, its a baking course between 2 covers. I recommond it in the shelf of every beginner baker."},{"Title":"Great Cakes","review":"So far I've made the Browned Butter Cake and the Chocolate Sour Cream Cake, and they both came out great. I was about to give up on baking, until making these recipes. Her detailed instructions for every recipe, guarantees goodness."},{"Title":"Great Cakes","review":"There are an awful lot baking cook books available these days, but few are worth anything. This book is one of the few truly helpful books that actually shows you how to properly bake a cake. Many baking books feature a famous chef on the cover, along with casual recipe instructions and the admonition that this really is easy to do; usually, this is a lie. This book fills in all the details, and is really the only cake cook book you will need.Please note that this is not a \\"throw it together and bake\\" kind of cookbook; for these, I suggest books like The Fannie Farmer Baking Book, or Pillsbury's Best of the Bake-Off. The chapters are arranged like a textbook. The author expects you to systematically bake your way through each chapter in order, gaining skill and experience with each chapter. You are not suppose to skip around at random, picking out a few appealing recipes. The first chapter has pound cakes, the easiest; last chapter has European tortes and gateaux, the most difficult.It has chapters on ingredients, equipment, techniques, pound cakes, butter cakes, coffee / streusel cakes, cakes with fruit, sponge cakes, roulades, chiffon, angel food, american, cheesecakes, tortes and gateaux, filling, frosting, glazes, sauces and toppings, and decorations.The quality of the cakes are very high. When I need a high caliber Sacher Torte in a professional setting, the recipe comes from this book. It has a rare and complete recipe for Genoise. It is also one of the few books that insists on clarified butter for the Genoise (the only other one I can think of is Beranbaum's Cake Bible). The only real complaint I have is the suggestion to bang Genoise batter in the cake pan on the counter just before baking (never do this; better a couple of small holes in the finished cake than a deflated cake). Her recipe for chiffon cakes produces more loft than conventional procedures. I also wish the author would use the classic European names for the recipe titles; it would make looking up certain patissiere classics easier. The last section tells you how to match frostings and fillings to the cake, some valuable and hard to find recipes for glazes, and a definitive recipe for creme anglaise. There is also information on substituting different baking pans, and a sufficient amount of information about cake decorating for the home baker.The most vexing feature of this book is the format of the first part, which has critical information on tools, pantry, and techniques. This is a most important collection of information that is essential for baking, but is usually left out of most baking books. The bad part is that these three chapters do not have a listing of the subjects; if you need to find something, say how to fold an egg foam batter, you will have to leaf through the entire chapter to find it. All other chapters have a complete listing of recipes in the Table of Contents.One can disagree with the author on a few points: unbleached flour does not have a higher protein content than all-purpose (this is brand dependent), the silly notion of melting chocolate in a 225 degree oven, and not supplying the flour measurements in weight as well as volume (she describes sift, spoon, and sweep, which is about 3 1/2 oz when I tried it). I also dislike her idea to dump out excess flour when flouring a cake into the sink; since flour tends to clog drains, I do it over a garbage can. The section on suggested equipment is comprehensive: 30 different cake pans are listed, about a dozen categorized as essential, and 50 different tools, about half categorized as essential. The pantry chapter has a good dissertation on the important ingredients and what to do with them. The chapter on techniques gives complete instructions for all of the important baking tasks, such as how to handle butter and fats, beating eggs, folding batters, lining baking pans, bain-marie, telling when cakes are done baking (it differs greatly depending on cake type), de-panning cakes, storage, and a fascinating section on freezing. The metric conversion table for liquids in the Appendix is wrong."},{"Title":"Great Cakes","review":"Coveres: ingredients, equipments, procedures, pound cakes, buter cakes, nut cakes, cheesecakes, chiffon cakes, sponge cakes, fancy cakes, and low-fat cakes.Overall, this is a wonderful book. There are pages and pages of terrific explanations of ingredients and equipment and things to look out for. The explanations are all very clear. This is a great book for the beginnning cake baker. Even if you're intermediate, you can learn a lot from this book. I feel this is at a slightly lower level than &quot;the cake bible&quot;. Many of the cakes are really easy and fast, and I don't think that, in general, the decorating taught here is that fancy. On the other hand, I really like the parts on &quot;what can go wrong&quot; which are comprehensive for each type of cake. So it's a different type of book. There is a much bigger cheesecake section here than in the &quot;cake bible&quot; and low-fat cakes that aren't included there. Like &quot;the cake bible&quot; there aren't that many pictures - if you're looking for a coffee table book go elsewhere. This book deserved its James Beard award."},{"Title":"Great Cakes","review":"We thought this was going to be one of those &quot;gourmet&quot; cookbooks that are about worthless to the average cook.

The problem is that because they are good and easy cakes to bake-- some of us who may be better served with less sugar may throw that advice out in favor of say, the Fresh Fruit Pound Cake?And as a plus, you can play with the recipes-- add your own personal touches or flavors and not ruin, but rather enhance these cakes."},{"Title":"Great Cakes","review":"I love this book! I recently purchased this great book to improve my knowledge of cakes. Was I in for a terrific surpriseor what? This is the Best Cake book ever.First, Carole Walter gives us excellent and specific instructions on Ingredients, Equipment, Procedures and Techniques. She goes into precise but interesting detail on these subjects. The benefits of scales, sifters, cake pans and electric appliances are just to name a few. We learn how to melt chocolate, plump raisins and currants, and how to grate fresh citrus rinds, and much more. Honestly there were things I did not know about, and I was thankful that they were included.We are then taken into her vast world of Cakes. I never knew this many cakes existed. There are over a dozen different kinds of Pound Cakes. Tons of recipes for Plain Butter Cakes (my favorite). She also includes many recipes for Cakes w/Crunch, Cakes from the Garden (types of fruit cakes), 5 different Upside Down Cakes, Sponge Cakes, Chiffon Cakes, Cheese Cakes and the fanciest of all European Tortes and Gateaux. (You must try the Chocolate Genoise, it is to die for).Of course that is not all. She then gives us fillings, 16 different frostings, sauces, glazes, toppings and whipped creams. And if that is not enough, she even has cakes with reduced fat, and reduced cholesterol and the same for the frosting, sauces and syrups.This book has it all. This is a cake lovers dream. Ask my family. I have made approx. 20 different cakes, and each one has received a standing ovation. Ms. Walters recipes are simplistic and easy to follow. So kiss those cake mixes goodbye, and become the Cake Master today!"},{"Title":"Great Cakes","review":"This is a great book!

Even though I reviewed the book from an educational perspective, to my opinion the book is nothing more as a summary of topics; the authors have not succeeded in getting their 'thing' and experience transferred to the pages. There are better books and even better articles around (e.g. Gartner, Cimdata, Forrester, John Stark to name a few).So why 2 stars you might ask: well that's because the authors have included metrics and that's an important fact!"},{"Title":"Product Lifecycle Management","review":"This is excellent, seems to me that this is the first time when some one has put all the basics of PLM in one cover.As I see it, the real PLM problem or challenge is really not the PLM software implementation project. The real issue is to know what to implement! The concept of PLM is still much fuzzier than f. ex. the area of ERPs.In my company we discussed for ages about certain details of PLM, its contents and the selecting of the SW vendor. However the real big thing was that there were no clear goals for the whole PLM development project. I think we missed our opportunity here because all the discussions and the definitions of PLM were held in very different levels and everybody had very different understanding of PLMwithin our organization.We all should have read something like this before we launched our PLM initiative in our company. This book really gives you good and clear view into PLM. I recommend!"},{"Title":"Product Lifecycle Management","review":"This book was fine reading. I like this kind of business books; most important points are easy to pick, not too scientific, clear and lots of new ideas - it was a perfect fit for my current needs. (I'm a director responsible for business development in my company (manufacturing services SME) My business is to bring in new concepts to help our business and couple the possibilities of modern IT-systems to our processes.The book was very well written with good summaries at end of each chapter. One specific thing that I really appreciated was the point that the book as whole gives a good end-to-end view to the whole PLM area - from building a product strategy to supporting it in daily business with PLM information systems. And one other thing that I would like to point out is the use of terminology, it is so important; all terms are well explained in this book. After reading this it will be much easier for me to discuss about these matters with engineers etc."},{"Title":"Product Lifecycle Management","review":"My search for books on PLM concepts and philosophy led to this particular book. Frankly, apart from this one there are only two other books on the subject. One by Michael Grieves and the other by John Stark. Over the last 8 years, I have worked on the implementation and maintenance of PLM solutions i.e. the customization of the commercially available PLM product. So I was looking for more of a textbook on PLM which would explain the details/nuances of key functionalities of any PLM product such as item/structure management, product portfolio management, change management & workflow, configuration management and document management. I wanted to understand what these mean, how these are typically used by various customers thru examples.This book did explain those key functionalities viz. product structures, item/structure management and change management. But the book talks about PLM more from a strategic and management perspective. It clarified my understanding of the product process and order-delivery process. The challenges of product management in manufacturing and how PLM can help in meeting those challenges are explained very well by means of 3 case studies for different product types.I saw the value of the book in the excellent overview of a typical product lifecycle model and how the product and product management strategy is closely linked to the business strategy. With a good product management strategy implemented in a PLM solution, management should be able to take business decisions about launching, introducing new variants, discontinuing products based on the data from the PLM solution.I would say that this book is a must read for the senior management team viz. CEO, CIO, business unit owners, program and project managers, who are thinking about a PLM initiative in their company. It is essential for them to understand that a lot of home work has to be done by the organization itself to define a clear product management strategy, before they zero in on a commercial product and contract with a vendor to implement the PLM solution. Techies and novices to the world of PLM can read this to understand what PLM does and how it is used by the users in different organization verticals."},{"Title":"Product Lifecycle Management","review":"I liked the way the author has laid out the chapters, each covering the different components of PLM.

Anyone who wants to know the real Southern Africa - that is, the incredibly harsh yet enigmatic environment that thrived prior to both the Bantu and Colonial influences - will find this book a most satisfying introduction."},{"Title":"The Healing Land: The Bushmen and the Kalahari Desert","review":"Rupert Isaacson took an amazing journey when he went to the Kalahari to re-discover the colonial roots of his anscestors and found what he didn't expect--that his family had unwittingly contributed to the demise of a great and important people--the Bushmen. Upon meeting this hidden and displaced culture, he began a crusade to to right his inherited Karma. This book is the beginning of his journey of discovery of a remarkable people and their fight to survive in a world, that like many others, would choose to eliminate their indiginous peoples for money and power. He now, as I understand it, runs an organization called \\"The Indiginous Peoples Fund\\", helping the Bushman to reclaim their land rights and their culture. This book was the beginning of that journey. I hope h e writes a follow up book as he fight grows more successful.

I lived in town; Cynthia Huntington lived in a dune shack. In the book, Huntington gets to know not only the flora and fauna of the place, but also the history and people who have been there for generations. She also lucidly portrays two kinds of solitude: being alone with oneself, and being alone with another person in a remote place. Huntington's prose is clean, clear, and driven by the forces of real life. So is her poetry, which you should check out if you haven't already ('We Have Gone to the Beach,' 'The Fish-Wife')."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"You can tell that the author is also a poet because this book is very, very perfumy. Very, very detailed. A whole chapter almost on the trails that a sea gull makes. Beautifully written but very little context. Should have instead been made into a 5 page short story. Would love to meet this person and be friends with her though. She would make a great next door neighbor it seems! :) If you like Barbara Kingsolver style writing you will probably love this book but if you prefer the Memoir style writing of Joan Anderson of A Year by the Sea (also taking place on Cape Cod) this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"When I closed the last page of this book, I wanted to start at page one again. The Salt House is a beautiful, meditative work. Huntington has a true ability to distill life into its poetic essences. The semi-philosophical nature of the book makes it timeless, and therefore good for re-reading. If you like reading journals and letters, or if you are a lover of nature, this will be right up your alley."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"This book is destined to become a classic not only in the rich field of Cape Cod writing but in nature and memoir in general. Huntington's prose is simple and pure, evoking not only the outer landscape, but the inner landscape of a woman's mind. What a pleasure it is to be in a mind so generous, open, and curious about the world! This is a book I will read over and over."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a while. I have been on a nonfiction kick for a few months. As a college student I don't often have much time to devote to &quot;reading for pleasure&quot; but since I'm on vacation I've had a little time. Reading this book in February brought me right back to June and July. It's descriptions were wonderful and reminded me why I love the beach. The author's reflections on her relationships seem to echo my own feelings that I can't express. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the beach and enjoys being there by themself or with a loved one!"},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"This lovely, meditative book was given to me as a gift, and what a perfectly wonderful gift it has been. Ms. Huntington's attention to detail reminds me of Gilbert White's classic, The Natural History of Selborne. She writes with such intelligence and pathos that her subject illuminates the emotional and psychological landscapes within each of us."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"You must read this book! It's poetic and profound and full of energy. Huntington writes honestly and intimately, and her words will take you to a world of great beauty--she left me longing for this world. If you like nature writing or memoir writing you will not find a better book."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"I cannot believe how wonderful this book is. I've read it twice, and it's even more amazing the second time around. This is one of those books you'll want to revisit again and again. I look forward to reading more of Ms. Huntington's work."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"After meeting Cynthia at a writers' program, and finding her to be a lovely person, I decided to read her account of a summer on Cape Cod. I've always longed for such an escapade myself, so this was a vicarious experience of sorts.\\"The Sand House\\" is a joyous and often times humorous telling of the author's days in a small cottage near the Atlantic shoreline. The book focuses on the beauty of her surroundings--the plants, the wildlife, the birds--and on the realities of life in a constricted space with a loved one. The book's title is evocative, tangy and alive, romantic yet earthy. It suits Cynthia's writing perfectly. She is a poet of prose. Her words linger and dance, like cool breezes over the surf. She conjures wonderful images and ideas. She is abstract in her thinking, yet she grabs intangible concepts and wraps them in the sweaty language which humans understand.If you're looking for quick reading and plot-driven stories, look elsewhere. If, however, you long for tales of lazy summer days told in lyrical language, \\"The Salt House\\" is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"I often approach the books I read with a secret hope that one of them might change my life, or inspire one of those &quot;a-ha!&quot; moments in terms of self discovery and the world perceived, or, equally important, have some impact on my writing life. For me, The Salt House was such a book. Huntington writes about this particular landscape with such intimacy and insight, such attentiveness, that is moves beyond what is local to embrace what is universal in our relationships with ourselves and others, and with the places we call home. I can't say enough about this beautiful book."},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"I have never been to Cape Cod and would like to someday. I picked this book up since I won't be traveling anywhere this summer, so I thought I'd read up on a vacation spot and dream my way through this book. This book is beautifully written, very lush and descriptive writing. But it dragged in so many places for me because she tended to repeat herself over and over again, as if she's trying to rewrite a scene from memory using different words. While I appreciate that, it tends to get old after awhile. I ended up putting the book aside half way through and never went back to it. I just finished skimming the rest of the book and decided that perhaps when I am not busy chasing after two kids, I might appreciate it better when I actually have the time to savor the words and lush descriptions of the Salt House.However, I do appreciate her writing and I can actually visualize the sea, the birds that occupy the sand dunes and I can almost hear the roaring of the seas coming to shore as well as visualizing the endless sky where it meets the ocean at the horizon. I can imagine spending a summer in a tiny box of a place, alone with my spouse and right now, that sounds like heaven on earth.It is a beautiful book but needed to be shortened somewhat so it's not so wordy as it is. But that's just a mom's opinion. This is a book I would like to revisit in ten years or so to see if I can glean more understanding from the lyrical writing. If you have the time in the world to read this book, I would recommend it. If you are like me and are busy chasing after kids, appointments and whatnots, this book may not be for you because it really is a book that needs to be savored and enjoyed, not to rush through.6/29/08"},{"Title":"The Salt House: A Summer on the Dunes of Cape Cod","review":"While I admit I have not even gotten halfway through this book, it is perhaps best read at a leisurely rate. It is beautifully written and evocative of the beach and lovely summers. I can assure you, I will return to this book many times for future re-reads--my highest compliment to a book.Another book that The Salt House reminds me of is a favorite of mine--one of my top ten favorite books, entitled The Big House, by George Howe Colt. Both deal with personal insights and long, languoring summers spent at Cape Cod. Both are worth the reader's time and effort."},{"Title":"LAPD: Patrol, Swat, Air Support, K-9, Crash, and Homicide (Power Series)","review":"LAPD is one of the greatest Motorbooks I ever read (and I read and have a lot of Motorbooks).Unlike some Motorbooks, LAPD is a reader...not something you can read overnight. It took me a few days because it's pretty heavy on text...and a bit depressing too to see such rampant crime in a city.Samuel Katz is truly a professional author and the way he describes information in this book is outstanding...every sentence is information, almost every page a case story.Sam Katz also wrote &quot;LAPD SWAT&quot; in a 1997 Popular Mechanics issue and a Concord &quot;Special Operations Journal #1&quot; but his Motorbooks expands and covers many facets of LAPD. This Motorbooks is/ has the full story. Popular Mechanic's SWAT article doesn't.Reading the book, you get a sense of how large and apparently dangerous LA really is. The book covers all the above sections but unlike some Motorbooks, Sam Katz doesn't just tell you what the cops do, but how, why, when, where, and for what reason. It's similar to a journal of where he went with whom...just like the &quot;COPS&quot; TV show from start to arrest. Sam keeps his opinions to a minimum and let's the cops do the talking which is refreshing since Sam is a visitor to the city of LA and LAPD.Each section gets it's fair shake of information and presentation. Sam isn't biased. He doesn't spotlight SWAT and downplay K-9 for instance. Best of all, the photos are mainly action and go with the case stories Sam went along for the ride. Like Concord's book you'll see actual SWAT busts with Sam snapping the camera, K-9 posing for Sam, Sam's in the helicopter shooting photos, etc. The photos are not something pulled from a file and captioned &quot;LAPD.&quot; There are some photos of weapons and vehicles but most is about the people and the cases. This is not a &quot;LAPD Equipment and Vehicle&quot; reference book but more of a &quot;what happened crime-wise this 1997 week in LA?&quot; journal.Also, Sam's been many places with LAPD and the book takes you along. From the wealthy &quot;too loud&quot; parties in Hollywood to the dangers of Nickerson Gardens Projects in 77th Area. From Venice beach with its problems to the skies over LA tracking a carjacker.All true battle stories about real cops and their suspects. The dialogue isn't filtered...only the swear words are bleeped out. The cops talk and so do the suspects...Sam writes their quotes all down in the book, preserving it for history and telling you the reader what the cops and suspects think.A must read about the best cops in a dangerous city. One of the best Motorbooks I have. Worth every penny in text and photos."},{"Title":"LAPD: Patrol, Swat, Air Support, K-9, Crash, and Homicide (Power Series)","review":"Finally--a book that tells the true story of the brave men and women who protect and serve the citizens of Los Angeles.

This books is a must read."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"I tholugt biography would be more comprehensive. It is a secondary biographymeaning it relies primarily on secondary sources and has very little of primarysources. It is written more for the lay audience. One does nlot get a very goodpicture of Stevens, the man, the politician, and the political leader.I also thought the paperback was way over priced."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"Hans Trefousse has done a magnificent job in portraying the &quot;Great Commoner&quot; and his effect on the United States. In fact, the book inspired myself and some other people in Gettysburg to start the Thaddeus Stevens Society to promote his memory. For information about the society, write The Thaddeus Stevens Society, 65 W. Middle Street, Gettysburg, PA 17325 or email me at rhetrick@gettysburg.edu."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"I want to thank Hans L Tredousse for a remarkable job on the unfolding of the character of one of the most complex individuals I have ever studied. Trefousse does a great job of showing us as much of what is humanly possible to know about Thaddeus Stevens.By far, Stevens comes alive in the preface of Trefousse'account. The reader is pulled gently into the life of this individal because of the hardships he experienced as a child and because of his determination to see justice prevailed.As I progressed into the book, I marvelled at both the strengths and weaknesses of this complex man called Thaddeus Stevens. Personally, I think he was a man before his times. It is unfortunate that he considered himself a failure. We have had many presidents in recent years who could not or would not acknowledge that they had achieved anything of &quot;real tangible worth&quot;. Stevens comes to the end of life feeling that he had achieved very little of lasting value. It is truly worth lamenting! If Stevens could come back to this century, I think he would be astonished to see what legacy he left the United States and particular minorities who have benefitted much from his efforts to support emancipation and a true Reconstruction for those who had suffered because of slavery.I was first introduced to Thaddeus Stevens in Lerone Bennett's BEFORE THE MAYFLOWER. I found Stevens to be the underdog, but an all powerful hero for the rights of equality. I think the second best thing to having enjoyed Trefousse' outling the work of Stevens would be to see the book made into historical fiction. Somewhere out there in &quot;fantasy land&quot; is an actor who could bring more to &quot;life&quot; this complex man called Thaddeus Stevens"},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"Hans L. Trefousse wrote a definitive biography on this great Republican that helped initiated the Reconstruction period after the post-Civil War period. The sub-titled: 19th Century Egalitarian proves to be an aptly named since Stevens proves to be one of the foremost egalitarians of his century. The book clears up the myths and misconceptions that Stevens were often regarded in and set the records straight. Well written, nicely researched and with superbly insights, I can only wished that the book went even deeper into Stevens' life.The book also goes into Stevens' strengths, weaknesses and his troubles. I thought it was a honest effort on the part of the author to showed the reader the complete man and the account of Stevens' life proves to be balance and fair.One of the more interesting aspects of this book lies within the struggled between Stevens and Andrew Johnson. The fight between \\"reconstruction of the south\\" to the \\"restoration of the south\\". This struggle had far reaching consequences in our nation's politics as well as racial relationship. Although product of his time and era, Stevens proves to be far ahead of himself in terms of race relations. It was interesting to learned that his concerns lies not only with the blacks but also toward Indians and Orientals. The book reflects accurately in the end that Stevens was a true egalitarian in the truest form."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"Thaddeus Stevens casts a long shadow in American History; a shadow that continues to bedevil the likes of Robert Bork, Anton Scalia and the so-called &quot;original intent&quot; crowd.Stevens, the tactical leader of the &quot;radical Republicans&quot; through the Civil War and Reconstruction era stands probably second to only James Madison in Constitutional history.Considering his historical role a thorough biography has been long overdue. Trefousse has gone a long way toward supplying a fresh biography of the man. In its pages he has applied the extensive depth of modern scholarship now available on the reconstruction era.Only Fawne Brodie has attempted a biography in recent times and that book, Thaddeus Stevens: Scourge of the South has slid thankfully out of print.The Trefousse biography will likely be the standard source on the life of &quot;the old Commoner&quot; for some decades to come."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"As I suspect will be the case with most people finding this book, I was introduced to Thaddeus Stevens via the Spielberg film &#34;Lincoln&#34;. Not a usual history buff, I knew the basics of the Lincoln story, but had never heard of Stevens, who came across as a hero of the film.This book must be understood to be a political biography. You will get only the barest bit of information on Steven's life before politics, and virtually no mention of any aspect of his personal life outside the political venue. I finished reading with a definite understanding of his political mind, but not really feeling that I knew the man. I would have liked a more human biography. More anecdotes of his life and wry humor.The book is also written for those who have a better foundation in American history than my own high school level. There were many places where I had to pull up a Wikipedia article on one subject or another to follow the book, because Trefousse assumes that the reader knows some things which, to my chagrin, I did not."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"I have. of course, been aware of Thaddeus Stevens in a general sense for quite awhile. Abolitionist, radical Republican, and thorn in the side of Abraham Lincoln and others. I was intrigued by the character played by Tommie Lee Jones in the movie \\"Lincoln,\\" so sought out a biography to learn more about this historical figure. I purchased this work.I see this as an effective biography. It is not terribly long, but we get a great deal of insight into Stevens--from birth to death. He was born with a deformity in his foot, but never let that deter him. He could be cynical and harsh in his treatment of those with whom he disagreed--but he could also be generous.His political career began at the local level, where he was active in politics in Gettysburg and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. One of the intriguing features in his life was that he and James Buchanan (Pennsylvania's only President of the United States) were both residents of Lancaster at one point--and quite opposed on issue after issue. He used his quixotic anti-Mason position to try to enhance his influence within politics, with somewhat mixed results.He moved onto the national scene by being elected to the U. S. House of Representatives relatively late in his life. And here, he became a major figure in national politics. He assumed key positions on a number of committees over his service in the House. The book lays out his relationship with Lincoln nicely--as well as his hostility toward President Andrew Johnson (he was one of the leaders of the attempt to impeach and remove from office Johnson).There are questions raised in this book about Stevens' motivations from time to time. For instance, he had an iron business, and strove to build a railroad with government funds to support its work. The furnace seemed generally to be running in the red (Confederates delighted in wrecking it as they moved toward Gettysburg).The book is stolidly written. Too many chapters covering his political career end with a statement something like: He didn't achieve all of his goals, but he did have an effect. I'm not sure that so many chapters need to end with the same evaluation. It handles certain sensitive issues (such as his relationship with Lydia Smith) with discretion, not going beyond what the author knows as the facts. In the end, this is a book that introduces us nicely to Thaddeus Stevens and his world."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"Was Thaddeus Stevens a hero or destructive nemesis? Clearly, he was a controversial icon, and a person I admire tremendously.This balanced biography follows his early career as a lawyer, to his role in the push for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. Historians lack any esteeming values for Thaddeus Stevens, Congressional leader of the Radical Republicans during Reconstruction. Despite his devoted career as a distinguished attorney, Pennsylvania legislator, and entrepreneur, Stevens is remembered more for his desire to punish the former Confederate states before readmitting them to the Union.He was more of an egalitarian, dynamic orator, and a staunch opponent of slavery... perhaps a common human with the strength of moral conviction, partly inspired as a result of an early childhood illness which left him physically impaired and with hair loss.How telling about America those individuals such as Thaddeus Stevens remain expunged from historical curricula in our basic educational institutions. It only seems fitting that certain lies, frauds and deceitful types have gained notority and recognition... many with references as \\"Founders\\".I seriously doubt if most Americans ever heard of this man, but ALL really aught to."},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"Saw Lincoln the film and wanted to learn more about Thaddeus Stevens.Detailed but at the same time easy to read.

A bit dry -- reads more like a text book but I learned a lot. Knew very little about this man but after seeing Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal in LINCOLN, I had to learn more. Would have loved if the book contained a bit more of Steven's actual speeches and cutting comments. Writing not up to the quality of Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of the must read &#34;A TEAM OF RIVALS.&#34;"},{"Title":"Thaddeus Stevens","review":"Trefousse captures this historical figure with all his uniqueness.

So the topic of this novel is right up my medieval alley. And I would say the author of this book is quite knowledgeable about King Harold and his arch-nemesis William. But I had some trouble getting my literary head around the changes in view point. Just as I was getting into the Saxon and Norman mindset, the author would make a reference to his own times ((19th century). In order for any fiction to work, the author must assist the readers in their suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help when the author keeps reminding the reader that this is only fiction by continually dragging them back to modern-day reality.I appreciate all the research that went into this book. I also appreciate the effort of making the writing style fit the topic.

Just like some other reviewers, I became a Harold fan (and frankly, the telling is favorable to him). It's a tragic tale with ironic twists and intrigues, and in this telling there's a little bit of harmless mysticism thrown in. In the end I was blown away by this $3 book. This story would make a fantastic modern film, perhaps including this little bit of mysticism. [Hollywood would have to resist the temptation to have skeletons rise up and go to battle, or to have warriors leaping 30 feet into the air.

All the essays (with a couple exceptions) are well thought-out explications and critiques of viewpoints of Romantic poems and poets which require considerable exertion of mind to comprehend. The exceptions occur in essays where the writers are too dismissive of certain poets and poems and fail to exert THEIR minds, possibly because of incapacity. Such is the case when F.R. Leavis dismisses the first lines of Shelley's towering, contemplative poem &quot;Mount Blanc&quot; (along with all the rest of Shelley's poetry, one might add) as &quot;...insortably and indistinguishably confused.&quot; The lines in question: &quot;The everlasting universe of things flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, now dark-now glittering-now reflecting gloom-now lending splendour, where from secret springs the source of human thought its tribute brings of waters-with a sound but half its own...&quot; These first few lines of the great poem are not that hard to make sense of if one but puts forth half an effort: The contemplative human mind is the passive recepient of all it perceives (i.e., the everlasting universe of things) which like a great river in different parts of its course will exhibit differing reflections and imaginings; whereas the mind, &quot;the source of human thought&quot; is but a tributary to this great river, &quot;with a sound but half its own.&quot; In other words, mere human thoughts pale in comparison to the torrent of impressions (i.e., the everlasting universe of things) flowing through the mind. But Leavis had his mind made up, and it is doubtful he even gave the poem a chance, such was his animus for Shelley, as evinced in the rest of his essay-But there, C.S. Lewis in his essay in defense of Shelley offers a fine riposte, &quot;I address myself, of course, only to those who are prepared, by toleration of the theme, to let the poem have a fair hearing. For those who are not, we can only say that they may doubtless be very worthy people, but they have no place in the European tradition.&quot;-Ouch!-And also Pottle in his fine essay, &quot;The Case of Shelley,&quot; attributes such dismissals as that of Mr. Leavis to &quot;...the very human but unregenerate passion for bullying other people.&quot; OK, I've said more than enough for the prospective reader to get an idea of what this book is about: the continuing battle over what the Romantics are all about and what they mean to us, if anything. I, personally, would hope the reader would come away from this book with a refreshed notion of how precious and indispensable they are to our appreciation of all poetry and, moreover, to this life itself."},{"Title":"ENGLISH ROMANTIC POETS; MODERN ESSAYS IN CRITICISM","review":"This work edited by M.H.

Gleckner, Harold Bloom write on Blake. Basil Willey, Carlos Baker, Charles Williams, Lionel Trilling on Wordsworth. George McLean Harper , G. W. Knight, Humphrey House on Coleridge. T.S. Eliot, Ronald Bottrall,Ernest J.Lovell Jr. on Byron. C.S. Lewis, F. B.Leavis, Frederick A. Pottle, Donald Davie on Shelley. Douglas Bush, W.Jackson Bate, Cleanth Brooks, Earl Wasserman, Richard H. Fogle on Keats.Among the essays I took special interest in was Lionel Trilling 's on Wordsworth 's 'Immortality Ode' Trilling attempts to show that the poem is not as is often supposed about Wordsworth decline in powers as a poet.It is not about a 'natural and inevitable warfare' between the faculty of Poetry, and the faculty by which general ideas are apprehended. It is rather more about the mature vision, the new way of seeing which comes with Age and Experience. It is about a kind of double- vision in which the visionary gleam given in childhood is not fled, but rather remembered; the legacy of childhood is not lost but rather incorporated into the more sober vision given in and with age. \\" To have once have had the visionary gleam of the perfect union of self and the universe is essential to and definitive of our human nature, and in that sense is connected with the making of poetry.But the visionary gleam is not in itself the poetry- making power, and its diminution is right and inevitable.\\" It is rather incorporated into the larger apprehension of reality which comes with the mature vision. There is Trilling indicates a sorrow with the shift in vision, with a motion from almost exclusive emphasis on Nature to one in which the Moral law and relations with Man become central. The Ode as Trilling understands it is as much about the celebration of new powers that come to the Poet with age as it is about the falling off of certain childhood ones. Trilling too hints the Ode as a transformation from what Keats called Wordsworth 's mode of the 'egotistical sublime' to one to a mode of 'tragedy.'Thus he reads the great concluding lines ,' To me the meanest flower that blows can give/ Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears' as Wordsworth's acknowledgment of the inevitable sorrowful element of life.This group of essays is a tremendously rich body of perception and reflection on what is undoubtedly one of the great bodies of poetic work in world literature."},{"Title":"ENGLISH ROMANTIC POETS; MODERN ESSAYS IN CRITICISM","review":"This collection of essays represents a field of perspectives so widely diverse and, in many cases, antipathetical, that it really amounts to too much for a short review like this to give it its full due.-The apt alternative: to give a brief description of the book, and then pick a couple excerpts from essays I like or dislike in the book and explain why.-First of all, the book is not for the shallow-minded. All the essays (with a couple exceptions) are well thought-out explications and critiques of viewpoints of Romantic poems and poets which require considerable exertion of mind to comprehend. The exceptions occur in essays where the writers are too dismissive of certain poets and poems and fail to exert THEIR minds, possibly because of incapacity. Such is the case when F.R. Leavis dismisses the first lines of Shelley's towering, contemplative poem &quot;Mount Blanc&quot; (along with all the rest of Shelley's poetry, one might add) as &quot;...insortably and indistinguishably confused.&quot; The lines in question: &quot;The everlasting universe of things flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves, now dark-now glittering-now reflecting gloom-now lending splendour, where from secret springs the source of human thought its tribute brings of waters-with a sound but half its own...&quot; These first few lines of the great poem are not that hard to make sense of if one but puts forth half an effort: The contemplative human mind is the passive recepient of all it perceives (i.e., the everlasting universe of things) which like a great river in different parts of its course will exhibit differing reflections and imaginings; whereas the mind, &quot;the source of human thought&quot; is but a tributary to this great river, &quot;with a sound but half its own.&quot; In other words, mere human thoughts pale in comparison to the torrent of impressions (i.e., the everlasting universe of things) flowing through the mind. But Leavis had his mind made up, and it is doubtful he even gave the poem a chance, such was his animus for Shelley, as evinced in the rest of his essay-But there, C.S. Lewis in his essay in defense of Shelley offers a fine riposte, &quot;I address myself, of course, only to those who are prepared, by toleration of the theme, to let the poem have a fair hearing. For those who are not, we can only say that they may doubtless be very worthy people, but they have no place in the European tradition.&quot;-Ouch!-And also Pottle in his fine essay, &quot;The Case of Shelley,&quot; attributes such dismissals as that of Mr. Leavis to &quot;...the very human but unregenerate passion for bullying other people.&quot; OK, I've said more than enough for the prospective reader to get an idea of what this book is about: the continuing battle over what the Romantics are all about and what they mean to us, if anything. I, personally, would hope the reader would come away from this book with a refreshed notion of how precious and indispensable they are to our appreciation of all poetry and, moreover, to this life itself."},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","review":"The book is fabulous! I read the book after reading an excerpt in RealSimple magazine and was not disappointed. The range of lives and dogs in this book makes it sure to appeal to every dog lover... because let's face it, we all like to read about \\"our\\" dog. There are pound princesses and pure pred princes, small dachshunds and gangly danes. And the lives of these women are very motivational. It provided a fun glimpse into the lives of authors, their families, their funny dog stories, some sad bits - because no dog lives long enough, and so everyday tales that remind you why you like dogs in the first place.One of my favorites was a chapter entitled \\"Seven Reasons Not to Get a Dog\\" about a person who breaks every rule. There's another on the legal aspect of pack-dogs on city streets, and yet another about a dog who misses a long-gone boyfriend to the extent that he rushes to every pickup truck with a male driver in hopes of creating a parent-trap-esque reunion.This is a great, peaceful, enjoyable book I am recommending to any and everyone - men included!"},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","review":"Woman's Best Friend was a great collection of short stories about dogs. I loved the realistic nature of the book as not all the stories were about how great, smart or funny each woman's dog was. In fact there are a couple sad stories that remind you that dogs are ultimately animals with instincts and breed characteristics and some times they aren't a woman's best friend. I loved the thumbnail photos of the dogs within the short stories so you could really envision them in their setting. The story \\"First Born\\" by Lisa Vollmer was one that resonated with me in particular and would with any woman who considers her dog to be part of her family. Highly recommended for anyone - male or female - who has had a dog make an impact on their life."},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","review":"This book was given to me recently when I became a dog mom for the first time.

One of the best aspects of this book is the wide range of story types presented. Some, such as \\"The Truth about Cops and Dogs,\\" are informative (and infuriating), while others, such as \\"Sage the Hollywood Dog\\" are sentimental and pack a great emotional punch. Many of the stories are humorous, and illuminate the comedic side of dog ownership. The funniest story, in my opinion, is \\"My Dog Speaks English,\\" in which the author gives her dog its own voice to convince other people to do her bidding. If you are a dog lover, you will certainly enjoy meeting the dogs the talented authors bring to life on every page."},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","review":"26 different stories of women and the dogs who have touched their lives in one way or another.

Judgemental types like me might grind their teeth at some of these owner's behaviors/irresponsibilities, but you'll find yourself somewhere in this book.

Also, each of the writers had very different stories so I did not feel like I was reading the same story from chapter to chapter. As another reviewer stated, I also appreciated the fact that these stories were not overly sappy. Although I did appreciate that the stories definitely seemed true, I was shocked that one writer actually admitted to beating her dog, following her sister's advice. In the same realm, although I appreciated the writer's honesty, I could not believe that a writer actually wrote that she did not miss her dog once it passed away. I just did not feel that these stories should have been included in a book titled \\"Woman's Best Friend\\". Otherwise, I enjoyed the book very much and would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","review":"bought this for a single gal, with a dog, for christmas. i didn't read it, but just the few exerpts i did, looked funny and heartwarming."},{"Title":"Woman's Best Friend: Women Writers on the Dogs in Their Lives","review":"Bought it as a gift for my wife - a dog lover.

A rollicking ride through a comedy of errors and flakes."},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"Is this the only book on the 1962 New York Mets? It seems so and Jimmy Breslin did a pretty good job. At least his book is better than that lousy expansion team of 1962 with 40 wins and 120 losses. Is it written well? I would say better than Marvelous Marv Throneberry at first base for that dreadful 1962 team. The book takes you through from the beginning -- the need for a team in New York in the National League after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants cut out for the west coast. It's all pretty interesting, although we hear Breslin committed a few errors of his own in producing the book. Like the title of the book is an invented quote from manager Casey Stengel. Like the first run against the Mets was not scored on a balk, but actually a base-hit by Stan Musial. Oh well, the team he was writing about committed far more errors in that first year of play. Do I recommend the book? You betcha. Has as much flavor as a Kahn's hot dog. Pass me a Rheingold and enjoy the book. Amazing!"},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"There have been many benchmarks for sports futility. The 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers were 0-14 in their inaugural season. The 2008 Detroit Lions were 0-16. The 1973 Philadelphia 76'ers won only nine games. But the 1962 New York Mets seem to be the standard for incompetence.Maybe it was the carnival atmosphere surrounding this first year juggernaut. Or maybe it was the way they seemed to be laughing at themselves as they spun further into the cellar.Jimmy Breslin has graced every type of writing he put his writing hand to, and sports is at the top. Although a thin tome (117 pages), it left this reader begging for more.I wanted more Casey Stengell witticisms, as he oscillated between exasperation and dead on humor at his predicament. I wanted more Marv Throneberry anti-hero tales. I wanted to read more about the battered and bruised, but ultimately noble pitching trio of Roger Craig, Larry Bearnearth and Al Jackson.The interesting thing is that this team spawned some of the great baseball minds of the generation to come. Gil Hodges managed the Mets to the 1969 World Series. Roger Craig became a pitching coach par excellance, and an excellent manager. Al Jackson was a pitching coach for many years.This was a team that New York fell in love with. They were decent, family people, who respected and genuinely liked each other. They just weren't any good, and their creativity in finding ways to lose games was off the charts.They were the only major league team to play .250 ball over a whole season, and more amazingly, they won 9 of 12 games in one stretch, meaning the rest of their season they went 31-117.Breslin nails the scoundrels of the National League on how they forced the sewerage of the dregs of every organization on the Mets. His writing is hilarious at times, and this was a story that was begging to told.Any baby boomer baseball fan would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"An outstanding sports writer did an outstanding job of capturing the essence of the first year of New York Met baseball.For those of us who lived through that magnificent demonstration of ineptness, we can recall how easy it was to follow the antics of a team that lost three times for every time that they won but found new and improbable ways to do so almost every day.Breslin captures the hilarity that characterized the efforts of this team to play a game that was not as new to them as it sometimes seemed to be. The reader also feels the pain of some of the top players of the sport who ended their careers in something less than glory that year.The reader for whom this is history will enjoy this crisply written story and learn the names of some of the heros of that first year who may not have left marks on the game of baseball but certainly left more than a few smudges.Still as good a sports read as the day it was written."},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"Jimmy Breslin, really, wrote only one book which ought to be required reading for anyone, even if they do not appreciate immediately the sublime, ridiculous, and surreal that was the 1962 New York Mets. Of every page and paragraph I have ever read of that wonderfully absurdist gathering of once-upon-a-times and never-would-have-beens known as the Amazin' Mets, none strikes with quite the humour and humanity of Mr. Breslin's gracefully murderous review of that first season. He gave all the heavies - Casey Stengel, Marvelous Marv Throneberry, Roger Craig, Elio Chacon, Harry Chiti (read: the only player in major league history to be traded for himself), Frank Thomas (the Big Donkey, not the Big Hurt), et. al. - both their just desserts and their poetic justice. He writes with the proper distribution of sympatico toward both the Mets' befuddled opponents and their bewildered observers. And he reminds baseball fans that sometimes the most transcendent joy of the game is when the name of the game is pure madness.Those who believe baseball needs to improve its sense of humour should adore this book. Those who cannot believe the 1962 Mets existed but in the warped imaginations of New York sportswriters and sociopolitical commentators trying to make sense of the unsensible should disabuse themselves with this book. Each will likely do one of two things, by the time Mr. Breslin's lyric prose completes its song of the broken road: Either you will empathise with their very real soulfulness amidst the months of Barnumesque deconstruction that was Original Met Baseball; or, you will simply rub your eyes, ponder how it could have been and who could have possibly conceived such bedlam, and, even when it makes sense, and you realise it was all of it true and none of it likely to ever pass our way again, just purr along with Perfesser Stengel: &quot;Amazin'!&quot;"},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"Last week, the Dodgers came to Shea Stadium. There's not a ballplayer left alive, except Jesse Orosco, who was born before the Dodgers left Brooklyn, but the residual anti-Dodger resentment which inhabits the ugly orange, blue, green and red seats at Shea still makes these games interesting. The score was tied, 1-1 in the 6th, and LA had runners at first and third, with one out. The batter hit a ground ball to Mets SS Rey Sanchez, less known for his .179 batting average than for reportedly getting a haircut in the clubhouse while the Mets getting clobbered in another loss. Sanchez needed to do just two thing with that grounder, which was too slow to turn into a double play. He needed to A) look the runner back to third and prevent the go-ahead run from scoring, and B) throw the batter out at first.Sanchez, of course, failed to do either.The runner on third scored (the winning run) and the batter was safe. Sound familiar?Jimmy Breslin's 1963 magazine-feature-length rumination on the woeful 1962 Mets (who lost 120 games -- more than the 1985 and '86 Mets lost *combined*) has fallen out of the baseball consciousness for a while. But it's still hilarious. The book is both a celebration of the underdog, and a scathing review of the National League's expansion process, which allowed for the creation of a new team full of players who simply couldn't play.It takes a while for Breslin to actually get into game descriptions. He talks at length about the building of Shea Stadium (which, true to Mets form, was completed a year late, and way, way over budget) -- \\"which they are building... for Marvin Throneberry\\". He talks about original Mets owner Joan Whitney Payson (be warned that, since this book was written in 1963, she's still referred to as Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson without any sense of irony), and reprints some of manager Casey Stengel's unforgettable monologues. He talks about the business of baseball, even in 1963 lamenting that too many were in it for the money, and not for the love of the game.Finally, Breslin gets to his recap of the Mets season, and gets it wrong from the very first inning. He repeats -- actually, he creates -- the myth that the first run scored against the Mets in their first game, in St. Louis, came in when pitcher Roger Craig balked with runner Bill White on third. Well, that never happened. It happened, but it was already 1-0 at that point and White wasn't on third. Since Breslin makes a big fetish of his scorecard later in the book, I have to assume this is dramatic license.Breslin's book is now 40 years old, but if you went into a time capsule in '63 and came out again this April, you'd never realize that, for most of their history, the Mets were not actually this horrible. When I have the choice of watching the Mets (who, in mid-May have already lost 60% of their games), or re-reading the epic saga of Pumpsie Green... well, just give me some more Pumpsie!"},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"For years author Jimmy Breslin claimed that \\"Can't anybody here play this game?\\" was an actual quote from New York Met manager Casey Stengel. Then several years later in another book that he wrote, Breslin admitted he had made up the quote. When I read his book \\"Can't Anybody Here Play This Game,\\" I got the impression he used this same approach in writing it. Not that the book isn't mostly true, but what he wrote was for effect. It appeared to me that he wanted to inject a lot of humor and light-heartedness and not necessarily provide a well-rounded description of the season where that would detract from his intended perspective.That the first run that the 1962 Mets allowed in a regular season game was scored on a balk makes for a great story and is so in line with the Mets image of whimsical ineptness. Breslin?s description of how the balk occurred- who was pitching, who was on base, that the pitcher dropped the ball while trying to pitch- made me believe that that was what happened. But that wasn?t what happened. Later I read on the Internet (and I confirmed it by listening to the original audio broadcast of the game) that the first run scored off the Mets was on a bloop single by Stan Musial. Sometimes fact is not stranger than fiction.I admit when I read the book I was disappointed- particularly during the first half of the book. I was hoping to read a book providing lots of insight and information about the Mets first season of baseball- such as what Stanley Cohen's wonderful book \\"A Magic Summer\\" does for the 1969 Mets. But that's not with this book is all about. It's really more about the Met mystique of the early years as lovable losers. And that mystique is something special about Met history.The point of this book review isn't to recommend the book or not (it is a very popular book), but it is to help the potential reader avoid having erroneous expectations."},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"How bad were the 1962 New York Mets? Let Jimmy Breslin count the ways. The Gotham City columnist tells the story of the baseball team's inaugural season in this 1963 book that left me with a few laughs and a sour taste in my mouth.Breslin here is like the best man at a wedding who does the dinner speech about the groom's sexual misadventures, who keeps going after everyone else realizes he's spent too much time polishing his act at the bar. Breslin can't get enough of telling you how bad the team is, telling stories of questionable veracity in order to serve his need for cruel punchlines about this or that player's total ineptitude. It's a one-note performance that gets tiring long before this short book is over, but Breslin never notices.One Met in particular draws Breslin's notice so much it makes you squirm. \\"Marvelous Marv was holding down first base. This is like saying Willie Sutton works at your bank.\\" \\"Marvin Throneberry's teammates would have given him a cake for his birthday except they were afraid he would drop it.\\" Or quoting Ralph Houk: \\"If he ever played that way for me, I'd of killed him with my bare hands.\\"There aren't a lot of quotes in \\"Can't Anybody Here Play This Game?\\" and those you get seem suspiciously jewel-cut as zingers for one of Breslin's stories. I'm not saying the guy made it all up. The Mets did lose 120 games in 1962, a modern major league record that still stands, and they did so in some mind-boggling ways, several of which Breslin no doubt got right. But there's a validity that's missing here.Breslin never gets past the ridicule to get at the heart of what the Mets were about that first year, why they drew nearly a million fans to the disintegrating Polo Grounds and inspired such bizarre and merry glee. The best Breslin manages to offer is they're like the chipped table you wouldn't trade for a new one because you're used to it already, never mind in 1962 the Mets were the new table, chipped or not.Another problem with the book is that it is written almost exclusively for New Yorkers of the early 1960s, who already knew the story and didn't need to have the facts established. He doesn't bother explaining who Joe E. Lewis was, or Toots Shor, because you're supposed to know. They weren't Mets, by the way, but nightlife figures Breslin was friendly with and wanted to say hello to by giving each a page in his book.Occasionally he says something funny, or poignant. Breslin tends to do this when he rambles long enough, and his declamatory-as-a-slammed-door prose certainly has readability and bite. He offers a terrific strand of thought on how following baseball makes you realize how fast time passes as you get older, noting his surprise about how fast Gil Hodges went from promising rookie to broken-down legend. There's good information about the Mets' origin after the Giants and Dodgers left New York City, and I enjoyed Breslin calling Walter O'Malley to account for his mendacious greed.But for the most part Breslin's targets aren't the wealthy or powerful; but a band of luckless journeymen who discovered winning wasn't everything when it came to creating a legend for their fans. It's a story worth telling; unfortunately Breslin can't get past roasting them for easy yucks and leaves the human factor out of the equation."},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"The paperback reissue of Jimmy Breslin's CAN'T ANYBODY HERE PLAY THIS GAME? is 117 pages, plus appendices. A photo section that accompanies the original hardcover edition has been deleted.For a taste of this highly enjoyable reminsicence of a legendary team's first season (1962), here's a couple of quotes from Chapter 1. Whether they're literal or invented by the author is for you to decide.In 1961, the newly-organized expansion team hired Rogers Hornsby to scout both leagues to see what players would be available. All clubs had to give up two men each to the new Mets and Colt 45s.Rajah worked from his home base in Chicago. Seeing American League games wasn't a problem as the White Sox played mostly at night, but all of the Cubs games were in the afternoon, and this was cutting heavily into Hornsby's time for racetrack plunging, a real annoyance for him.Here's a comment about other clubs' possible castoffs that Hornsby made one Wrigley Field afternoon:\\"They say we're going to get players out of a grab bag. From what I seen, it's going to be a garbage bag. Ain't nobody got fat off eating out of the garbage, and that's just what the Mets is going to have to do. This is terrible. I mean, this is really going to be bad.\\"So tell us what you REALLY think, Raj!Was he ever right! Their first season, the NY Mets lost 120 games, doing so in the most creatively colorful way in baseball history.On the occasion of his 73rd birthday, manager Casey Stengel drew thoughtfully on a cigarette, sipped a Manhattan at a hotel bar and recalled a particularly shocking game. He told of bringing a catcher up from Syracuse who could possibly control action on the basepath against a steal-intensive Dodgers club:\\"...I don't want to be embarrassed. So we bring him and he is going to throw out these runners.\\"We come in there and you never seen anything like it in your life. I find I got a defensive catcher, only who can't catch the ball. The pitcher throws. Wild pitch. Throws again. Passed ball. Throws again. Oops! The ball drops out of the glove. And all the time I am dizzy on account of these runners running around in circles on me and so forth.\\"Makes a man think.

Maybe that's why I didn't find myself laughing out loud as I read it. It was one of those books on my \\"Will Someday Read List.\\" The Mets of 1962, as many baseball fans know, were horrible, a collection of over-the-hill veterans and cast-offs who combined to win just 40 games in a 160-game season. The stories about \\"Marvelous\\" Marv Throneberry and his failure to touch not only third base but second base after hitting a triple are told here, and of course, there's all sorts of stuff about manager Casey Stengel, the Mets' septugenarian manager, who dispenses goofy wisdom to the masses and seems resigned to having on his hands a very bad team. Breslin tells us how the Mets originated after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants left for California following the 1957 season, and an attorney named Bill Shea set into motion efforts to bring a National League team back to New York. This is okay, even if it deviates a bit from all the fun stories from the ball field. I guess I was hoping to find out just what made this team so memorable. And to tell you the truth, other than the fact that the club was terrible, were the players any more colorful than any other Major League team? I don't think so. It had more to do with a club in New York somehow getting as much attention for its inept play as its mighty American League rivals across town - the Yankees - and the media there deciding to run with something that could prove amusing to readers. Timing is everything is life, and New York can magnify it."},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"Breslin's tells the story of the year the Mets were founded, the people behind the business side and the heartbreaking but very humorous details of 140 losses in this first year. There are characters that only a novelist could create, but they were, in fact, real ball players who couldn't play the game. The book is a nostalgic trip to a simpler time in baseball, to long gone stadiums (the Polo Grounds) and players. A fun, funny and enlightening book to read"},{"Title":"Can't anybody here play this game?","review":"Like most books published in the 1960s and early 1970s meant for popular consumption, this one was poorly written. It is punctuated with badly outdated slang-phrases leaving you feeling embarrassed for the author. Written in that 'anything goes' style, it meanders around like a drunkard's walk. Actual details and anecdotes about the Mets' goofs are sparse. Worst of all, Breslin fails to create ANY likeable traits in ANY of the characters. I'm gonna have to charge him with an ERROR here."},{"Title":"The Whole of the Moon","review":"This book, about a teenage boy suffering from cancer, is absolutely outstanding. Duncan Stuart delivers a flawless story about finding out about life the hard way. &quot;The Whole Of The Moon&quot;, explores pain and tragedy in a way that few books do. Not only is Kirk, the main character, suffering from a physical disease, but he has to deal with the harsh realities of life and adolescence. This book is one of the few I've read that tackles the issue of cancer from a believable teenage perspective. It's by far one of the best I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Whole of the Moon","review":"Me dejo un pensamiento que me hizo reflexionar sobre la importancia que tiene la vida y el estar sanos, y que apesar de todo puedes encontrar ayuda en donde menos te imaginas."},{"Title":"The Whole of the Moon","review":"Their is no way to describe this totally touching book you just have to read it!!!IT is realistic and deals with issues many teenagers may face.It is emotional and funny and beautifully written.I couldnt put it down and read it over and over!!!"},{"Title":"2025 : Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped by Science and Technology","review":"&quot;The future is now present,&quot; claims Bill Clinton. We need to &quot;honor the past&quot; and &quot;imagine the future.&quot; Here is a book that helps millennial planners do the later part well.Coates is a regular feature at World Future Society conferences. Last year I heard him give an 8-part lecture series last year on scenarios of life and business in 2025, and later bought the cassette series.Now he and his colleagues have brought out the book on the subject. It taps the worlds of science, technology, and engineering to look at the thirty year period of 1995 to 2025. Written in the form of a history book in 2025, Coates gives fifteen scenarios which reflect what life will be like in the United States as well as other societies (both affluent and less prosperous).* Smart Living / house and home of the future * Information: The Global Commodity / integration of telecommunications * Harvesting the Fruit of Genetics / biotechnology * Powering Three Worlds /energy technology and efficiency * The World of Things/ materials technology * Working Toward a Sustainable World /environmental strategies and tools * Managing the Planet/ macroengineering the environment * Putting Space to Work /cooperation and commercialization of space * Our Built World/ infrastructure and construction * People and Things on the Move / transportation * The World of Production / custom manufacturing * A Quest for Variety and Sufficiency / food and agriculture * Striving for Good Health / disease prevention and life enhancement * Our Days and Our Lives / quality of life movement * Balancing Work and Leisure / lifestyle and entertainmentOne added feature to *2025* is that at the end of each chapter, Coates lists the &quot;Critical Developments, 1990-2025,&quot; plus the &quot;Unrealized Hopes and Fears&quot; of each field he covers.*2025* is the best information rich and researched mid-range scenario for the future I have read. It also is enjoyable reading. I have sharing bits and pieces with my son ! and daughter who will be 41 and 39 in the year 2025. They get a kick out of hearing about computer &quot;knowbots,&quot; toys made with &quot;smart materials,&quot; or machine &quot;language coaches.&quot; But *2025* is far deeper than just a preview of future gadgets.This book could be a veritable field guide to your next 30 years, especially if you are in business, an entrepreneur, a person responsible for planning, or engaged in scientific and technical issues.I am using it right now as a help in writing radio commercials which illustrate futures thinking for upcoming millennial celebrations."},{"Title":"2025 : Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped by Science and Technology","review":"The prediction of future events or trends has always been of interest, not only from a popular point of view but also from a business/financial one. If one can obtain a fairly clear assessment or forecast of future developments, one can leverage against or for those developments. The authors of this book want to give the reader an overview of what the world will be like in the year 2025, which is now only two decades away. Two decades may seem like a somewhat short period of time, if judged purely by the ticking of clocks or wristwatches. If however one views it from the standpoint of the ticks of the clock of the dynamical system of scientific and technological change, it is a very long period of time. If one views the last century in blocks of twenty years, one will find that an incredible amount of scientific and technological has occurred between one block and the next. Even more importantly, many of these developments were unanticipated, in spite of concentrated efforts to predict them.This is not to say that efforts to predict or at least understand future developments are unimportant or misguided. The anticipation, if not prediction, of future developments is important in that what is predicted can actually have an affect on a what actually happens in the time frame at issue. Indeed, the branch of learning theory called \`anticipatory systems' is concerned with the extent to which the results of modeling or predictions can influence the time evolution of a particular system. The results in this theory have had only limited influence on forecasting in the popular or semi-popular literature, as this book is clearly an example of. The predictions or forecasts in this book however may motivate some to actually bring them about, or even to attempt to correct the course of events if certain predictions do not reach fruition. This is particularly true, and of major importance to financial institutions. It is of less importance to scientific researchers, who are quite myopic or even completely disinterested in future developments. Sitting in between these two extremes is the curious person or the polymath, who both enjoy speculating on the future.Making an objective assessment of the content of this book will entail that the reader have a strong background in many different fields, even though the authors have attempted to make the book accessible to a general audience. One could perhaps read the book passively, i.e. without really attempting to assess whether the predictions are plausible or violate established scientific principles, but this would probably result in extreme boredom on the part of the reader. The authors point to developments in information, materials, and energy technology, and in genetic engineering, all of these fields quite extensive in themselves. In addition to these developments, the authors believe that environmentalism will stimulate some of the developments in these fields.Given the current political configuration of the world, one would expect that future changes will affect each country differently, and in some cases the affects will be extremely traumatic. The authors realize this, and have dissected the world of 2025 into three population groups. One of these, called \`World 1', includes the affluent nations of Europe, the United States (the authors assume, interestingly, that the nations of World 1 will actually be named as such in 2025). Another, called \`World 2', contains the majority of the world's population; while \`World 3' is made up of regions or nations that are very destitute. The needs of each of these \`worlds' will influence those of another, and this feedback will drive even more change. This (global) viewpoint is actually quite refreshing, and has proven to be an accurate one given the trends in globalization that have taken place since this book was published (1997).As the authors explain, the book had its origins in research in a private think tank that specialized in the study of the future. Such a specialized function in a private firm entails that it provide more scientific approaches than what might appear in a popular book on futurism. The authors therefore use more exacting language, such as distinguishing between a \`forecast', which does not allude to a particular time or place in the future, and a \`prediction', which makes a quantitative statement about a future outcome. And conforming to an essentially reductionist approach, they construct fifteen \`scenarios' for 2025 that are based on 107 assumptions that they made about the future. These assumptions are encapsulated into \`high-probability' statements, but they also give a list of developments that they consider will have a \\"somewhat lower probability\\" of coming to fruition in 2025. They do not however calculate these probabilities explicitly, and so it is really a subjective assessment of the likelihood that they will occur. Some of them seem very plausible (again a subjective assessment), and others seem extremely unlikely.Of all the technologies discussed throughout this book, nanotechnology is given sparse treatment. This is surprising if judged by the current hype concerning nanotechnology, and the irrational fears that many have expressed in its contemplation. The authors believe that self-assembling nanomachines will exist in 2025, but their abilities will be too slow to be practical in commercial manufacturing. They refer to nanotechnology as an \\"unfulfilled promise\\" in 2025.And what of artificial intelligence, another of the current technologies where predictions have been extremely optimistic? The authors predict the use of \\"knowbots\\" for news filtering, the routine use of machines to do medical diagnostics, triage systems for health-care institutions, and totally automated factories. But here the authors are overly pessimistic in their predictions, for these technologies exist now, twenty years ahead of where they thought they would be.Genetic engineering has also proved to be advancing at a rate much more than the authors had anticipated. Transgenic plants and animals, genetically engineered viruses, and the widespread cultivation of genetically modified crops are a reality at the present time."},{"Title":"2025 : Scenarios of US and Global Society Reshaped by Science and Technology","review":"This book looked very promising; the format and premise of a history book written from the year 2025. Unfortunately, the book is so superficial in its treatment of the subjects that I found myself falling asleep whenever I attempted to read it. The book reads like a collection of facts or sidebars; there are no stories, fiction or non, to pull you through the chapters. Read Probable Tomorrows instead."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"Having made about thirty different trips into the Ventana wilderness over the last several years using this great guide book, I've come to appreciate the authors maps. Regular topographic maps from the USGS do not show many trails in the Ventana or inaccuratly shown. The author has plotted the trails in detail onto USGS topos (shrunk to book size which means you must look closely, but you can still discern every contour clearly). The trail descriptions are as detailed and informative as one can expect for a book this old. Fires, El Nino's and withdrawal of funds for trail maintenance inevitably change the accuracy of Schaeffers descriptions. Nevertheless there are still many useful descriptions and comments. If you are serious about exploring this rugged widerness, the book would be well worth it for its maps alone."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"Big Sur has some wonderful hiking trails, and this book provides very good, detailed descriptions of most of them. Because it was published several years ago, however, and some of the trails have been damaged in storms over the past few years, some of its information is now inaccurate, even with the several-page addendum at the back of the book. For example, the trail to Mount Manuel is &quot;closed&quot; -- though I understand that people still occasionally hike it. Also, during a recent visit, we were unable to cross the Big Sur River in order to hike the spectacular-looking Panorama and Hidden Trails in Andrew Molera State Park. There was no bridge and no place to ford without considerable risk of mishap, a state of affairs the book doesn't seem to consider. Of course, these inaccuracies are the fault of Mother Nature rather than of the author, and any hiker who isn't prepared for less-than-ideal trail conditions probably shouldn't be hiking in the first place. Nevertheless, to be really useful to hikers, the book should be updated yet again.I share another reviewer's frustration with the topo maps near the back of the book. They're a bit hard to use because many of the trails, even the shorter trails, run onto several pages, making it necessary to flip back and forth between pages. The topos also have tiny print, undoubtedly a consequence of having to scale them down to the book's size. There must be a way to include more hiker-friendly maps -- even hand-drawn, trail-specific maps of the kind found in the Lonely Planet guides, while not providing much topographic detail, would help hikers get more of the &quot;big picture&quot; of a trail's length and proximity to roads and other trails.All in all a good guide to a delightful region."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"I first purchased Mr. Shaffer's book back in '94 and have jokingly referred to it as &quot;The Liar's Guide to Hiking the Ventana Wilderness&quot;. I found the book fairly accurate for the more popular trails (Carmel River Trail, Pine Ridge Trail, Skinner's Ridge), but somewhat misleading for the lesser-traveled trails. The book is in SEVERE need of updating to correct some of the inaccuracies and mainly, because over 100,000 acres in the heart of Ventana were scorched in the Kirk Complex/Tassajarra fires of 1999. The fires resulted in many of the trails being burnt almost out of existence or severly damaged. Despite its shortcomings, however, the book is worth it for first-timers wishing to hike Ventana."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"This book is the only detailed guide to the Ventana wilderness. It is very difficult to follow and you definitely sense that it has not been updated since 1987. The topo maps in back are hard to read and you constantly have to flip back and forth to see where you are going. I give it a 4 because it is the only book out there, but in terms of usability it is a 1. My advice: buy the book and call the ranger station to get the skinny before heading out into the wilderness. Also, I will definitely refrain from pointing out my favorite hiking destination...it is a jewel."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"I bought this for my son and his wife who live in Colorado and when they come out here always have to take in the Big Sur area. There are few pictures, but if you google Big Sur Bike Rides you will find great photos taken by bikers."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"I purchased the recently updated version of Shaffer's book, but having recently hiked in the Big Sur area, I can confirm the book is still riddled with basic mistakes. These mistakes aren't of a rudimenary nature, but significant misstatements of fact, such as where to locate a trailhead, how far each hike is and where to park your vehicle. On several hikes, Schaffer describes a &quot;locked gate&quot; which hikers must traverse... oops, sorry... there is no gate there anymore and no access for hikers. This can be extremely frustrating to plan a morning hike and rely upon this guide, only to be misled and have the hike aborted before it even begins.In addition, the book is organized in an extremely frustrating manner. Distances are given, but no elevation gains or indication of whether the trek will be easy, moderate or strenuous. This is an inexcusable omission. The only reason to buy this guide is because good hiking books on the Big Sur region are few and far between. I use Schaffer because it's the only guide out there, but it has many serious deficiencies. Know this before you purchase it and don't expect a stellar guide. Also be aware of the errors in trailhead directions and outdated material."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"I thought that this book was very useful.

Put simply, I plan to hike the trails that this book introduces."},{"Title":"Hiking the Big Sur Country: The Ventana Wilderness","review":"I just finished a weekend hike in the Ventana wilderness. Granted, I did a lot of stupid things. But I got 18 hours of rain! I was trapped between two rivers that had risen over 6 feet in 24 hours. My down sleeping bag was soaked. Temperatures were dropping into the 40s at night. I thought I was going to die. Did this book give me any hint that there was this kind of danger? No. It makes no mention of radical changes in the environment due to weather. It mentions steady-state danger conditions for other rivers (Carmel, Big Sur and Little Sur. These the are the same ones that the Forest Service mentions, btw. Here it says that they can be impassable in the winter) but nothing about other ones. At least *some* of the narrative is correct.But for a place as rugged as the Ventana Wilderness, a book without discussion of the dangers is simply inexcusable. If this is our only source, it's no wonder there's such a high number of plaques to a &quot;Loving husband and father&quot; on some of the trails."},{"Title":"General, Organic, And Biological Chemistry, Third Edition Study Guide And Solutions Manual","review":"This book is highlighted and has writing in some areas.

It was very informative, but challenging for that level. Driedger takes a thematic approach to church history. So this book is better for understanding who and where the Catholic Church is now than as a comprehensive survey of church history. In fact, it would be helpful to know the basics of Christian history before you delve into this text. The author's religious approach is open minded. She presents the official teachings without being too fundamentalist or rigid. Once the reader gets used to the author's style, this book has much to offer for understanding the contemporary Catholic Church."},{"Title":"The Church: Our Story: Catholic Tradtion, Mission, and Practice","review":"This text is a helpful introduction to Catholicism.

Above all, this novel is really well-written. \\"The Farce\\" is a work of literary fiction that is economical in its words,rich in its style, evocative and eloquent."},{"Title":"The Farce","review":"I read this book at the same time I read Oriana Fallaci's The Rage and the Pride. At the time Fallaci's book made a bigger impact, but this book has a quiet strength in it that has made it endure in my memory while the Fallaci book has kind of disappeared. The understated brilliance of this book's examination of the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu and its effect on a journalist living with his family in Bucharest is difficult to summarize but the concrete details and warmth of the narration make the book impossible to either forget or to categorize. The ending has left me wondering for a month or two -- as the new age takes over from Marxism as the reigning ideology of the new regime. Farcical, indeed. I'd like to read more of this author."},{"Title":"Siegfried Odermatt & Rosmarie Tissi: Graphic design (German Edition)","review":"This book presents a comprehensive overview of work from a two-person graphic design team based in Switzerland.

Based on the good reviews, I assumed it would be a wholesome story. Instead, I learn that Frances sings terrible, mean songs about her little sister and her friend \\"Fat\\" Albert. I skip the words to those songs, as I don't even want to plant the seed of such unkindness in my son's mind. Additionally, some of the boys in the books exclude the girls from a game of baseball, saying that it's not a game for \\"girls.\\" Maybe I'm just overly sensitive, but such thinking is so antiquated that even to have it mentioned is offensive to me, and it's an idea that I don't want my son to have. I realize that maybe eventually I'll have to deal with such gender wars and ideas of prejudice (gender, weight, age, etc.), but I don't think it's appropriate for a three-year-old. He doesn't have any idea yet not to like people for such petty reasons; why would I want him to get the idea that it's okay to feel that way?? Even if the characters in the Frances books ultimately redeem themselves, the seed of hateful thought will have already been planted in my loving little man. No thanks, Frances."},{"Title":"Best Friends For Francis","review":"My family is fairly unanimous that this is our favorite Frances book (with &quot;A Birthday For Frances&quot; the likely runner up.) Frances both stands up to being excluded and learns not to do the same thing herself; her anger at Albert is realistic and her &quot;revenge&quot; funny but not cruel; and everyone resolves their conflicts in a friendly way. The wording of the exchanges between Frances and Albert is exquisitely well done, I think: Hoban expresses such nuances in language that gets through to even small children. And last but not least, Frances's little songs are always hilarious and this book has some of the best ones of all, which my 2-year-old daughter has learned by heart."},{"Title":"Best Friends For Francis","review":"Another great book from the Frances series by Russell Hoban. In this episode, Frances's friend Albert is not very interested in playing with her, especially because she is a girl, so Frances turns to her sister Gloria for a playmate. When Frances and Gloria plan a \\"best friends\\" outing complete with an enormous picnic lunch, Albert reconsiders the wisdom of not being friends with girls. I like this one both for the positive development of the sometimes-difficult relationship between Frances and her little sister Gloria, but also for the portrayal of girls who like to play baseball and catch frogs."},{"Title":"Best Friends For Francis","review":"You can't go wrong with a Russell Hoban Frances book for young children.

In this one, Frances won't play with her younger sister Gloria because Gloria is too small to catch and bat a ball. But when Frances tries to play with her friend Albert, he says it's a no-girls game and won't let her play. This makes Frances appreciate the friendship of her sister more, and the two of them go on a no-boys picnic. Albert, however, hears about all the food they have in the picnic basket and wants to come. And eat. Frances tells him that it's a no-boys picnic. When Albert agrees that the baseball games will not be no-girls games, Frances agrees that the picnic will not be no-boys. After Frances and Albert patch things up, Gloria is afraid she will again be left out because she is the youngest, but Frances assures her that won't happen. A happy ending for all."},{"Title":"Best Friends For Francis","review":"The Frances series of books is wonderful for children. I read these for my own children and am now getting them for my grandchildren. The books are wonderful for helping children explore their feelings and interaction with others.

The color photographs are far better than the usual paintings or black-and-white photos, and the evolution of the uniforms of the major combatants is quite interesting. I would have liked more stuff about the minor combatants, such as Serbia, Romania, Japan, et. al., as well as more Austria-Hungary, but on the whole, this book does what it sets out to do, and since it is geared toward an English-speaking public, the emphasis on the Western Front is not out of place."},{"Title":"World War I Infantry in Colour Photographs (Europa Militaria)","review":"Combine some of the best examples of original artifacts from WWI, assemble them into complete uniforms, then have models put them on, and take photos.

O'Neil was birthed in a morass of Boston's retail politics. This forced the man to ask for votes and grant favors to people within his district. It also forced the man to develop a taste for the give and take of negotiating with other politicians. It is not a sophisticated system, but rather a simple system of give and take between to people working with one another. O'Neil's book also details what he thought about certain topics and individuals which he dealt with while serving in politics. He reveals the fact that Gingrich was a bomb thrower and how he defused this situation. All in all, a great, entertaining memoir. Get it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"MAN OF THE HOUSE reads more like a conversation with a favourite grandparent than the memoirs of someone with fifty years of experience in politics and the book is the better for it. The book is vaguely set up in chronological order starting from his childhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts and ending with his retirement from his position as Speaker of the House. But Tip (one feels to be on a first-name basis after the familiar tone of the book) sprinkles many anecdotes and jokes throughout the text, giving it a conversational flavour instead of reading like a straight history.O'Neill does not try to hide the fact that he is a Democrat and an extremely partisan one at that. However, he does not let his philosophies blind him to what people really are. He remembers the flaws that were present in some of his Democratic colleagues and speaks about the good qualities in the Republicans in Congress. Partisanship never gets in the way of friendship and he recalls many stories of socializing with members of both parties after a day spent fighting legislative battles.It's fascinating to read about (what is now) history through the eyes of someone who was witnessing first-hand so much of it. An entire chapter is dedicated to the Watergate scandal of the Nixon years and we can see it unfolding as he saw it. Nixon can be seen through the eyes of someone who was not a part of his close inner-circle, but who was closer than the general public. He offers his thoughts on the pardon given by President Ford and his mixed feelings on the subject.All the Presidents that he worked with are given a chapter of their own where O'Neill offers praise, criticism and a few humourous anecdotes. As expected, fellow Bostonian Jack Kennedy receives the most attention, having one chapter dedicated to him and another to his family. O'Neill describes a man who surrounded himself by a team of people that were the best in the business when it came to getting someone elected, but who really did not have the first clue in how to deal with legislators.O'Neill describes many of the battles he had with Kennedy's successor, President Johnson, on the subject of Vietnam. O'Neill broke from the President's position and was quite vocal in his condemnation of the war. The deep division in the Congress and the conversations he had with the President are given a lot of attention. O'Neill details how, while agreeing with the sentiments of the protestors, he felt that they were distracting from the message. Every time someone would smash a window in anger during a gathering, instead of reports of general unrest, the story in the press would be that this was another action supported by Tip.The last two presidents that Tip served with were the two in office during his tenure as Speaker of the House. President Carter, the Democrat, and President Reagan, the Republican, are seen to Tip as being almost complete opposites. Where every conversation O'Neill had with Carter demonstrated the President's obvious knowledge in on a given subject, virtually all Reagan had to talk about were old movies and baseball. The main difference in their leadership styles, and what Tip found so frustrating, was the difference in which the two men viewed the Congress. Carter took a much more passive role, not really understanding the way that Washington worked. In contrast, Reagan would be constantly on the phone to the members of Congress, sweet-talking them into supporting his bills.This was a very interesting read and I highly recommend it. O'Neill himself comes across as a very warm and friendly person who, in all his years in government, never forgot where he came from. His fights over various pieces of legislation down the years always came down to a simple desire to help the little guy."},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"The man who coined this phrase, Thomas P. \\"Tip\\" O'Neill, one of the most influential congressmen in history, never forgot his roots. Always looking out for \\"the little guys\\" who elected him, but always making them feel like \\"big guys,\\" Tip O'Neill never lost an election following his elevation to the Massachusetts House in 1936 at age twenty-two. Sixteen years later, he received a private tip from John F. Kennedy, a year ahead of time, that JFK would be giving up his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1952, and O'Neill prepared early and ran for and won that seat, soon becoming as savvy a backroom politician as old Joe Kennedy ever was, and considerably more honest. As Speaker of the House from 1977 until his retirement in 1987, O'Neill enjoyed his role as a power broker, while improving the lives of ordinary citizens instead of feathering his own nest.With William Novak acting as writer/recorder, O'Neill reminisces like the consummate \\"Irish politician\\" that he was, telling lively stories about the country's most powerful leaders, often telling \\"tales out of school\\" in the interest of \\"honesty.\\" Every reader will know exactly how O'Neill felt about each of the Presidents and politicians with whom he worked. He helped JFK try to buy off Edward McCormack (unsuccessfully) when McCormack was running for Senate against Teddy, but he disliked Bobby, considering him a \\"self-important upstart and a know-it-all.\\" Though he disagreed with the Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorizing LBJ to \\"take all necessary measures\\" in Vietnam, he voted for it, then publicly changed his mind, a move that infuriated LBJ, who needed all the support he could muster.His observations of Nixon suggest that Nixon, a master manipulator, completely lost touch with reality regarding Watergate, joking about issues that were not even slightly funny. He regarded Jimmy Carter as nave and completely unable to get anything done, in part because he surrounded himself with people O'Neill considered arrogant, especially \\"Hannible Jerkin.\\" And he never understood how Ronald Reagan could have managed two terms as President when his grasp of issues was so limited, citing an example in which Reagan confused President Grover Cleveland with the ballplayer Grover Cleveland Alexander. Reagan, he says, was often speechless at State Dinners, until the topic turned to movies and Hollywood.Though Tip O'Neill's most memorable legacy may be that he brought The Big Dig to Boston and changed the face of the city, he never failed to sponsor legislation which would benefit poor \\"little guys.\\" In this fascinating, sometimes gritty depiction of backroom political maneuvering, O'Neill elevates power broking to an art form with politicians as the artists, creating an unforgettable tale of old-time politics the likes of which we will probably never see again. n Mary WhippleAll Politics Is Local: And Other Rules of the GameMemorial Addresses and Tributes in Honor Ofthomas P. \\"Tip\\" O'Neill, JrTip O' Neill and the Democratic Century: A Biography"},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"I recently received this book as a gift from an older, wiser cousin after I asked for something to help me learn a bit more about the politics of our nation.

This book is worth reading repeatedly since you uncover more gems upon further read and reflection. His aspirations, hopes and intents, while sometimes poorly envisioned, were rarely not borne of the finest virtues.This was a man who the knew the game and knew it well and, unlike now, was in an age in Washington where politicians of opposing views drank and played cards together. In some measure, that is a legacy to be sorely missed."},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"This is an entertaining, anecdotal biography of former Massachusetts Congressman Thomas \\"Tip\\" O'Neill. Before his retirement, O'Neill parleyed his popularity and seniority into several terms as Speaker of the US House of Representatives. He was a faithful follower of the Kennedys. He became a minor celebrity of sorts appearing as himself in television commercials and on an episode of the sitcom \\"Cheers.\\"His nickname was derivative: the original Tip O'Neill was a professional baseball player who would have been long forgotten but for the fact his sobriquet was recycled on Capitol Hill. The Speaker engages in some interesting reminiscing as he recalls unemployed Bostonians who lined up to accept Depression Era jobs shoveling snow from sidewalks for a daily wage in return for peddling their votes to the Democratic ward politicians, of the now distant time when Republican Brahmins dominated Massachusetts politics and of the roguish James M. Curley, the twice imprisoned Boston Mayor, hustling up campaign contributions for a split of the overall take.O'Neill was an unrepentant New Deal liberal, who refused to acknowledge that the times had changed. He seemed to personally embittered by the fact that Ronald W. Reagan (the son of a nonpracticing Irish Catholic father and a Scotch Protestant mother) abandoned the Democratic Party of his youth and became the leader of the Republicans. Despite lacking a Republican majority in the House, Reagan frequently was able to peel off enough Southern Democrats to beat O'Neill on crucial votes. O'Neill seemed to like Reagan at a personal level while detesting his political policies. He did grudgingly admit that Reagan was a good golfer (O'Neill was an enthusiastic duffer).His astute observation that \\"[a]ll politics is local\\" remains as true today as the day that he first said it. Whether or not you would have like to have had the opportunity to vote for O'Neill, the truth is you would probably would have wanted to share a few glasses of beer with him and listen to his stories. This light book is amusing, which is more than can be said for many political memoirs."},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"Tip O'Neill was a great politician and you can feel this though his writing.

I belive that the Democrats will never win congress back until they look back on his philosophy that \\"All politics is locale.\\""},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"Tip O'Neill was an old-fashioned politician. He came up he traditional route, kissing babies, handing out jobs and favors and calling them back in when the time came. He is often credited with coming up with the quip that all politics is local.O'Neill spent fifty years in politics, 34 of them in the House of Representatives, ten of those as Speaker. He was, in my opinion, a living argument for term limits and harsh punishment for those \\"public servants\\" and elected officials who violate the public trust.Co-authored with William Novak, who may have carried most of the writing load, this is a breezy, enjoyable memoir of the things O'Neill could talk about without fear of going to jail.O'Neill came into the House in early 1953, just before Eisenhower assumed office. He recounts his experiences with Presidents, beginning with a chance meeting with FDR, then Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan. O'Neill was a partisan, though not as shrill as those currently in power.It is probably obvious that I am not a fan of O'Neill or his politics. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying his recounting of his far too many years in the House. O'Neill isn't shy about recounting the political maneuvering he engaged in that was on the right side of the law. Some of the stories are fascinating, like the one about he played messenger boy between then Speaker Sam Rayburn and Democratic Presidential nominee John F. Kennedy to put Lyndon Johnson on the ticket as the Vice Presidential candidate. Backroom politics at its best.On the other hand, it strains credulity when O'Neill pretends thsat the dirty politics engaged in by Nixon and his cronies was different than what his party did.One of the best howlers in the book is Tip O'Neill saying \\" \\"[c]ontrary to the popular view, politics today may be one of the cleanest professions rather than the dirtiest\\". He was speaking of the period when he appointed Charlie Wilson - who was managing a quasi-private and very secret war in Afghanistan - to the House Ethics Committee to keep unindicted ABSCAM conspirator John Murtha from any kind of disciplinary sanctions.Not much has changed. Politicians still tell us how pristine and pure they are, while keeping their hands out for \\"contributions\\" and returning the favor with taxpayer money. O'Neill was one of the best of that breed and his biography is worth reading, especially if you are able to read between the lines.Jerry"},{"Title":"Man of the House: The Life and Political Memoirs of Speaker Tip O'Neill","review":"In these highly entertaining memoirs, House speaker Thomas P. Tip O'Neill describes his half-century in public office, politics, deal-making, and 34 years in Congress (1952-1986) including the last ten as speaker. O'Neill describes his political life in chronological order, beginning with his first race for City Council (his only loss) while a student at Boston College. From there we learn about the Massachusetts Legislature (he was speaker there too), and his 34 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. O'Neill shares his basic philosophy of Jobs, helping the poor, loyalty to your roots, disagreeing without being disagreeable, and remembering that all politics are local. From these pages we see the value of friends in politics, and the intellectual and political skills of competent elected officials. Readers also learn how the House of Representatives works, and get a view of characters like James Curley, Sam Rayburn, John McCormack, etc. We also get Tip's view on each President from Kennedy thru Reagan. In short, this gregarious man weaves a host of entertaining anecdotes into a combined and valuable autobiography-memoir-political primer.I'd have liked more on the workings of the House of Representatives, and editors shouldn't list congressman Marty Russo (D-IL) as Mary Russo. Also, some readers may not like O'Neill's Democratic partisanship, or his view of Jimmy Carter as brilliant but personally deficient, nor his correct indictment of Reagan as a charming but ill-informed rich jerk who disdained the poor.

Hodgeson in the advertisement of a film, 'Matango'(directed by Ishiro HONDA famous for Godzilla in 1954/\\"Attack of Mushroom People\\" in English title later exported to overseas). At that time, SF in Japan was still at dawn and some Sci-Fi writers were eager to introduce variety of SF especially to adults. 'Matango' is today a classic horror film with some but highly enthusiastic fans. The original story of 'Matango' is 'The Voice in the Night' which is contained in this volume. The story is terrifying but sadly romantic, which is common in many stories by Hodgeson.Those who like sea adventure stories by E. A. Poe, will surely find the similar but more exciting tastes in this volume. Hodgeson loved Poe's works while H.P. Lovecraft worshiped Hodgeson. Supernatural and very physical (not psychological) terror is here.I am collecting all 5 volumes this time, but sea adventures are concentrated in this 3rd volume.

There is a whole life in all of these short stories.POWER OF THE WRITER: These stories step you into lives either vastly different that your own, or incredibly familiar, and show how alike we really all are. What these stories do show you, is how powerfully elegant Ursula Hegi is as a writer, to be able to do this.EACH STORY IS CAPTIVATING IN ITS OWN WAY: Each of these stories could be a novel in its own right. In fact that is the only complaint I have, is that I wanted more. It was evident each story was complete in its own right, but on the same token, you wanted to follow the writer's thoughts so you could see how things ended up. Many stories were very introscpective, as much of Ms. Hegi's work is. All related a feeling of belonging, betrayal, concern, happiness, etc. These weren't so much spelled out, but you experienced them as you read the stories.INTERESTING WAYS OF TELLING A STORY: I found several of the stories very compelling. One was by a person that was struggling with the wandering mind of a high fever. Another was of a jilted bride that attended stranger's wedding in her wedding finery, to insure their good fortune. In both of these stories, initially you don't know what's going on. The fog of the central character is over your eyes as well.

There was a bad poet hopelessly in love with an unresponsive-not to say cold-female; a sophisticated person, much older in both physical and mental terms, a true to type Woman of the World, and he a clich&eacute;d portrait of the kind of person rampant in literature, either as a caricature or as comic relief. Spare me an unrequited-love romance, even as an aside, I inwardly implored.I was spared.What I found instead was a delightfully good-natured literary satire on the various \\"types\\" found in literature, the kind that every reader recognizes instantly. Here, you find them all, congregated in a short and enchanting novel full of the most subtle and gentle humor-the least obvious and most entertaining joke is, of course, that none of these people can really be taken seriously.In a parody of characterization in literature, Huxley comes up with: The Philosopher, The \\"Sensitive\\" Wannabe Poet, The Serious Pretentious Pseudo Intellectual, The Spiritual Author as the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; (Pet) of a Rich lady With Nothing To Do, The Rich Lady With Nothing To Do, The Rich Lady's Husband With Nothing To Do, The Charming Accomplished Amorous Aristocrat With Everything Going For Him, The Mediterranean Artist, The Religious Fanatic, and finally, the Ice Maiden.Huxley takes this rich cast of familiar and even sometimes lovable characters that we have known from time immemorial in innumerable novels and puts them together, in the close proximity of a house in which they are the house guests of the rich lady and her husband, who in literature, have nothing to do but invite people over for the summer to endure excruciating contact with other people they have nothing in common with. And then, Huxley casually presents us with their performance.The obvious purpose is to take these tools that many authors dupe their readers by calling \\"characters\\" and let them behave as tritely as they can, with this difference: all the trite behavior, all the clich&eacute;d dialogue, the whole overused situation, will not save them from where they should really end up, as opposed to where they do end in literature, i.e. the bad poet is rewarded in his literary efforts AND he gets the girl, the charming prince does find true love and settles down to a life of fidelity and healthy offspring, the artist does find solace in his art and gets rid of his neurosis, and so on. Here, the situation is rendered interesting by virtue of the author's freedom in taking these characters-who have populated so many books, they breathe with a life of their own-where they ought to go if we consider how many forces are at work in life, and how simplistically life is represented in many novels, that seem to exist in a egocentric universe where its own cast of characters are the sole remarkable occupants of a universe.This very theme is touched upon when Denis, the poet, discovers what Jenny, the only original character in the whole book, does when she scribbles silently in her diary. His dishonesty leads him to the disquieting realization that there are people beside himself who possess the faculty of observation and interpretation. He had underestimated Jenny, just as the reader is led to do, as a deaf woman in her thirties, quite unnecessary in any tangible sense: her apparent distance from the action leads us to discount her importance as a character or a human being, the very thing many of us do in real life when we come across quiet, self effacing, retiring individuals.What appealed to me personally about Crome Yellow was that Huxley, whether consciously or unconsciously, had used two characteristics from two of my favorite authors: he had taken Dickens' style of casting all his characters as types (though Dickens is, of course, more lucrative in his supply of types than Huxley is or should have been), and then using them to make a story; in Dickens case, the characters assist him in his chief aim, that of satire and social criticism, and are not themselves the focus, whereas here the characters are the point. The other characteristic is the distance of the author from his characters, which is best exhibited by Forster. Huxley is wonderfully omniscient and yet absent in this work, with no leaning towards any particular member of his cast. No favoritism, so to speak-there are no heroes and no villains.Huxley has managed here to be true to form while keeping the whole composition charmingly original and fresh: the accomplished aristocrat comes but for a fleeting period of time and leaves a broken heart behind him. The philosopher is kept incessantly talking. The lady with her spiritual pet is properly in the background. The lady's husband is, not unexpectedly, obsessed with the record of the history of his family. The artist is tormented, handsome and original. The serious pseudo intellectual is critical, highly formulaic in her intellectualism (always afraid of not doing or saying the right thing intellectually) and intelligently interested in everything. The love interest of the poet is self-contained, distantly amused, and sphinx-like. The poet himself is shy and sensitive to a degree. However, all of these characters are made to exhibit some of their insides: the poet, for instance, is shown incapable of being spontaneous or natural, of giving full play to his emotions and what after all, is a poet to feel if he can't feel an emotion? They are all similarly exposed as flimsy pieces of work-the clear implication being, how untrue are the types portrayed in literature: they don't even have the decency to be representational.I am charmed by this work. The writing is refined, the story original, there are some surprises always waiting for the experienced reader too ready to take things for granted. It's a fresh fresh composition. I'm glad it was short though as a protraction would have spoiled its essence.I have but one complaint to make, which was enough to make me give it a star less than it otherwise would have deserved. There are a few characters that are perfect as types and are given appropriately lengthy introductions, but are subsequently, unceremoniously banished from the story. One such character is the priest. Some other characters were treated in the same manner, as for example, the spiritual author, but they were at least connected to the story in a more concrete way. In the case of the spiritualist, he was necessary to complete the character of the lady of the house. The lady herself was a necessary accessory, and looked okay in the background. But the priest does not have any real connection with the other characters and in the end, it remains unclear why he was introduced in the first place. He does not in any way help to give a clearer picture of the community, as later on, the community is not much of a factor anyway. If he had been further pulled into the story and given a place in the scheme of things, he would have been an interesting guy: not to mention, leaving him hanging in there with no beginning and no end is a bit of a disappointment as it doesn't leave things complete in an otherwise perfectly composed novel."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"Huxley's talent, especially in his first novel, is to pour out ideas (the subjects and issues covered here are staggeringly diverse for such a short book) without losing the human spark or light touch that keeps you reading. Crome Yellow, the story (I use the word loosely) of fairly lazy aristocrats whiling the weeks away at a luxurious country estate, manages to be at once a dozen (or more) intelligent essays--on all different subjects and from many points of view, a romantic comedy, a character(s) study, a social satire, and a charming short story collection. Aldous Huxley was a young man and when he wrote Crome Yellow in the early twenties (not long out of college) he was more agnostic skeptic and social critic than the psychedelic mystic and dystopian prophet he would become. Yet the themes, and sometimes more, of his later work are all present here. There's a suggestion of mysticism and the \\"other world,\\" albeit in a more comic manner than The Doors of Perception. Denis, with his anxieties around women and self-loathing, hand-wringing intelligence, is an early version of Bernard in Brave New World. And early in the book (at a pig pen of all places) a character hypothesizes about the future--and describes almost exactly the world Huxley would portray in Brave New World! It's fascinating to see, in this modernist society tale, the seeds of Huxley's future work. But better yet are all the ideas and separate stories Huxley crams into Crome Yellow: the historical tale of a dwarfish aristocrat and his gigantic son, a romantic escapade on the roof between a dashing visitor and the well-read yet thick Mary, the frequent and inept attempts of Denis to woo Anne, and cynical but comparatively content Mr. Scogan, who imagines stories to fill the mock books in the library, and cross-dresses as a fortune teller to scare the villagers at the annual fair. All in all, a great, quick read and a touchstone for all of Huxley's themes in a most unlikely vehicle."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"Crome Yellow was Adolous Huxley's first novel. It describes the life of leisure of the Wimbushes, an aging aristocratic couple and the relatives and young intellectuals who are staying with them over the Summer in their estate at the village of Crome.It has often been remarked that this novel is unserious.There was not really much hilarity contrary to my expectation; the bulk of such stuff as there is was in the first part of the novel. The one passage which made me roar with laughter is Mr. Wimbush solemnly reading to his family and guests a particular excerpt from the history he has just finished of their estate which was built back in the 16th century. The founder of the estate was his wife's ancestor, Ferdinando Lapith whom Mr. Wimbush explains devoted his time to figuring out and publishing his ideas on sanitation. He built privies (indoor outhouses) at the top of each tower for he thought that the act of depositing human waste was such a degrading act for noble creatures like humans that they should be far away from the sanitation disposal system in the ground and as close to heaven as possible. He advised that the privy have a big window on which to look out at nature; a bible, Greek and Roman philosophy and other reading material on hand to console oneself in the act. Sir Ferdinando called his book \\"Certaine Privy Counsels by One of Her Maiesties's Most Honourable Privy Counsels, F.L. Knight.\\" Mr. Wimbush says Sir Ferdinando wrote on the subject \\"with great learning and elegance\\" and Mr. Scogan, one of the Wimbush's guests expresses enchantment of such great achievements of English aristocrats.Other amusing incidents include the conversation between Denis Smith, the hero of the novel and Mr. Barbecue Smith, the spiritualist New Age author whom Mrs. Wimbush's patronizes. Barbecue-Smith claims to be able to produce an amazing amount of his wisdom on paper in a very short time, merely by finding his \\"inspiration.\\" He claims he is able to find his inspiration to produce profound writing by hypnotizing himself by staring into a electric desk light. While he is thus entranced, his mind produces really profound stuff and he writes it down. Another amusing episode is the phamphlet produced by Mr. Bodiham, the village pastor, during WWI which tried to prove using biblical text that that war presaged Armegeddon. It was a war of righteousness between Protestant nations and Germany which was under the sinister influence of Catholicism according to Mr. Bodiham. Long after the war's end, Mr. Bodiham still is seeing portents that the second coming is at hand.The novel suprisingly has a pretty serious side which comes to the fore in the second part of the novel. The author shows great skill in portraying the humanity and emotions of Denis and Mary as they confront their own emotional immaturities.The author uses some big words but his narration is very simple, intelligent and charming.. The rest of the characters have less depth to them but they are likeable and the story gets to be fairly interesting and even a little profound at the end.Sure the lenghty conversations of the characters, particularly Mr. Scogan's discourses and the poetry, sometimes seem to divert the story from its path. However I was never really bored at any point in the book. Too bad Huxley succumbed rather early in life to spiritualism, quackish medical cures and the other world and devoted his writings to them; he could have built on the excellence of this book had he not been so diverted."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"This book, it should be said, will disappoint those who search for a plot to follow. Instead, Crome Yellow is a collection of incidents, largely trivial, and long-winded expositions by various characters on everything from happiness to art to methods of waste disposal. I am assuming this to be a satirical piece, and as such it succeeds marvelously. Consider the character Denis Stone, an aspiring poet and the main protagonist who, while biking to Crome early in the novel raises a hand from the handlebar to wave ephemerally while trying to divine a perfect adjective for the rolling hills of the countryside and nearly falls off his bike.Each of the characters is caught up in trivialities and long-winded discussions on topics wherein nothing is solved but everything is reiterated incessantly, wrapped up in a more impressive bow. The interests range from Cubism (\\"the purest of art\\") to astrology/New Age Spirituality to meal journals of antiquated manor residents. They are each played to hilarious hyperbole and make for very humorous reading.As I said, the plot is scant and outside of a couple hints at romance and forbidden love there is little to motivate these characters as they meander around Crome. This will be a deterrent for some, but I found that it worked for this largely character-driven story.I got this for free for my Kindle, and the formatting was great. I am unsure of a few points; whenever a character breaks into verse, for instance, there are no line breaks. The poem runs as prose, though the beginning of a new line is marked by capitalization. Not a deal-breaker, but inconvenient. Navigation from chapter to chapter is not present here, so bookmark often if this will be a long read.For a free book by someone who at this point was testing his ability to write satire, it is a fun read.**Keep a lookout for one digressive monologue which foreshadows Huxley's later work Brave New World!"},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"I like satire, and I'm a fairly sophisticated reader, so I came into this with high expectations which were dashed on the grounds of the Crome estate. I understand that the characters themselves were intended to represent types, but I didn't feel that Huxley DID anything with them that was new or unexpected and I found it a tedious read."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"This novel was written as a satirical take on the British aristocracy of the early 20th century, and my rating reflects that. Purely on it's own, this book has absolutely no relevance for me. But taking it in its historical context, I can see that it could be considered a very critical - if not damning - look at British high society. I guess it would be like if a current American novelist were to write a book critical of the lifestyles of people like Paris Hilton or Charley Sheen. It is also semi-autobiographical, in that Huxley at one time had an experience much as described in the novel. This was Huxley's first novel, and he would go on to write many more books and essays about the nature of life and society, including \\"Point Counter Point\\" and \\"Brave New World\\"."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"This is early Huxley at his funniest. The romp takes place at the Wimbush home, Crome Manor, where Ms. Wimbush drains the estate finances with horse betting by horoscope and mild Henry Wimbush records the long history of the manor, particularly its plumbing. Diverse with ideas, as well as varied psychological types, the novel is a predecessor of Point Counterpoint and the darker, more humanistic novels. This is light and comic. Denis Stone, the protagonist, is a Huxleyen self-portrait, bright, sensitive, literary, self-absorbed, preoccupied with his sense of genius, and somewhat ineffectual in practical matters and in love. Old Scogan is a portrait of the \\"saurian\\" Bertrand Russel, with dry, humorless observations, while other characters embody known literati and artists of the day. Whiling away their time in the remote estate, they sample dalliance, leisurely conversation, and a treatment of the history of eccentrics that have lived in the manor over the centuries, amidst a pleasantly lazy and refined atmosphere. This is a nice portrait of a world that hardly exists anymore--the somewhat idle wealthy post world war one set in England, savoring the new intellectual trends, and revolting against the Victorian past in their cultured, mannerly way. This is perhaps the most humorous and kindly of Huxley's self-portraits, of the serious but shyly ineffectual artiste Denis Stone. A nice portrait of the fatuousness of the twentysomeething artist, who remarks while idling time away of his work a year or two ago, \\"I had such genius then.\\" And for those interested in psychology, a nice depiction of what RD Laing the antipsychiatrist called, a generation later, \\"implosion,\\" \\"objectification\\" and ontological insecurity. Damon LaBarbera, PC, FL"},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"This was probably one of the funniest books I've read in a while. Satires, if not done properly, can get dull very quickly. There's typically a point where you can actually feel the dead horse being whipped by the author as he panics for something else to say. Crome Yellow seems to stay fresh all the way through. If you're expecting Brave New World subject matter, totalitarian governments and that, then you will not find it. I'd say its worth it just for Harry Wimbush's family history."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"This book transports you to 1920's English countryside estate life. Plenty of time for ennui, long sermons, elaborately constructed ideas (included several which later appear in Brave New World), coming-of-age angst, and a set of interesting characters.I had much more fun reading this than I had expected. A very nice, light surprise."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"An interesting first book for a renowned author. Crome Yellow is a wonderful introduction to Huxley's story-telling talents. The scenes were so meticulously laid out I felt I was watching a movie in my head. Crome was also a wonderful introduction to Huxley's knack for detailed characters. His writing style pulls you into the characters and the world of the book.Crome was a fabulous exploration of human sexual desire. The yearning, the attempts, the exploits, even the destruction of a man. All who have ever desired another can certainly relate to this one."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"Crome Yellow is actually the second novel by Huxley that I have attempted to read this year. The first one,Island, was one of those few books that I find so unreadable that I have to put it down without completion. I won't go into all the reasons that I hated Island-- suffice to say that it wasn't my cup of tea on any level. In any case, I approached Crome Yellow with some trepidation.This wasn't helped, by the way, by the back cover of the book. It informed me gravely that this book was \\"blamed for...the downfall of post-Victorian standards of morality\\". It also describes the book as a \\"bold exploration into love and sex\\". I rather doubted the first statement and was rather put off by the second. All the same, I had carted the book to Singapore to read, so read it I was determined to do.To my surprise, rather than a crude broadside on 1960s utopian ideals, I read a rather delicate satire of country manor novels. Granted, it was a satire with a sharp edge, which took the opportunity to take some nice little rabbit punches at society in general. But still-- not at all what I was expecting.I was particularly impressed by Huxley's hand with character. After a generation of sighing sensitive young men who tremble with love for their older ice princesses, it was quite a relief to meet a sensitive young man main character who was just as gormless and ineffective as he appeared. Huxley uses a combination of smart word choice, good dialogue, and a cynical eye to make his point. There is some real stink dressed up as clever froth-- and that's a skill that I really admire.I have the feeling that the book is so much of the time that I was missing part of the point. Sort of like a child listening to grown-ups talk scornfully about people that you only vaguely know.Anyhow, glad that I read it since it washed the taste of Island out of my mouth. A curious little book, and worth reading, even if it didn't single-handedly cause the downfall of Victorian morality."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"The book was in the condition that the seller stated it was in. The price was right and it arrived in a timely manor. This is all that mattered to me."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"I have not read his legendary work, \\"Brave New World,\\" yet. However, I have heard so much about how brilliant his work was and anticipated to leaf through his very first novel (I would call it a novella). After reading Huxley's allegedly first novel, \\"Crome Yellow,\\" I couldn't help but be surprised by all the hypes about the writer. The beginning and ending of the story seems to be interesting enough which sets the reader's imagination to impetus. Between the beginning with Denis' arrival at Crome riding bicycle and the ending with Denis leaving the place thinking morbid thinking, there's only a twilight zone of inactivities - thoughts, ideas, philosophical discussions, a story within a story, and a faint hint of mis-directed affection and romance that is never to come to pass in the story. The twilight zone is fraught with social satires -- satirical comments. All these supposedly artists at the mansion tinkling with words - ah, words - and milling about their own carnivalesqueness of words, are nothing but the prop that the author wanted to use to deliver his social critique. Clearly, Huxley seemed to have fun experimenting his very first dallying with writing through this novella. \\"Crome Yellow\\" can never exceed any work by Oscar Wilde not to mention Charles Dickens. Just a poor imitation of an aspiring writer!"},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"I just finished Crome Yellow, and, like all of Huxley's works, enjoyed it immensely. I was quite surprised to see the seeds of Brave New World and Point Counter Point so clearly laid out. It is an enjoyable read and a fascinating study of character and artistic temperament. Look for Mr. Barbecue-Smith as the predecessor to the Chicken Soup trash that's so pervasive today.It is truly unfortunate that it seems to be out of print."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"this novel was, in my opinion, not very good. it smacks of aristocratic pretension. i did not like nor could i find my self sympathetic with any of his hollow, flat characters. which really bothers me very, because i'm a huge huxley fan."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"Crome Yellow was Aldous Huxley's first book. His best books are his early books that he wrote before Brave New World. The young Aldous Huxley was evanescent, fluid, and limitless in his potential. However, as he grew older, especially in his last decades when he lived in California, he became more calcified, his vision narrowed and he became mired by his own mystic obscurisms. And when Huxley 'got' Buddhism, he stopped writing novels and wrote Buddhis tracts, so to speak. Written when he was 27, Crome Yellow centers around a house called Crome hence the title, (like Wuthering Heights centered around a house - Abbey Grange). The house was a gathering place of artists who were vacuous, though in a brilliantly significant way. The main character is Denis Stone, a naive neophyte, much like Huxley must have been at the time. Consequently as Huxley himself grew more sophisticated, so did his characters. Huxley attacks the ennui and malaise existential of life with a kind of righteous indignation that is refreshing. And he uproariously endorses the sentiments of misanthropy that all refined and culture cynics must feel. Huxley spent most of his life playing the expatriate game. In his own words from Crome, Huxley was &quot;one of those distinguished people, who for some reason or other, find it impossible to live in England.&quot; Huxley spent most of the 1920's in Italy. It is difficult to believe that Aldous Huxley was just 27 when he wrote this book, for it is written like a 50 yr. old. Crome Yellow is a great introduction to Huxley, as well as a great way to know him better. There could scarcely be a more potent, intense vanguard for the psychedelic revolution, for which Huxley must have been a precursor of."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"Crome Yellow, a wonderful addition to my collection, found in an old bookstore for one dollar.

The book also contains a fair amount of subtle hints on many different topics of interest. For example, the brief discussion of greatness - human greatness - is always a topic worth exploring. The piece about the \\"little person\\" from the perspective of a \\"little person\\" living in the Victorian era is mesmerizing. This unfolding character history by Huxley is riveting. The book contains a hint at a future qoute of Huxley's on perspective. That is, the notion of seeing oneself through the eyes of another.

Between his exaggerated prose and his excellent characterization, he ensnares the imagination.Crome Yellow, despite being his first book, is precisely what one expects from Huxley. The book itself is a satire on the daily life of his time, and the characters are in a way caricatures of the people you would expect to find in the early part of the 20th century. There is Denis, whose love of all things literary complicates his romantic endeavors. There is Mary, who wishes for something the holiday home cannot fulfill and works to escape the tedium and expectations of the everyday. There is Anne, who is entirely too aware of herself and trapped between tradition and desire. And there is Old Henry Winbush, a long-winded fellow who embodies the spirit of the age: elaborate parties, long speeches, and a pressing need to teach everyone what \\"wisdom\\" he has collected over his years.Together, this cast of characters spends the holidays in the town of Chrome, and despite the hopes of some, the only things which don't change are the ones that need to change the most.It is a bit unpolished and slow in places, but it is still a good piece of Huxley's work."},{"Title":"Crome Yellow","review":"I believe this is Aldous' first published book. Truth be told, It is kind of boring but I think writers will enjoy this book more than your average person.

Yet these grand old movies probably did more than any one thing to shape our ideas and ideals. The films gave us action, comedy, music, and good wholesome entertainment for the entire family. They taught us faith, hope, loyalty, honesty, and gave us heroes. We knew they were not real, but we loved them just the same. They made no attempt to show life as it is, but rather how life should be. The B-Westerns were not a substitute for church, but they certainly complimented the message presented by the church. After watching one of these movies you felt a tingle of goodness spread throughout your body ... like your soul had been cleansed\\".If you were fortunate enough to have lived during the 1930s, '40s or '50s you may have been sitting in one of those old majestic movie palaces with buckaroos like Steven Spielberg, George Lucas or yours' truly.

There are so many ways in which this novel--a debut effort!--achieves greatness: the hit-the-nail-on-the-head portrayal of contemporary music (and music criticism); the brilliant evocation of chaotic, Olympic-obsessed Atlanta; the keenly rendered angst and ennui of the protagonist, Gerald, lost in that early thirty-something morass of directionless desire for something (Something stable? Something \\"deeper\\"? Something intellectual? Something just around the next corner?); and, of course, the love-of-language brilliance with which Boswell constructs sentences that give nothing short of delight."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"Thirty-year-old Gerald Brinkman seems about as ready for life as Atlanta was for the Olympics: a certain amount of hope and promise early on that masked their lack of preparedness for coping with realities. Set in the Olympic summer of 1996 in Atlanta, Brinkman for the last three years, after dropping out of grad school as a lit major, has been drifting on pot smoking and writing about local rock bands for the local alternative newspaper, based on the actual Creative Loafing. But even this tentative and minimal existence is now being assailed as his long-standoffish father has arrived on the steps of his apartment with apparently all of his worldly possessions in a few bags and his ex-girlfriend and fellow grad student Nora is suddenly getting married.The book follows Gerald as he lurches from one unsettled aspect of his life to another. His aloof, quirky, and intellectual father has arrived seemingly intent on unburdening himself with deeply held secrets, but Gerald can't get past his father's withdrawal from real parenting after his mother's death many years ago. Gerald's knowledge of rock music is encyclopedic and has even placed him in demand for a job in New York, yet his lack of enthusiasm is quite noticeable. Any conclusiveness that Nora's marriage could have represented is quickly dispelled as she seeks out Gerald for troubles that begin almost immediately in her marriage. And then there is mutual friend Sasha, a married beauty, who has taken a very keen interest in Gerald.This book is the anti- perfect childhood, straight through grad school by age twenty-four, and on to a great job book. Not to minimize the difficulties of figuring out what life is all about before one is thirty, these characters, especially Gerald, given their intellectual capabilities, seem overly obtuse, self-destructive, and unable to effectively communicate - Gerald can write but not speak effectively. Most interactions seem to end up in squabbling, followed by a disappearing act. The characters are sympathetic, which keeps the book interesting, but puzzling enough to not be totally believable. At times the misconnections threaten the flow of the book.Residents and visitors to Atlanta will undoubtedly be taken by the accurate descriptions of the Atlanta landscape: the Philly cheese steak shack on Monroe, Piedmont Park, and Centennial Park - the site of the infamous bombing. The author unnecessarily integrates the practically hysterical search for suspects in the bombing into his story. Given the turmoil and uncertainty in the city and in the lives of the characters, the book ends on a rather pacific, almost predictable, note. A lot of issues disappeared or got better quickly.Note: One suspects that selected readers were sent early copies of the book. All the reviews just after publication were five stars. Hopefully, early reviewers can resist the pressure to inflate reviews. A nice book, but five stars is a reach."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"Boswell has written one of the funniest, most touching novels I've read in a long time. His portrait of s father who moves in with his slacker son is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Check out his first book too while you're at it, a collection of stories called TROUBLE WITH GIRLS."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"As a woman, what I really liked most about this book was the character of Nora, who is a remarkably real and complex character. She is emotionally anxious and yet empowered, both vulnerable and strong in her femininity: a balance hard for most writers to achieve, particularly when that writer is male. Yet Boswell manages--within a story of the slow but constant ache of a grown-up boy's very \\"pre\\" midlife crisis--to create a woman who deserves our identification and our respect. Nora's counterpart, that grown-up boy, Gerald, is equally compelling in his worried want to be a good son and yet to find his own way. Boswell's portrayal of that \\"what-am-I-doing-with-my-life\\" torture we all face somewhere near our 30th year is dead on. Sometimes painfully so. But the angst is relative, and Boswell's prose throughout the book, especially his description of the vast and dazzling chaos that was Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics, makes us see the beauty in desolation."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"Gerald, a pot-smoking former grad student, now a music reviewer for an alternative newspaper, gets tangled up with a dying father and an old girlfriend who just got married but still hasn't gotten over him. I really liked Marshall Boswell's Trouble With Girls, but didn't find it quite as impressive as other story collections about young men searching for love -- like Steve Almond's My Life in Heavy Metal or Thomas Beller's The Sleep-Over Artist. But with this novel, Marshall Boswell really hits it out of the park. It's a great story with compelling characters -- Nora, the old-flame; the father who make a suprise visit to Gerald in the midst of the Atlanta Olympic games. The father has two big pieces of information it takes him a while to tell. (I won't say won't they are -- discovering them is part of the fun suspense of the book.) Meanwile, the old girlfiend has a couple big secrets of her own. Watching Gerald sort this all out is moving and very funny. The writing is fabulous and the turns of phrases and observations are often brilliantly insightful. I recommend this book to anyone, and I was glad to see in the acknowledgements section that Boswell thanked two writers who I really admire: the aforementioned Steve Almond, and also Robert Cohen, whose two most recent novels -- Inspired Sleep and The Here and Now -- I would recommend to anyone who enjoyed Alternative Atlanta."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"Alternative Atlanta is a superbly written novel about strained relationships--strained relationships with one's parents, friends, employers, lovers, ex-lovers, and the city (in this case, Atlanta during the '96 Olympics). It opens with thirty-year old Gerald Brinkman, a graduate school drop-out and local music critic, attending his ex-girlfriend's wedding. Yes, he still has feelings for her, and this wedding is just the first of many difficult trials he finds himself enduring over the next two weeks, including a surprise visit from his widowed father, a job interview in New York, and the news that his newly-married ex-love is several weeks pregnant. The plot's so gripping that, by the last 100 pages, I found myself fighting a compulsion to leaf through the book's final chapters so I wouldn't have to wait to find out what happens next: What is this deep, dark secret his dad's hiding? Who's really the father of the ex-girlfriend's baby? How will the bombing in Centennial Park inevitably factor in? But what kept me from skipping ahead is the quality of the prose. As a former Atlantan myself, I loved all the references to actual street names and local venues that only residents would be familiar with. More importantly, author Marshall Boswell's descriptions of human behavior and relationships are so perceptive and uniquely clever, I didn't want to miss a single word. You won't either."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"This is a hilarious, beautiful book. Not a page goes by where there isn't some small, perfect detail that captures a bright facet of life. Reading this novel is like coming out of a movie theater in mid-afternoon - it wakes you up to all that you've been missing: the way a nearly empty coffee cup looks late in the morning, the way the ghosts of your parents haunt you, the way you can't grow up and always have to.One chapter in particular - where the main character goes for an interview at a rock magazine - is alone worth the price of the book. There's just so much completely smart stuff in here - about the marketing insanity of the Olympics, about the look of 20-somethings in the mid-90s, about the meaninglessness of the names of rock bands. An addictively good read."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"I just read an article about the latest trend in hapless young hero lit, and apparently the trend is to write about an unabashed cad,[...] and--oh! Make sure it's not fiction, make sure you're just glorifying your own heinous existence, you handsome memoir-writing rouge, you.Ugh. Thankfully rather than clutching an air sickness bag, I stumbled upon ALTERNATIVE ATLANTA, a terrific novel about a hapless guy finding thirty to be his \\"awkward age\\" with nothing but bad timing and good music to keep him company. \\"You had your chance, Gerald Brinkman, and you missed it!\\" he's told early in life and that continues to be his theme: missing work, missing cues, missing his ex, terrified of adulthood despite the fact his friends are dropping out of slackerdom and into Crate and Barrel faster than you can say \\"I Do.\\" I liked so many things about this novel: sharp, original writing, hilarious scenes, memorable characters--not to mention that it's the first recent novel about THIS city, Atlanta, that I think gets it just right. Yet I guess the thing I like most about it is that Gerald Brinkman seems so darn familiar. The author, Marshall Boswell, writes like some of the guys I've known over the years might write if they could put their particular brand of angst down on paper. ALTERNATIVE ATLANTA is no macho brag-a-thon, just a particular, peculiarly sweet and smartly-written story of a guy and his Dad and his friends, and a summer where he finally learns to pay attention. Boswell doesn't make you want to lead the life in his book, but he sure as hell makes you wish you'd written it."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"Great literature affords a safe harbor to explore those deep issues that all inevitably face. The protagonist of fiction will shed light on areas that may be difficult for the reader to see, or even to face without prompting or encouragement. In this case, Alternative Atlanta's Gerald Brinkman represents post-modern man's search for meaning in a world offering many alternatives. His character brings to mind a similar sojourner from 40 years past, Walker Percy's Binx Bolling. While Binx found refuge in the darkened movie theaters of New Orleans, Gerald's escape is found through the alternative music of the 90's. In both cases, these men were forced out of their caves to look for meaning outside of themselves. In Gerald's case, he finally reunited with Nora, and in Binx's, he found direction through Kate. Alternative Atlanta is engaging, quick, and hip, yet its ultimate success is found in its ability to force the reader to pause and examine all the alternatives to meaning that one faces."},{"Title":"Alternative Atlanta","review":"Yes I enjoyed this book. Yes it was funny. Yes it was different. It also happened to be wordy, boring if you're not familiar with the Atlanta area, and so predictible. It is in no way great or 5 star material.

Properly presented, they can frustrate you to the point of grinding off the sharp points of your teeth. The title selection from this collection of Martin Gardners' Mathematical Recreations columns from Scientific American is one of the better paradoxes that you will find. The solution is surprisingly easy, once the proper approach is taken.The other entries are also vintage Gardner, who has no equal in the accurate rendition of mathematical curiosa. Other topics include gambling fallacies, a church of the fourth dimension, games and systems that learn by experience. There are also thirty-seven catch questions in a final chapter that are definitely groaners. Upon initial reading, the answer appears easy. However, the careful and precise wording of the problem often leads to an unusual but correct solution.If you have a curiosity driven desire to learn mathematics, then Martin Gardner is an excellent place to begin or continue your exploration. Even though the articles collected here were written in the early sixties, the topics are timeless and will continue to intrigue new generations of the mathematically inclined."},{"Title":"The unexpected hanging,: And other mathematical diversions","review":"I read this book in the early '70s, and it remains one of my favorites.

Owing much to the dizzying reorientation produced by Ludwig Wittgenstein, Wisdom attempts to better understand the epistemological puzzle that presents itself when we give a quick sketch of human beings existing and relating to each other in the world. We might assume that to be human is to exist as a body and a mind; the body is public, extended, finite, and divisible; the mind is abstract, intangible, and private; one's body belongs to the physical world, but one's mind belongs chiefly and conspicuously to oneself.If we assume a picture something like what's suggested above, then we face a quandary. How can we ever know the contents of another's mind?Wisdom presents the reader with an array of examples meant to elucidate the concepts and expose the assumptions that give this classic philosophical problem its hypnotic power. His methods are contentious. And whether or not you are inclined to agree with them, the fate of philosophy of mind - and psychology and cognitive science by extension - hangs in the balance."},{"Title":"Other minds","review":"Highly intellectual, cerebral, and academic. Of little value (+ 1 star) to the general layperson except to those who love analysing. Written by a psychologist for psychologists. It analyses how one may perceive what other people may be thinking.Surprisingly, this book was referred to by another author, John G Bennett, who wrote a highly recommended and readable book on our current epoch of human spirituality, \\"The Crisis in Human Affairs\\" (1948) - 239 pages, ASIN: B0006D9DNG, which is, and will be, far from anachronistic.I would rather recommend another book about thinking (if thinking is what the prospective reader would like to think about), which is by Rudolph Steiner, called \\"Intuitive Thinking As a Spiritual Path\\" (Oct 1995) - 288 pages, ISBN: 088010385X. (Rudolph Steiner advocated a form of ethical individualism, to which he later brought a more explicitly spiritual component. He based his epistemology on Johann Wolfgang Goethe's world view, in which \\"Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas.\\" A consistent thread that runs from Steiner's earliest philosophical phase through his later spiritual orientation is the goal of demonstrating that there are no essential limits to human knowledge.)All the aforesaid books relate to spiritual matters (if one views \\"Other Minds\\" as an enquiry into the spiritual nature of other people's minds)________________________________"},{"Title":"Boomerang","review":"Boomerang is a direct escape into the harried life of Jean Rubin, a Women's Studies instructor.

What was her secret? she listened to what her clients were saying, responded to what was legitimately a cry for help and learned what they needed.

So all in all it was a great read but it left me feeling very sad."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door, it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parentsI served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I absolutely adore this book. Everything Cassandra narrates I can vividly see in my mind. A strong voice and wonderful usage of words, makes it an even more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I got this book based on the recommendation of a classmate, and immediately fell in love with the narrator. All the characters are intriguing, and I couldn't put it down. I must read for anyone who loves very British stories."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"So much of this quirky, beautifully-written book is wonderful that I am sorry to have come away from it rather disappointed. After an excellent first half, it gradually descends into a morass of puppy-love.The picture that this book \\"captures\\" of the social possibilities for girls in the 1950's is devastating."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra, a 17 year old girl living in a decrepit castle in England in the 1930's. It's told through her journal entries, which she writes not so much to tell the events of the day, but more to practice her writing because her author father (who hasn't written in years) was highly critical of the last piece that she showed him.As the reviews on the cover of the book claim, Cassandra is a very charismatic narrator. It is difficult to dislike her, though there were several points where I did truly want to. Her excitement for things is infectious, as is the romanticism of the castle in which she lives. Her endeavors to improve her writing lead to a very interesting and sometimes moving story.The main problem that I had with the story was actually something that was done well. The characterization was excellent, making it very believable that it was a young woman writing about family and friends that she has known for some time. They were well fleshed-out and seemed like real people. The problem that I had was that they seemed like real people that I just didn't like and at times that detracted from my reading pleasure.While I did find I Capture the Castle to be enjoyable for the most part, my dislike of the characters hampered that enjoyment. I found Rose to be very shallow, as was Cassandra, and I honestly wanted to see them foiled in their quest for husbands. I have little tolerance for people who are upset about their circumstances but don't do anything to change them, so the constant moping in the Mortmain household grated on my nerves after a while. I know that it was a different time, and perhaps that was more appropriate action then, but it was annoying to see all the women there so weak and unable or unwilling to do anything to improve their situation.The plot was also so much based around their desires to improve their situation that I had a small bit of trouble with it as well, but it was cleverly done, and there were enough side plots that I wasn't too overwhelmed by Cassandra and Rose's attempts to improve their position through marriage.I did find this book to be an interesting look into a different time period. I enjoyed reading about the idiosyncrasies that Cassandra focused on, as well as things about the village life and the castle itself. I also found the attempts to get Cassandra's father to write to be highly entertaining, particularly the last way they tried. I also enjoyed the characters that, for the most part, weren't involved in the husband-fetching scheme.Really, Cassandra was charismatic enough that she made up for most of the flaws in the story with the way that she told it and in the end, I did enjoy the book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading about that time period."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I loved this novel. It seemed less like a novel than a real journal, where I could explore the life of a very interesting, astutue young girl on the cusp of first love. Cassandra and her family are funny, sad and infinitely real. I love the dialogue and also the descriptions of English country life. The first scenes of being down-and-out in a huge castle are beautiful and comic. But the novel moved me most in its moments where Cassandra finds herself desolate and heartbroken, asking God for comfort. This is an exquisite, gentle book. I will pick it up again soon."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book was extremely well-written, and quite entertaining. Though at some points in was a little bit boring, for the most part it was very enjoyable. I would not reccomend this book to people who crave action and fast-moving scenes; it is more for people who enjoy quite yet engaging books. I did enjoy Cassandra's charactor a lot, though I also loved that of Simon. A great read for a Sunday afternoon or a rainy day."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle, by Dodie Smith, is really a story about a girl coming of age in a rundown, old English castle in the late 1940's after World War II. Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen year old girl, from a poor, eccentric family is trying to polish her skills as a writer by keeping journals. She tries to capture the personalities of those she interacts with and in doing so we get a sense of her own journey to maturity as well as her family's. As different people enter and influence the Mortmain household, it gives reason to reflect on the impact people and new relationships can have on any person.I thought I Capture the Castle was a thoughtful exploration of character. The plot wasn't very fast paced and only possessed, what I would consider, a few major highlights throughout the story, but the intricacies that were given for each character that developed over the course of the book were enough to keep me interested. The way Cassandra's character portrays the world around her is very poetic at times, and also very witty and comical as well. The heroine is instantly likeable and interesting and her personality and her family's personalities keep you turning the page with their sometimes unpredictable and boisterous behavior.My absolute favorite thing about this book is that the author is able to put the simplest, yet sometimes hardest things to describe, in writing. She captures those simple joys and wonders that we all posses and is able to put them in words, which is what made the main character so relatable in the story. One instance of this is when she is day dreaming, or imagining things, like she often would; She said she made herself stop imagining too far because the things you imagine happening usually never come true. Another, smaller example which I thought showed this was when she was recounting a dinner party with some new, wealthy friends. \\"I went through the whole evening - it was almost nicer than when it was actually happening...\\". I appreciated the honesty that the character was able to have because it was a journal; it made the experiences more real throughout the story.This book was written in around 1948, which I believe is one of the causes that the writing style is a little different than most of the contemporary novels that are being written today. This book is beautifully written, but if people are not used to slower moving plots, with heavy emphasis on descriptive passages, I would suggest that this book may not be the best for you. It isn't what we would consider a fast, easy read, but if you can get through it, I would recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"My husband would call this \\"another book about British people with repressed emotions.\\" He is basically right--this book is very much in the spirit of Jane Austen (as the characters point out at several points in the story). The plot is completely character driven and, while interesting, lacks the grandeur of Austen.Though it wasn't neccessarilly a bad book, I was left with the feeling that I would have rather spent my time rereading Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I think the perfect time to read this book is when you are about 13, but I re-read it a few years ago, and still loved it. I bought the book most recently for my 13 year old niece. The narrator of the story is a teen-age girl who lives with her siblings, her brilliant but disturbed father and wonderfully eccentric step-mother in a crumbling castle in 1930s England. The family is on the brink of really going under, financially and emotionally, when two handsome brothers move into the near-by manor house and everything changes. I certainly found the characters and the plot totally believable when I was 13, and it really seemed to all still ring true when I re-read it as an adult."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"In the 1930s teenaged Cassandra lives in a dilapidated old castle in the English countryside with her older sister, Rose, her younger brother, Thomas, her eccentric father, Mortmain, and his bride/muse, Topaz, and of course, the former maid's son, Stephen. The supposed romance of living in a castle is quickly debunked and the reader sees all is not well - the father has not even attempted to work for years and the family is on the verge of starvation. The action really starts when their landlord dies and ownership passes to his two young and handsome American nephews.This novel is told in the form of Cassandra's journals, and very endearingly conveys her experiences trying to deal with her constricted existence, her bizarre family, and first love. I could not put this down and thoroughly enjoyed it... however, I could not help the occasional thought that another author would have made this story side-splittingly funny."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable story of two families in rural England in the first half of the 20th Century. And I agree with the cover quote from J.K. Rowling: \\"This book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met.\\"-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I was suprised by Cassandra's maturity and by her keen insights of the people around her. Cassandra is undoubtedly a character that belongs in the same category as Jane Eyre and Elizabeth Bennet: all three women are strong and not easily \\"broken\\" by money, men, or influence. Cassandra is intelligent but not pompous, reserved but unafraid to be blunt and direct. She has a sense of duty to her father and to her sister which I very much admire.This would make a great gift for a girl who is around 16/17. It's a very, very good book.Writing: 5/5Characters: 5/5Plot: 5/5"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just finished this - thought it was great. Once the story got rolling I couldn't put it down. The characters are memorable - the setting intriguing. I'm sure I'll be picking this one up again to reread!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Dodie Smith's novel is captivating--from the first chapter, you feel like you know the characters, and you want to know what will happen with them. There are a ton of surprises in store, and the novel ends quite modernly. I did feel there were a few weaknesses, however, mostly in explaining relationships between characters that came out of nowhere. All the same, the book was great, and I could hardly put it down."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"What a fantastic book. Touching, funny, realistic...a depiction of first love that probably anyone can place themselves in. One of the best books I've read in a long time. I checked it out from the library, but I know I'm going to buy it. This is a book I could read probably every year, and I have to REALLY like a book to want to do that! Even if you are older than Cassandra (I'm only two years older than her now, but I'm referring to people even older than that), you can really feel with her and relate to her experiences. Excellent. A must read for anyone. This is somewhat what I imagine Jane Austen would have written had she lived in the 1940s."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Life in the castle for Cassandra Mortmain has been a hard one lately since no more money is coming in from her father's only bestseller. When two young American boys inherit the mansion neighboring the Mortmain's castle, Cassandra's life and her sister Rose's will change drastically. Dodie Smith uses seventeen-year-old Cassandra's journal for the narrative perspective that creates a fresh, but sometimes cynical view of life. Ms. Smith utilizes foreshadowing in the beginning of the novel as Cassandra hoists her sister up to try to wish on the gargoyle high up above one of the castles windows. The reader never finds out exactly what Rose wishes for, but one can assume it is for a better life or just good fortune to come to her and her family. Rose's wishing foreshadows that the Mortmain's lives do take a turn for the better when the neighbors move in. The Midsummer Rights ceremonies that Cassandra and Rose perform symbolize their immaturity and innocence, as time goes on in the novel, the reader notices changes in the ceremonies as the girls get older and those changes show how they're characters have aged and matured. The castle in which the Mortmains live represents their unique lifestyle. Ms. Smith places the Mortmain family in a castle because without this unique setting the Mortmain family would not be half as intriguing or interesting. I enjoyed this book very much and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys coming of age novels that have a fresh view of the world and that let the reader enter the novel as if the reader were truly there in the castle."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith was an excellent book. If you look at the cover, you can pretty much tell it would be classified as a &quot;chick flick&quot;----very much into the romance part. Overall it was a good book,and I would recommend reading it if you are into chick flicks"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"A couple of my friends recommended this book to me since I was, at the time, reading Pride and Prejudice. The descriptions and commentary from Cassandra are wonderful and quite breathtaking, but the only setback is the ending which leaves one with many questions and is not satisfying."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I am very glad that I read this book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought that it would be another castle novels, which i HATE. But as soon as I turned page 19 I was hooked, and this book really caught my attention. Cassandra and her sister are two very interesting girls, and the two guys they meet are really cool. I did a book report on it and, I have to say, I finished the book more than a month before it was due! THis is a must read for someone that loves a cute love story!!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"i capture the castle interested me because it had such good reviews. i decided to buy it in paperback, and got it at a low price in a local bookshop. i opened it and found that cassandra's journal really dragged on, with all these details about her life in the castle. i couldnt really find anything very interesting in it. im sure that people who enjoy very placid and idyllic books would like i capture the castle, but it is not for me."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"After reading Pride and Prejudice, this book does not hold a candle. I personally do not enjoy reading a book written as a diary. I like to feel a part of the story and not on the outside as an observer. If you are in the mood for a romantic story, choose Pride and Prejudice. The characters in Castle were not well-developed. I never cared about any of them. The ending leaves something to be desired."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I'm reading I Capture The Castle now and I'm trying to like it, I really am, unfortunately it's an uphill battle.The father is tiresome and is not written with sufficient charm to inspire me to care and sympathise with his plight.The man is arrogantly neglectful of his childrens well being and is luckier than he knows to be married to someone like Topaz who will treat those kids like her own and be a parent to them...FAR more than Mr. Genius ever does.I also take exception to the treatment of Stephen. I mean, this is a noble young man who worries that the drab sounding Cassandra is hungry!He takes it upon himself to SUPPORT this family and is gorgeous to boot what IS Cassandra's problem?Okay, okay, he doesn't sit around reading Jane Austen or the Brontes but for Pete's sake...he feeds this worthless crew...even the blasted FATHER!!The section where Stephen describes how as a very young child his mother told him not to approach the Mortmain girls because they were \\"young ladies\\" while he was the son of a maid brought tears to my eyes.He's so worth ten Mortmains put together.I shall fight on to the end but I do wish that Stephen and Topaz would run away together and leave the rest of them to snap and snarl over the carcasses of those Cottons.I fear I shall finish this book, toss it aside and just say...\\"So?\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it to the film (usually a pointless exercise, anyway). Watch the film!One small criticism: I love Bill Nighy, but I think he's a little shaky in this. He's better playing extroverted characters."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Smith's telling of the day-to-day experiences of young Cassandra reminded me of Jane Austen, but the plot was of no comparison. I just couldn't buy into the wealthy American brothers falling in love with Rose. I just don't think it would have happened, or perhaps not enough premise for this to happen was presented to the reader.However, while not as sophisticated, the book was much more compelling than Jane Austen, as popular fiction should be, and I forced myself to not peek at the ending - thankfully, for Cassandra's finale was wonderful.And, several scenes were so well told - the furs incident & the bathing incident in which the brothers make their appearance were hilarious, and several other episodes (especially between Simon and Cassandra) were a pleasure.Jagged edges in the plot, but still a delight for fans of British lit."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great \\"compare and contrast\\" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they \\"don't know how to do anything\\". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are \\"eccentric\\", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful coming of age story! It is the story of the Mortmain family, as seen through the eyes of 17 year old Cassandra, as she chronicles her and her family's life in a series of journals. The family is one step from poverty, living in a falling down castle, when Neil and Simon Scoatney arrive from America. The Scoatney's live in the manor down the road, and actually own the castle Cassandra's family is leasing. Once they arrive, things begin to change for the Mortmains. Rose, Cassandra's sister, is determined to marry one of the brothers, hopefully to lift her family out of poverty. The Father of the family, once a brilliant writer, is reclusive and non-communicative, until Mrs. Scoatney gets a hold of him! Topaz, the girls' step-mother, is beautiful in an unconventional way, plays the lute, and communes with nature in the buff. As Cassandra chronicles the goings-on of life in the castle, she tries to &quot;capture&quot; her life and her family on paper, in hopes of understanding who she is and what it means to be a part of her family. The author's rich descriptions of the castle and the surrounding countryside are so vivid and lush, I felt as if I was there, in the story, with Cassandra."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Don't be fooled by the cliches. There's a lot more going on in this book than &quot;quirky&quot; and &quot;charming.&quot; It's a brutally honest tale of a 17 year old girl coming out of that self-involvement phase and getting a good first look at the world around her. And it tackles the concept of understanding and portraying beauty in a very effective manner. Her father's puzzle exemplifies the puzzle of the novel....you have to pace through the book with Cassandra to get from point A to point B. There's no flipping straight to B for enlightenment. You must take the full journey.But it's a quirky, charming journey nonetheless. :)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This has to be my very favourite book. Cassandra is really easy to relate to, at the end of the book you are left longing for more of her thoughts and witty observations. This book captures its characters so well, that you could walk straight into the book and feel quite at home!The cover of this book does really not do it justice. I bought a different copy which had a picture of Cassandra writing her journal by the castle in the evening light, with warm orange colours, this is perphaps more suited to the magic and warmness of the book.Okay, so living in a castle and having rich guys come round bringing money with them seems a little convient and unrealistic, but the fantastic way in which this book is written persuades you that this could be a true story, with all its characters being believable and lovable.Face it, we all hate one romance after another in a book, with more mood swings then you can count, but Dodie Smith has exactly the right balance of romance, comedy, and emotion. It does have you crying in parts of the book, but nothing else is expected when you become so involved with the each of the characters.It is set at a time that isn't too far back that we cannot realate to it, but is far back enough to have a touching innocense, that creates a pleasant enviroment for its reader that modern stories simply do not have.Overall, I would say this is an excellent read, the best thing about it being its characters, and warmth. Read it as soon as you can, this is certainly a timeless book that should not be missed."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"What a delight of a book. Written in the form of a seventeen year old girl's journal, over the period of six months during which her life and that of her (rather unusual) family change dramatically, this novel introduces us to one of the most likeable voices in fiction. Cassandra Mortmain, an aspiring writer, keeps the journal to hone her skills; she ends up, rather, getting to know herself and her surroundings better. Smith manages to keep her reader's interest effortlessly (or so it seems, though the hints given by Mr. Mortmain's struggles may indicate otherwise), through a carefully rationed supply of surprises, small suspenses, and the sheer curiosity she has created about the future of the Mortmain family. The most frustrating (though perhaps most amusing for Smith) part of the thing is that Mr. Mortmain is an author himself, the highly regarded author of a book of fiction, poetry, experiments, called &quot;Jacob's Wrestling&quot; that figures in &quot;Capture,&quot; but we are given tantalisingly little information about it. I expect Smith enjoyed doing that to us; i know i would. Though it has the feel of a juvenile book (the narrator is seventeen, it's about [among other things] first loves), this is an adult book; though teenagers can read and enjoy it, more will be discovered by the active adult reader."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is the most incredible book--it is an example of the way a book should be written. It is very hard to say something that hasn't already been said . . .this book has been receiving accolades for nearly half a century, and rightfully so. As a fan of Jane Austen, I found myself thinking throughout the book that if Jane were alive in the 1940's, this was what she would have written. It has everything--adventure, romance, humor, and a little bit of philosophizing thrown in for good measure. It is one of those books that when you finish it, you find yourself sad that it ended, and wanting to open it right back up and start again. If you are looking for a great rainy Sunday afternoon in front of the fire novel, a great reading on the airplane novel, or a just plain great novel, pick this up. You won't be sorry you did."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is one of those books that you can just &quot;fall into.&quot; The observations of Cassandra are insightful and delightful. The setting in time and place is a joy. The characters are, for the most part, well-drawn and interesting. My only complaint is that the ending came too fast. This is one of those optimistic books that you never want to leave. Try it as an antidote for the daily news. If you like EF Benson, you will like this one."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"If you've ever thought it would be cool to live in a castle, this book is a must-read. It's romantic without being at all sentimental, and quite funny to boot. I thought it sagged a little in the middle, but things definitely picked up toward the final quarter. And Cassandra just killed me -- what a fun, bright narrator!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Two poor but nice girls live in poverty near the affluent owners of their decrepit rented castle. It keeps you guessing until the last page. No telegraphed punches. Even tho I'm a octogenarian, I identified with the 17 year old narrator. Dodie Smith is an artist and a joy to read again after 51 years"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"My Dad found this book for me more than twenty years ago at a garage sale. To him, it was a bargain; to me, it was magic. It is a wonderful tale, filled with charming eccentrics. One of the things I like best about it is that that the characters aren't static. Not only does the story develop, but so do the personalities in it. I couldn't bear to give my well worn copy away, so I was delighted to find that it's still in print and that I can pass the magic on to my teenage niece."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Green arms, an old castle, a father writing &quot;the cat sat on the mat&quot;, does this entice curiousity? Dodie Smith has the gift of drawing you so far into the story that you live inside the book. I read I Capture The Castle when I was a teenager, and loved it so much I lay under my bed to read it again and again. I actually thought that my family couldn't find me. How wonderful that it has been reprinted so that my adult children can discover this enchanting tale for themselves."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I had no idea what to expect from this book, having chosen it for its title, and it's one of the best coincidences that's ever happened to me. I devoured it in two days and was then stunned to discover that it was written in the first half of the last century; it could have been written today.The author deftly combines wit, humor, and empathy to deliver a well-developed picture of the narrator Cassandra's life. Cassandra is wonderfully real and insightful as she tries to \\"capture\\" in her writing the events that take place around her. It's a book about family, love, and growing up, and I don't think it will ever grow outdated."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first heard about I Capture the Castle a few months ago, when it kept showing up on people's \\"favorite\\" lists. Interested to see what all the fuss was about, I bought a copy for myself...and was not disappointed.The book is written from Cassandra Mortmain's point of view...actually, the book is her journal. We see through her eyes her very eccentric family, which includes her odd and lazy father, her free-spirited stepmother, self-serving sister Rose, and stoic brother Thomas. Also living in their home with them is their \\"servant\\" Stephen. They all live in a crumbling old castle that is romantic as well as slightly creepy. They live very isolated, and on the brink of financial ruin when the rich Cottons move next door--two bachelor brothers and their mother from America.The descriptions of the ruined castle and the surrounding English countryside are superb, and my favorite part of the book. I also thought the author did a great job of seeing things through Cassandra's eyes.One thing I'd like to comment on--and other reviewers have mentioned this as well--is that at times the characters can get on your nerves. Rose in particular doesn't have many redeeming qualities, and (in my opinion), Mr.Mortmain had none. Even Cassandra acts supremely selfish and immature through out the book--I often felt she was 14/15 instead of 17/18. But, I kept reminding myself that things were different back in the 1930s, and didn't let it detract from my love of the book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I have read this book because it is in the BBC big read list, and I loved it. I think this book will always stay in my \\"All Time Favourite\\" List along with books like Pride and Prejudice. Even thought I usually dont like books that doesnt tell me exactly what will happen to the character, but this one is an exception because it made me always think of the charatcters and what might happen to them.Casandra is a really special character and you just feel like you are living with her when you read the book, she was just like a friend to me whom I have known for ages.I would reccommend this book to anyone who enjoy reading diaries and romance. Their are also many parts that will make you laught.I would say get it and have fun reading it. You will love it!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"What a gem of a book! &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is a magnificent coming-of-age book, which reminded me of the best of the Brontes, &quot;Little Women&quot; and Jane Austen. It is just so good...Cassandra, the 17-year old heroine, lives with her well-born family in near poverty in a castle in England. Her father, a true English eccentric, once wrote a bestseller--but that was a long time ago. Her sister, Rose, is a beauty with ambition--to marry well. Her stepmother Topaz, a kindhearted and beautiful soul, trudges into London to pose nude for artists and bring income into this colorful crew.Cassandra dreams of becoming a writer. When two rich American brothers and their mother move in next door, well she believes that she has found her heroes and her story. And so indeed a story, actually several stories unfold into wonderful tales of adventure and romance in 1930's England. You see the world of well-born bohemians, subtle class snobberies, interwar London and lots of romance through the eyes of the young Cassandra. You also see-and feel-Cassandra maturing and growing into a woman through her experiences.I would recommend this book highly to individuals (most likely women) who enjoy coming-of-age stories, romances, and English life tales in the interwar period. A warning: this book is very well-written, but well-written through the eyes of a 17-year old. That may not be your taste--other reviewers have found it a young person's book. Yes it is--but you don't have to be young in years to enjoy it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The thing about this book is its unique voice. Tied up in the first person narrative of a seventeen year old girl keeping a journal so to hone her writing skills, \\"capturing\\" dialogue, character and action is a groundswell of comedy, cultural satire and dramatic irony, not to mention some sharp insights about love and coming of age. There are whiffs of a number of literary forebears and contemporaries such as Nancy Mitford, William Dean Howells, Shakespeare, P.G. Wodehouse, Stella Gibbons, and Jane Austen, but thanks to the inimitable voice of Cassandra Mortmain, this reads as if it were the first story about mixed up love or sisters whose once well-established family has fallen on sore times.The plot, so much as can be easily and fairly revealed: between the wars in rural Suffolk, the Mortmain family lives in a 13th century ruin of a leaky castle that was somewhat fixed up in the 17th century, with some remuddling by the Victorians. The father is a one-book genius who after an unfortunate moment with a cake knife, the humor of which escaped the judge, entered into writer's block. There have been no residuals from the book in some time. The household he is not supporting also consists of Cassandra's bohemian stepmother Topaz, Cassandra's older sister Rose, her younger brother Thomas, and Stephen, the orphaned son of their former maid who has a crush on Cassandra and is also the only one in the household who is capable of producing the slightest income. The women troop about in odd costumes made from disintegrating wardrobes. For Cassandra, this is simply the way it is, and for Rose, it is a horror from which to escape. Enter the wealthy American heirs of the recently deceased landlord, two brothers and their family dynamics. A number of plot lines take off: Will both Rose and Cassandra find true love and with whom? Will father write again? Will Cassandra figure out what makes people tick, an essential component to writing? The plot complications are endless.This is smart, unsentimental, and often very funny. The secondary characters are well-defined and a hoot, too. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"My friend recommended the movie, and I went to the web and found its website, which intrigued me into finding a used copy on amazon.com. I also did investigations into the other writings of Dodie Smith, and was entranced to know that her fame came largely from \\"101 Dalmatians\\".Well, my trade paperback copy arrived and I immediately plunged into the tale of the crazy family of Cassandra Mortmain, the story teller, and their state of poverty of the upper class in England. Actually, it is amazing that her father, James, a one book author now stymied by writer's block, should submit his second wife and three children to such an austere life, one that is supported by the son of a now deceased housekeeper that the family took in during better times.Cassandra's sister, Rose, plots to marry the property's rich owner, which leads one into an examination of the truth of intentions: money over poverty in the guise of love. And the seduction of Simon Cotton, landed gentry with American background, gives Cassandra quite a tale to tell.Cassandra is the love object of Stephen, the serving woman's son. And she dodges his determined suit, though touchingly receiving his gifts. His dedication to the Mortmains and to Cassandra in particular parallels a knight who serves the damsel in tales of old.There is remarkable strength in the character of lively Topaz, James Mortmain's second, and much younger, wife. She truly holds the family together, and the three Mortmain children seem to respect her as a step-mother who is not much older than they. In fact, the whole Mortmain family is oddity personified; yet, they are deliciously quirky and enjoyable. The setting of Scoatney Castle and the remains in which they live, horribly cold in winter, lacking light and adequate food, but rich in spring and summer, is as much a character as any of the cast.And the American heirs, the Cottons, contrast with the very English Mortmains in social customs and income. The lavish circumstances that Rose enjoys with Simon's family once they go to London gives off visions of a lively between-the-wars British society in dazzling costumes of the 1920's and '30's.I am so glad that I ordered this book. It kept me reading day and night for a couple of days. It swept me into Cassandra's world and into a vivid period of her coming of age. The honesty of its telling made it even more delightful.Now, I am ready to see the movie. I only hope it holds up to Dodie Smith's original book. If it fails, I still have my personal vision of the novel to satisfy me. How nice to discover another lovely read and to be captured by it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I stumbled over a 40-year-old copy of this book at my in-law's house last spring when they were trying to get rid of some of their thousands of books. After reading the first sentence, I simply could not put it down!Dodie Smith's writing is vivid and captivating, and her characters are all well-defined and interesting, whether you find them likable or not. A year later, I can close my eyes and see myself as Cassandra, performing my Midsummer's Eve rituals.This book is utterly charming, without becoming drippy. The characters are gritty and real enough to keep from falling into stereotypes. On the one hand, the story is a conventional fairy tale of marrying off daughters to handsome, moneyed boys and solving the poor family's financial crisis, but on the other hand it is completely UNconventional, allowing the narrator to have very un-fairy tale-like thoughts and experiences.I am delighted to see this book back in print! It is a wonderful read, so just buy it and read it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I was recommended this book by a friend who is a voracious reader. I forgot about it until working at the library, a copy fell into my hands. I remembered the friend, and borrowed the book. For several days I slowly read it and was mad at myself for having neglected this fine work. The narrator, Cassandra, is a girl on the brink of womanhood in the middle of a sad and terribly amusing dysfunctional family. Her family includes her genius of a father, who spends his days teetering on the brink of mental collapse; her stepmother, Topaz, a ridiculous woman with a heart of gold; Rose, the sister, heartless until her heart breaks; and their loyal servant, Stephen, who is the only one on the premises with the brains and brawn to earn the money they so need so badly. They live together in a beautiful ruin of a castle, caught in almost a dream of poverty, until one day two vistors arrive and change their future forever. I fell in love with Stephen, and I love this book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book really has no equal. I first read it when I was fourteen, and find that I appreciate better now at 32 than I did then. I am delighted to see it revived. The boost it's gotten from J.K. Rowling, however, has proved a bit of a mixed blessing. Many people seem to infer from her endorsement that it's of a genre with her writing. In fact, this is not fantasy, but a beautiful evocation of the life of an observant teenager in 1930's England. Highly recommended for artists, writers, and Anglophiles. And may I suggest: &quot;The Death of the Heart,&quot; by Elizabeth Bowen, for an alternate existence to Cassandra's."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first read I Capture the Castle in junior high school almost 30 years ago and then as a young adult I bought a copy of the 1948 published hardback from a bargain book table at an antique store for fifty cents. I was quite amazed when I found it by accident while searching on Amazon. I am so very pleased that it has been re-released because this is one of my favorite books and I'm happy to know there is the possibility for others to meet the main character, Cassandra Mortmain and her family. I have re-read it many times over the years and treasure my bargain copy. It remains as fascinating as the first time I read it and I can't recommend it highly enough. It is beautifully written and is a book that can be enjoyed by book lovers of any sex, both young and old."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I have long adored this book! I am so pleased to see so many discovering and rediscovering it. I would like to share a letter I received from Dodie Smith in 1985, when she so kindly responded to a letter I wrote to her. She replied:Dear Lynn Hudson, Very many thanks for a particularily kind letter. &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; was first published in 1948, 37 years ago and yet I still get letters about it, from old friends like you and also, occasionaly, from new friends. I'm astonished and proud that it has lasted so long. I've written other novels and two of my childrens' books continue to be succesful, (paticularily The Hundred and one Dalmatians), but nothing (for me anyway) means as much as ICTC&gt; Where did those characters come from? They are not drawn from life. The Castle partly is but I changed it a great deal and I much prefer my own castle! I've been asked again and again to write a sequel to ICTC but I'm sure I never could. I don't even like to think of the future of the characters because I don't want them to grow older. I've been asked again and again to say whom Cassandra marries but I've no idea. I like to think of her just hopeful for the future and I shall let myself think you and I share this idea.

I rarely react to a book so strongly that it leaves me with a pleasant glow days after I have read it. Magically, this book manages to be the warmest, most positive, least cloying story I have ever read (even the end is satisfying without being a cop-out). It is beautifully written with an amazing sense of place, atmosphere and character. Who couldn't fall in love with Cassandra with her quick wit, intelligence and unconventional outlook? I have rarely read such an unpatronising, accurate and positive account of a girl on the brink of adulthood. Read ICTC for the cleverly constructed plot. Read it for the descriptive passages and the evocation of time and place. Read it for the distinctive and endearingly eccentric characters, especially the narrator, Cassandra. Just read it. And don't think you have to be a woman to love this book. I am a guy in his late twenties who intends to pass on my copy of the book to most of my friends - male and female - under the strict condition that it is returned in mint condition!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The plot of \\"I Capture the Castle\\" sounds, on its surface, a little Cinderella-y: two genteely impoverished sisters of between-the-wars Britain live in a ruined castle with their eccentric novelist father and his bohemian wife Topaz. (If you want a taste of author Dodie Smith's ability to write funny characters, bear in mind she is also the author of \\"101 Dalmations\\").Two wealthy American brothers move in next door; although they are initially blinded by sister Rose's classic beauty, eventually one of them (I won't say which) sees the depth of character behind the narrator, the more sincere and thoughtful Cassandra.Cassandra is an enchanting narrator (the book is a series of first-person entries into her journal) - she is witty, self-effacing, and completely authentic. The reader will absolutely believe she is a real, irreplacable person.I was so enamored of Cassandra that at first I worried for her when she fell in love - I was worried about a too-convenient fairy-tale ending. But happily the \\"happily ever after\\" is replaced by a more intriguing end; Cassandra's final decision is perfectly consistent with her chracter.I only wish I had read this when I was, like her, a teenager - it would have meant a lot to me to meet a character so ambitious, energetic, lively, funny, who still clearly has romance in her future."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, an aspiring author, is keeping a journal in which she chronicles her life in a ramshackle old English castle. Life is not easy for the Mortmains. Most of the family's possessions and furnishings have been sold off, they do without electricity, and there is barely enough to eat. In spite of all this, the family keeps a cheerful outlook and manages to get by, thanks in part to the generosity of the wealthy American Cotton family who has inherited the estate upon which the castle sits and who have taken the Mortmains under their wing.The Mortmains are an offbeat family. Cassandra has flights of fancy and unusual schemes that often have unexpected results. Father, an eccentric and innovative writer, is suffering from severe writer's block and can no longer support the family. He spends his time holed up in the gatehouse reading novels. Stepmother Topaz is a flighty artist's model who enjoys roaming the estate in the buff. Cassandra's older sister Rose is tired of living hand-to-mouth, and she decides to find a way to marry the landlord's wealthy grandson. Handsome Stephen, a hired hand who stays on with the family even though the Mortmains cannot afford to pay him, has difficulty hiding his unrequited love for Cassandra.First published in 1948 and set in the 1930s, the story has an old-fashioned feel to it, especially on the subject of courtship and marriage. It also highlights the cultural differences at that time between the Americans and the British. Possessing a wisdom and maturity beyond her years, Cassandra spends much time analyzing the people and events that surround her and then recording her observations. &quot;Contemplation,&quot; she says, &quot;seems to be about the only luxury that costs nothing.&quot; Through her journals, Cassandra's voice is sometimes funny, sometimes poignant, and always endearing as she describes her concerns, her hopes, and her first love. &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; is recommended for both young adults and adults as a warm coming-of-age story.Eileen Rieback"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"After I read a very short synopsis of this book, I knew it was a MUST HAVE. The only dissapointment was that it was not long enough. Cassandra Mortmain makes you want to be seventeen again. She narrates to you the very width and depth of her life during probably the most important summer of her life -- the summer she falls in love. It is a story about growing up, getting on, and making do. The fact that it is set in a ruined castle on the English countryside just drags the reader in deeper and deeper into Cassandra's realm.I read the book in two sittings, then I passed it on to my best friend. She too fell madly in love with Cassandra Mortmain, her beautiful sister Rose, and all the delightful characters that come to life for the reader throughout this book.I CAPTURE THE CASTLE is a book for all ages.

A while later she phoned to say: \\"It was SO perfect, I don't want to read anything else for a long while--I want to savor it.\\" We chatted about the multifaceted charm of this novel, and compared it favorably with the film based on it, which we both had seen on DVD.\\"On the 5th day of Christmas\\", 2006, I visited and found my friend dead in her bed--she seems to have died peacefully in her sleep. My book was on the table in her living room. In the days following I thoughtfully re-read the volume, thinking at every page how my late friend would have delighted at the offbeat wit and each nimble turn of phrase.--And for the first time, I was struck by the small but important role of the Vicar (who \\"looked like an elderly baby\\"), and noticed the \\"stealth comfort\\" he administers to the non-practising, nominally Christian protagonist, when late in the story she is confused and depressed by situations beyond her control. It may well have been the last reference to the comfort of religion which my friend read, which is felicitious; for she reminded me much of the main character in her views on God and religion.I am grateful to be granted the grace of giving my friend the pleasure of such an enchanting \\"last novel\\". I will savour that gentle and whimsical Providence (not unlike something which could have happened in the book) for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is the first sentence of _I Capture the Castle_, and it's got to be one of the all-time greatest first sentences (along with &quot;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife,&quot; from _Pride and Prejudice_, and &quot;There was a boy called Eustace Clarence Scrubb, and he almost deserved it,&quot; from _The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'_).The narrator is Cassandra Mortmain, a 17-year-old who lives in a broken-down castle in Suffolk with her eccentric family: her father James, a writer suffering from a years-long case of writers' block; her stepmother Topaz, an artists' model who has a tendency toward outdoors nudism; her elder sister Rose, a beauty who desperately wants to escape the family's poverty-stricken life; her precocious younger brother Thomas; and Stephen, the son of a late family servant who is now the Mortmains' only breadwinner (and Cassandra's ardent admirer).Into their lives come the Cotton brothers, Simon and Neil, from America; Simon has just inherited the nearby Scoatney Hall, and Rose immediately sets out to capture him, thereupon setting in motion the train of events chronicled by Cassandra.The foremost appeal of _I Capture the Castle_ is Cassandra's voice and personality, which infuses the book with her wit, charm, and innocence and makes you feel as though you know Cassandra and her family and friends intimately. I've heard people criticize the ending, which certainly does not tie it all up in a neat resolution, but to me, that's a strength of the book: you feel that the characters can continue beyond the last page, because their futures are in doubt, and you can conjecture to your heart's delight about what might happen to them."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Dodie Smith may be best-known as the author of The One Hundred and One Dalmatians, but she was the author of many hit West End plays and several best-selling books. If you enjoy mid-20th-century British fiction, may I recommend a perfect gem of a novel, back in print after many years a-languishing: I Capture the Castle, told in first-person narration by Cassandra Mortmain, the younger daughter of a family of impoverished eccentrics living in a small run-down castle in the British countryside, as she tries to &quot;capture&quot; her life in her private journal. Her father is a once-famous writer with a seemingly-insurmountable case of writer's block; her stepmother Topaz is an unusually-gorgeous former model with pretentions of artistry and a loving heart; her beloved sister Rose is hungry for some sort--any sort!--of change. Into this almost Austen-like situation comes Simon, the new landlord, an upper-class American from New England, along with his informal younger brother, raised in California, and their &quot;club woman&quot; mother, and suddenly the potentials and possibilities and coincidences become endlessly interesting...Will Simon propose to Rose? Will Mortmain ever write again? Will Cassandra's swain kiss her in the bluebell wood? Perhaps it doesn't sound like much, but it's engaging and endearing, a period-piece with &quot;good bones&quot; and long-lasting, pleasurable resonance, still holding up well after half a century on the shelves.On my top-40 list, certainly, if not my top-10. I can't recommend this one highly enough."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"There are a lot of books out there with famous first lines. A Tale of Two Cities, for example: who hasn't heard \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\"?This book should be added to the list. I really don't think \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink\\" could be improved upon in any way.And it gets better from there.I accidentally saw the movie first- which you should NEVER do. Seven-eighths of the charm of this story is in the first-person narration. The plotline itself is not all that impressive. In fact, when I explained the basic gist to Josh, it sounded a bit like a trashy grocery-store novel. Which proves, I guess, that you can never judge a book by its outline.It is the diary of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain. Cassandra's author father got a 40-year lease on a crumbling old castle in the English countryside, because he felt its romantic essence would spark his dried-up creative juices. On the contrary, his writer's block stretches over two decades, and the family's income dwindles to nothing. Cassandra and her sister Rose spend most of their time imagining their lives differently, until, one day, two wealthy brothers move into a nearby mansion.The ensuing drama unfolds in a predictable manner; but you won't mind, because the telling is so delicious. Cassandra's perspective brings so much whimsy and honesty and real-life-ness to an otherwise cliched and lachrymose tale. Each gleaming insight, every subtly hilarious description, along with the book's vaguely silly characters, adds up into an artfully winsome experience- a bittersweet yet somehow enormously enjoyable read. It's become one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is the 1930's coming-of-age story of 17-year-old Cassandra, who lives in rural Britain with a cast of simultaneously comic and tragic family and friends. During the spring, summer, and autumn months spanned by the story, she pens a diary that describes her first adult lessons about love, sisterhood, and friendship. Although the voice is believably adolescent, the lessons Cassandra learns are completely adult.\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is beautiful in every way a book should be. It's gentle without being sappy, humorous without being mocking, gorgeously (although a bit painstakingly) written without digressing into flights of narcissistic prose. The narrator is both an ordinary child and an extraordinary woman, and her greatest strength as a character is the believability of her weakness. The other characters are interesting and unusual and completely human. The setting, a barely-refurbished medieval castle, is very nearly a character in its own right, and it informs and interacts with the story in a way I've rarely seen outside of the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez.The book, with all of its lyricism and innocence and wise optimism, teaches a gentle and almost invisible lesson. It's about learning to love fairly and accept love gracefully, about being faithful to your friends even when it hurts, about who constitutes a family and how one goes about caring for them, about how growing up is not the end of a the road but the beginning. It's not a new lesson, but it's one we all need to learn a little more.But \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is more than a beautiful book, and more than a lesson. It's an experience. It's as if Jane Austen had been reborn 130 years later and rewritten \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" with a compassion and magic her original work missed. Or as if \\"Little Women\\" had been written for adults: just as so many little girls start their own \\"Pickwick Papers\\" and take to eating apples in attics after reading Alcott's book, after reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\" I wanted to find a ruin in Britain, fit it with indoor plumbing, and spend the timeless days of summer sitting in the tower and penning a journal of my own days and dreams and loves."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read this book because it was the monthly selection of my book club. The glowing reviews on amazon captured my imagination and did not prepare me for the disappointment ahead. I think the book might be truly appealing...if you are younger than sixteen. For a middle-aged mother of college students, the love-starved 17-year old Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine totally at the mercy of her heart, left me untouched.The author did a wonderful job of capturing teen-age angst over unrequited love, but none of the characters were what I would call appealing, or even mildly sympathetic. Cassandra Mortmain, the heroine whose journal we as readers are privvy to, lives in an ancient castle with her father, step-mother, brother, and sister. The family is now dirt poor thanks to a writer father who was a one-hit wonder and does nothing now but hole up in his private gatehouse. The sister is busy batting her eyelashes as she really wants to marry a wealthy man who will save her from her life of poverty and the brother is never completely developed, though we do get inklings near the end that he may be the most normal of the family. Only the stepmother has any desire to help herself. While the rest of the family consider themselves too good to do an honest day's work, the stepmother travels to London and earns money as an artist's model. The others had rather sit home and munch on old bread crusts while bemoaning their plight. It was really hard for me to empathize with such a group.The book is very reminiscent of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" though it is set later, in 1940's England. It is very much a coming of age story of a young girl who, through the course of the novel, finds love, loses love, rejects love, and yet \\"captures\\" all the feelings and characters around her as she spends hour after hour writing in her journal as an exercise in teaching herself how to write.In the opening pages, Cassandra tells the reader that she will capture all the conversations, feelings, and characters in her life. That she does, but for this reader, it was a disappointing story that failed to interest me."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I devoured the beginning and couldn't wait to finish. The characters were eccentric and amusing; I found myself easily caught up in wondering what it would be like to meet the bohemian Topaz, sturdy Thomas, bold Neil, and innocent Cassandra. The descriptions were also marvelously evocative of a madcap family amidst a quaint life of genteel poverty. But then Cassandra's journal writing started getting bogged down since the imagery was written at an adult level, but the entries moved from descriptive passages to an adolescent emotional level. It was understandable because Cassandra was so naive but I believe I might have enjoyed it more if I were able to identify with or be interested in all the angst of who loved whom and who was doomed to disappointment in the maze of Stephen loves Cassandra loves Simon loves Rose loves Neil. Mainly I was VERY dissatisfied at the ending since there was no closure and I thought the last chapter was missing. What happens to Cassandra? What about Stephen? What about Simon? What about ...?Simon to Cassandra, \\"Because it's the essence of an enigma that one must solve it for oneself.\\" Very apt."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"While enjoyable, this book is overrated.

The narrator/main character is twee, irritating and too dominant when drawing out the other characters in the book. Her voice is never lost.

I like novels written as journals, because the characters and their stories become so much more personal. Cassandra's journal makes me want to write."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain has asked for very few things in life: that her family would never reach that point known as abject starvation, that her father rouse himself enough to pick the pen up once again, and that no one turn them away from that tumbledown heap of ruins called the Castle (and more familiarly known as \`home'). Even if they are practically *un*paying tenants.Sensible, fiercely affectionate towards her beautiful (if slightly temperamental) elder sister, Rose, and aware of the infinite magnanimity of the world as compared to the transience of one person's existence, she takes each day as it comes and never lets herself become *too* jaded as another dusk unfurls into another dawn, their family's fortunes seemingly not ever showing signs of taking a turn for the good. There is simple joy to be had in finding a spot atop Belmotte Tower, with a view of the wheat field spread all around glinting drunkenly from the sun's rays, and jotting down into her journal both the curious and innocuous happenings in her and her family's life.It is, however, with the somewhat surreal introduction of the brothers Simon and Neil Cotton that tumble Cassandra's relatively peaceful existence into disarray.As coming-of-age novels go, I would admit to not immediately seeing \\"I Capture the Castle\\" as one. In some respects, I was more riveted with the bits of quirks inherent in the story. There is the paradox of the cold isolation and the elegant deterioration of the Castle itself. Half-standing walls vie for the same space as ivy creepers which lend the estate a sedate kind of beauty. Mists that come out of nowhere can enshroud the ruins like something out of a gothic tableau, while the next sunny day bathes those same walls with a warm, comfortable glow.The characters themselves are a walking contradiction. The elder Mortmain sister, Rose, while blessed with looks, is filled more with bitterness for their dismal state of affairs. Their scrumptious stepmother, the glitteringly-named Topaz, has nocturnal forays atop the ramparts clad only in her nightgown, her \`commune with nature' an oddity that is aptly fitting with *her* own nature. And yet she has managed to keep this family from totally unraveling.Cassandra's father, who long-ago wrote a novel considered a masterpiece by the literary community (the contents of which are tantalizingly never fully disclosed), has now hit a wall and refuses to budge. He passes his days more like a hermit, his head up in the clouds, while his family is sunk deep in the ground with poverty. The only times there's a hint of animated life in his eyes is when he is quizzed by outsiders as to when they should expect his next novel.His response is a snarl.Simon Cotton is born in England but bred on the other side of the Atlantic, the resulting strange accent befuddling Cassandra at first. And if that were not enough, the jarringly peculiar and menacing dark beard he sports is at odds with someone his age, oftentimes preventing people from noticing how generous and kind he really is. His younger brother, Neil, is the full-blooded American. Jocular at one second, and brooding in the next. His American bent obvious in the sometimes faintly jeering attitude he has towards anything English. And yet he is quick to seek pardon if he thinks he has caused offense.Cassandra's encounter with these Americans and their ways of thinking would almost always rattle her, compelling her to remark silently that \\"Americans do seem to say things which make the English notice England.\\"Then there's our young narrator. On the whole, content with her lot in life, yet she would not shirk from any opportunity that might just turn the fates in their favor. She is even-tempered and more tolerant than most, her vow to be a good writer (or, at least, a credible chronicler of the Mortmain family drama) making her an exceptional observer of events. On the outset, she knows her family more than, it seems, they know themselves. And yet, as the novel unfolds, she would find herself wondering just how much she might have misread the people around her.And, perhaps, even herself.Subtly engaging, unexpectedly poignant at times, and even witty with its bouts of one-liner maxims, Dodie Smith carves out a heroine worth adoring. Cassandra is on that ambiguous threshold of being a young girl who should have had so many teenage thrills as befits someone growing up, and being swayed headlong into full womanhood, as evidenced by the unnerving introspection she has had on occasion to indulge in. She can laugh and lark about just like any young, carefree kid, but she is also highly-sensitive of the feelings of others and is often crippled with annoyance with herself and with another person if they should cause her discomfort for being concerned over *them* in the first place.Unquestionably proud of her family, she could also be thrown into pits of despair and mortification when one of them commits a faux pas in front of \`sociable' company. More than once she has had to be the mature one among her relatives, while, at the same time, inwardly shaking with trepidation or embarrassment.And it is with the unfurling of the first seeds of romantic love that she realizes the depths of her passion. She discovers a side of her nature that would cause her joy as well as grief. She may look unchanged on the outside but within there brews a turmoil the likes of which just might shake the very foundation of all that she has held eternal.And what she fears most is the uncertainty of *who* might emerge by the time this havoc settles.A tour de force, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" would ensnare one's attention with a quietly plucky heroine. There are no high-blazing action scenes or spine-tingling suspenseful moments in this novel, but the unhurried exploits and simply clever insights in life make this a veritable treasure."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a great story narrated by a teenager, Cassandra Mortmain, who sets out to capture the crumbling castle she lives in with her family in a series of notebooks. Also living in the castle are Rose, her sardonic older sister, Thomas, her brother, her father, a writer whose first novel, Jacob Wrestling, is followed by years of writer's block, her step-mother Topaz, a flighty former model and Stephen, the eighteen year old son of their former maid who had nowhere to go when his mother died, now does odd jobs for the family and has a crush on Cassandra.The family becomes involved with two brothers from America, Simon and Neil, who inherit the castle they live in and the surrounding estate. They court the two sisters and through her involvement with them, Cassandra comes of age.Dodie Smith gives Cassandra a really unique and authentic voice with a strong personality and witty and somewhat innocent outlook on life. The story and the characters are charming with a very humorous cast of eccentric English characters. I was a bit sorry to see Rose, the older sister, lose her acerbic and hopeless attitude when one of the Americans begins courting her.

Dodie Smith, more famously remembered for her children's classic 101 Dalmatians, has humorously assembled an eccentric cast of characters living in less than genteel poverty in a crumbling castle in England. The story is revealed through 17-year old heroine in the making and aspiring writer Cassandra Mortmain in a series of journals, an she attempt to improve her skills as a ticket out of her dire circumstances. Her sister Rose will use more avarice means to free herself from her parent's neglect by setting her cap for their wealthy new landlord Simon, and easily succeeds. Less of a schemer, Cassandra is attracted to his younger brother Neil and is hopeful for her own romance. As the wedding plans proceed, Rose's vain and selfish nature blossoms with her newly elevated social position causing conflict. Cassandra, left out of the plans and Simon, who Rose is treating as an annoyance are drawn into their own romance. Rose, on the other hand, is drifting away from Simon and secretly into the arms of his brother Neil. An elopement will cause a family panic, a change of heart and an unusual ending.Filled with allusions to Pride and Prejudice, this coming of age story is more a gentle nod to Austen's style than a copy of her novel. Witty and moving, Smith connects with readers through perceptive observation played against dry wit resulting in a moving and memorable story. It's what makes for great literature, and also what Austen is valued for today.

The results carry the family (with a narrator reminiscent of those created by Nancy Mitford)into situations both absurd and absorbing, but always with a warmth and wisdon that does not fail to charm."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"It seems redundant to add my voice to the chorus of admirers, but I can't resist. This is one of my favorite books; I, too, have read it over and over. I don't quite understand why I love this book so deeply. Yes, it's beautifully written, with a very real main character and a story that both celebrates romantic convention and twists it into some surprising knots. It's a strange and wonderful combination of psychological reality with a wildly improbable plot and some very weird supporting characters. It's intellectually and artistically sophisticated without being stuffy or pretentious. But it's not just that. Somehow, this book got to a part of me that very few books do. I treasure it for that reason."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book is like a gift, and everyone who reads it wants to share it.I first received a copy from a complete stranger -- a participant in a newsgroup discussion at rec.arts.books.childrens. When I mentioned that I'd never read the book, she sent me an old, well-worn copy in the mail. She wouldn't even accept payment. Now that it's back in print, it's on my gift list for half a dozen people. ICTC is intellectual without pretension, romantic without mush, comic without jokes. It's simply magic."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It might be considered a &quot;woman's novel&quot; in the vein of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Antonia White, or Colette. The protagonist, Cassandra, a very bright and sensitive 17 year old writer, makes one want to move to a medieval castle in England. She has a very perceptive and wise view of life for a young woman, and captures the pains and joys of falling in love to which women of all ages can relate. Just a fabulous book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a book you will read many times through your life. There is joy, sorrow. and humor. You will always be happy to have read this book. Try to find the author's other books- 'It Ends With Revalations', 'A Tale of Two Families','The New Moon With The Old', 'The Town In Bloom', and, of course, 'The One Hundred and One Dalmatians'."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"My mother had an original bookclub edition of this and I have it, earnestly annotated in my adolescent hand. My sisters now have copies collected at book sales over the past 30 years. My daughter loves it now. Seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain wants to be a writer and fills three journals with the tale of a year in '30's England...her writer-father in the middle of an unexplicable dry period, her step-mother Topaz who &quot;communes with nature&quot; in the nude, her beautiful but discontented sister Rose, Stephen the young hired-man and the exciting American brothers who inherit the great house in the neighborhood. &quot;Which do you like better, Jane Austen with a touch of Charlotte Bronte, or Charlotte Bronte with a touch of Jane Austen?&quot; is the kind of question the sisters ponder until real life becomes much more interesting. A lovely book that hasn't aged a bit."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Not just romance in terms of love (although there's plenty of that too - sweet, innocent, wonderful and heartbreaking) but the romance of the time and the setting and the characters are what's so great about this book. Swimming in a castle moat by moonlight; bathing in front of the fire; hot tea on a cold, dark, English night; a beautiful stepmother named Topaz. If that sounds good to you, you'll love I CAPTURE THE CASTLE!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This mid twentieth century novel of English girlhood moved me very much as a teenager; now, on rereading it, I appreciate even more its treatment of everything from hunger and nascent sexuality to the puzzles of literary modernism. Represented as a series of journals (with all the questions implied in that form) the novel has both the kooky charm of other midcentury social comedies (think Thirkell and Sharpe) and a much more serious love for and appreciation of the complications of female adolescence and literary creativity. Give it to your daughter and then borrow it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I found this book on my recommendations list on amazon.com and decided to give it a try. I ordered a copy and thought it might please me, although I thought it would never compare to Jane Austen or Fanny Burney. I began to read it, and was shocked at how well it was written, and in first person journal form. I immediately fell in love with the style of writing, but also with the main characters. This book has a little bit of everything, despair, romance, a coming of age story, a dysfunctional family, lies and deceit, pain and loss, mental illness, different settings. I read it twice, and then told all of my close friends to read it. I went on amazon and ordered copies and had them sent to my friends across the country. I couldn't believe that a book written by the same woman who wrote 101 Dalmations could be this good of a coming of age story for teens and adults. I am in awe of the story within this book, and I HIGHLY recommend reading it. I hope you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Why have I just now read this book, at almost thirty years old? I wish I had discovered it as a teen! That way I could have read it ten times by now!! I loved it so much. Such a beautiful setting! What woman hasn't dreamed of living in a castle? In beautiful England! With an eccentric family! With handsome, mysterious, new neighbors?? Perfect!!

Sorry Dodie, but i just coldn't get past the first 7 chapters...it got really boring. i guess you could say that i shouldn't base my review on only 7 chapters...but seriously, the fact that i couldn't finish the book is the reason why i felt obliged to write down that i didn't llike tho book. i realize that many people loved this book, which is great..i just didn't. thats just me."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"its about this teenager, cassandra, she lives in this romantic castle but her family is increadibly poor. her father used to be a writer but is suffering from writers block and cassandra, who wants to be a writer, starts a journal to improve her skills as shes not suposed to be very good. then this rich family moves near them with two men. cassandra's sister and the rest of the family see them as a way out and rose(the sister) sets out to grab herself a man and some money.its really not all that. i read it because i heard about it in another book but i was very disapointed. the books long without much story and the characters are without charisma. the only thing i can say for it is that it does have some rare points of good description.i'm warning you, if you want a good story, whether your into action, horror, comedy, fantasy or even romance, this will not be it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I had seen the film version of this on cable several years back and remembered enjoying it. The first line of this novel, \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink\\" often comes up on various book trivia lists. So my interest was already piqued when I picked up a remainder copy of the movie tie-in edition at Elliot Bay Books in Seattle. I was interested to discover that it was out of print for many many years and was triumphantly celebrated by the critical media upon its return to publication.17 year old Cassandra Mortmain is a charming and entertaining narrator. She is writing in a journal, but as it is practice for being an actual writer she tries to write her entries as she would a novel, with all dialogue recorded and true honesty when it comes to all the characters in her story, herself included.She attempts to \\"capture\\" the story of her family as they live in poverty in an old ramshackle castle in the English countryside during the 1930s. There is love, and bohemia, and mystery, and adventure and confusion and hilarity and a little sadness too. I really felt for these characters and was dreading the end of the story when I would have to leave them.I adored this book. I know I will reread it. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read the book, and watched the movie. I loved the book more. It is definitely worth your time. I read a long time ago, but I am still writing a review encouraging others to read it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"When it comes to literature, I am a very critical person but I capture the castle was a wonderful read. It is one of the best books and it is really a rare gem you will find. The character is a sharp, intelligent narrator who writes in a diary, telling the readers of her family life and problems.The scenes are very well written and they paint a very good picture for the imagination. it was not a book I could just breeze through. The only thing I didn't like was when the character at some point got confused in love matters and showed an interest in her sister's lover. So while the book was really wonderful, the ending I feel could have been different. All in all, it is definitely worth a try and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I love this book so much that I've probably read it a dozen times-at least once a year.I will caution that it is not a happy-go-lucky book. It's full of some self aware teenage angst, and that's part of why I enjoy it. It's a book I love to read when I want to feel bad with someone else, about someone else's problems- the main character, Cassandra's. But it's not a tragic book, and while you may cry a time or two (or possibly, I'm just one of those people who cries over books) you'll enjoy doing it.Two thumbs up, and five stars. Fully recommend buying a copy!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I have heard a lot of chatter recently about this book and I have been meaning to read it for quite some time now. I'm so glad I took the opportunity to purchase it and I am saddened that I did not read this book when I was younger because it has so much youthful hope for life and the ending shares with readers the beautiful transformation of a young girl into a young woman.The story is told through seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain who lives with her family in a crumbling castle in the English countryside. Her father wrote one popular and widely acclaimed novel but has not managed to write a second follow up. Needless to say the family is struggling to get by and has sold most of their furniture and other household items in order to survive. Cassandra and her older, beautiful sister Rose have fun comparing themselves to the Bennett sisters in Pride and Prejudice or characters from a Charlotte Bronte novel. To the family's surprise and delight two American brothers inherit the property next door and the relationships between the families lead to changing within the walls, first love and the discovery of self.Like Cassandra, I wish I could find the right words to describe how much I enjoyed this book but I know that I will never be able to capture all of the emotions and feelings I had while reading it. Cassandra fills up three journals with funny, witty and poetic observations about her life and the people she knows and lives with. She is a wonderful and fascinating heroine and I enjoyed every word she wrote. At first I had some reservations about reading this book because it is written as journal entries but I after reading the book I feel that this gave me such a connection with Cassandra. She becomes a wonderful and endearing character and as I got to watch this period of her life along with her I begin to learn so much about her and ultimately myself. Her assent into first love is so touching, sweet and sad that I begin to fear for her feelings and wellbeing almost as if I was experiencing falling in love for the first time again myself.At first, I found myself a bit disappointed with the ending because I wanted things to turn out well for her but looking back I realized what a wonderful ending to Cassandra's story it is. Be prepared, it is sad, but what Cassandra choses to do is so in tune with the woman she becomes I admire it and appreciate it more. It has been such a long time since I read a book that made me feel like a teenager again and affected all of my emotions. I know that I will be reading this book again many times in the future and it ranks up at the top of my list of my favorite books."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"J.K. Rowling says \\"this book has one of the most charismatic narrators I've ever met\\"* which certainly influenced me to buy the book because I don't think I've ever seen a J.K. Rowling blurb on a book. However, it was a blog post by Elizabeth Bluemle \\"Characters You'd Let Your Daughter Date\\" (http://blogs.publishersweekly.com/blogs/shelftalker/?p=1503) that moved I Capture the Castle from the shelf to the \\"to-be-read\\" pile. I was curious about this Stephen character and his marriage potential. But that is just what caused me to pick the book up, there is SO MUCH more to love about it.First, it has one of the best first lines I've ever read: \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink.\\" If that doesn't want to make you read on, I don't know what will. Second, the narrator is utterly charming. She is captivating, innocent yet serious, she knows who she wants to be but recognizes the challenges that lay ahead of her. She confronts first love head on and survives when both parties end up disappointed. She wants to be a writer and she invites the reader into her deepest thoughts, wishes and dreams and you love her for it. She's smart, funny, sarcastic and dramatic as she attempts to \\"capture\\" the castle.I'm neither the first person to say it nor will I be the last, Cassandra and her family will absolutely capture your heart. Here are few other of my favorite quotes:\\"I was wandering around as usual, in my unpleasantly populated sub-conscious...\\"\\"Americans do seem to say things which make the English notice England.\\"\\"I only want to write. And there's no college for that except life.\\"\\"...I have noticed that when things happen in one's imaginings, they never happen in one's life, so I am curbing myself.\\"*this quote was taken from the back cover"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"It really kept my interest and I could not wait to get to read it any chance that I had.The author did a great job sharing Cassandra's adolescent issues in the first person. In fact, it was disturbing at times to be reminded of how difficult it was to be that age. A lot of the story and situation was far fetched but it portrayed an atypical dysfunctional family very well and I felt the frustration I feel when I see dysfunction in real families, including my own. It wasn't really a happy ending and I definitely prefer happy endings. In fact, as much as it kept my interest, I feel mildly depressed just having finished it.It's not \\"classic\\" material but it is definitely bestseller quality."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I love this book--this is my second time reading it and it is just as wonderful as the first. It is rare for a novel to transport me into its world as thoroughly as this one does. When I read this story, I am Cassandra Mortmain--I see what she sees, I feel what she feels. On every page, the author captures a moment or makes an observation that resonates with such authenticity that I am taken back to similar moments in my life and I remember that, yes, they are just like she portrays them. And what the author portrays so vividly is the agony of being a young girl in love for the first time. It's that awkward phase between girl and woman, the pains, the embarrassments, the enthusiasms--Ms. Smith puts them all on the page for us to relive and recognize. It's wrenching at times, but so absorbing that when I reached the end, I immediately turned back to the beginning so I wouldn't have to say goodbye to Cassandra and the Mortmain family.The story is told through Cassandra's journal entries, and I love how the author effortlessly guides the reader in out of the journal. For long stretches of time, it's easy to forget that we're reading Cassandra's diary. But then we dip back into it as Cassandra tells us she's tired of writing or notes how long it's taken her to record a particular event--and even in one case, how she waited too long to record an event and can only give us general impressions of it. The author has a masterful way of using the journal format to her advantage and never letting it limit the story. And I love how, even though the story is told exclusively through Cassandra's viewpoint, the author is still able to show us things through Cassandra's eyes that Cassandra doesn't necessarily see.The 101 Dalmatians, also by Dodie Smith, was one of my favorite books as a child, but I didn't discover \\"I Capture the Castle\\" until adulthood. I'm sorry I didn't have the pleasure of reading this as a girl, but I doubt I could have loved it any more than I do now."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The Mortmain family were once financially well off. James Mortmain had written a wonderfully successful novel, but that was a long time ago. Years have now passed and James has not written anything! Over time, his wife died and he was left with three children. However, he did find a new love with a beautiful and exotic model by the name of Topaz. When times were good, James had leased a castle for his family. A romantic endeavor, but now the family are very poor. The castle is terribly run down and over the last few years any furniture of value has been sold. James can't or won't write another story. His fans want another book and no one can understand why James can't produce one!Topaz dearly loves her husband and does her best as a step-mother. The children seem to have a good relationship with her. The daughters are Rose, who at twenty-one is quite beautiful, and seventeen year old Cassandra who is a wonderful and colorful character. Thomas, the only son is still in school, but anxious to grow up and see the world. A young handsome eighteen year old boy by the name of Stephen also lives with the family. His mother had been the family's maid during better times. After her death, Stephen has stayed on and worked for the Mortmain's doing any chore that was requested of him. He is extremely fond of Cassandra and she worries about what might become of him.The story is set in the 1930's and told by Cassandra. She's absolutely charming in her observations and descriptions of life. She records the happenings of daily life and analyses everything and everyone she interacts with.When the Cotton's, a very wealthy family inherit a neighboring estate, life changes for the impoverished Mortmain's. The girls are dazzled by their new American neighbors, especially Simon and Neil, the two very interesting sons of the family.One note of interest, the author, Dodie Smith also wrote the children's story, The Hundred and One Dalmatians."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"If you like Roahl Dahl or Stella Gibbons, then you will most definitely like this book. I had never heard of it until I read that J.K. Rowling liked it, so I bought it on those merits alone. Glad I did! Thoroughly enjoyable. Castles, gloominess, humor, clashing characters...it has it all."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I saw this book in a flyer for a bookstore. I'd never heard of it before, but the title captured my imagination. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. I identified so much with Cassandra, it was almost scary... I felt like someone had been inside my head and written down some of my thoughts. I so enjoyed this book that I didn't want it to end. I hope this book is discovered by many people. It is so touching, heartwarming, and real. It was a true joy to read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"As a sixteen year old girl, I found Cassandra very easy to relate to. A lot of the thoughts and emotions mentioned in the book really hit home with me, as I'm sure they did and will with other readers. Dodie Smith's writing style is amazing; I was never bored once, always turning page after page to find out where the characters would end up. If you love a touch of romance, a slice of comedy, and a lot of truth, this is the book for you. I Capture the Castle was a fantastic read, one that I will gladly repeat again and again."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Rereading this book after 25 years might have been a disappointment, but it was as good this time and as a more mature reader. Dodie Smith wrote an ageless tale that any woman will find to be poignant, touching and unforgettable. I'm so happy that it is back in print. It will be a top gift choice when I select holiday presents for my friends of all ages. I'm confident that they will remember the characters, as I have, for many years to come."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first read this book when I was 12. It belonged to my aunt and I often wondered what became of her copy. Every summer I was sent to her farm for a 3 month visit and since she had no juvenile books, I got an early start on E. Caldwell, John Steinbeck, Pearl Buck and this wonderful book by Dodie Smith. Thank you for reminding me about it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first heard of this book when Entertainment Weekly gave it an unheard of A+ rating, and thought it sounded fun. After reading it, I became a D. Smith ADDICT and quickly read everything else (unfortunately, thru the library as they are mostly out-of-print) she'd written. The comparisons to J. Austen are apt, but Smith has her own idiosyncratic style. Cassandra Mortmain is a heroine for all times, though and I can well imagine that I too, will become one of the book's devoted fans who will read and re-read and re-read this book for years to come. Yes it really is that good!! As one reviewer put it so succinctly, &quot;What Chanel is to perfume, Dodie Smith is to charm.&quot; Do yourself a big, big favor and discover this utterly delightful book for yourself!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just read this book for the first time, and it is a definite great. I can't think of a better story about young girls confronting the complexity, wonder, and pain of growing up. I would put it in the ranks of Anne of Green Gables, and Little Women. I think boys (teenagers) would also like this book because of the sensitive description of girl's emotions, desires, and ambitions."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I have read this book over and over again and never tire of it. A wonderful story of a teenaged girl in 30s England. I especially love the graphic descriptions: the sunbathing on the castle roof, the night swim round the moat, the magic of the dinner party at the Cottons', the candlelit summerhouse and the fountains, the midsummer rites - I could go on and on, but please read it and discover these joys and so many others for yourself."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I bought this book this summer after hearing a clerk say she read it as a teenager and was afraid to re read for fear that she would not like it as much as an adult... she then said she loved it as an adult. I was surprised at the timelessness of it, yet enjoyed the dated periodness as well.It is a book that you will read and then buy for others as a gift."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"If you loved the movies &quot;A Room With A View&quot; and &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; you won't be able to put this book down! It's so very charming and eccentric. A lovely story. I plan on giving copies to all my favorite people."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I've always been an avid reader, and whenever I visited my grandparents in Ohio, I would invariably run out of books and start scouring the shelves of my mother's and aunt's childhood bedrooms for anything to read. Once when I was looking, my mother said to my aunt, &quot;Where's your copy of I Capture the Castle?&quot; My aunt fetched it from her home and lent it to me with the warning that it had better be returned! I read it and was instantly captivated. I have since found my own copy and reread it at least once a year -- anytime I'm looking for a story with a main character I want as my best friend!I'm thrilled that this is out again, and I'm planning on buying my aunt a brand-new copy to replace her tattered, threadbare edition!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I feel almost churlist for not liking this book as much as I had anticipated. Oh, it's well-written and pleasant to read, with the usual assortment of eccentrics that only English authors seem to be able to create. Unfortunately, I couldn't really get interested in what happens to the characters in the story, even though I tried very hard. It's a good book to spend some quiet time reading, and it will relax you with its language and languid pace. Perhaps it's finally showing its age, being over a half-century old, and seemingly rooted in another world and time entirely. Don't be put off by what I say; read it and make your own determination. You may enjoy it very much, that's the beauty of literature; one size definitely does not fit all!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This truly is a classic. Written in 1948, I Capture the Castle is a marvelous book about mid-20th century England. It is written in the form of a young woman's journal entries over the span of a couple of months, March to October. The Mortmain's are poor and hungry, though they live in a castle; it is mostly empty because they had to sell most of their belongings for money. Cassandra's father became famous for a brief time in the past with the writing of his book, but has since then stopped writing and acquired very strange behavior. Cassandra's mother passed away when she was very young.One day everything changes when two young men come to the castle. Rose takes a great interest in one of them, Simon, and he eventually asks for her hand in marriage. Cassandra knows, however, that her sister is marrying him for the wrong reasons: she only wants the money, for herself and for her family. Cassandra becomes quite upset and it is soon learned that she herself is in love with Simon!This book is written with wit, beauty, and the words flow so easily. It is impossible not to love the characters and the story. In the end, Cassandra truly captures the readers heart with her heartfelt and sincere entries. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I bought this book while on vacation and was looking for something to read. I admit that it was the simplicity of the cover that caught my attention. The writing style was wonderful and I always enjoy a book written in the first person narrative. The main character, Cassandra, was easy to listen to. A girl on the verge of womanhood, she showed wisdom, insight and sensitivity beyond her years. Considering that she lived in such a dysfunctional family, it was miraculous that she turned out to be so well-adjusted.The writing style was beautiful-not too wordy, but allowing for crystal-clear descriptions of the family and their surroundings. I did find that the plot was alittle predictable and events that should have taken time to evolve, happened at a whirlwind pace. At times I thought that months or years had passed, until the narrator indicated that it was actually the next day ( I just don't think that the kind of events described happen that fast in real-life).In general, I found this to be an enjoyable and pleasant book. No sex, no drugs, no violence - just the likable story of a girl coming of age.P.S. Men might not find this story as compelling as a woman might-it's definitely a \\"girl\\" book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book is one of a kind. It really captures you into the time of story, no matter where you are reading and what mood you are at when you are the reading the book. The young girl, Cassandra who takes us through part of her life, maybe the most important part of her life is very charismatic in a way, she puts everyone's problems on her shoulder, and in the it was all payed back, but I felt realy sorry for her. I thought maybe she deserved better than the way she was treated, and even at the end, no convincing apologies were made. Not even by the people who really hurt her at times, when she didn't even realize it. The ending was really realistic. In most stories the girl and the guy get together after all they have been gone through, but in the end this doesn't happen though in thier hearts you feel some connection between them, each don't want to admit and they seperate. It is kind of sad, but you realize, that's how most of the world function. The author did a superb job and it almost left me in tears at the end."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Growing up as rather a bookish only child I would read anything I could lay my hands on. Growing up in South Africa without television also strengthened the reading habit. My first encounter with &quot;I capture the castle&quot; was as a serialised version on the radio and I couldn't wait for the next installment. Of course I subsequently read the book - five times. To this day, the story of Cassandra rates as one of my top ten reads of all time. It has an innocent charm not often found in many modern publications. So if you are after a good old-fashioned, yet timeless read I can highly recommend this title."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I stumbled upon the book through recommendations and was interested to learn that the author wrote this in the 1940's and the book is set in the 1930's. I also loved the fact that Dodie [the author] had written 101 Dalmatians. To be honest I did have very high hopes for the book. While it was written with wit and wisdom I was bothered at finding the usage of the same extraordinary rare words over and over. I thought the story started out wonderfully; a girl loving where she is and loving who she is and being content while wanting so much more. It is the life of a young girl who wants only the best for her father, sister, brother, step mother, and friend/hand-boy. It was no surprise and I knew it was coming ... that she would fall for the wrong man which was disappointing. I hoped that there would be a better end; that somehow for once an author could actually pull it off. As the author had our young main character put it ... she loved a book that \\"left you wondering.\\" Some just do not care for the way it is done, I being one. Overall the book was worth reading and I did enjoy the time I spent."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just read I CAPTURE THE CASTLE for the first time and it was definitely one of those &quot;Where has this book been all my life?&quot; reading experiences. It was a true joy. I had read A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIONS when I was a child and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this book because that wry, witty writing style is just as present in that &quot;children's&quot; novel. Cassandra Mortmain had such a strong voice and she's now one of my favorite female characters of all time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I suppose that I would have liked the book more, had I read it first instead of watching the movie first. I think this book lacked details that I look for in a good book. I did not care much for the time or place that it took place. I felt the book had a slow beginning. That was enough for my husband to quit reading it. Several of my book club members could not get past the fist sentence! As you read on, however, you find that the story gets better as it goes. There is so much drama between the two sisters in this book! It makes it really good! It has some laughs and some serious parts. There were some parts in this book that my book club members disagreed about as far as what Smith was trying to get across to the reader. Overall, I would say that it is worth a try, but I would not read it again. I would, however, watch the movie again!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I think I started this book with my expectations too high. After all the glowing reviews I really expected a book that would grab me and not put me down, or at least one that would make it onto my bookshelf as a favorite. It's a good book. The characters are interesting and involving. Maybe if I'd read it when I was a teenager the unrequited love angst (well-written though it was) would not have put me off so much. But from my middle-aged perspective it let the book down. So my recommedation is to give this book to your teenage daughters and nieces, and to take the glowing reviews with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The book came as advertised except for the stickers on the spine, which couldn't be removed completely. Other than that, the book was on great condition and came quickly."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"A charming coming of age story with equally charming, eccentric characters and wonderful descriptions of the English countryside and the day to day life in pre WWII England. Dodie Smith perfectly contrasts English mannerisms and etiquette with the American way of doing things, hits the mark even all these years later. She also beautifully portrays the bevy of emotions a teenager goes through when falling in love for the first time. The book is written in diary form, which allows for deeper insight into the musings of Cassandra, the lead character; the effect is to make her very real and believable. In fact all the characters are very believable; with exceptionally varied roles for the women. It's interesting that the unique diary form of the book while effective in adding realism and depth to the plot and characters also tends to make things a bit tedious as Cassandra records her daily happenings and thoughts, some of which are rather insignificant. It was a nice read but seems more appropriate for school \\"required\\" reading."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I'll be honest. When I first came across this book in Barnes and Noble a number of years ago, I dismissed it as something I wouldn't like (literally, I judged a book by its cover, shame on me). I re-discovered this book a few months ago, and now I'm wondering why, oh why, didn't I read this book earlier.I Capture the Castle is the diary, kept over a six-month period, of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, who lives with her unconventional family in a decrepit, crumbling castle. She keeps the diary in order to strengthen her skills as an author. The novel is written not so much as a diary; rather Cassandra writes it very much as a story is written (aside from mentioning the month, she doesn't date her entries).Cassandra's strength lies in her recreation of her family members and the people in the small country village in which they live; even the dog has a personality. All of the characters have depth; take, for example, Cassandra's stepmother Topaz, a former model who is more complicated than she appears at first. Cassandra narrates this story with a great amount of humor; especially funny is the story about the bear. Cassandra and her whole family are charming, and I absolutely fell in love with all of them. I think if I'd read this book when I was seventeen, I would have loved it; but it's no less funny and poignant ten years later. It's a great coming-of-age story, especially since Cassandra's coming of age happens so imperceptibly over the course of the novel."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I'm a person who finds classics a bit intimidating because sometimes I find the language a bit rough to get through. So, I was a little apprehensive when I first picked up I Capture the Castle. Still, I figured a good introduction to the classics genre (I've only read a few) would be a classic young adult novel and I was right. I Capture the Castle is one of the most beautiful books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.I noticed that in other reviews, people stated that I Capture the Castle was really slow to get into at first. I didn't find it that way at all. From page one I was enchanted with Cassandra and her life at the castle. Cassandra is just so sweet and funny that you can't help but love her. Due to her flaws, she's also extremely real. I got annoyed at her when I read who she was in love with and at some of the things she did and then I remembered that most teenagers act illogical sometimes when they are in love. Cassandra wasn't really a heroine that was glorified. Because I Capture the Castle is written in the form of Cassandra's journal entries, we see her at her absolutely best, yet we also see her at her absolute worst.Cassandra wasn't the only charming character in I Capture the Castle. I found myself falling in love with not only Simon, but with Neil, and especially Stephen (poor, poor Stephen. I just wanted to hug him throughout the whole novel). I also absolutely loved Topaz and the way she was prone to dramatizing certain situations that she felt needed a bit of \\"drama\\" to be romantic. As for Rose, it was heartbreaking what she was willing to do in order to save, not only herself but her family, from poverty. I found my feelings varying from dislike to pity for her.The thing that I loved most about I Capture the Castle was the progression between how Cassandra was at the beginning of the novel up until the end. You truly see Cassandra grow up and become more of an adult. However, the feelings you get in regards to that are mixed because while you know she could use some growing up, you really don't want her to change from the enchanting person you met when you first started the novel. But I guess it really was necessary.I definitely recommend I Capture the Castle to everyone. It was an amazing classic novel that is still surprisingly relevant today despite that it was written so long ago. You can still relate to Cassandra and her problems and feel for her. You are charmed by her through every step of the way as she captures the castle and our hearts. Tremendous novel that I no doubt will read again and again."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I, too, wish I had read this book when I was a teenager rather than my early 20s, but it is still a charming book that many women would probably appreciate. The narrator is likable, interesting and complex, and experiencing her first love, which is always an interesting thing to read about. Smith is able to keep the interest up until the very last pages - in some books the action is over too soon and the last chapter seems \\"tacked on\\", but that is not the case here. Cassandra's development and maturity really is the most interesting thing about the book overall.The other characters are also interesting, but realistic. Smith's commentary (via Cassandra) on the father, who is a post-war experimental writer is particularly interesting. As a scholar myself, I think it's always interesting to read about other scholars, whether fictional or historical, especially in a field like creative writing, where \\"genius\\" is a highly subjective thing.All in all, this was an enjoyable and rich book - but I think I won't be re-reading it until I have some daughters to read it too!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Remember when you were a kid, and reading a book felt so alive? You wanted to read it all the time, but you didn't want it to end? I don't get that feeling much anymore, but Dodie Smith delivered. The story is equal parts Bronte sisters and Jane Austen (as the narrator herself says) with a large dose of Little Women and some Shakespeare comedy thrown in for good measure. The narrator is as appealing as all get out, and then there's the pleasure of observing gentile poverty and the English weather and class system. Maybe a dash of Agatha Christie? And in the midst of all this sheer delight, a sensitive coming of age, sexual awakening story. I can't imagine a woman who wouldn't love this book, and maybe some men as well."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The author pulled me to the English countryside when romance was still romantic. I loved the characters and the castle. The Mortmains live in poverty for no reason except their eccentric father has writers block. The girls fall in love with wealthy brothers. At the same time I envisioned the story I envisioned a black and white film. This is a fun book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I loved it. It is impossible not to love and admire the main character, and the story is impressively original, considering how stereotypical its plot appears at first glance. I could hardly put it down! I was a bit disappointed that the story ended where it did, but it made this book more interesting, more memorable. I definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I really loved this quaint book. I found it funny and engaging, in a Jane Austen-ish sort of way. The characters are quirky and witty, and even though it would seem that not much happens in the castle, you can picture yourself there, and the story that moves with it is delightful."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. The narrator is a young girl, making the best of difficult, though quaint, circumstances. The novel is very funny as it describes the efforts of two young girls trying to find out who they are amidst difficult circumstances, and who the \\"meaningful other\\" is in their lives."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a literary gem that should, at the very least, be read by everyone who has a love for historical novels. It is a fantastic/appropriate read for both teens and adults, and I recommend it so much that I have had to buy several copies over the years - unsure of who has my last one when I find myself recommending it to yet another friend.I'm ordering two more copies today.The main character, Cassandra, is my favorite narrator of all time. She is witty, yet not overdone, and tells the story with an honest teen perspective. She is humiliated when a normal 17-year-old would feel so, and finds herself in completely realistic situations, rather than overly dramatic versions of reality. And yet there is SO much to laugh at, and feel agony over. The balance of wit and angst is perfect in my opinion.The ending is as surprising as any in literature, and still so real. It is not at all a novel where the story is wrapped up with a neat red bow, but rather one which makes you smile and say, \\"Ah, Cassandra, you are going to go places, my dear friend.\\" That is exactly how I feel about Cassandra - she is a dear friend who I wish could have told me story after story as her life progressed!This was a book that could have had many exciting sequels, but apparently wasn't as appreciated in its day as it should have been.Hooray for Dodie Smith - I wish she would have written 101 more novels :)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book! Cassandra is such a great character, very carefully crafted and written. I can relate to many of the feelings and experiences she encounters. I recieved this book as a gift and am so grateful that I did, it has now become one of my favorite novels. I would totally recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story and a character with a great deal of intellegence and affection. The other part of the book I really enjoyed was the plot, it is very easy to follow and written in a way that keeps you reading up until the very conclusion of the story, there is never a dull moment.

I really liked the ending, I was putting it off a bit because I was pretty sure that I knew what was coming, but I was wrong, and I like being wrong in this instance.There were a few chapters in which Cassandra (the narrator) is miserable and alone, and that was dull. I felt as though her depression was emphasized without a real purpose.I'm really quite torn on what to rate this and whether to recommend this! I suppose that if the pagan-y and devil-wishing content doesn't bother you, then I do recommend this book. Three stars it is!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I found \\"I Capture the Castle\\" in the attic of an estate sale in 1953 at age eleven. Since then I've read it AT LEAST every two years; you do the math. I've probably given out twenty copies, always telling the prospective reader that she will be hooked after the first page, if not the first sentence. You can imagine my delight when the book was rediscovered and republished several years ago. There is a British version of the paperback that includes fascinating background information on Dodie Smith. She had moved from Britain to California with her husband, a screenwriter and a pacifist, in the early days of WWII. She longed for \\"home\\" and the innocent time before the war. Thus writing \\"I Capture the Castle\\" was a labor of love. Well, it's not a labor to read-- infectious, clever, funny, romantic, surprising. The movie version is not half-bad, but the book is ten times better!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Not many people know that British writer Dodie Smith produced more than children's beloved \\"101 Dalmatians\\". \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is probable her second most famous book -- although one may wonder if it doesn't deserve the title of her most famous work. Largely known as narrative produced for young girls, this one goes much beyond its target reader. \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a book that may be read and appreciated by women and men alike, no matter how old they are.A romantic comedy, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" keeps the light tone most of the time -- albeit it flirts with the Gothic novel sometimes. After all, the main characters have an old and abandoned castle in their backyard. The castle is as Gothic as it could be with gargoyles and towers falling apart.But Cassandra, the witty nave narrator, never leaves the castle to be the center of the action. Dutifully she is the raison d'tre of the book. She is a young girl, daughter of an ex-famous writer that hasn't produced anything since his first novel. She lives with her father, stepmother, older sister and Stephen -- the son of their deceased maid --in a house adjoined the castle. They lead a poor life -- actually a money, food and joyless one. Until the day two young and handsome heirs arrive. They come to claim the castle that once belonged to their grandfather.But don't expect the ordinary from Smith's quills. Contrary to the \`natural' order, Cassandra's family do not battle against the heirs for the castle. Again, against all odds, the stepmother is not the incarnation of evil -- actually she is a good friend of the two girls. The writer only brings to the novel ideas that would unfold in a clich&eacute;d way and then subvert all of them.This is the biggest pleasure in reading \\"I Capture the Castle\\". The book is a narrative of sweet subversion -- so is the young narrator. A delightful voice, Cassandra has been praised as one of the best young female narrators ever (J. K. Rowling seems to agree). Extremely well developed, one may take this novel for an autobiography sometimes, rather than fiction. Her moral, intellectual and romantic dilemmas are real and interesting.With \\"I Capture the Castle\\" Smith produced a novel of touching and tender subversion -- funny sometimes, sad other times, but real all the time. Something that is already a reason to praise a book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"When I first found this book I was on vacation, looking for something to read. I was drawn to the book, maybe by its interesting cover, or the fact that it has been praised by the author of my favorite book series, Harry Potter. After picking up the book and reading the back cover I thought, why not, sounds good enough.I started reading the book and yes, it was a little slow at first. But usually once I start a book, even a seemingly boring one, I try to finish it. I can't be exactly sure when I really started getting into the book, perhaps it was the introduction of the Cottons, but soon after I couldn't stop. After I finished, I recommended it to everyone I knew.Cassandra is a character, in my opinion, many girls can relate to; mainly being in the shadow of an older sibling, and living in a castle was a fantasy of everyone at some point or anotherI highly recommend this book to teens and old alike. It's an enchanting coming-of-age book and I give it my highest praise."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a perfect book. I thought I'd read all of the cozy, well-written, pastoral English novels that exist ... and then I found this novel. I read it in three days flat and mourned that it didn't last longer. The characters are vivid and real and the dialogue sparkles ... it's like a modern Jane Austen but with a touch more action and with beautiful visual descriptions of the English countryside. If you love Anne of Green Gables or Elizabeth Bennett or Jane Eyre or Betsy Ray, you'll adore Cassandra: she has the perfect blend of spunk, ingenuity, and pensiveness. I adored this book. I'll never get tired of it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle was a truly delightful book. Written in a journal format, in the voice of the seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain, this book captures the angst of first love. It is hard to resist a book whose opening line has Cassandra writing while sitting in a sink. The setting of a ramshackle castle in the English countryside adds a certain whimsy to the story. It is not your usual run of the mill coming of age story. Cassandra's view of the adult world is also seasoned with a hard dose of reality. The story of Cassandra and Rose's sisterly love is also very moving. The book is a little dated, and the naivet&eacute; of Cassandra sometimes takes one by surprise, but don't let that stop you from reading this book, because you will miss a lovely story."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"A short while I discovered this enjoyable book, now back in print. I sat down and devoured it in a day or two. Cassandra is a teenage girl growing up in England in the 1930's. Her family has moved to a ramshackle castle, where they live in poverty, or near to it. The story is her enchanting diary, in which she records her thoughts, hopes, and wishes candidly and clearly. Cassandra is a very likeable character, as she is by no means perfect, and is honest about her imperfections; at the same time, she keeps trying to be the type of person that will make her family proud. Well worth the read, for people of all ages!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I found out about this book from a small catalog and bought it with my fingers crossed. And I was very impressed! Smith's character Cassandra captures the castle and the people living in it with cleverness and thoughtfulness that I could only hope to possess. She is a wonderful heroine - maybe not beautiful like her sister Rose, but she knows what she wants (at least in the end) and has a way of talking right to the reader so you can identify with her. Simon and Neil Cotton characters bring more humor to the book and bring out the Mortmain family, as seen from outsiders. Another strong point besides the characters was the foreshadowing that keeps one wanting to read on and on without stopping. Some parts, especially the &quot;life lesson&quot; at the end, were a little predictable, but that doesn't take very much away from this excellent story. I recommend I Capture the Castle to young adults and older adults who enjoy romance and fantasy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This truly is a classic. Written in 1948, I Capture the Castle is a marvelous book about mid-20th century England. It is written in the form of a young woman's journal entries over the span of a couple of months, March to October. The Mortmain's are poor and hungry, though they live in a castle; it is mostly empty because they had to sell most of their belongings for money. Cassandra's father became famous for a brief time in the past with the writing of his book, but has since then stopped writing and acquired very strange behavior. Cassandra's mother passed away when she was very young.One day everything changes when two young men come to the castle. Rose takes a great interest in one of them, Simon, and he eventually asks for her hand in marriage. Cassandra knows, however, that her sister is marrying him for the wrong reasons: she only wants the money, for herself and for her family. Cassandra becomes quite upset and it is soon learned that she herself is in love with Simon!This book is written with wit, beauty, and the words flow so easily. It is impossible not to love the characters and the story. In the end, Cassandra truly captures the readers heart with her heartfelt and sincere entries. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"\\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cozy. I can't say that I am really comfortable, and there is the depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring -- I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. \\"This is the story of the Mortmain family, in all their wonderful eccentricity. It is told by Cassandra Mortmain, youngest girl of the family, and aspiring writer, as she tries to \\"capture the castle\\". She lives with her family in an old English castle. The father, known only as Mortmain, was a famous writer. His one novel, was very successful, especially in the United States. But he has been suffering from writer's block every since....and is a tad bit on the crazy side. With no income for years, the family is basically dirt poor, having sold off all their valuable possessions just to have enough food to live on. They live with Mortain's second wife, Topaz, an artist's model and extremely free-spirit who exists only to be her husband's muse. And hasn't been able to accomplish it. The eldest sister, Rose, is self-centered at best. She hates being poor. Hates it with a passion, and would do just about anything to marry someone with money. Youngest child, Thomas, is just a schoolboy, but remarkable insightful. And rounding out the motley bunch, is Stephen. Stephen is the son of their former housekeeper. When she passed away, Stephen stayed on with the family. He's exceptionally handsome, though Cassandra finds him a bit \\"daft\\" (of course, he thinks the sun rises and sets on her!)Things change very little in the Mortmain castle until the day the Cotton's move into Scoatney. The Cotton's are Americans who have inherited the estate, and with that become the new landlords to the Mortmains. Simon, as the eldest brother, is the actual heir to the land and in essence, the \\"wealthy\\" one. Neil, the younger more carefree brother wants to return to America to become a cattle rancher. Rose, in her desperation to get out of the poverty that has struck her family, decides that she is hopelessly in love with Simon and will do just about anything to get him to propose to her. And since Simon is rather scholarly, he and his mother are taken with Mortmain. Fans of his writing, they try to get him over his writer's block.The story is told in journal format by Cassandra, who is sweet and gentle and kind. She's also smart as a whip and devoted to her family. Cassandra, in a word, is delightful! I usually tend to root for the more brash characters. But there is just something so endearing about Cassandra. \\"And that was all she ever did talk about it -- that was almost the worst part of the gloom, our not talking naturally. Never have I felt so separate from her. And I regret to say that there were moments when my deep and loving pity for her merged into a desire to kick her fairly hard. For she is a girl who cannot walk her troubles off, or work them off; she is a girl to sit around and glare.\\" \\"That evening of the row was our lowest depths; miserable people cannot afford to dislike each other. Cruel blows of fate call for extreme kindness in the family circle.\\" Cassandra is level-headed and wise beyond her years. She is charming and refreshingly honest in all her writings.Rose drove me crazy though. She is vain and self-centered and annoying. And even though she tried to justify that her marrying Simon would help the family as a whole, she really was in it only for herself. She was obnoxious and the type of woman that sat back waiting for someone to give her something. The Cinderella waiting to be rescued by the Prince, instead of the Belle, who was out there doing the rescuing. And that just drove me crazy! But, in truth, it's how the character is written and Smith definitely did a great job in making me dislike her immensely!Each character was so thoroughly fleshed out. It's like you actually knew the people that were being written about. And you cared what happened to them. I can't remember the last time I was so taken with the characters in a book. And I can't even begin to pick a favorite. Aside from Rose, each character has some strange but endearing qualities. And I loved them all!! A timeless story that will last forever, this is one book that I'm truly a better person for having read! A 100% definite 5-Star Rating!!! Will surely land on my list of favorite novels!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I probably read this book 5 times while I was a pre-teen and teen-ager. I loved the fairy-tale aspects of it but at the same time I related to Cassandra's refreshing honesty as she painstakingly \\"captured\\" her daily life in her journal. Somehow I lost the book, but scenes from it remained clearly drawn in my mind! As an adult I looked in every bookstore I entered, trying to locate a copy of it to see if it was as good as I remembered. When I finally found one I had a wonderful reunion with the Mortmain family! Then, imagine my delight a couple of years later when it was reprinted and I could literally share it with so many people! (The movie was a disappointment! I should have known!)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful book that is about a seventeen year old girl named Cassandra. She and her family live in a large castle in England though they are very poor. She finds her life exciting yet dull.

While reading the book you fall in love w/ or get annoyed with each character. You want to be them, meet them , or just become friends with them. For me it kept me guessing till the end. Does she love him? Will they get together? What will happen to them? You soon feel like you know the charachters personally. I admit after finishing the book I was a bit frusturated. It seemed it didn't end how I wanted it too. But after going over it in my head multiple times I sooned realized why it makes it so good. It shows that you can't always make someone love you and you can't make yourself love some one. I recommend this book. It is a great read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read this book after seeing the film starring Romola Garai as Cassandra and Bill Nighy (yes, he who plays the ageing rock star in \\"Love Actually\\") as the father suffering writer's block.Author Dodie Smith, (also of the classic \\"101 Dalmatians\\"!) had transplanted herself with her husband in California, at the height of her fame in England. As World War II broke and rumbled on, she longed for London. Writing this book was an expiation of her nostalgia.The novel's title is the triumphant declaration of the book's narrator, dispossessed wannabe writer Cassandra. In fact, it is author Smith who \\"captures\\" the angst of her young heroines, class warfare, tension between Transatlantic neighbours and especially of the England of the 1930s that she missed.Apart from the luminous romance, two of the characters are concerned with writing. Young narrator/protagonist Cassandra ambitiously works through her story in ever-more-expensive notebooks. By contrast, her unproductive father cannot reproduce his early creative form.It's a good story in the Jane Austen comedy-of-manners tradition, with a little sexiness of DH Lawrence mixed in, and the down-at-heel feeling of, e.g., Cold Comfort Farm\\". The compulsive beginning immediately establishes Cassandra, the writing motive, and engages our sympathy: \\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"What a wonderful book! Cassandra Mortmain, the young narrator, writes this a journal that takes place over six months, while she works on her writing.

The Mortmains have been living in poverty in a castle in England, because after Father was released from a three-month stint in jail, after the \\"cake-knife incident\\" in their neigborhood, he wanted to live in the country. They had been living on the profits of his first and famous book, \\"Jacob Wrestling,\\" but he has a serious case of writer's block, eccentricity, and questions are raised about his sanity. With little income, their home is falling apart, many of their belonging have been sold off for food, we watch their fortunes change when Neil and Simon Cotton move in next door. Cassandras's sister, Rose, her brother, Timothy, stepmother, Topaz, and the lovesick Stephen all live in the castle, interesting people all. Throw in the wealthy Cottons who move in next door, and we add love and engagements, Simon loves Rose, Rose doesn't love Simon, Neil hates Rose, and Cassandra of course, loves Simon. There are many more interesting characters who do not overshadow the plot while we watch Cassandra change during the course of her journal. Fabulous story!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is the delightful story of 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmaine, who records in a series of journals what could be an ordinary life of a young girl teaching herself how to write. But instead the narrator develops an extraordinary coming-of-age-fairy tale set in a deteriorating castle outside London. We explore sibling relationships, parent-child relationships and the powerful feelings associated with first love.Filled with a cast of well drawn characters who are both down-to-earth and sublimely eccentric, I was captivated from page one by Cassandra's charming innocence. It can easily be compared to Jane Austen's work and now fifty-five years in print, it's appropriate to label it a classic. I highly recommend this book.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book has a vividness and charm that is timeless. The family in the story is so quirky they seem like they have to be real. I read this book every winter and its rich, descriptive language and humor whisk me away every time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is a wonderfully enchanting story told through the diary entries of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortman. Surrounded by the eccentric members of her family, Cassandra's writings reveals a mind as interesting and unique as the crumbling English castle in which she lives. The arrival of Americans turn the family's focus from their dire finnancial crisis to matters of the heart.This book is essentially about Cassandra's journey from childhood to adulthood, yet I found other aspects of the book to be very profound and thought provoking. At the same time, I laughed often whilst turning the pages, and smiled at the beautiful way Cassandra has captured not only the castle, but also members of her family and entertaining incidents. Anyone from teens onward would love to be immersed in the brilliant, emotive, shimmering world of &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; - I know I certainly did!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book will captivate you, hold your attention for the duration. A must-read from off the beaten path."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"A friend of mine gave me this book for my 42nd b'day, saying I'd love it. The J.K. Rowling blurb on the cover gave me pause (was it a children's book? ) as did the old-fashioned cover and unknown author name (to me). Well, I absolutely adored this book and its characters--laughing out loud at the bear coat scene and crying inconsolably at the last words the narrator writes. Others here have said more about the plot, but all I can say if you love Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables, Little Women or any books that feature strong-willed, quirky girl-women, you will adore this book. Give it to your friends, too. And I hope it's true that they are making a film of this, since it should revive interest in the book. (Although after what Hollywood did to Land Girls and Cold Comfort Farm, I'm afraid for this little gem.) Cassandra's journal entries capture the castle perfectly as well as the heart of her readers. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Well, everyone in the other reviews has done a good job of decribing it, but would just like to say that this is the best book I have read since last summer. I am ashamed to say that i have fallen in love with Stephen, if it's possible to fall in love with someone who doesn't exist. Read the book and see what I mean! I can't say I enjoyeed the ending quite so much, but i admit it was the only sensible way to end it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is the moving, heartfelt, and funny tale of Cassandra, a seventeen-year-old girl living in a crumbling, cold, and bare castle in England. Her unique, spiritied family, the Mortmains, struggle daily with poverty, having little to eat.There's her eccentric father, James, an hermit-like ex-writer who has a huge case of writer's block. There is Cassandra's sister Rose, a vain beauty who longs for riches and something more in her life. Then there is her stepmother, Topaz, a towheaded artist's model who likes to play her lute and commune with nature (walk around outdoors naked with the elements). Lastly, there is the god-like beauty Stephen (but Cassandra says his expression is \\"a bit daft\\"), who helps around the house and is totally in love with Cassandra.Our heroine records events with wit, honesty, and cozy warmth. The Mortmain family meets the sons of the late Mr. Cotton, the rich landlord, Simon and Neil Cotton. Soon Cassandra's life and the lives of those around her begin to change. Rose becomes engaged to Simon Cotton. But does she actually love him? Rose had once told her sister that she would do anything to help her family out of the poverty they are in.Cassandra is a wonderful girl coming into her own, witty and likeable up to the very last word. I really identified with her, as a teenaged girl. This book may not deliver your standard happy ending (we never know who Cassandra really ends up with relationship-wise), but will certainly deliver a wonderful reading experience. It is a good book to simply curl up with."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Every Midsummer's Eve I think about Cassandra's celebratory pagan rituals and of how much I adore Dodie Smith's I Capture the Castle. Tonight being that date I told a friend about this treasure, and am amazed to find it actually in print and available. I have read of Cassandra's adventures since I was her age through my own now (31). Each time I read I am struck by the forcefulness and poignancy of the writing, at how we as readers watch Cassandra grow into her strength as a writer and into her pain as a young woman. The scene in which Cassandra sits in the church during a storm (&quot;I am a chaos inside a stillness inside a chaos&quot;) and ponders the relation of spirituality and human-kindness I review my own sense of spirit and self. Details, such as the color of the liquers, the shadows of the castle, the green die in the tub, the packed lunches for Mortmain in the castle, illustrate the power of Smith as a writer of tremendous force-- most powerful in her ability to have these details grow from Cassandra's pen (or pencil stub). I gave my first copy away to a good friend for her graduation, then received another used copy from a good friend on my first birthday away from home. I have never known a world which I wish to share more than that of the castle, England in the 30s, the world of I Capture the Castle."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Most of these reviews sounds as if they're written by teenagers -- let me sign in -- I'm 72, first met the book when I was 25, totally enchanted. Like many others, have searched for the old book-club copies at used book sales so I could share this delightful book with everyone I know. I envy anyone who hasn't read it yet-- they have some pleasant hours ahead. (The woman who first recommended it to me said she'd got the title -- in 1950 -- from The Brooklyn Library's Cheerful Book List.(Try compiling your own Depressing Book List.)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"My mother nearly shrieked in the middle of the library book sale as she ran over to me, thrusting into my adolescent hands a grey, clothbound book.&quot;This is the BEST book!&quot; she said. &quot;I have been looking for this book for you for years!&quot;Naturally, being a teenager, I did not want to like whatever my mother liked, and it took me a long time to open the cover of _I Capture the Castle_. Once I did, once I read that fantastic first sentence, I was hooked. Since then, I have read it at least once every year, and my mother and her friend Polly and I have amused ourselves for many hours casting the movie we'd like to make of it (Gabriel Byrne for Mortmain, Sean Bean for The Swain . . . ?).It is a charming, clever, intelligent book, with a heroine who is three-dimensional and extremely sympathetic. Its cast of characters are the family and friends you always wished you had, its love story satisfying in its open-endedness.If you know a smart, literary teenaged girl (or if you are or were one), buy the book. I swear you won't regret it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I CAPTURE THE CASTLE is truly one of the best books I've ever read. Cassandra, the main character, becomes like a dear friend as you read the three journals through which we see her life. She could very easily be you or I, and even goes through the heart-tugging situations the way a real person would. Her charm and her romantic view of the happenings surrounding her and her family draw one into this beautifully written book. When you're through, you'll want to have a Midsummer's festival, just like Cassandra.I try to read this book at least once a year- it is one that you will never tire of, and one which you wish would continue long after it is over! Buy this book- have some cocoa- then escape into Cassandra's world of English castles and newfound love."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I loved this book--up until the last chapter. It started out a perfectly beautiful little escapist story, filled with scrumptious images and a romance with life....The problem came when the author tried--exceedingly heavyhandedly--to turn it into a life lesson. The reader is driven up through luscious scenery to the top of a mountain, made spectator to a breathtaking sunset, and then dropped off a cliff. If you do insist on reading it, go back after you've finished and write a new ending."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle is the story of an English family living in poverty in a castle that was leased due to the long ago success of the patriarch's novel, Jacob Wrestling. It is written in diary form from the point of view of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain. Their lives get turned upside-down with the arrival of the American Cotton brothers, Simon and Neil, the new owners of the property. Cassandra chronicles the changes within the family and home for the next six months.Initially, I loved the story. I found Cassandra's narrative to be extremely charming, and I felt the book was well written. As it was written in 1948 and set in the 1930s, a lot of the subject matter in the book was extremely progressive, i.e. Cassandra's musings on whether she is an atheist or not. I cannot seem to recall a book I've ever read from that time period that was so candid about such a controversial topic, which I really appreciated.I also loved all the characters in the book. I felt that they were flawed in a very natural sense, very much like people that one would know. My favorite character was Stephen; he was like a knight in shining armor for the Mortmain family.The things I didn't really care for was the way Cassandra turned about halfway through the book. The story got convoluted and started becoming trite, with subplots that really didn't seem to make sense. Cassandra goes from being an interesting, intriguing character that I really wanted to know more about to a character that is simpering, insipid, and contradictory. Having said that, though, one forgets that she's seventeen, so her wishy washy, over-romanticized nature con be slightly forgiven. Only slightly.The ending is ambiguous and may leave some people thirsting for more of a story; however, as it is a journal, there will be some loose ends. It is unpredictable, which I appreciate.While things didn't go the way I wanted or expected, this was still an excellent story with excellent characters. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Along with the rest of the literary world, I recently rediscovered this classic after it was republished having sat in obscurity for years. And was promptly blown away. For any lovers of Pride and Prejudice, Anne of Green Gables, or even The Age of Innocence, this is a must-read. The plot is Austen's, the characters Montgomery's, and the setting and bittersweet flavor Wharton's. Written as the journal of a cynical but essentially dreamy 17-year-old, it depicts the turning point in both her life and the lives of her family, as they spiral toward decay and complete poverty, the only hope of redemption being offered by the arrival of wealthy, good-looking neighbors next door. Don't expect to find any Mr. Darcys in this book - the Cotton brothers are much more thinly sketched and truth be told despisable heroes than that famous character, but the book rides on the wistful, witty, breathtakingly clear voice and character of Cassandra Mortmain, a heroine who burns in the memory long after the book has been put down, and as such the book is more than worth reading. Doesn't quite achieve the peak of lofty classicism of other more famous books such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice, but a lovely story which skitters on the edges of childhood, romance, heartbreak, and growing up with grace and near-brilliance. For a book to be a true classic it must contain 1)intensely vibrant, complex, and individual characters, particularly the main one 2)a well-constructed and finely drawn plot, that brings nothing extra in and 3)that extra spark, of style or vision, that lifts a book into something that appeals on some level to all humanity. I Capture the Castle has a good dose of all three but not quite enough. On the first charge, while Cassandra herself fits the bill as nearly as a 17-year old can(unfortunately by the very nature of the age given to her she doesn't quite have the maturity or decisiveness of a woman) most of the other characters feel either over-the-top(her family) or under-drawn(Rose and the Cotton brothers). On the second, there is such a thing as too much detail, and Dodie Smith falls into that trap. On the third, she nearly, nearly reaches that level, particularly in the brilliant ending scene, but not quite; the wider emotions - hate, fear, and the deeper vision, is missing. So, in the end, while this remains a minor classic - the story of a year or so in the life of a girl - it's a brilliant and heartbreaking one. \\"Three more lines left. I love you.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Cassandra keeps a journal as an exercise to practice writing and she records the events that occur over the period of about one year. She is a 17-year-old girl who lives in a rundown, but romantic castle in England with her family. Her father, James Mortmain wrote a novel years ago that was wildly successful and earned alot of money, but he hasn't written anything since and now the family is impoverished to the point of hunger. Cassandra is kept company by her older sister Rose and her eccentric stepmother Topaz while her younger brother Tom makes infrequent appearances because he is mostly in town at school. And then there is the servant Stephen, an extremely good-looking young man devoted to Cassandra. He so hates to see her hungry that he takes a job to contribute his earnings to the household. However, the father discourages any interest Cassy might have in Stephen because he is from a different social class.The real excitement starts about 100 pages into the book when the Cotton family arrives at the nearby Scoatney estate. Neil and Simon are wealthy Americans and Rose sets her sites on Simon because he is the heir. Anyone who has ever been poor can somewhat relate to the girls predicament. Rose's desire to marry wealth would not only ensure enough to eat and buy pretty new clothes for herself, it would ensure the same for her family (since her father shows no signs of changing and Simon is kind and generous).I think young adults would enjoy this book because the rest of the novel is about young love. The relationships lack real depth and the ending is somewhat open ended which some will like and others will find disappointing. I can't really imagine being 17 or 20 and being as nave about boys as Cassy and Rose, but I suppose things used to be very different. The real charm of this novel is the enchanting atmosphere of the castle as depicted through Cassandra's rose-colored glasses. Most of the characters seem shallow and we didn't see enough of Stephen, the only person I actually admired, but somehow Cassy's rendering of the whining characters makes them likeable."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a &quot;small&quot; book. The scene is circumscribed, the characters few, and the action minor. Yet is is a beautifully written, achingly real book about the passage from girlhood to adulthood. And in the end, the story seems bigger than it is.My only complaint about this book is that I can never again read it for the first time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This a book you want to read more than once and loan to friends so that they can have the experience. The characters, the settings are all beautifully drawn and developed. But more than that, the feelings of Cassandra at seventeen, falling in love for the first time are so vivid. It is wonderful to remember how it felt to be young and in love. A book for everyone. The only problem is that it ends. I could go on reading about these characters and &quot;living&quot; with them in their castle forever."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read this book only because it had been recommended to me by a friend years ago, then I found it on a \\"librarian's picks\\" shelf in the library.Once I began reading, with no particular expectations, I was quickly and completely caught up with it. It is the coming of age tale of a young girl, whose family, including her father, step-mother, sister and brother get by in rather desperate and precarious financial circumstances in an excentric house that's part of an English castle wall. Her father is an writer, of real reknown in literary circles (think Joyce), but hasn't written anything in a very long time. A wealthy American family moves into the castle's main house and their lives change profoundly.The book was originally written in the early 20th century, but its insights about a young girl and her observations of the world and people around her are timeless.This is a lovely book that was well-deservedly reissued and I recommend it to everyone. After reading it through a library, I ended up buying two copies so I could keep one and share another with friends."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I loved this. I absolutely loved it. The lead character Cassandra was wonderful. She was so smart and romantic. She made me laugh and even cry a little. This has to be one of the most touching stories I have ever had the pleasure to read.

This is a definite keeper. I would recommend it in an instant."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a gently whimsical and vaguely gothic story told from the perspective of young Cassandra Mortmain, living with her eccentric, genteely impoverished family in an old English castle. Writing in her beloved journal, Cassandra, an aspiring writer, creates a clear picture of her castle home and her brilliantly bizarre family; genius novelist father James with a case of intense writer's block, sweet, bohemian stepmother Topaz, elder sister Rose and servant boy Stephen.The novel picks up pace when the wealthy Cotton brothers move from America to their English estate, very close to Cassandra's castle. This sets life into hectic motion for all the family, particularly Cassandra and Rose. As Cassandra chronicles the goings on, she gradually, gracefully grows up. Ultimately, this is a story about the joy and pain of love, particularly when that love is unrequited.While there are moments when characters behave, well, randomly (why in the world DOES Simon kiss Cassandra?), the book has a quirky, lovable charm and beauty. Cassandra's voice is fresh and unaffected, and the characters and surroundings are finely sketched. A good read for anyone, particularly imaginative teenagers."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I prolonged my reaching the end of this book as long as possible.

I instantly fell in love with Dodie Smith's style of writing. She describes the characters and the setting so well that you feel as if you are inside the book rather than reading it. What makes this book so great is that by the time you are finished you feel as if each character was a long lost friend and you feel so sad that the book has ended. This is definately a book that I will read again and again in the future, and I will most definately cherish it forever."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I'd been hearing about this book for a few years and I'm now terribly sorry I waited so long to get it. What a treat! The heroine/narrator is a smart, wry girl named Cassandra Mortmain, living with her father, stepmother and sister in genteel poverty in a ruined castle. With wit and an eye for detail, she describes her family, the history that led to their reduced circumstances, and the remarkable events that transpire to change those circumstances. I loved this book so much that I bought two more copies, for my mom and my aunt, for Christmas, and I know they will love it too."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I highly recommend this book to any girl who is a romantic at heart.

If you read Enid Blyton's Famous Five books when you were a child, you might get a little of that feeling back reading this book. The castle, the eccentric family, the exotic American interlopers, the &quot;bear&quot;, the steam trains, the thrilling moments of luxury and indulgence, tea with the vicar, fulfilment... it all reminds me of those times. It's simply enchanting."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I dare you to pick this book up and then try to put it down.

It is a sweet tale of a family very similar in nature to the family in George S. Kaufmann's &quot;You Can't Take It With You.&quot;However, I did find the plotline regarding the lovelives of the sisters to be trite and taken directly from the melodramas of the 1930's and 40's.

The Mortmains live in England in a drafty old castle, without any source of regular income. In her witty and wonderfully colorful diary entries, Cassandra bemoans the horrible meals, the awful clothes and the bitter cold that they all must endure. She writes with bravado and style, and she is a most endearing heroine. Her family is not ordinary. James Mortmain, her father, is a formerly successful author who wrote one book and then abruptly stopped writing. In spite of his family's extreme poverty, he refuses to put pen to paper. Cassandra's stepmother, Topaz, is a former artist's model who is still gorgeous and occasionally outrageous. Cassandra and Rose decide that Rose, the older sister, must marry someone wealthy in order to escape their wretched impoverished state. Fortunately, two brothers, Simon and Neil Cotton, come into their lives and the inevitable romantic entanglements ensue. Most of the book is engrossing and funny. However, the book is a little too long. The last fifty to seventy-five pages drag a bit. All in all, Smith has created a delightful heroine, whose fresh and irreverent voice is a breath of fresh air. I recommend this book as a light and entertaining diversion."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"After reading a glowing report of this book's reissue in my newspaper and the raving reviews of other readers on this website, I was dying to read I Capture the Castle. And I enjoyed it at first--I loved Cassandra and could definitely identify with her. But it all fell apart for me when she fell in love with Simon. Maybe it's because I don't like that name, maybe it's because I couldn't get the image of his ugly beard out of my head even after he shaved it off, but I think the main reason I was disappointed was that I never quite understood what she liked about him in the first place--he seemed nice and benevolent and all, but hardly desperately attractive. I'm disappointed to be disappointed though!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I was not terribly impressed by this story. It was well written with wonderful character development of the narrator, Cassandra, however the overall plot was dull. I think what really threw me was the very beginning of the novel, when Cassandra and her family describe their overwhelming poverty, and then they all come to the conclusion that not a single person in the house can go out and work to make money. Why not? What are they doing with their time? Cassandra daydreams and writes in her journal, I have no idea what Rose is up to, Thomas goes to school, Topaz keeps house, the father does crosswords and mopes all day about not being able to write, and the only person who does go out to make money is the orphan serving boy who shouldn't even be giving the family money in the first place.Instead of self sufficient pluck to get the family out of poverty, the plot revolves around her sister Rose snaring a rich man, which in turn leads to the family's fortunes turning around (and a lot of other stuff happens).It reminded me a lot of \\"A tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" but what made that such a wonderful read was the tenacity of the family, never giving up to pull themselves out of poverty through hard work and determination and not waiting around for things to be handed to them."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"What I enjoyed about the story was mostly how it evoked other favorites of mine - this tale of a girl coping with poverty, an eccentric family, and her own budding sexuality is a little Wuthering Heights (without the melodrama) meets Pride and Prejudice (without the social satire) meets Judy Bloom (without the happy ending).I found the story to be sweet, entertaining, and well-told, if not particularly memorable. Like a slow walk through the English countryside on a summer day, the narrator is in no great rush to tell the story, taking time to wander down lanes that don't ultimately contribute much to the story (Cassandra's flirtation with religion, the history of castles, psychoanalysis, etc.) but that are scenic enough.However, as much as I enjoyed the stroll, the impatient American in me longed eventually to arrive at some destination. Instead, the narrator leaves us at a fork in the road, watching as Cassandra looks longingly down the path she yearns to take and then down the path she ought to take. Not sure if it's the author's attempt at realism, or symbolic of Cassandra's emerging maturity/wisdom, or just a British thing - but did find the ending a little unsatisfying. Not enough, however, to entirely detract from what was, in the main, a pleasant and worthwhile journey.(See, Cassandra, just how useful metaphors can be?)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Cassandra's lovely prose far transcends her age in the book. Whimsical, fantastic, all in all a wonderful novel that will capture your imagination and render you unable to stop reading."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"A great read with well-developed characters. It's one of those books where you feel a little sad once you reach the end because you've become attached to the characters. A lovely book"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Wow. I have read this book twice and it only gets better. I am only 14 but this is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It explores the life of 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain through her diary. It is a coming of age story as Cassandra learns what it is to love and to hate. Her life changes over this period of a year. She is put out into the real world (she lived a sheltered life in a castle in the countryside of England) and forced to rethink her semi-naive ideals of life. I really identified with Cassandra when I read it. She wants to become a writer, just as I do. There are some absolutely beautiful passages in this book about what it means to write, and the stumbling blocks, which are totally true. It also explores the mishaps and adventures of love, and how you can lose your head, and hurt others as well as yourself. It has an extremely poignant message about true love and also the affects of fooling yourself into love for the begiuling riches. Dodie Smith has written a masterpiece, a classic, in my opinion. I think that every young woman should read this book and learn the lessons it has to teach about love, friendship, strife, and life in general. I don't want to sound Cheesy at all but that's what it is. If there was one book that I have to say influenced the way I looked at life and my writing the most, it would probably be this one.GIVE PEACE A CHANCE!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of the owner of Bookhampton in East Hampton, NY for my 14 year old daughter. I just devoured it and fell in love with Cassandra - It has a Jane Austen - Bronte feel to it which I loved but is very much a feminist novel for the new millennium. Read it - you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"When I first began reading I Capture the Castle, it was simply out of pure boredom. As i read further, I began to understand the concepts of Cassandra's writing and relate to some of her feelings. The life of England in the 1930's is most astounding from Cassandra's point of view. I found myself transported into her world, imagining what was happening, having mental pictures of the characters. I am happy to say that in my mind, I have a slight knowledge of all the characters and what they really are to look like.This is an absolutly brilliant book that is beautifully written. The author did an amazing job and has inspired me greatly."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I came across this book accidentally. My co-worker had it on the library reference desk. She said it was the next book in her book discussion group. After she told me a little about it I decided to read it. Then, I had second thoughts. So, I read reviews of it on Amazon. I still wasn't sure if I wanted to read it when I read that people said it was like Jane Austen would write if she was around today. Even though I'm a former English major and a librarian, I will commit the great heresy and admit I don't like Jane Austen. She's too hoity-toity for me. But, then, in a review I read the opening couple of sentences: &quot;I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy.&quot; This is such a great and intriguing opening that I had to know what was going on. I'm glad I decided to read it. It is a delightful novel, especially describing the poverty the Mortmains experience living in the castle. (You don't associate living in a castle with poverty! That, right there, makes the book different.) I have to admit, it does rather read like a modern Jane Austen and yet I didn't mind all the talk about who loved whom and who was going to marry whom. I also enjoyed sharing the challenge of getting James Mortmain to go back to his writing. It's a very good read with interesting characters, including the castle itself. And, if you like romances, you will really like this book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"this book was really good i just finished it. i loved the characters although i wished the ending was a little different. i recomend it to anyone who loves the british!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The method of telling the story reminds me heavily of Emily of New Moon by L. M. Montgomery but the overall themes and characterizations remind me most of the Great Gatsby.Nick Carraway, the narrator and protagonist of The Great Gatsby describes Jay Gatsby, all his excesses and his hangers on with a sense of detachment and mild amusement. Cassandra, the narrator and protagonist of I Capture the Castle takes the same approach with her description of the Cottons, who are visiting from America. In Cassandra's case, her family's extreme poverity heightens the divide between the two families and opens her eyes even wider to the oddities of the wealthy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I am what you would call the typical teenaged girl with a passion for books of all types. However this book has topped all my lists I have read it hundreds of times, without it loosing and ounce of appeal. It does not have the typical ending or follow the formulated outline for teen fiction, it is unique in itself and should be a required reading of anyone who is growing up. By the end of the book the characters are as close to you as your own family, I feel their pain and happiness with every word &quot;Cassandra&quot; writes. I belive this book to be the best book of all times and that could be true, but oppinions change and intrests grow so, I would be tempted to recomend this book to the large population of teenagers. I would not however recommend this book to adults. I think adults may see it as yet another book about teen angst or unrequinted love, but it is so much more it is about the life of youth and the heart of an entire would and time. But for now I say I Capture the Castle is a classic and even further I would say that it is THE CLASSIC."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"How can you not love a book that opens with the line, &quot;I write this sitting in the kitchen sink&quot;?I fell in love with every single one of the characters. Although set in the 1930's, the story is timeless ... and a true test of a writer's skill in avoiding that &quot;dated&quot; tone. Dodie Smith's novel is as fresh and vivid as if it were written today. I actually took this book to work with me so I could finish it on my lunch hour.Thoroughly original and engrossing."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"After seeing the movie trailer for &quot;I Capture the Castle,&quot; my interest was sparked &amp; I devoured this book. Before I knew it (and to my very great dismay), the book was over just as I was getting to know and become fond of the narrator and heroine, Cassandra Mortmain. I was enchanted by this story of a bright young girl and her first love though I was often times quite aggravated by her very eccentric family and neighbors - most particularly her mad father and marriage-minded sister. Yet, in the end the characters are part of what made the story so enjoyable. As portrayed in this book, life in a castle in 1930's England, was quite an experience. An ideal read to curl up with on a rainy day!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book is a fabulous coming of age story that is written splendidly. The narrator begins as a clever 17-year-old and matures in the story to be a sharp and self-aware young adult. The stories of her family are entertaining and it is so much fun to see all of them mature in the novel. The story and Dodie Smith's engaging writing style makes the book almost impossible to put down."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"In the first few pages of her journal, Cassandra Mortmain paints an amusing, whimsical, and somewhat depressing picture of her life in a crumbling castle in the English countryside. She lives here with her sister Rose, her brother Thomas, her father James, her stepmother Topaz, and the family's live-in helper Stephen Colly. They live a life of genteel poverty, quite often not having enough income to feed the family. James Mortmain has a more-than-serious case of writer's block having once traveled and lectured on his critically aclaimed book. Now the family has no other income than that contributed by the hard working Stephen who would gladly hand over all that he owns to win Cassandra's favor. In the opening scene, Cassandra discusses the family's poverty and the fact that they have sold off nearly every stick of furniture in order to make ends meet. As the family sits down to tea, Cassandra writes of the unexpected treat of having eggs. She exclaims, &quot;I was only expecting bread and margarine for tea, and I don't get as used to margarine as I could wish. I thank heaven there is no cheaper form of bread than bread.&quot;This book is told in first person and is the journal that Cassandra keeps over the course of a year. We learn her fears and dreams, and we get to know her family through her eyes. When two handsome, wealthy, and exotic Americans show up to claim their birthright, Cassandra and Rose are both thrown into their first encounter with romantic love. Cassandra tells a sweet and touching story woven through with a great deal of humor which keeps this story from becoming dull and whining. We literally get to read Cassandra's march from being an awkward girl to developing into a charming young woman making her mark on the world.As trite as it might sound, this is truly an enchanting book. I kept thinking that the author was doing such a remarkable job of creating an authentic atmosphere with the dialogue, clothing, and current events of the time. Then I found out that the book was originally written in the 1940s which isn't a far leap from the 30s setting of the book! This is also penned by the author who wrote One Hundred and One Dalmations. I recommend this for anyone who has no problems reading books such as Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. While this is certainly less stuffy than the &quot;classics,&quot; it is nonetheless a treat to read.(reviewer: mellion108 from Michigan)"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is one of the nicest, sweetest, loveliest books I have ever read. Absolutely charming...and I haven't finished it yet! Like any good book, I am torn between not wanting it to end and wanting to do nothing but curl up with it. I happened upon this title while reading movie reviews - it was recently made into a movie and is currently in theaters. I plan to see it when I finish the book, but not a minute sooner. Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book was recommended to me and I am forever thankful that I bought it. Through the diaries of a teenage girl named Cassandra Mortmain, the reader has the opportunity to discover the Mortmain's style of living in their old, broken-down castle. James Mortmain, reknown author of Jacob Wrestling, suddenly stopped writing and spends his days in the gatehouse, reading detective novels. After Cassandra and Rose's mother died, James decided to marry a woman who was at the same time excentric, peculair and overly obsessed with nudity: Topaz. Topaz posed for artists', but did not really enjoy it and rarely received any money for posing. With no income whatsoever, it would take a miracle for the Mortmain family to continue living.However, thing slowly changed: Stephen, the Mortmain's servant and Cassandra's admirer, received a job at Four Stones. This gave the family a bit more financial freedom, but nothing major happened until they met the Cottons'. Simon Cotton took possession of Scoatney Hall, and, in this case, the castle, since the Mortmain only had a 40 year lease on the castle. But Simon didn't mind that the Mortmain's couldn't pay their rent; in fact, he was so honoured of meeting James Mortmain that Simon frequently came to the house to talk to the family. Neil Cotton, Simon's brother, was also there, but less present then Simon was.As the story unfolds, things seem promising for the family: Rose is engaged to Simon. However, things suddenly go wrong, as first love often does. A surprising ending, with a witty and lovable narrator and a perfect length for the book. What more can a reader ask for?I find this is a great book for teenagers and prepares them for the often deceiving ending of their first relationship. It was very well written and inspired me to start a journal, just like Cassandra did. It makes readers who have never experienced love realize that it is not as beautiful as is often perceived to be in fairy tales. With a zest of rustic, mediaeval feel snd a modern twist, this book is something that will be cherished and passed on from generation to generation."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Here is a book you can &quot;live in&quot; and enjoy all the tears and laughter right along with this wonderful family. I hated it to end but look forward to reading it again. It's a true classic!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book was extremely inciteful and readable and contained fabulous characterization. I was enthralled from the first sentence to the last by Cassandra's adventures and misadventures. I would recommend it to anyone. In someways comic, and in some tragic, it is always lyrical and beautiful."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read a short blurb about this book and knew I would love it. I was unprepared, however, for how deeply I felt about it. This is a book to savor, although I found it hard to pace myself. Smith's book is as satisfying as a Jane Austen novel and as funny as the Adrain Mole diaries by Sue Townsend."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Have you ever had lots of people tell you that you *have* to see this great movie, only to go and wonder what they were talking about? That's how I feel about this book. My expectations were so high after reading the reviews here, that I was expecting this to be one of my favorite books of all time. And although it did not live up to the hype, I still thoroughly enjoyed this engaging book -- I just didn't *love* it.The story takes place in a more innocent time, in a lonely and dilapidated castle in England, where the impoverished Mortmain family lives. The narrator is the younger daughter of a once-successful author, and one of the sheer joys of this novel is the narrative voice -- it is charming and youthful, and wise yet perplexed in a way that intelligent young people can be -- remarkable since the author was in her 50s when she wrote it! This was also playwright Dodie Smith's first novel; often a playwright has trouble capturing the natural flow of conversation and description, but Smith accomplishes both here.Another strength is that the author, like Alfred Hitchcock, does not *tell* so much as *show*. Related as diary entries, and therefore more intimate than straight narrative, illustrative anecdotes immerse the reader in the state of mind of the narrator, Cassandra: we are as confused by her father's peculiar behavior as she is, we do not know whether or not sister Rose really loves her fiancee, we do not know whether or not Stephen would be a desirable beau for our heroine. Late in the book, Cassandra's father develops a theory that readers create and discover as they read, and Dodie Smith has ensured that we experience this as well as read about it.The Mortmains are complex -- stepmother Topaz is hard-working and kind, if a bit shallow; Rose is dramatic and moody, but also brave. Other characters, particularly the two American brothers who inherit the castle, are not as three-dimensional, and we are never as interested in them as we are in the English characters.The ending is lovely -- no neat resolution here. Instead, the reader is left to conjecture about the future of the Mortmain family based on what we know about them, and thanks to the talents of the author, we know a great deal and care enough to wonder."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle\\" is about a 17 year old girl in England living with her eccentric and impoverished family in a castle that her author father bought when he received money from writing an acclaimed novel called \\"Jacob Rising\\".However, since the death of their mother, Cassandra Mortmain and her siblings, Rose and Thomas, have lived with their father and stepmother, Topaz, in poverty. Their father, Mr. Mortmain, is down on his luck and seems to have writer's block or possibly have suffered a nervous breakdown. Whatever his problems are nobody in the household works and they are selling off the furnishings and artwork from Belmotte Castle where they live.New neighbors move in to an estate near the Mortmain estate and soon Rose Mortmain is engaged to on of the American sons. The Mortmains are soon receiving monetary aid for their predicament from the Cotton's.Cassandra Mortmain chronicles the Mortmain's life in her journal. Her chronicles make up the book, \\"I Capture the Castle\\" and the story is fairly tedious at times. The story kept my interest since I wanted to find out how Rose and Cassandra handled their lives and also what would happen with their father. The ending was unsatisfactory for me. I did not find this quite as enchanting as other reviewers did."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book is sort of a Gone With The Wind type. I loved it so much, and the end was so heart-breaking and wonderful at the same time. You sort of wish it could have ended differently, but it was also so beautiful that you know you couldn't possibly change a thing. After reading it I longed so much for a sequal. I cry even thinking about this book. It's like you become Cassandra, and feel the way she does about Simon. This is the most wonderful book of all time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I kept reading this book hoping it would get more interesting. I rarely give up on books but after 120 pages I HAD to send this one to Goodwill!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"When I finished reading I Captured the Castle, I couldn't get it out of my head. The characters came to life in the 1930s of the English countryside.The narrator is a precocious 14-year-old. Perhaps I felt something for this kind of strong female pubescent lead character. Cassandra Mortmain narrates her family's travails in her notebook and keeps a journal to chronicle the eccentric activities of her father, the essential paper tiger. A one-hit-wonder with an obfuscating literary book published many years ago, Cassandra's father fails as a breadwinner and the females in the family conspire to generate household income. Their best option is marrying off Cassandra's older sister to the new rich American neighbor.This premise doesn't reveal the surprise and ambiguous ending to the tale, and it is all about the means towards a better end that makes it a fun and light summer read. What lingers long after the reading is the way Dodie Smith wrote about the confusions of first loves and how one loves another who doesn't return the affection and how another loves you and you can't reciprocate. Confusing? She captures that female whirlspinning sensation remarkably and it seems so timeless.The male characters are three-dimensional and Cassandra's younger brother Stephen wins my heart. So too the young male servant orphaned into their family; Cassandra is not taken with his godlike beauty and finds him a bit daft.The father character is so fantastic that I won't give much away. He is a portrait of so many tortured writers who will never be authors. A widower, once accused of threatening to kill his wife with a butter knife and sent to prison, he remarried an aesthetic muse in Topaz, a beauty whose images adorned the walls of museums. But he hasn't written a second book. He doesn't do anything but read cheap detective novels all day long. Now a penniless country bumpkin instead of a London diva, Topaz cannot arouse him to write. It is the American widow who arrives and intellectually stimulates him to change his behavioral oddities and replace them with other peculiarities.I am reminded of the same kind of writing agility of Willa Cather in her depiction of the professor in The Professor's House. The skill required to convey the gender and age and human frailties of these men is impressive for any writer. Each character has a distinctive voice and personality.Cassandra and her brother conspire with insights derived from the new fangled theory proposed by Freud to make their father work. Cassandra can't help but want to free her sister from a loveless marriage to support the family because she has fallen in love with her sister's fiancee. If only her father would make a living!It's Parent-Trap meets Petticoat Junction on a Monty Python set. Hilarious."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first read this book many many years ago (hate to tell you how many) because I'd read a blurb somewhere that the movie was scheduled to be made with Hayley Mills (I can only imagine if that fabulous film had ever come to fruition). It never materialized, unfortunately--but the book itself almost made up for it. I've probably reread it 100 times over the years and it still remains one of my favorites--not only because of the lyrical, descriptive prose but the beautiful images of England it conjured up in my mind. The story is wonderful and the characters are magical; particularly Cassandra and her struggles to find herself and her talent. Cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the CastleThis is such a fun book and easy to read--hard to put down. Love it. I want all my daughters to read it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Yes, I admit it, I'm a man in his 30s, and I fell in love with Cassandra Mortmain while reading this book.

What an incredible book ... I feel that I know those characters and places so intimately that I can't convince myself they're all fictional. I read the last few pages at a snail's pace, because I really didn't want it to end. There have been only a handful of books that have ever so thoroughly entranced me.I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read this book. But it isn't just a book for girls.

It is the kind of book in which halfway through it you become terribly sad because you don't want it to end. I Capture the Castle is written with such beauty, originality, and humor, and is so easy to relate to, even if one has never lived next to a crumbling old castle in the English countryside. If you want to read a book that will make you feel wonderful inside, this is the one."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"An old family friend gave me a copy of this when I was a teenager and I must have read it ten times before loaning it to some wretch who didn't give it back! I just re-read my brand new copy and loved it just as much. Dodie Smith was not only a great storyteller and a wonderful writer -- she also had a fabulous sense of humor. This book literally makes me laugh out loud every time I read it -- and in spite of its age, it isn't dated at all. Great characterizations, tons of atmosphere, and wit by the gallon -- not to mention a story that will keep you up much too late for your own good!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Each page of this remarkable book contains an enchanting tone. Cassandra Mortmain chronicles each event at Godsend Castle with such a distinct detail. Her narration of her exciting life is very readable and enjoyable. Dodie Smith obviously had a strong connection with this wonderful character.The plot should not be discussed in too much detail because it takes so many turns. Cassandra's descriptions of the characters in her life and how she interacts with those characters is as delightful as her situation. A seventeen year-old girl living with her older sister, eccentric stepmother, and unusual father in a dilapidated castle in pre-war England? How could I resist such a romantic setting. Cassandra's story gives us a very unique look at the people in her life, and what unique people they are! The American Cotton family, the bashful Stephen, the mysterious father. We are given a thoughtful look into her life. Instantly, I won Cassandra's attention. I took interest in her thoughts and experiences. Her voice is wonderful, her experiences are unique, and her story is delightful. I was glad to have met her. I am not yet fifteen, and I heartily congratulate the reissue of this gem of a book. I hope other young people will enjoy this story. Similar to this is Cold Comfort Farm. On many occasions while I was reading Cassandra's story I was reminded of this story."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book is extraordinary! =) I've bought copies for friends, lent it out to people I know, etc. It's just a great book..

Can you imagine my joy when I found it here? My gradmother read &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; when she was a girl in the 40's. My mother read it when she was a girl in the 60's. I read it as a girl in the 90's. Through three generations, &quot;I capture the Castle&quot; has been--and still is--our favorite book. I am overjoyed to see that it has been brought back to print. It has been long, long overdue."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Plain and simple: I ADORED I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith. I fell in love with the unusual and artless Cassandra. I fell in love with her entire eccentric family: her selfish writer-father; her beautiful artistic stepmother, Topaz; her shallow sister, Rose; and her little brother, Tom. I fell in love with poor but gorgeous Stephen. And I most definitely fell in love with the decrepit castle in the remote English countryside. But then I'm a romantic.I think part of the reason that I Capture the Castle charmed me so much was because certain elements of it reminded me of two of my favorite books and their heroines: Anne of Green Gables and Pride and Prejudice.I Capture the Castle is set in England in the 1930s. Cassandra's family has been living in the moldy castle for many years without having paid any rent. They have no income coming in because no one works. Sometimes there is a royalty check from the publisher because Cassandra's father once wrote a highly acclaimed and important novel which is still being taught in universities. The problem is, he hasn't published anything since. He has been shutting himself off in his room to supposedly \\"write\\"; everyone indulges is strange behavior because they're hoping for more of his greatness to come forth. Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother, does her best to take care of everyone, but a life of poverty is a far cry from when she used to be an artist's model in London. Rose hates the castle and having no money and is determined to get out being poor by any means possible.Cassandra, ironically, is writing up a storm. While her famous father is blocked, she fills notebook after notebook about her family and her sharp and lyrical observations of their lives. You might think that living in such isolation with so little wouldn't have much cause for her to write but some of the funniest sections have to do with how they try to make do with what they have. However, things soon take an exciting turn when two American brothers stumble upon the castle and its peculiar inhabitants.\\"I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cosy. I can't say that I am really comfortable, and there is a depressing smell of carbolic soap, but this is the only part of the kitchen where there is any daylight left. And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiring--I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. Though even that isn't a very good poem. I have decided that my poetry is so bad that I musn't write any more of it.\\"Characters fall in love but not with those whom they should; hearts are broken and there are no neat and tidy conclusions. All throughout, Cassandra's pure voice chronicles every occurrence with such candor, heart, and insight that reading I Capture the Castle was a magical experience.The 2003 movie is wonderful and does capture the book very well. Plus the one and only Bill Nighy as Cassandra's father is perfect casting!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a fun, charming little book, written in a sort of loose diary format from the perspective of a girl living in 1930's rural England. Most of its appeal is in Cassandra's voice, which is very strong, and its portrayal of a coming-of-age story that's enjoyable and lighthearted, but without being dumb or shallow in retrospect.Cassandra and her family live in an old castle, and they've been sinking into poverty since her author-father hasn't written anything for years. Much of the book focuses on the romantic escapades of Cassandra and her older sister Rose, when two eligible young American men move in nearby. But the book isn't a romance; it's a story about growing up, and Cassandra wrestles with her relationships with family members, her (lack of) religious beliefs and her writing skills--she's keeping a journal as practice for writing a novel, which neatly explains the inclusion of scenes and dialogue in someone's diary.The book starts out a bit slowly, but gets going after about 50 pages and is an entertaining read. \\"Charming\\" is probably the best word for it. Cassandra stands out for her mix of intelligence and navet&eacute;; she's quite perceptive about people, but doesn't know much about life. She feels real and authentic (minus one problem that I'll get to later). It's interesting to see all the other characters through Cassandra's eyes, because several are not very nice and yet everything we hear about them is filtered through Cassandra's deep-seated affection for them. The book makes excellent use of voice and perspective and never forgets who is telling the tale. And the writing style is good, but believable coming from a 17-18 year old girl. Some episodes are downright amusing, and the book does a good job recalling what it's like to grow up.My biggest problem with the book was that I experienced a lot of dissonance regarding Cassandra's (and Rose's) actual age. Cassandra is 17-18 and Rose 20-21, but both felt 3-4 years younger. A lot of that is probably cultural and as a historical fiction reader I should be used to this, but I think the fact that the book is set in relatively modern times actually made this worse. There's the way people around Cassandra infantilize her--their constantly referring to her as a \\"child\\" (even her significantly-older love interest does this, which is creepy) and, for instance, asking if she's old enough to attend a dinner party (why wouldn't she be?) had me picturing her as about 12. And then, neither she nor Rose seems to have any future plans; Cassandra has no thought of leaving home; neither has any work experience or marketable skills; neither has ever thought herself in love or so much as kissed a boy. (Rose, whom we're told is beautiful, \\"first realizes\\" her power over men during the book. I know they live in a remote area, but surely she'd encountered male attention before?) So, Cassandra's experience of being 17-18 felt more like my experience of being 15. Which surprised me a bit, because we think of ourselves as growing up slowly in the U.S. these days. On the bright side, though, the fact that I can relate to Cassandra's experiences at all speaks well of the book.Possibly I just read this book at the wrong age (mid-20s). It's probably best read by either teenagers a few years younger than Cassandra, or adults decades removed who want to look back nostalgically on their teen years. One of the things Smith does very well here is write a book that can appeal to both kids and adults; perhaps because it was written before the \\"young adult\\" genre was born, it's appropriate for young readers without ever feeling patronizing or whitewashed."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle has been sitting on my to-read pile for years...ever since my aunt gave me a copy and told me I'd love it. She was right! It is a sweet (and a little silly) coming-of-age story about a girl, Cassandra, who lives in poverty in a dilapidated castle with her eccentric family. She wants to live in a 50/50 mix of a Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte novel, so you can guess how the story progresses when a rich family moves in nearby! I'm happy that I took time to read this gem."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"\\"I Capture the Castle,\\" by accomplished English playwright and novelist Dodie Smith, will capture your heart. With consummate skill, Smith presents us with the journals of young Cassandra Mortmain. Cassandra at seventeen possesses both sense and sensibility; the novel is both a coming-of-age tale and a love story. Cassandra looks at the world through clear eyes; she is kind and loving to everyone in her life, and completely honest with herself. Yet at times we are transported into the romantic fantasies of a young girl experiencing first love. Like the best novels of the 1940s--a golden period for women readers-- this one is wisely written and emotionally satisfying, with insights into the hearts of the central characters. It would make a good book club selection."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just finished reading I Capture the Castle for the first time and I am left with wonder at the depth and artistry of Dodie Smith. The characters were strong individuals without becoming clich?s (Let's face it: Rose could have been.) I loved their quirks and their problems.As I flip through others postings, I'm rather shocked to read that many believed/hoped that 'I Capture' was a romance. It isn't. The ending isn't accidental or vague. (Yes it leaves possibilities... But that is part of the point.) This is a book about \`choosing to feel', not about \`falling in love.' Reread the portion about Miss Marcy's work with the children, the Vicar's work with the church, and Cassandra's thoughts on embracing their choices or walking past. (And the reason she gives for why she chooses as she does.) Reread (and figure out) what the father's strange writing was about.To all the scoffers, I loved the ending. She was true to what she'd learned and what she believed, and that was more important than romance. (Although, I'm not a romance basher. Love it actually.)I can't recommend this book enough. It was a pleasure to immerse myself in Cassandra's world. Wish I could stay there longer."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read this book as a teenager in the 60s, and still, on occasion, pick it up for a &quot;change of pace.&quot; It never fails to charm and please me. It's a complete &quot;escape&quot; book -- you won't find anything like it on today's best seller lists.Now, if some publisher would just reprint &quot;The Peaceable Kingdom,&quot; I'd be a fulfilled and happy person.

Hard lesson learned."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"[yes, the title is cheesy, but it's true!!)At first when I started reading I Capture the Castle, I must admit, I was a little bored. I put off reading it for more than a year! Now I could read it over and over and over again, and it would still be great! The book starts off slow, really, but after sitting down in a nice, quiet room, and taking in every word I began to like it. I found as I began reading that the book grew more and more interesting. (Once you getting a feeling of the book) The storyline flows and it's so well put that you feel like you're sitting in Cassandra's kitchen, that you're right beside her while she writes in the kitchen sink. Cassandra and her family live in an old castle, which Cassandra absolutely adores. The book is about Cassandra Mortmain, and her daily life in that castle, set in the 1930's; her hardships with her family, her battles with love and the every day comedy's of life.Dodie Smith really makes Cassandra and the other Mortmains come to life. Cassandra is one of the most likeable characters I have ever \\"read about\\", she is stubborn, funny and dislikes anything involving romance,[ in the sense of romance between to people.] Quirky and perceptive, Cassandra will always keep you smiling. Then there's beautiful Stephen who's in love with her, who she thinks of as a brother, her sister Rose, who attracts boys where ever she goes, Topaz, Cassandra's step-mother who's a part-time nude model and her eccentric father, who's been having writing block...for twelve years. Cassandra's younger brother Thomas plays a lesser role in the book, but he does help with some of Cassandra's schemes. I do have some qualms with the ending though, it was a strange ending- but at the same time, I loved the ending! I capture the castle is a delightful book....go out and buy it!! If you're Canadian it's pretty expensive for a paperback, but get it anyways, it's truly worth it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a really wonderful book for those with a whimsical, romantic, but unconservative bent. Seventeen year old Cassandra, along with her unusual family, lives in a chilly dilapitaded English castle. Though they live in poverty, the strength of their imaginations, wit, and sense of fun, prevents one from feeling their lives are lacking. Many scenes are infused with a subtle otherworldliness, as are some of the characters. The tale is filled with the tricks ones mind can play on itself when in love and even Cassandras sister Rose, so determined to marry her way out of poverty, finds she cannot ignore the real thing when it comes along. Though she tries. Oddly, as a female, I had a lot more empathy for the male characters. Especially the gentle love-sick Stephen. The characters, while not sophisticated, are something finer, more brilliant, and fresh. Nothing new or original is said about love in this story, but it does take the essence of coming of age, longing, and struggle, and infuses it with a pensive magic. To say anything more would deprive one of the delightful details of this wonderful tale."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle can be summed up in only one word- delightful.

Over the course of a few months, she intends to &quot;capture&quot; each person in the castle- describing his or her personality, opinions, and other interesting quirks. Reading this book reminded me of reading Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. The characters were just as likeable (or unlikeable) and the result was a story that shimmers like a fairy tale. My only complaints are as follows: a. The second half of the book gets a bit melodramatic at points, and you'll probably find yourself longing for the lighthearted wit from the beginning of the novel. and, b. The book is now over and I can't read it again for the first time.Read it once. Believe me, you will fall in love with Cassandra.

They hope that their father will one day begin writing again, or that Cassandra's beautiful elder sister, Rose, will marry well and save them all.Enter the American Cotton brothers, who are wealthy and have just inherited the nearby estate of Scoatney, as well as the landlordship of the Mortmain's dwelling. Rose Mortmain and her stepmother see nothing but dollar signs as they scheme to marry Rose off to Simon, the eldest Cotton. But Cassandra has fallen for Simon herself...I was skeptical of this book because the cover was so outdated and plain. The story itself is set in the 1930's, but the book was published in 1948, and it seemed so dated. But once I started reading, I could scarcely put it down. This is classic English literature at its best, with a storyline that will pass from age to age without ever seeming old-fashioned. I highly recommend it and plan to keep my copy forever!!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"(I save 10's for Dostoyevsky)This book is a dear, wonderful tale of life and love and intellectual exploration. It is the story of Cassandra and her sister Rose; their adventures in castle and great house and village of England; touching on London high society, the art world, Druidic rites, and an American dowager who collects creative types.When it opens, Cassandra and Rose are in dire poverty because their brilliant writer father is going through a long dry spell. Rose makes a wish by kissing a gargoyle 30 feet above their medieval kitchen for something to happen... anything! Of course her wish comes true. Enter Simon and Peter and many exciting events, including Cassandra being stranded penniless in London after midnight, and Rose being mistaken for an escaped circus bear.Reminiscent of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, with its daisy chain of infatuations, and peopled with delightfully real characters from the beautiful, gallant Steven to the bogus artist-model stepmother, this book is a joy to read from start to finish. I'm jealous of you if you haven't read it yet. I wish I could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"A seventeen-year-old girl and a six-hundred-year-old castle&iexcl;what an interesting match! From the very start of the novel, the clever and humourous narration \\"captures\\" the reader's heart and keeps them in expectation all the way to the end. Reading it is such a delightful and enjoyable experience!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I started this book around midnight and read for the next four hours straight. And then for some godforsaken reason, this book gave me an urge to go for a very early morning jog. I came home refreshed after my run and you know what I did then? Picked up the novel and resumed reading. This book was a breath of fresh air, it really makes a person hopeful. Cassandra Mortmain is witty and funny and makes you feel as if you are literally there with her in the castle. Some people may think it moves too slowly, but I think that is part of the charm. Every detail is \\"captured.\\" This has become one of my favorites! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I CAPTURE THE CASTLE was recommended to me by an acquaintance when it became available a few years ago, in print after a long absence in the United States. It has become one of my favorite books not for it's depth or subject matter but for the shimmering state of existence it captures- that of a precocious girl becoming an intelligent young woman. Don't let the recent film adaptation prevent you from reading the book because its charm lies in the first person narration (something never captured in film) of Cassandra Mortmain. She chronicles her family's life in an old castle where her beautiful elder sister Rose chafes at her isolation and poverty, her father, the once promising author, continues to suffer from writer's block, his artist's model second wife, Topaz, makes the best of it, and the solid Stephen helps the family without pay. Their world is inevitably changed by the arrival of new American landlords and eligible bachelor brothers Simon and Neil Cotton.However what could become a trite romance or standard coming of age story is carefully avoided by the thoughtful honesty of its narrator tempered by the comedy of the situations and by a hint of the sadness that accompanies all change. I confess I have purchased eight copies of the book and given them to friends because of the transitory feeling it so accurately grasps. Set in the 1930's, the narration still feels fresh even if the social codes have changed. This is unlike Dodie Smith's famous work, 101 Dalmatians, though, it is perhaps more like her plays, indeed, she even wrote a stage version of I CAPTURE THE CASTLE. It is an imminently readable and enchanting book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This was easily the best thing I read in all of 2002, and I read a lot. Though this was written 50 years ago, the writing still seems fresh and modern, and the characters are as alive today as they were when they were written. A heartbreakingly good coming of age story.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I found this book by accident in the tiny library of a summerhouse on the Maine coast. I read it in one day, and I loved it so much I actually took it home with me! The characters in this book are so well developed that you feel like you know them.The story is so real and so beautiful. You can identify with Cassandra as she deals with life, and the people who surround her. I read this book at least once a year, just to stay in touch, and i never, ever get tired of it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"The first feeling is one of total surprise. I really did not expect such an entertaining modern book. Although this is a book that was published, as I understand in 1948, it is very modern and refreshing and seems to be dealing with issues relevant to young women in any time and place.What is mostly refreshing is the writing of Cassandra, the 17 year old narrator. Cassandra would like to be a writer one day and therefore writes this account. She writes candidly, vividly and with no need to impress herself or others. Cassandra is totally true to herself and the fact that the Dodie Smith chose this mechanism of diary writing as her narrating tool allows us to see Cassandra grow, mature and understand the world in front of our eyes. The descriptions are real, alive and very detailed. The story, which can be very simply described as a sort of love story is interesting due to the lovely characters. Cassandra which the reader knows inside and out, a person that likes human beings and nature alike. The beautiful rural English view comes alive through her eyes as well as the behaviours of the people surrounding her. Cassandra has an eye for detail and a natural way to catch all gestures (an example for this would be Cassandra's description of her sister Rose drinking the green Menthe drink which she chose on purpose as it matches her hair). We also have Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, beautiful and looking for a way to escape her poverty life, Thomas their younger brother, Stephan a servant son who has been living with the family, the father, a writer who does not write, and their stepmother, Topaz, a model for artists, full of good will and kindness. All these characters are presented as round figures, we see their good and bad qualities and this mixture, together with further characters makes this a superb book. Pure entertainment."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain lives a life of poverty is a crumbling castle in England. Her family consists of her father who was once a critically acclaimed author but hasn't been working in years; her eccentric step mother, Topaz; her dramatic and romantic sister, Rose; her younger brother, Thomas; and Stephen, who helps maintain the castle for free and is infatuated with Cassandra. Cassandra begins, one cold evening, sitting in her kitchen sink, to write a journal in order to teach her self how to read. The events that follow this decision will change her life forever. Her family meets the Cottons, two wealthy men from America named Simon and Neil. When Rose becomes attracted to Simon she begins to come up with a plan that could bring the Mortmain family out of poverty. What is she marries Simon? As the book progresses Cassandra deals with all the issues of growing up: love, trust, finding faith, and learning to understand her family and friends.I have to admit the only reason I really read this book is because of JK Rowling's commentary of it on the cover. I learned quite quickly that I Capture the Castle was much different from Harry Potter. Written by Dodie Smith (who wrote 101 Dalmations which has been made into two movies by Disney) in the 1930s, I Capture the Castle manages to capture a young, charismatic narrator that you will fall in love with right away. Cassandra begins this book very much as a child but by the end she has not only &quot;captured the castle&quot; but has grown up into a sophisticated young woman. I very much enjoyed this book. There are a couple twists near the end that even I didn't expect to see. The characters are fascinating and very well drawn and it's written extremely well. I would recommend this novel to both the young and the young at heart. It's a very good book. I highly recommend you read it!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just finished reading this book and came to Amazon in hopes that some of her other adult titles were in print--no luck there.

I did this book for an ISU because i liked it so much"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; by Dodie Smith is like a beautiful painting of words. It's about 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain and her family, who live in an old ruined castle in England. Her father is a writer with severe writers block, but who wrote an obscure book, which was one of the most important books of that generation. This book is about her experiences, going from poverty to wealth, from loneliness to love, from complete estrangement from her father to a daughter again. Written as a sort of journal, it chronicles her life for what seems to be about a year. It is written beautifully, very expressively, and to me seems to have an ethereal quality. Some characters are well thought out, and necessarily deep, whereas some, such as Mrs Cotton, are just small, sometimes comedic, sometimes more sombre, pencil-sketches.Cassandra lives through desparate poverty, her father's mood swings, her sister's love affair, falling in love herself, her step-mother's odd habits and rituals, the &quot;hired&quot; help's love for her, and records all of it in hindsight, often with amazing insight and maturity, while maintaining the voice of a 17 year old.This book, to my mind, brings back images of the novels I read when I was young - narrative, and with seemingly no other deeper messages to convey. It is the type of book that I can imagine a mother giving a daughter to read. It is wonderfully innocent, and yet delightfully ravishing to the senses. It is timeless, and creates the English country village scene without any real reference to year or generation. It was a joy to read, and I hope that others find the same pleasure in it that I found."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book has everything a good book should have: memorable characters (Cassandra is one of the most lovable narrators I've ever stumbled upon, and I wanted to meet in person everyone in the story!), substance, romance, humor, and the ability to keep the reader thoroughly happy! I did not want this book to end. I felt I was part of their 1930 English countryside world and didn't want to come back to 2002 (there's just no &quot;class&quot; in the world anymore!) This book gave me the same warm glowing feeling as Pride and Prejudice. There is the film that is coming out soon.

Cassandra is the second daughter of what would be called today, a one hit wonder, a writer whose only, and only moderately successful book was followed by a period of writer's block which lasted for many years. She lives with her father, elder sister, younger brother and step mother in a 14 th century castle, a mouldering ruin with crumbling brick work and damp walls which looks romantic and like something from a fairy tale but is, in reality, far from comfortable in any way. The family lives in poverty with barely enough to eat and only a few items of clothing left on their backs. When the new owners of the castle return from the US to take up their inheritance, the family plots to marry off the elder and prettier sister to the heir to the estate, as they are literally starving and prepared to resort to any means of getting money.

However, please dont let this deter you from reading it. I thought I would really dislike the style, but you will hardly notice it once you start the book. The book has a good pace to it, its definitely a leisurely summer read. The main character is Seventeen-year-old Cassandra. Throughout the book she has do deal not only with her crazy family, but also first love. My favorite thing about the book is that it really goes against the perception of many young girls today that all your problems get fixed if you get married, but it doesnt rub your nose in it either. Cassandra's sister is one such girl, and its a nice comparison to see how Cassandra handles her problems compared to how her sister hopes to handle them. I highly recommend this book, it has beautiful language and a wonderful setting, a castle in england. There are no bad scenes in the book, nor bad language. Both young and old will find the book very delightful."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"What a thoroughly enjoyable book.

It spent so long out of print (my copy was my mothers) and I wonder who finally bit the bullet and put it back in print. May they be rewarded with great sales!

The library didn't have it but amazingly I found it on Kijiji for $2.I was very excited about this book and this is why I am so disappointed. I've been reading patiently, waiting for the story and not just descriptions of minor events, and finally, at the end of the second of Cassandra's journals something happens. Great, here we go, I thought relieved (I really wanted this book to get good as I had already invested some time in it). But no, that event sort of implodes, and looks like we're back to more descriptions of Cassandra's strange (and not very likeable to me) family. I don't know, maybe I am five pages away from something happening again, but I don't care anymore. I don't even like Cassandra all that much.

Narrator/diarist Cassandra (I know she isn't really Romola Garai, but it's nice to think she is) is quite a wit and a talented young writer, courtesy of her eccentric father. Her stepmother and older sister, according to her, are both great beauties - nothing wrong with that. Each of them is admired by several men, always a good sign. And the several men are in turn variously chased by the (mostly) chaste women. If this sounds a bit like a soap opera, as some of the less enthusiastic reviewers have written, perhaps it is, but one of a very high quality, one with many surprises, picturesque settings, and at least one great car - played by a GP Bugatti in the movie. A very enjoyable diversion, despite a rather slow start."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I just loved I Capture The Castle. What a charming book!Set in the 1930s in a rural English town, the novel tells the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen year old girl living with her family in a run-down castle. Cassandra's family is highly eccentric. Her father is a tortured writer, her stepmother a free spirit and great beauty and her sister Rose is her imaginative best friend and confidante. The story revolves around the love triangle that ensues when two wealthy American brothers move into a nearby estate and begin courting the Mortmain sisters.Smith's writing style is languid and lushly romantic. The novel is a pleasure to read. While Rose and Cassandra's romances are very much mired in old fashioned conventions, the emotions involved are quite accessible to modern readers. Cassandra comes across as a vivid and believable character and it's easy to care for her.I have to say that I was disappointed in the ending. Not because it didn't work, but because I'd been hoping for a different outcome. I actually thought about it for days. That's the power of a good story!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Mortimer Adler (How to Read a Book) recommends reading a book three times to delve deeper into what an author is trying to say through their story. I just finished reading this for the first time. This really deserves a closer read now that I \\"get\\" what happens with Rose at the end. (No spoilers here).I'd seen the movie a while ago and it didn't really do anything for me. I watched the movie again last night and still didn't like it. Sure, the movie was OK, but I don't think it really got to the heart of the story.I feel the author is really trying to say something here that is summarized at the end during the discussion between Simon and Cassandra about her father's book. This book is a puzzle in itself on purpose. It is not just about a love story, or a child growing up. Dodie Smith is trying to say something about the creative process itself. It will take effort on the reader's part to tease out all the meaning that is layered into the story."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Sometimes when as a modern reader you read books from the early part of the 20th century or before they can feel... stale or dated.\\"I Capture the Castle\\" may have been written in the 40's but it feels so very and amazingly moddern.

This book is a delightful read! I read this book last year around Thanksgiving. (...you a know it's a good book when you can remember details like exactly when you read it!) I thoroughly enjoyed the old language in this book, and I could picture the scenes perfectly in my head as I was reading. (I still remember many of the scenes of this book -after a whole year and many, many books later!)It is a great story, and the ending will surprise you. I didn't want the book to end, I wanted to keep reading about the characters and their lives.If you know a teen (or anyone else!) who loves to read, I would think that this would make a great gift, they'd probably keep it for the rest of their lives!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"In a past life, I lived in a castle; it is the only thing that can explain this obsession I have. I even have castles on my checks! And, since I'm an Aglophile, I gravitate towards books from Britian. Anyway, I get a lot of ideas for books from AMAZON'S marvelous 'lists' and when I saw something that said, I CAPTURE THE CASTLE, my curiosity got the best of me. And then, reviewers were comparing the author to Austen and Bronte and the heroine to Jane Eyre or Elizabeth Bennett. Since these people are referring to my all time favorite books, I immediately ordered this one. The cover of the book has a castle on it and the back has a recommendation from J K Rowling, another favorite author! WOW! I couldn't wait to start this book.Well, despite not seeing any similarities between the above authors to Dodie Smith (who also wrote the classic 101 DALMATIONS) or my beloved heroines to the seventeen year-old Cassandra Mortmain, this is still an enthralling read.This novel was published in 1948 but takes place in the 1930's. James Mortmain has written a very successful novel called \\"Jacob Wrestling.\\" He makes quite a bit of money and then, years later is sent to prison for 3 months for dramatically brandishing a cake knife at his wife during a family picnic (a neighbor 'tells'). When he returns from his incarceration, he has writer's block that spans decades. He also impetuously signs a 40-year lease on a ramshackle castle that is hundreds of years old. He promptly hides out in the tower all day, every day to read novels (while his family thinks he is writing). Cassandra, an aspiring writer, tells the story through her detailed journals.In addition to the father and Cassandra, the family now consists of the beautiful and selfish older sister Rose, a brother Tom, and an eccentric and free spirited Topaz, the beautiful stepmother (their mother has died years before of natural causes). There is also a young servant boy, Stephen (who is madly in love with Cassandra). Since the dad is useless, the family sells not only the furniture but also personal belongings to buy food. Stephen tends the garden and volunteers to get another job to support the family that should be paying him. To add drama and romance, the handsome and charming Cotton brothers move into the manor adjacent to the castle. Mr. Mortmain is supposed to be paying rent to the owner of this estate (he doesn't).One can really imagine what is going to happen from just reading the paragraph before this one. Yes, this book is a tad dated and predictable but trust me, there is a delicious twist at the end to satiate all of us romantics who love the fairy-tale ending. Cassandra is absolutely charming and we really pull for this young lady. I loved reading this novel; it was so easy to get into and easy to follow. The story was sweet (if you ignore the slattern father and bratty sister) with nice language and no $*x.........very classic. And of course, the other star of this tale is the wonderful castle!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"After reading the latest reviews on Amazon I felt obliged to write my own review.This is a wonderful book. It reads very easily and the story is a joy to follow. I love Cassandra and her very matter-of-fact love lorn ways. Rose is the character that you want to hate but just can't. All the characters are enjoyable and life like.Of course, this is a book for younger readers. I still feel it is a very good read for any age. I read it in one sitting and loved every minute of it. I have since re-read it twice and I still love it.I have heard that this is also one of JK Rowlings favorite books as a child, and that it inspired her to write.High praise indeed.Please read it for yourself and don't let those without imagination turn you away from it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I absolutely love this book! I say it a lot, and it's always true. My mom gave me her copy when I was twelve, she'd found a first printing copy in a box of books her father recieved from the book of the month club, read it, and fell in love. So she passed it on to me and I adore it every bit as much as she does. This is beautiful story, it sucks you in. You care about the people and it is definatly not a brick wall happy ending. I still wonder what happened...how Cassandra's life turned out, not to mention her sister rose's. This is the story of a young girl and her family living in an old castle in rural england. Her sister detests poverty (unfortunate, since they are extremely poor), her father is a has been writer who's work is still studied in colleges in england and america, but brings in little to no income (he hasn't written a word in years) and her step mother is an eccentric (to say the least) painters model who communes naked with nature and finds the castle wonderfully romantic. Everyone in this book is human. they have flaws...selfishness, lazyness...insecurities, and their flaws only make them more endearing. When Cassandra's sister Rose meets an American millionair come to stay at a neighboring estate (actually, he's their landlord) she determines immediately that she will marry this man, Simon Cotton, whether she loves him or not. I wont say too much about the plot, because I don't want to ruin it, but suffice to say that this story is above all real. I can relate, just as my mother could, and anyone who has ever been in (unrequited) love will be able to relate. It's touching without being mushy, and trust me, you don't know how it's going to turn out, even if 2/3rds of the way through you think you do. On top of that, it's funny! you will be laughing out loud. Green hands, naked step moms, and ackward situations abound (there's a scene involving rose and a bearskin coat that is a classic) so don't expect it to be preachy. Just entertaining, touching, and fun."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I cannot think of a book which has made me laugh, cry, daydream, and fight the urge to finish reading instead of savoring each word as long as possible. The book works on so many levels, but I won't bother mentioning them. Mostly, it shows Cassandra developing her writing skills and maturing into a lovely sensible young woman. The descriptions are sometimes so breathtaking that I reread them and just closed my eyes to visualize what this place must be like. While I wish there were a chance that a movie could be made about it, so much would be lost without the words Cassandra writes. This is a book that I will recommend to others; it was as close to perfect as I have found for some time."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I knew that the book was good the moment I realized that I was enjoying it -- because the first time I read &quot;I Capture the Castle&quot;, I was only ten years old. Furthermore, my mother was forty-five, and she loved it just as much as I did. And, now that I think of it, so did my grandmother (sixty-eight, I believe).&quot;I Capture the Castle&quot; is an amazing novel set in the thirties, near the town of Godsend, somewhere in England. The book is told in the form of a journal; seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain, whose best poem was written on top of the henhouse (and it wasn't a good one at that), has finally given up on rhyme and meter, and has decided that the best way to train herself into &quot;good writer&quot; position would be to keep a journal in her own very unique shorthand.Cassandra, her broody father, her eccentric stepmother Topaz, her older sister Rose, her younger brother Thomas, and Stephen (who helps with the gardening and things) all live in a large house -- well, mostly castle, but a bit house as well -- with very little money and not much hope ... until two strangers show up at their door after their car has been stuck in the mud, claiming to have seen some spirits dancing around atop the battlements.Smith's style is whimsical at times, dead serious at others, but all the time managing to capture the reader's attention, as she captures the castle."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first found this book in England and have read it twice since then. It will be difficult to find one unhappy reviewer for this book as it is perfect in itself. It is the story of seventeen-year-old Cassandra Mortmain and her eccentric family who live in a crumbling castle in 1930's England. Her lovely sister Rose,&quot; a pinkish person&quot;, is desperate to be married off, her father has become strangly antiscocial after his days as a best-selling author, and Topaz, her stepmother, is the very embodiment of eccentric. Cassandra herself is intelligent, dreamy and sometimes sarcastic, loved by Stephen, &quot;eighteen now, very fair and noble looking but his expression is just a fraction daft,&quot; who gives her plagiarized poems, but in love with someone else.

It is worth far more than $11.16!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle, an absolutely delightful story by DodieSmith, also the author of 101 Dalmations, which was popularized byDisney's film adaptations. Dodie was born and raised in England (rather evident from this tale!), but wrote I Capture the Castle in the '40's while living in America. For some reason, ICtC has been out of print for many years. I join many of the literary populace in their cheers of gratefulness for the recent re-printing!I Capture the Castle is the story of Cassandra Mortmain, a seventeen-year-old aspiring writer, who lives with her family in a rapidly deteriorating castle in the middle of the English countryside. ICtC is her diary, sharing with readers not just a story, but the intimate thoughts and marvelous details recorded by a girl in transition to womanhood.Uproariously funny, I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks. Cassandra's escapades were certainly WORTH recording! Her comments about the people in her life kept me constantly in stitches. Mr. Mortmain, Cassandra's father, is a one-time-published author; a man who everyone considers to be brilliant, but who does nothing to support his family and goes through life like a zombie. Then there is Topaz, Cassandra's stepmother-- though young enough to be a sister. Topaz is a nude modelist for &quot;great&quot; paintings and is invariably eccentric, down to her midnight romps &quot;communing with nature&quot; out in the country. Rose, Cassandra's elder sister, is a lamentable character; and Thomas, the brother, as sweet as can be. Then there are the love interests: Stephen- the family man-of-all-work, and the Cotton Brothers- a breath of fresh air from America.But I'd better stop there. I wouldn't want to give the story away! Then again, Dodie created so many wonderful twists and turns, that &quot;giving away the story&quot; would be neigh unto impossible!If you want something light, humorous, and quick, yet possessing elements of the serious and thoughtful, you are in for a very good time with I Capture the Castle.

Well I do love reading, and I especially love reading and rereading this book. I'm always enchanted by the clever plot, the teacher with the blinky eyes, the white dresses the sisters wore in London when everyone else was wearing black, the image I have of Cassandra's stepmother floating like a ghost while communing with nature and the crinoline tossed over Cassandra's shoulder as she walks down the lane. Sometimes I think I can even smell the musty, dank hallways of the castle. In my many moves over the years, I lost the copy of the book my mother gave me, and was heartsick about it because I had planned to give it to my two daughters when they become teenagers. I'm thrilled that the book has been reprinted! I hope it becomes our family tradition to pass this book on from mother to daughter."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I was online searching desperately for other books by Dodie Smith and became absorbed in the reviews for I Capture the Castle, my favorite book of all time. Most everyone agreed that it is one of the most beautiful, enjoyable novels ever written, but I was spurred to write this review after discovering a review by someone who ACTUALLY gave it two stars or something equally pathetic. Their reason: because \\"no book could ever live up to Lord of the Rings,\\" which they had just finished. For the record, this is not a book to be compared to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The differences between the two are astounding, one being that tLOtR is, albeit a well-done history and fantasy novel, stale and boring, especially compared to a book like ICtC, which really enchants the reader from start to finish. I read Tolkein's trilogy and enjoyed the imaginative goings-on, but I had to force myself to finish, to read the long boring passages saturated with history.Everyone should read the Lord of the Rings, and everyone should read I Capture the Castle. But please don't avoid it because one elitist person thinks that one is better than the other. I Capture the Castle is truly mesmerizing and can be enjoyed by anyone...seriously."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read \`I capture the Castle' over a year ago and enjoyed it even though (forgive me for using the \`R' word) it is a romance, which I don't usually find too interesting. What I find amazing is that it has stuck in my mind like the contents of a child's treasure box.The setting of the castle is as clear in my mind today as it was when I read about it and it gives me a pang of regret to realize that it is only a place of fiction and not one I can ever lay eyes on. In truth, though, it appears more vividly in the imagination that it ever could if it were made of mere stone. Seldom has a title of a book been so apropos.I would say more about Dodie Smith's portrayal of the characters but others have done so. I do regret that she didn't leave the world with more of her books.I can't wait to introduce my daughters to it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"There really are no words for how much I enjoyed this book. The main character, Cassandra Mortmain, tells an entertaining story in a delightful voice. Her humor, her zest and her knack for observation and introspection make her first-person narrative both compelling and vastly entertaining. I wish I had the book handy so that I could post half a dozen excerpts to demonstrate how falling-down funny this book is in places. As it is, I will have to satisfy myself only by telling you that the first sentence is \\"I am writing this sitting in the kitchen sink.\\" A more auspicious beginning I cannot imagine.A great part of what I enjoyed about this book was the humor. Cassandra's family gives new meaning to the term \\"dysfunctional\\" and her descriptions of the various members and their escapades are hilarious. But I appreciated the book equally for its serious parts and for the sensitive touch with which the main romance was unfolded. Cassandra's soul-searching is insightful and touching, and her rendition of the traditional teenage unrequited crush and subsequent angst is fresh and honest. Towards the end of the book, I started to get a little worried that the book's original light-hearted tone had gone forever, and that the book would end on a downer, but I was relieved to find that I was wrong. Speaking of the ending, it was neither complete nor entirely without a note of sadness, but I thought it exactly appropriate. It ended with hope, even if you're a cynical reader, and if (like me) you're a shamelessly sentimental reader who can squeeze a happy ending into even the tiniest crack given the chance, it ended with considerably more than hope. Thematically, the ending was perfect.For some reason, I keep wanting to say that Cassandra Mortmain is Anne Shirley for post-moderns, which I don't think is exactly right, but it's close. She did strike me as a character that many Green Gables fans will identify with. I Capture the Castle deals with a lot more complicated issues, especially in the interpersonal relationship department, whereas Anne's stories (and relationships) are much simpler and more straightforward. Cassandra is called upon to examine herself and others much more deeply than Anne ever does while Anne has more opportunity for innocent whimsy. Anyway, I think that people who identified with Anne as teens will identify just as strongly with Cassandra a few years later. I did, at any rate."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I am not sure when first I read \\"I Capture the Castle\\". I believe I might have been in High School. I do know when I got my own copy of the book: in 1975, when I was twenty-five years old. That was 31 years ago...and I have read it every few years ever since I've had the joy of it's presence on my bookshelf. I shared it with my daugter when she was in High School, and it's one of her favorites, too. That is not to say this book is a \\"girly\\" book, or even a \\"romance\\". It's something altogether different. Ethereal, yet heart touchingly real. Imaginative, yet grounded and honest. It really is, very much, a journey of a young soul into self awareness, truth, and ultimately, spiritual and moral triumph. All this accomplished through a journal written by 17 year old Cassandra Mortmain, documenting the sometimes humorous, sometimes embarassing, sometimes touching and sometimes painfully profound events that occur during seven months in one momentous, and pivotal year. This is no \\"fairy tale\\". The image of the crumbling castle, and it's eccentric and complicated inhabitants isn't a careless or gratuitous one. Like in the fictional book \\"Jacob Wrestling\\", that the father of our heroine wrote years ago as his \\"one hit wonder\\"...there is a reason for everything in this book. The image of a \\"bear\\" \\"attacking\\" sister Rose, the \\"dead shoes\\", the \\"Shape\\" seen at a Midsummer's Eve observance. the pennies coming out of a 'phone in answer to \\"prayer\\"; the green of a liqueur against beautiful hair, a bowl and pitcher glimpsed in a window: all of it together forms a pattern that is crafted to imprint the book's message indeliably into a receptive reader's mind. Yet..it's all done so charmingly that one hardly realizes one has just had one's consciousness elevated. The reader may think he's merely being entertained....I am with those who believe \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a modern classic. The very fact, from the time I read it first, some 40 years ago, that it's images and charm has haunted me to this day is testament to it's validity and value. I will find myself somewhere, in some circumstance, and suddenly a correlating scene from the book pops into my head. As Cassandra's passage into womanhood leaves first one childhood dream, then another, behind...my heart squeezes with pain at the losses we all endure in our journey into adulthood. Yes, this is a wonderful book for a young person. But it's also for all ages, even someone old, like me. That is why I must go back to \\"The Castle\\" every few years, as I travel this road of life...and with every visit, I spot something new, learn something else, grow a little more...."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This intelligently written, playful, and all around delightful novel, set in mid-20th century England, was the answer to my prayers oh so long ago, when I was in the throes of teenage angst. Although it was written before I was born, it never struck me as being outdated or inaccessible. The heroine, Cassandra Mortmain, lives in a derelict medieval castle in the English countryside, with a motley assortment of family members. Hers is a distinctly bohemian, if not to say eccentric, household, but to me she seemed as real as my fellow classmates in New York's Greenwich Village. The frequently hilarious, frequently touching moments in the life of Cassandra and her circle--her father, a once-famous writer, her beautiful, dissatisfied sister Rose, her artist's-model stepmother Topaz, her precocious younger brother, and the family's faithful \\"servitor,\\" the incredibly handsome, lovelorn Stephen--make for entertaining reading of the best sort. Enter two wealthy, half-American brothers, one of whom actually owns the castle and the land it stands on, and the stage is set for romance (both requited and unrequited), misunderstandings, comedy, and Cassandra's own poignant coming of age. Dodie Smith, the author of \\"101 Dalmations,\\" combines wit with a sprightly prose style to produce an almost cinematic flow of imagery in the mind of the reader. For young women, age 13 and up, who have not grown hardened and blase on a diet of \\"Gossip Girl\\" type literature, this book is worth its weight in gold."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Dodie Smith's 'I Capture the Castle' was reccomended to me at a party...I picked it up that night and read it for two straight days until I finished it. The book was enrapturing...it didn't start to fast or to slow but the discriptions are wonderful. Cassandra is a wonderful character with all vantages of the human nature shown through her, from extreme happiness to jealousy of her sister, Rose. A wonderful book to read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book is Fantastic!The story Takes place In an old English Castle. Cassandra Mortmain, a Writer-to-be, tells the story of her Family.

But I suppose that is the way of things, as different people fell in love with other people throughout the book. The best part of this novel - aside from its all-over dreamy, magical feel (&amp; no, there is no magic in this book, it is just the feeling) - is the characters. Wonderfully unique, and very real, you find yourself caring for them, despite their faults, as people close to you. And I adored the concept of her father's novel, ingenous. But most of all, this novel let me meet Cassandra and that is by far the most wonderful gift of all. What an enchanting character. Yes, buy this book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I fell in love with this book from the very first chapter. It's funny, poignant and creates such a vivid picture of Cassandra's family and castle that you never forget them. From Bohemian Topaz to Mortmain and the cake knife, from Rose to Stephan to Leda Fox-Cotton, all these people are real. Read this book. You will never forget it."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is the most wonderfully enchanting story! I first read this book when I was 12 or 13, a Book of the Month Club selection from the 1940's that belonged to my grandmother. I have probably read it least 50 times since then (I am now 47). I would love to find another old volume of this book as mine is lovingly worn. I was so delighted when I found out that it was being reprinted. I have purchased a new copy and recommend it to all of my friends. It is wonderfully written and Cassandra Mortmain has captured my heart for all time. Was there ever a sequel written? Did Cassandra love Simon for all time? Did Simon ever return that love? And what of Rose and Neil? Did they live happily ever after? How I wish I knew; I have wondered all my life. I wish I could thank Miss Smith personally for her lovely story that has brought me so much happiness."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I chose this book as I enjoyed Dodie Smith's book for children- especially 'the Twilight Barking'. I loved the book - it is such a snapshot of time and circumstances, very 'other- worldly' I felt. I recommend it to all ages"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"So happy I could order my own copy of this wonderful book, an early creation by the author of 101Dalmations"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a reputed classic, which it took me some effort to land on the Kindle. It was reputedly revised endless times before publication, and is supposed to have been the Great Hope of its author. It is well-written, if well-written = very smooth, fairly clear transitions, strong narrative voice, memorable setting and characters. The central trope, the Young Girl's Bildungsroman, has been around since *LIttle Women* and *What Katy Did*, and it seems rather obvious that the writer has gone for Oddest Version of the Young Girl Possible, a competition very evident in some of the (English) YA i've recently read - Joan Aiken's Dido Twite, Eva Ibbotson's Countesses, for-ex, but happening in a lot of other places too. If your Young Girl isn't odd, it seems she isn't interesting.Cassandra Mortmain certainly comes across as odd, from her opening sentence, written ostensibly sitting in the kitchen sink, but then her whole family appears odd, from her reputed genius novelist father to her supposedly gold-digging sister, and their Castle is even odder. There's another recent narrative solution present - the arrival before an impoverished English family of some Rich, Young, Handsome Americans - Pride and Prejudice for the Post-War Period. *Castle* does present the husband-chasing of at least one Mortmain girl more unabashedly than Austen did, though of course, that turns out to have been a mistake, and she actually elopes with somebody else, while the protagonist/narrator (sort of) captures the main matrimonial prize.Cassandra's whimsical voice, poverty-stricken circumstances and general comedy of weirdness are taking generally, but I'm glad the ending has an unexpected twist, because by then I was thoroughly out of charity with the book over its treatment of the other Competing but Utterly Ineligible Suitor. This is the young Englishman who's been living with the family, trading his orphaned lack of hearth or kin for playing general dogsbody while mooning after Cassandra. It's made plain from square one that he is Not Suitable - a sudden and very ugly extrusion of classism that is startling in this context.Unlike Simon the Gooseboy in Aiken's Willoughby Chase books, however, Stephen never apotheosizes into a nobleman and discovers an ancestral heritage. Instead, after attempting to serve Cassandra as devotedly as a dog, he's treated like one. He's very handsome, so eventually a fast lady photographer takes him off to photograph (and possibly seduce) and then introduces him into filmdom. Whereupon the Mortmains let him pack up his little chest - given to him but a non-Mortmain - leave his squalid little Castle room, and, despite his even having travelled clear up to London to help Cassandra in extremis over her American, walk out of their lives without so much as a Thank you, let alone any more concrete keepsake.I personally was so angry over the way Stephen was treated, by both characters and author, that this book went very close to bottoming out on my review scale. Classism is to be expected in Austen (who seldom shows it because the really Lower Classes never behave like humans in her work) but what's it doing in somebody writing after WWII? Especially as blatant and unremarked as this lot.Wherefore, so far as I'm concerned, Miss Cassandra Mortmain may have captured the castle but all she captured from me was a large helping of disgust."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This book was excellent. If you love a good narrator, this book is for you. Very entertaining and fun to read, but also has substance. I have already passed it along to a friend."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I'm sorry: it really seems a promising and refreshing book - but somehow, somewhere, is just starts riding downhill in a succession of clich&eacute;s and small incomprehensible absurds which go crashing all the way down the road and end up in a discombobulated mess. A nice promise - yet not delivered.Three stars, all for them for the first part of the book."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"With blurbs from authors like J.K. Rowling and a huge following I was so excited to read I Capture The Castle. It promised to be a romance from another time, filled with whimsy and spunk and all that other good stuff they had in the mid-thirties. There was even an old-castle and a, possibly haunted, tower! All of the ingredients seemed to be there. Unfortunately I think I built my expectations up a bit more than I should have. It wasn't that I hated this book, in fact there were things I really loved about it. Let's start with those shall we? First of all I loved the style it was written in. The story is told through our main character, Cassandra's, journals. Her genuine and lovable voice lends itself well to the story as she describes her life living in a crumbling old castle with her eccentric family. Although she has seen years of poverty and neglect thanks to her writer father, she loves her family and enjoys life at the castle. Cassandra starts out as such an up-beat character. She sees the good in life and strives to see everyday as a new adventure. Along with Cassandra, there is an entire cast of lovable, if flawed, characters. There's her father, who hasn't written a word in 12 years but continues to lock himself away in his office each day, her stepmother (who insists her given name is Topaz and likes to dance naked in the rain), her older sister Rose, who is the definition of a drama queen and the two new Americans who have moved into the mansion down the road bringing an air of mystery and suspense along with them. The first half of the book was full of adventure and intrigue with these characters and I ate it up. I was sure that I would love them forever and that this would be a favorite book. Then things got messy.Now, I'm not talking about conflict. There's plenty of that from the beginning. Mostly what I'm referring to are the love triangles (yes multiple). I could have tolerated one, but everyone seemed to be in love with the wrong person and this was the main plot device for the majority of the book. Not only was it confusing, it was frustrating as hell. Everyone was going around being as selfish and stupid as possible with no concern for anyone or anything else and I just sat there wanting to throw the book at my wall. By the time I got to the ending I was so exhausted and upset that I didn't even really care what happened. No, that's not true, I did still care, but then Dodie Smith had to go and make sure that no one ended up where I wanted them too. I realize that Ms. Smith didn't do this as a personal affront to me, but it sure felt that way. I won't say that I hated this book, because I didn't. I could have even loved it if it weren't for so much nonsense in the middle. I could have dealt with the ending too, but I was so worn out that all I felt was frustration. So I'm giving this one three stars because the setting, characters and the beginning were all great. It just didn't quite live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I enjoy reading historical fiction and England is one of my favorite places to read about. Throwing a castle in was just icing on the cake. Well written and engaging."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Now that I've reread this, I can honestly say I am still in love with it. I first read I Capture the Castle when I was about Cassandra's age, and it spoke to me on such a deep, personal level. Years and years have gone by since, but a new book club gave me the opportunity to read it again... and I shall be forever grateful.Dodie Smith created such a magnificent piece of wonder when she wrote this. Being (much) older than the first time I read it, I feel like I can sympathize more with Rose and everything she goes through... and causes to happen. I think I remember hating her for being such a heartless wretch of a human being during my first read. Now, I can commiserate with her despair and wanting to help out her family, even at the cost of marrying someone she doesn't love. Stephen, on the other hand, remains a character I feel kind of sorry for. He's so devoted to Cassandra. When he finally realizes she doesn't and will never love him the way he would want her to, he is devastated, but he accepts it eventually. He just wants her to be happy, even if that means she ends up with someone else. Stephen really shines at that point, in my opinion. He finally takes control of his own life and makes decisions for himself. I know I definitely prefer this Stephen over the lovesick puppy hoping for attention. Topaz also shone more the second time around. I fear I felt she was just a silly woman with no real substance to her at first. She really is a strong and brave character and she is quite selfless, though a little eccentric. I did find myself getting quite upset with Mr. Mortmain. It made me angry that his loving family was being practically ignored and forced to live in such horrible poverty. I believe he should have sucked it up and helped support his family... taken responsibility for their misfortunes. Stupid man.During the book club, it was much talked about and despised that nothing really resolved itself. Cassandra didn't get to be with Simon. Rose and Neil got a happy ending, but still. Does Mr. Mortmain ever finish his book? Does Stephen go on to be a famous actor? Does Simon ever get over his heartbreak, forget Rose and embrace Cassandra? So many questions, but only an open-ended story to tease you. Frankly, I love the open end. I know full well what I imagine happens to these characters and I think the author was quite right in giving the reader an opportunity to create it. I suppose it would have been nice to have confirmation, but then it wouldn't feel genuine, in my opinion. Cassandra is more or less content with where her story ends, so why shouldn't we, right? I mean, not everything gets tied up in a neat bow in real life. Cassandra, being the intelligent, brave girl that she is, knows this.Also during our book club meeting, there were complaints about too much scenery talk. Personally, being an extremely visual person, I loved it. I guess I'm just a different kind of reader from those in my group. Also, I thought it went well with the format of the novel. Cassandra wants to be a writer and she's writing a journal as a way to practice. Naturally, she is going to write about what she knows, hence why there is so much about the castle itself. You can also see her mature through her writing so much of what surrounds her. Our heroine really does find her voice and is able to \\"capture the castle\\" quite perfectly.I Capture the Castle is a beautifully written coming-of-age story that is sure to continue to be as relevant today as it has been since its publication in 1948. I simply love this novel!A favorite quote: \\"The thought came to me that perhaps it is the loving that counts, not the being loved in return - that perhaps true loving can never know anything but happiness.\\""},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"It certainly isn't a bodice ripper. The characters are pleasant people and the main character grows from teenager to an intelligent and caring young woman while doing everything she can to help her father, step-mother (no, not evil), sister, brother and adopted brother without hurting anyone."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I started this book and then put it down for months. I finally picked it up a couple of days ago and could hardly put it down at all. It is delightful! But oh, I wish it would have continued. I wish there was a second book to continue Cassandra's story. This is a lovely, lovely, laugh-out-loud book that touched my heart so much!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"This is a classic coming of age story with a memorable, loveable heroine. If I'd read this when I was fourteen I would have grown up loving Casandra Mortmain just as much as Jo Marsh or Elizabeth Bennett. Her first-person narration is both laugh-out-loud funny and innocently heartbreaking at the same time. A bit Jane Eyre and a bit Pride and Prejudice, Smith uses the elements of both the gothic novel and the comedy of mannors to unique effect. The subtle criticisms of modern art and literature that are woven throughout the story are both funny and true. More importantly, I couldn't put this book down and was sorry when it was over. The characters are memorable and their world is enchanting. It's feminist and romantic at the same time. And the ending, without giving anything away, is absolutely perfect. This is the rare book I've read as an adult that feels as if it's always been a favorite. So glad to have discovered it now!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Warm, wise and witty, a lovely (and quite funny) story of young love in a crumbling English castle. The voice is delightful and although I was, as I began reading, a bit concerned about the diary-entry structure, I needn't have been. Suits perfectly. And it made me want to drink lots of tea, which is always a bonus. Enjoy."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Wow- I loved this story from the very beginning to the last page. Cassandra is one of those great characters and I loved reading her journals. The story begins with Cassandra's family in poverty, her father wrote an important book many years ago and has not written anything since. The family is out of money and hope when they get a new owner to the castle they rent. The new owner, Simon, is a rich, handsome young man who comes to visit the family with his brother Neil. After a bad start the brothers come to enjoy spending time with Cassandra's family and Simon falls in love with Cassandra's beautiful sister Rose.The story follows Cassandra through many difficulties including dealing with Stephen, the boy who has loved her for a very long time, helping her father get through his writer's block, supporting her sister, and finding her own way through the feelings of first love. It is a delightful story told with humor, insight, and love by a very intelligent 17 year old girl.The setting of the old, crumbling castle is perfect and the characters are entertaining. Cassandra's father gives a whole new meaning to the word eccentric! I would highly recommend this delightful coming-of-age story, it was a wonderful read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I enjoyed the first half of this Brit lit coming of age story more than the 2nd half. The unique narrative voice of the character Cassandra is very intelligent and charming throughout. The resourcefulness of the Mortmain family living in poverty and need in a crumbling castle was related in a humorous way. However, the fact can't be ignored that they are living in poverty and want because their one-hit wonder author father has not produced any source of income in quite some time, and appears to have no motivation to do so. Although most of the characters are flawed in some way, some of the father's flaws are a bit darker in nature.The book was written at a time when women had few options to make their way in life, and some of the character's motivations and attitudes reflect that. From a more modern perspective, some of the character's attitudes were a bit grating at times. This is especially true of sister Rose's desperation to marry for material security, and her utter lack of any other skills other than singing or looking pretty.There was at least one part that I found laugh out loud funny involving a foiled attempt to evade a social encounter, some old beaver and bear furs, a case of mistaken identity, and a pitchfork. That alone was worth the read."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12 and since have been unable to find a book that would be as captivating and enjoyable as Dodie Smiths I Capture the Castle. I can read this book over and over without tiring of it and I only wish they had it for my kindle so that I can take it with me everywhere without fear that it will rip!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I thought this book was truly wonderful, even if the ending was a bit sudden. This is a story about two young women who live in an old castle with their father Mortmain-who was a writer, untill he went to jail-, and their step-mother Topaz-who was a model for artists. The story takes place near London. I'm sure any ambituos young reader will like!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I first read this book when I was a child, and then reread it so often that I almost knew it off by heart. I love everything about it, the eccentric characters, the strong visual images, the hints at sexuality, the wonderful, mysterious fantasy world that you can escape into. I too imagined it as a film, or TV series (I'd be the director and could choose the cast). I've loved reading all the other reviews, they brought back so many good memories. Thank you everyone. I lost my book about 20 years ago, but am going to buy another asap. I can't wait to read it again (and again)!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"&quot;I write this sitting in the kitchen sink. That is, my feet are in it; the rest of me is on the draining-board, which I have padded with our dog's blanket and the tea-cozy.

And I have found that sitting in a place where you have never sat before can be inspiriting-- I wrote my very best poem while sitting on the hen-house. Though even that wasn't a very good poem.

ICtC is her diary, sharing with readers not just a STORY, but the intimate thoughts and marvelous details recorded by a girl in transition to womanhood.Uproariously funny, I laughed until tears ran down my cheeks. Cassandra's escapades were certainly WORTH recording! Her exceedingly truthful comments about the people her life kept me constantly in stiches. Mr. Mortmain, Cassandra's father, is a one-time-published-author; a man who everyone considers quite brilliant, but who does nothing to support his family and goes through life like a zombie. Then there is Topaz, Cassandra's excentric step-mother, though young enough to be a sister. She is a nude modelist and engages in all sorts of interesting romps, including &quot;communining with nature&quot; at midnight, also in the buff! Rose, Cassandra's sister, is a lamentable character, and Thomas, her brother, as sweet as can be. Then there are the love interests: Stephen, family man-of-all-work; and the Cotton Brothers, a breath of fresh air from America.But I'd better stop there. I wouldn't want to give the story away! Then again, Dodie created so many wonderful twists and turns, that &quot;giving away the story&quot; would be neigh impossible!If you want something quick, light, and humorous, yet possessing elements of the serious and thoughtful, you are in for a VERY good time with &quot;I Capture the Castle.&quot;"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I read this based on two or three articles in the press and was somewhat hesitant about it on that basis -- after all, hype is never trustworthy. However, like so many other reviewers, I was delighted once I began reading. Age tends to teach us that love and art do not respond according to plan and Cassandra's experience is a charming reminder of what it is to be seventeen and just learning that lesson for the first time. I do wish I'd found it as an adolescent. This is an unsung delight. Buy it for a young girl you know and keep a hardcover copy on your own shelf."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I've been re-reading &quot;I Capture The Castle&quot; for more than 25 years. It's one of the books of which I have to keep two copies: one to lend to friends, and one to keep safely on my nightstand. The prose is delicate without being unbearably sweet, the story is a constant delight, and Cassandra's dry humor is perfect. I can't imagine a life of the mind without this book!"},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I thought until I met Cassandra that I was the only sixteen year old girl who'd ever fallen in love with a 28 year old man who liked the same books she did. ICTC isn't just wonderful, it's miserable, magical, comforting, cheerful, beautiful... it isn't anything ordinary, but I think most people will find it deeply familiar. Thank you, Dodie, thank you thank you thank you."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Thanks so much all of you who previously wrote reviews - it's due to you that I bought this book! I had never heard of it before, but thought that with all these great reviews it would be worth a try. It was. Wonderful characters, interesting plot - a great coming-of-age story. I enjoyed particularly Casssandra's father, although I'm sure I wouldn't have enjoyed his books! I wondered if the fact that it was written in 1948 when the British were still enduring rationing has anything to do with the many descriptions of food and clothing which were written with real longing."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I Capture the Castle is a wonderful book that will be enjoyed by girls and women of all ages. I've just discovered the book now but I know that I would have loved to have it as a companion during my teenage years. One aspect of the novel that I enjoyed was the contrast between British and American customs and behavior. I'm so grateful that this classic has been rediscovered and reissued."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"I have been reading this book for over 30 years. There is something about it so magical, and yet so earthy, that I always come away from it with something new. Although set in '30's England, the characters face situations and troubles with which we can all identify and in particular, Cassandra, the narrator of the book goes through adolescent angst so poignantly that you just want to sit with her in the castle window seat and be her friend through it all. I heartily recommend this book to anyone, young or old, who cherishes good books with characters you wish were real."},{"Title":"I Capture the Castle","review":"Last year, my daughters (ages 12 and 14) and I went to Disney World. I had picked up a copy of this book at a bookstore on the way to the airport. As soon as I started I was hooked. Forget Splash Mountain, swimming, fine dining- all I wanted to do was read. Within the week, my girls had both read it. We continue to talk about it- and give it to friends. The BEST!"},{"Title":"Kiowa Verdict (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"Cynthia Haseloff has made a grand effort in this fictionalized history account of a raid by Kiowans on a freighter train, a trial and a verdict. Because records of the events have mostly been destroyed, or were deliberately never made, Haseloff has been forced to assume a lot about what happened and why it happened. It's generally a good job.The legalities of trying Comanches and Kiowans raiding into North Texas while residing 'out of reach' in Oklahoma weren't vague at the time. The raiders understood enough of the law to know they were immune from prosecution by Texans for depredations in Texas if they escaped to Oklahoma. In this instance, the laws were ignored. Two men responsible for a raid that resulted in the deaths of several freighters and torture of one were arrested, taken back to Texas, tried and hanged.From a strictly practical perspective, it was probably the right method of dealing with the event, though illegal. Even though Comanche raids continued for several years after this trial, the security of refuge provided by the Oklahoma Territory was never again to be trusted. Comanches who remained at war with whites in Texas were forced to remain on the high plains and face white retribution for their acts. This eventually allowed Colonel Ranald McKenzie to destroy the entire horse-herd of the raiding bands, putting them afoot and ending their ability to conduct raids without exterminating the entire tribe.The fate of Penateka Comanche, the Karankawa, the Lipan Apache, the Fara'on Apache, and many other tribes caught in the vicegrip of Spanish and Anglo migration into the American West and Southwest is a bloody illustration of the other alternative.The author has done a good job of reconstructing the events, the setting, the characters and the context. I recommend it for anyone interested in that phase of Texas history."},{"Title":"Kiowa Verdict (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"Cynthia Haseloff has captured the spirit of the American frontier in a way that kept me spellbound from beginning to end. Not only did I come away with a true sense of the era, but I also became a new fan of the Western genre, as well (at least the Haseloff Western genre). I can't wait to read her prequel to this book, &quot;Satanta's Woman.&quot; I would highly recommend &quot;The Kiowa Verdict&quot; to anyone looking for a great beside-your-bed read."},{"Title":"Kiowa Verdict (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"Cynthia Haseloff has written a great western that very much deserves the 1998 Spur award recieved from the Western Writers of America.The Kiowa Verdict is based on the trial of two Kiowa Indians, Satanta and Adoltay also called Big Tree, for taking part in the \\"The Warren Wagon Train Massacre.\\" Satanta led about 100 Kiowas and Comanches and attacked a wagon train with only a dozen white men. This took place west of Fort Richardson, Texas, in the spring of 1871. There was little doubt who was responsible, for Satanta himself bragged to Quaker Indian agent Lawrie Tatum at Fort Sill:\\"Remember this. If any other Indian comes in here saying he led the raid he will be lying, because I, Satanta, led it.\\"Satanta and Big Tree were the first Indians to be tried in a white man's court in Texas for crimes committed against Texans.Historically both Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. Governor Edmund J. Davis commuted their sentences to life imprisonment. Later Satanta committed suicide by leaping headfirst from a second story window at the Texas State Prison in Huntsville and smashing his head on stone paving.Adoltay, or Big Tree, a young warrior, converted to Methodism while in prison, was eventually released, was ordained as a Methodist minister, returned to the Kiowa-Comanche lands around Fort Sill and was instrumental in converting many Kiowas and Comanches to Methodism.One of the characters in this novel, Joseph A. Woolfolk, a Confederate and Frontier Regiment veteran, was appointed by the Thirteenth District Court of the State of Texas to defend the Kiowas. The prosecutor was S. W. T. Lanham, who later became governor of Texas.Transcripts of the trial don't exist, so what courtroom action there is - and of course the thoughts and fears of Joe Woolfolk - are entirely fictional. What is real is the fact that poor Joe Woolfolk instead of putting up a token defense, actually defended his clients in court.To paraphrase the sometimes Western writer Mark Twain, \\"the reports of the death of the Western have been greatly exaggerated.\\" The modern Western has been part of the American literary scene ever since - and arguably long before - Owen Wister introduced readers to \\"The Virginian\\" in 1902, and it shows no signs of riding into the sunset."},{"Title":"Kiowa Verdict (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"This book is the winner of the 1998 Spur Award for Best Western Novel (selected by the Western Writers of America)."},{"Title":"Kiowa Verdict (Five Star First Edition Western)","review":"Cynthia, has captured the events of a very special time in our history and built beautiful characters around the very people who played such an important role in that point in time of the american west."},{"Title":"Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism","review":"This book will give you the inside scoop on the concept, history and day-to-day life of a photojournalist.

His comments on the craft and business of photojournalism were enlightening. This book is well worth the money."},{"Title":"Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism","review":"I have honestly say that I expected more from Mr. Chapnick. While some chapters ARE informative, others - like how to present yourself at an interview - are routine and almost obvious. Any so-called professional should NEVER show up looking like a bum. Or, (if I recall correctly) to use Mr. Chapnick's example, 'Animal' from the old Lou Grant program. You better have the rep of an Avedon or an Adams, and even THEN, you might not get the job. While I did see some pages on amazon, to judge from the title, I feel the title is a bit misleading. While Mr. Chapnick DOES cover some points of 1st Amendment, ethical and legal issues, I was expecting the bulk of the book to deal with these issues from a journalistic/freedom of the press point of view - both in America AND abroad. While he DOES touch on this when discussing shooters killed in the line of duty, I was expeceting more. For example: How did BLACK STAR photographers (or any other photog he knew about) deal with the Chinese Army and censorship during Tiannamen Square? What about shooters in previous years working in Central and South America (ie: Susan Meiselas)? As a counterpoint, the story about Don McCullin is interesting. At what point do you HAVE to stop looking at man's inhumanity to man and almost force yourself to walk away from being a war photographer? Mr. Chapnick discusses this. All this said, Mr. Chapnick never, EVER denigrates a shooter! From Adams to Nachtwey and every one known and unknown in between, Mr. Chapnick writes about every one with respect and the kind of thoughtful patience he showed me when I was in his office one day more than 20 years ago surrounded by photographs by James Nachtwey. For me, I learned about photojournalism by going out and doing it.

His books always feel like a real novel in the classic sense. In this one Uris tackles the rebuilding of post World War II Germany and the dramatic Berlin airlift. The book is full of tough, gritty men doing heroic deeds. Uris also deals a good bit with the redemptive power of love.As the story unfolds, the reader understands the ambivalence Americans felt toward the defeated German people during that era. The book also shows repeatedly how awful and vindictive the Soviets were toward those same people. Many of the characters in the novel are stereotypes representing social groups but the idea here is history in action and when the story takes off it just roars along to a dramatic conclusion that leaves the reader both entertained and informed. A reader couldn't ask for more."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Mention the author Leon Uris and books like \\"Exodus,\\" \\"Trinity,\\" and \\"QB VII\\" come to mind. His novel ARMAGEDDON rarely makes such a list, which is a shame, as this powerful story reveals an accomplished author able to weave a riveting tale populated by a stunning array of complex characters.I first read ARMAGEDDON over thirty years ago; it was my introduction to Uris--an intro that led me in an enthusiastic frenzy to his other works. While I have enjoyed them all (especially \\"QB VII\\"), I keep coming back to ARMAGEDDON as Uris' definitive accomplishment. Written during the height of the Cold War--detailing the alarming complexities of the Soviet blockade of Berlin following World War II and the subsequent Allied airlift--this novel explores post-war Germany from literally dozens of different perspectives.This is a compelling read, beginning with the liberation of the Nazi death camps, when angry and frustrated Allied commanders ordered German citizens from neighboring towns to tour the prisons and see firsthand the atrocities their government had committed. As Soviet domination in eastern Germany threatens to choke the divided city of Berlin, Uris relates the fascinating events of the Allied airlift--a herculean task involving British and American cargo planes flying around the clock into the west side of the city to deliver supplies. If not for the airlift, West Berlin would have collapsed and succumbed to Soviet domination.The story is told through the points of view of a multitude of characters: an American pilot; a young German woman; a former SS officer who was forced to perform unspeakable acts; British, American, even Russian commanders. The list of characters coming in and out of the story is formidable, yet convincing and essential. And, like Uris' other books, ARMAGEDDON is essentially a portrayal of the indomitable human spirit; for Uris fans unfamiliar with this book, or for fans of historical fiction this novel is highly recommended.--D. Mikels"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I read this book several years ago, unable to put it down - and its prose still affects me today! This is perhaps the most powerful story I'd ever read. A dazzling array of characters from General Marshall to working women gathering bricks on rubble strewn Berlin cities, they're all here. Your transportation back to post-WWII Berlin is so vivid that you'll hear the roll and pounding of allied bombs, you'll swear that C-47s are flying over your living room every nineteen seconds delivering aid to stranded Berliners! Yes, its THAT powerful.Every character is human. They elicit empathy from you, even the SS candidate who must do the unthinkable upon graduation.To be sure, this book was written in the late 50s, early 60s. You know who the villian was then. There is a certain slant to Uris's story. He is not entirely objective in his portrait of all the villians in this novel. But it still works powerful magic.For an engrossing, absorbing history lesson, Read Armegeddon.Comments? Email me"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Armageddon is my favorite Leon Uris, unless I just reread Exodus. The book is the story of one of three brothers serving as soldiers during World War II, each in different capacities. Sean O'Sullivan's war is not one of glory and flying but of thinking and strategizing how the United States will occupy Germany after the War. After his brothers are killed by the Germans he finds it hard to do his job and begin the rebuilding of this enemy state.The story gradual turns to Berlin, the first front of the Cold War. The struggles of Sean O'Sullivan are set against the drama and escalation between the United States and the Soviet Union culminating in the Soviet blockade of Berlin in 1948 and the fledgling United States Air Force successful effort to supply Berlin by air. An air power buff will love this story of the logistics and planning it took to supply half of Berlin, by air, for almost a year.The intermingling of the facts of rebuilding Germany, the political fight for Berlin and its eventual division into East and West, and the Berlin Airlift with the story of Sean O'Sullivan and Ernestine a young German woman he comes to love create a potent story that you don't want to end despite the long pages."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"When Friday night turns into Saturday, and you have been up all night to finish a book, but sorry that it came to an end, then you know that you have read a classic. That is how I feel about Armageddon by Leon Uris.It is set near the end of World War II in England and continues in Germany through the Berlin Airlift.The development of the characters is superb, their stories exciting.Nevertheless, I found some of the assumptions about Germans quite incredible, even a little absurd. Uris describes their love of the forest as an almost mystical Teutonic reverance, which I never observed despite living amongst Germans of all backgrounds, and having travelled extensively through their forests above several tons of tracked aluminum.Uris also describes Americans in a way that we would like to think of ourselves, which is, in a word, righteous. Unfortunately, if that ever existed during the Berlin Airlift, it is not in evidence today.But against the backdrop of the airlift which was America's most spectacular strategic, tactical and propaganda victory ever against communism, the characters from the pilots, to the Germans, to the leaders of all sides, come to life in realistic and dramatic fashion.Uris is a masterful storyteller, and this is entirely top notch writing. You cannot help but hope that the lives of his characters and their love triumph in the ordeal of rebuilding a nation from it's total collapse.This is one of those rare books that I can take from my shelf, turn to any page, and find in any one of them, the shear pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Leon Uris was a great American author & Armageddon is one of his best novels.

Regardless of the inaccuracies other reviewers find, this is a book that tells an important part of healing and history that few students hear in a classroom. Furthermore, Uris whets the reader's curiosity to learn the facts, to seek non-fiction sources and learn about post-War Germany and the power plays that were the first frost of the Cold War.Uris is a master story-teller -- his characters come fully human, with strengths and weaknesses. His plot is gripping. His style is compelling.It would be interesting to find out what was going on in the author's head and heart as he wrote the piece, as it evolved from his pen.I agree that Uris is one of the best story tellers of our time."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"In this novel, Uris shows us the aftermath of the fall of Berlin. Uris tells the tale of how the 2 winning sides of the war will divy up the country of Germany. The beginning is pretty straight forward, but Uris quickly shows how the Soviets are trying to play mind games with the Americans. We are shown how the two opposing sides deal with their territories won in battle. We see how the Americans fix the pipes and sewage systems and are shown how the eastern Germans are treated like dogs from the Russians. While all is going on we are shown how the Cold War takes shape. Great story telling, and great charactors add to the mix. At some points he had me cheering, when the USA was pitted against the USSR. The section where the huge airlift operation took place was terrific story telling.The complex nature of the book's charators, goes to show that Uris, is among the elite writers of his day. I only wish a movie could be made of this story."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This book opens in England in 1944, with the Allies preparing for the invasion of France. An elite team of soldiers looks beyond the invasion to the end of the war, and begins preparations for the occupation of a conquered Germany. Filled with a variety of colorful, yet believable characters, Uris provides a sweeping portrayal of the challenges facing the Allies as they struggle to rebuild a peaceful Germany after the war. The majority of this book focuses on Berlin, and the emerging conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. These former allies find themselves at odds over the future path of Germany, and gradually the U.S. comes to realize that the Soviet Union isn't interested in a free and democratic Germany. The tensions escalate until the Soviets blockade Berlin in a final attempt to drive the Western Allies from the city. The final quarter of the book describes the heroic efforts of the American pilots who flew supplies into Berlin in one of the most remarkable airlifts in history. This book provides a detailed glimpse at the earliest moments in what would come to be known as the Cold War, and helps to explain how Germany changed from being an enemy to an ally."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This is the only book that I've read twice.. once when I was twenty and now at seventy.

He is able to wrap a plot around historical events that not only entertain you but provide you with an excellent foundation for understanding the time of the story. I have read several Leon Uris books and all are excellent. The one I am missing is Exodus, his most famous work and it is now on my list to read. Armageddon, A Novel of Berlin, takes us through the occupation of Germany after World War II and gives us great insight into the mind of Nazi German and the mind of the soldiers of the USSR.

How do we allow that to keep happening? I love Uris' stories and as usual this one was both entertaining and enlightening."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I've loved all Leon Uris's books. They combine historical fact with wonderful fictional stories. This book is a great read."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This is not great literature. The plot is kinda hackneyed and predictable. But the story of how Germany managed to resist being completely taken over by communism at the end of WWII is a fascinating one. The Berlin Airlift actually happened, just about the way Uris described it. So read the book for the history, and ignore the weakness of the plot."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"As always, Leon Uris did his research for Armageddon. I have read all his books and I am always reminded to never forget the horrors of the Nazis and the death camps. May Germany and other nations never forget and allow another mad man to repeat history."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Leon Uris did an excellent job weaving history with fiction. As a young boy at this time period, I remember the news reel depicting the difficulty of the allies saving the Berliners from Stalin. Having a strong President like Harry Truman. He save Europe by implementing the Marshall plan and the tenacity to stop communism. The US State Dept .was infilitrated with Communist Sympathizers The Greatest Generation came thru with their dedication and self sacrifice . The author captures these events with clarity and. freshness. What a great read. Any student of history would enjoy this fast moving novel Deeply regret The author's passing."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Armagedon is a great story and a wonderful history lesson. Leon Uris was a master at creating characters that were believable and a story line that kept you wanting it not to end. This is really a must read for anyone interested in World War 2 and it's aftermath."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I haven't finished it yet. But am enjoying what I've read. I is a good reminder of what happened in post-war Germany."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This book deals with a very heavy theme, and Mr Uris has not shrunk away from them but attacked them head on. This makes for some truly impressive and emotional scenes. What really got through to me was the absolute sacrifice and willingness of Sean's father to let all his three sons be killed if that were necessary.However, as I state in my title, I had some mixed feelings that grew on me while reading this book. The first thing that annoys is the all-American heroism of the American characters (mainly Hansen en Sean) who even stand up against their own goverment that (of course) realises its own mistake and turns around in time. The book might properly be called a hagiography in this respect.The racism is complete when the Russians are portrayed as to a man having their brains washed till they are heartless automatons. Even the dramatic exception, Igor, can not tear himself away from this Russia with which he has a love/hate relation. Most of the Germans are denied a face in the novel, being referred to as 'the Germans' or 'the Berliners' -- always a bad sign.All in all a book with some very good writing, though a bit sappy at times, a very promising begin, but disappointing due to its very questionable ideology. A shame that a good writer has lent himself in such a way for cold war propaganda."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Personally, I don't feel that this book shows the strength of the human spirit...Ok, for most of the book, especially in Berlin Uris discusses this, but the last page destroys this myth in crashing style. I will not state the ending (other reviewers have), but I think that at the end, and especially the last page, the events are Uris's way of proving that no one is \\"that\\" strong.This would have been one of the best books that I have read in a while, except for the ending. Maybe I am not able to get the depth of his meaning, but for me the ending was unnecessary and completely contrary to the feeling of the book."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I hadn't read a book by Leon Uris in quite a while, but I remember the ones I had read very favorably. One of us changed over time.While \\"Armageddon\\" moves along nicely and recalls a time in history not frequently discussed these days, it's too much like a cowboy movie to be taken as anything other than a lightweight. The Americans are the guys in the white hats, by the way."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"All americans are good, brave, understanding, funny, hard-working, incapable of greed (they almost deserve to have been born in America, the greatest country in the world by far). Russians are pig-headed, predictable, cruel, brutal and very easy to surprise. Germans are all nazis, so much so that they call temselves nazis in private, when that is a derogatory term! Their only redeeming opportunity is to be as American as they can. But they are Nazis after all...The \\"kill your dog now\\" episode is laughable, to say the least. The English are stodgy and dependable. The French talk alot and do nothing useful (except when they do what the Americans say).One MUST remember that this novel was written in 1963. The \\"airlift\\" description is quite good. So, take into account when it was written, get totally one-dimensional, and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I am not sure what has happened here but the cover shown here is the book Armageddon by Jenkins and La Haye ??I am confused, I guess it was a mistake.Either way the book by Leon I have not read yet, the same title by Jenkins and La Haye is a great book in the series of Left Behind.Just an FYI.Lizzy"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This book is perhaps one of the most boring I have ever read. Uris not only introduces multitudes of characters whose positions and affiliations are completely confusing, but drones on in the telling of each of their stories. 200 pages into the book, I was ready for it to be over, but as I had to read it as an assignment, I was forced to continue. Not to say that the book is without merit; some of the passages describe war time horrors and the difficult descisions leaders must make. But Uris bores you with accounts of meetings and confusing scenes and dialogues, leaving you wondering about the direction of the plot. Surely there must be more exiting books about WWII. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Not much. You can figure it out pretty quickly from one page to the next. Dialoge is hack. A poor effort."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This book was in good condition for it's age, but not \\"like new\\" as described. The problem was that the shippers simply wrapped it in paper with no protection. As a result the corners of this hardcover book were seriously damaged. Since the book was so old it should have been packed more carefully as most books I have ordered through Amazon are. The paper wrapping was partially torn off and there was no other protection for this very special old book."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"The most wonderful thing about Leon Uris' books are his testament to the eternal indomitable strength of the human spirit This book shows the horrors of the 20 th centuries twin ideologies of evil-Communism and Nazism-and also shows that there are good and bad people in every nation You also eagerly follow the character development -The American army officer Sean O Sullivan who in the end-for all of his millitary courage- shows himself to be weak moral character. The Bruckner family made up of a sadistic father ,cruel opportunistic brother ,weak mother and two remarkable and beuatiful sisters Ernestine Bruckner is the heroine of the novel who we fall in love with (something wich is common to most Uris novels) but it is her seemingly weaker sister Hilde who emerges as the stronger of the two .I thought that the suicide of Ernestine at the end was unneccesary ,she seemed to have lived through too much and seemed to be too strong a woman to kill herself over a failed love affair-this was the drawback in an otherwise excellent novel .The other hero of the story is Ulrich Falkenstein who spent years incarcerated by the Nazis becasue of his total opposition to the evil Third Reich and now shows once again -as Mayor of West Berlin-that he will not bend before another tyrannical empire-the Soviet Union"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This was a good book to help get a picture of the Nazi mindset. And the Russians. If the facts are correct. It is a novel but he is very believable. It was a long read...many, many short chapters."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I've only read 100 or so pages thus far (I only read during a coffee break), but like most of Uris's books he already has me hooked. So far I've seen the incredible organization of Nazi Germany, as well as how our military governors officiated in captured German cities even before the war was over in May of 1945"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"As with Mila 18, my daughter was interested in reading the story, one I first read 40 years ago. After visiting Berlin and other parts of Germany lately, it was easier to picture the places mentioned in the book. Also a very good characterization of both the German people and North Americans during and just after the war."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Armageddon is another one of Uris's sweeping sagas, addressing the fate of Germany during post-WWII recovery. It focuses on the relationship between the victorious conquerors (Americans, French, British and Russians) and their former Nazi enemies and becomes a true battle between the Allies and Communist U.S.S.R over coveted Berlin. It is a story of redemption as the Germans rebuild their country, try to salvage their tarnished reputation, and fight a communist regime that is worse than Hitler. There are so many absorbing individual stories intertwined throughout the dense narrative. While some technical details (logistics, plane and flight specs, etc.) were mildly tedious, they were entirely necessary to understand the vast effort that went into supplying a blockaded Berlin and keeping its citizens alive. This is another book in which I will praise Uris for his immense grasp of history and detail and his straightforward yet captivating writing style."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Excellent book with engaging characters and compelling plot. A history lesson for those of us whoe teachers ran out of time to cover the twentieth century. Classic!"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Uris is able to thoroughly and magnificantly detail the events of the most pivotal period of the 20th century. The events in Germany from '45 to '49 are told in a writing style of which only Uris is capable. For 650 very quick pages, I was immersed in 1940's postwar Berlin. The characters were real, their feelings and actions believable, and thier inner conflicts convincing. His portrayal of the World Domination Seeking Soviets will anger you like no other book. In short, it is an extremely entertaining, thought provoking history lesson."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"If you have ever wondered what it was like in Germany after VE day, this is a great example.

This is a riviting time in our history and a time that must never be forgotten.It's fun to be able to get a refresher in history while hanging out with fictional people who are in the thick of it all.

So much of the wartime damage was still visible during the early 1960's. I worked in the I.G Farben building and had to chuckle about the elevator which was still operating in the 1960's.

If you are looking for a five-star treat you will want to include this book in your reading."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I read this book while I was a college student in the mid sixties and I enjoyed it. I had read other Leon Uris works previously and had enjoyed them. In re reading this some 45 years later I enjoyed it more. I have read many of Uris's works and this one is very well done and overlooked by many."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Having lived in Germany shortly after WWII, I had to read this book, and it made an enormous impact on me. I remember seeing the Berlin Airlift Memorials at Rhine-Main AFB and the other in West Berlin. I've been in Berlin before, during, and as the Wall came down. Uris tells the story and makes it come alive. In typical Uris fashion, he takes his time, tells a lot about everyone, and it is all riveting. I can't stop thinking about the people whose lives were focused on saving Berlin and helping Germany escape Communism, a sacrificial mercy in spite of their horror over the Nazi atrocities. Yet a worse evil was looming. But this is not a history lesson...it is a very human story about the people who were there and who made a difference, and the Germans who got caught up in it all. The American spirit shines through it all, in the determination to not let evil succeed, and in the can-do attitude that made the Airlift so successful."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This was about Berlin after WWII. The city was divided and it tells about some of the problems that needed to be solved to stabilize the government, but is also a very good story. Basically the American slant and the problems they had with making sure it was democratic. Many characters, with different stories all blended around a soldier being sent to do a job of setting up a government and keeping it from being placed back in the hands of hidden Nazi's.I have read most of Uris's books and they are mostly well researched and a very good read. If you are at all interested in this time period you will enjoy it. It is an old book, but I was in Germany a few yrs ago and recognized many of the places so was curious about it.. It is a book that could be read again, and I probably will."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Leon Uris is one of my favorites and although this was an older book I learned a great deal about Berlin after WWII. The \\"air lift\\" was a miracle for freedom. I was suprised how barbaric the Communist could be in their quest for European dominance."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Armageddon, by Leon Uris (636 pgs., 1963, 1964). Uris has always been among my list of favorite writers. My assumption had been that I had already read all of his published works. The old cliche about assumptions making an ass of you & me, came true in this case. Somehow, this 600+ page doorstop of a book escaped my voracious reading eyes. After completing this tome, Uris remains on my list of favorite authors.This book begins before the end of WWII. American General Andrew Jackson Hansen has been given the task of heading the American occupation of Germany after the war ends. He has been given the task of setting up & carrying out a denazification program & the rebuilding of Germany. One of his right-hand men is Capt. Sean O'Sullivan, who has been chosen to lead the pacification, denazification, & rebuilding program of the German City of Rombaden, as a test case to see what will work in the rest of the country. O'Sullivan is promoted to Major so he won't be outranked by the officers working for him.Uris writes about the beginning of the Cold War between the West & the Soviet Union. He illustrates how shortsighted & naive the Western Allies were in not seeing the Soviet threat early enough to prevent their takeover of all of Eastern Europe. Hansen is one of those U.S. Generals who did see the threat. He is determined not to let the rest of Europe fall to the Soviets & has drawn the proverbial line in the sand in the Western Sectors of postwar Germany & of Berlin, in particular.O'Sullivan is very successful in Rombaden & Hansen asks him to come to Berlin & work with him to make sure the city does not fall to the Soviets. He does. The rest of this book shows how the Soviets try every way they can to get the Western Allies to pull out of Berlin & concede the city to them & how the West ultimately defeated them.That's a bare skeleton. This book is much more than it's skeleton. Uris doesn't spare his readers the ultimate horrors of this war. He writes about the discovery of the Concentration Camps. He writes about the atrocities committed during the war by the Nazis. He also writes about the prewar atrocities Stalin committed against his own people in the USSR. He gives readers a brief historical summary of the rise of Communism in the Soviet Union. He writes of the numerous rapes & pillages committed by Soviet troops upon German civilians after their occupation of Germany. He writes of postwar Germans claiming to know nothing about the death of six million Jews & the horrors that occurred in the Concentration Camps. He writes of allies during the war becoming enemies & of enemies becoming new allies. He writes of the degradation forced upon many of the occupied German civilians simply to live above the level of scavaging animals.He writes of O'Sullivan losing two beloved brothers in the war to the guns of the Nazis who now has to work with those Germans who made the rise of the Nazis possible & help them build a new country. He writes of the few anti-Nazis who somehow survived the war & are the hope of this new Germany. He writes of love affairs between enemies. He writes of budding friendship between American & Russian soldiers, nipped before they could reach fruition. He writes of the incredible airlift into Berlin by the Americans & the British, which kept a lifeline alive to a free & democratic Berlin. He writes of a renewed special relationship between the USA & the UK. He writes about the creation & shaping of what became Western & Eastern Europe in postwar Europe.He does all this not by being some didactic professorial type, but by using characters who have history breathing through them & their actions. He draws characters about whom his readers learn to care. Not just Americans, but Germans, Russians & Brits. This book is over 630 pages, but it's a page turner. It's a historical tome. It's a love story. It's an action novel. It's a character study. It's a Greek tragedy. It's all of these combined into one huge novel. This is why Uris was a best-selling writer during his lifetime."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I've read all of Uris' work and believe him to be amongst the great writers of all time ... his descriptions of immediate post-war Berlin, the power struggles of 4power occupation and the Berlin Airlift were magnificent.Never has a book made me feel so much a part of the times and the struggles, nor given me agreater feeling for the emotions of the people who helped reshape the world after the worst of all wars.Positively brilliant ... a MUST read"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Have read most of my Uris as a teen and into my 20's, and he deserves great credit for teaching me about the holocaust and other historical moments that he weaves into his fiction. That is the case here as well. Having said that, perhaps I am older and more sophisticated, but the writing definitely reflects a Coldwar 60's attitude, and the dialogue a bit patriotic/ham fisted. Sometimes it made me squirm. The subject is great, and the characters well placed and fleshed out. The soviets do seem like a creepy bunch, and although I am sure their nature is exaggerated, Uris gets across the tragedy of soviet post-war occupation."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Leon Uris totally hit his stride in writing this book--and many of his subsequent books picked up on the same kinds of characters and themes discussed and witnessed in ARMAGEDDON.-You have the Irish-American protagonist O'Sullivan who is given the duty to oversee American interests and policy in the newly defeated Germany - Uris's fascination with the Irish as a people would grow and become more apparent in such books as TRINITY, REDEMPTION, and A GOD IN RUINS.-You have the bookish professor Faulkenstein, a German who was imprisoned in a concentration camp and mentors O'Sullivan throughout the text-pick a character from MILA 18.-There is the beautiful German girl Ernestine who falls in love with O'Sullivan prompting him to question his beliefs about the German people after examining the events of the Holocaust-like Kitty in EXODUS and Shelly in TRINITY.-And then you have the Soviets and their impact on the rebuilding of Germany and *that* is what separates this book from the others I have mentioned. This was Uris' first attempt of writing a holistic story told from all sides and he does it best in this book-though written at the height of the Cold War he goes to great lengths and pains to explore and try to justify all points of view. In his other works where this kind of holistic exploration takes (EXODUS and THE HAJ for example) it seems almost forced and fake.If you are new to Leon Uris this book is a great place to start; historically informed and complex characters. If you are returning to Uris, give this book another read, it gets better and better with each page!"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Leon Uris is a brilliant writer! This is #4 on the top best seller list for the year I was born, 1964. Gripping, edge-of-your-seat novel! Of course, since this is based on the Cold War (end of of WW II), there is a lof of fact in it as well. My opinion is that this should be a book that should be required reading in high school. Great work of fact/fiction entwined. I was never really too knowledgeable about this time era but I am really glad I read this book & am more educated because of it. A must read!"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"This is one of the best books written about Germany at the end of the W.W.II. Shocking but very informative. The Soviets v. the world.

Who is right?"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"The Cold War is a distant rememberance today but it all started with Russia planning to make Berlin a communist city following WWII and this book tells the story of the famous Berlin Airlift that saved the day for the Allies. There are a lot of technical details to add interest as well as a story line following some characters. If you can't read the book in a short period of time, it is hard to follow some of the characters. Leon Uris took a pessimistic view of world leaders success with negotiations to enact peace, but his story of the bravery of U.S. service personnel is inspiring."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I believe that Leon Uris is one of the great writers of the 20th century. All of his books are excellent, but 2 stand head & shoulders above the rest-Armageddon & Mila 18.

Not many surprises, but the manner in which the conflicts of the real history are resolved keep the reader guessing.As is usual in Uris' works, he weaves the personal tragedies into the eventual victory or success of the main character. This novel seemed to follow a more modern day similarity to 'Trinity'. The more I read, the more I saw Connor Larkin personified in Sean O'Sullivan."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"The characters are well developed with a real history to them. However, the story line moves rather slower than other Uris novels."},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"Leon Uris has proven to be a master of telling compelling stories within an historically accurate framework. This is certainly true here! The characters are real -- honestly drawn, flawed characters who are trying to make it in a world totally askew, where reality bears no resemblance to the world they knew before. Uris has interwoven several story lines here, and the most interesting element is how the interactions between the various characters -- Americans, Germans, and Russians -- changes each of them. More than anything, this book helps one to understand the complexity of politics and feelings at the end of WWII that led directly to the Cold War -- the American distrust of German people who \\"didn't know\\" what Hitler was up to, the shame of German People who come to understand that maybe they should have made it their business to \\"know\\", and mutual distrust between the Soviet and American military powers. It is also a story of America coming of age -- reluctantly facing up to the fact that we had a place in the world that we couldn't deny, for better or for worse. Reading Leon Uris is always an adventure, and this is an adventure that will stick with me for a long time. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Armageddon","review":"I purchased the Kindle edition of ARMEGEDDON by Leon Uris, intending to re-read something I had read over 30 years ago. The book is every bit as timely today.

They suffered through very difficult times treating wounded soldiers in Bataan and Corregidor. After the surrender of the American military in the Philippines, they then endured three years in captivity by the Japanese. The author, Elizabeth Norman, has done an excellent job documenting the events of the time and the personal experiences of these women. It's an excellent Book!"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Living in hard conditions often forces people to change their ways and make sacrifices. However, no one could dream of what the army nurses in Elizabeth M. Norman's We Band of Angels sacrificed to benefit others, and not themselves. In this book the author tells the stories of the heroic nurses trapped on Bataan by the Japanese in a detailed, interesting, and suspenseful manner. In ancient Greek civilizations a hero was someone who was brutal, handsome, strong, and normally accomplished something physically that benefited himself, and maybe a few close to him. Greeks strived to gain power and glory; however now, this is not what a true hero strives for. True heroes make both mental and physical accomplishments that benefit others, and not necessarily themselves. A true hero is able to adapt to tough conditions, and in those conditions put others before themselves. A true hero breaks barriers, and can be found where least expected. Anyone wanting to read a wonderfully written story about true heroes must read the story of these \\"angels of Bataan\\".Norman communicates the stories of these \\"Angels\\" in a way that sucks the reader into the lives of these women and makes them feel the pain that they felt. The author interviewed many of the nurses who survived, and from them learned the tragic, yet successful story of their lives and other nurses' lives such as, \\"Red\\" Harrington, Helen \\"Cassie\\" Cassiani, Minnie Breese, Laura Cobb, Josie Nesbit, Juanita Redmond, Maude Davison, Ruby Bradley, and many more. These brave, young nurses wanted a way out of the depressing, normal world, and adventurously signed up to be nurses in the army/navy. Stationed in the Philippine Islands in 1941 the nurses lived in paradise. After only a few months, on December 8th 1941 the Japanese began to bomb the paradise and transformed the flowery island into a nightmare that would haunt these heroines for years to come.In this nightmare of reality the author uses suspense, and brings the reader closer to where the nurses are through her interesting writing. Throughout the story the nurses show their heroism more, and more, and they prove that women can do anything that a men can do. Onlookers were astonished when such heroism was found in these women who were once looked upon as fragile. These women could survive through anything a man could. Norman tells how every night and everyday these angels watched the war take the lives and spirits of so many. But, every day and every night they showed their heroic qualities no matter what the surcomstances. The conditions they lived in, are those that one can't even begin to imagine until opening this book. They were ordered to move from place to place and did so without complaint. They lived in everywhere from humid jungles to cramped submarines, and from crowded hospitals to brutal internment camps. However, even in these conditions they adapted and made due with what they had. They gave up a roof over their heads, and traded in their white dresses for canvas overalls worn by men to better maneuver when working such long, hard hours. They cut their hair so it would not be in the way of their work too. They gave up all feminine things and toughened physically and mentally; otherwise they would not survive. Their few supplies and necessities could only last so long, so they knit themselves underwear and rationed their food. The nurses starved but still showed how heroic they were by not feeling bad for themselves, but by going with the flow, and putting every bit of the scarce energy they had into caring for their patients. They suffered so much so the wounded would not half to. No one ever made them give up safety, or comfort, they just did it. When reading this book it is hard to believe that not once through the whole thing there was any sign of the nurses feeling self pity, or the thought of caring for themselves before a patient even while sickness and starvation gnawed at their spirits. Some, like Minnie Breese were sick with jungle diseases such as malaria but still kept on taking care of their patients without complaint. When a few of the nurses were given the chance to escape and go home they felt guilty leaving the wounded in their beds, and reluctant to leave their suffering colleagues. One nursed, Juanita Redmond stated, \\"I wanted to go, and I wanted to stay with them and face whatever was to come; we had faced so much together, and I felt like a deserter.\\"(pg106) Heroism always appeared no matter how much they were sufffering. They demonstrated such loyalty to their collegues and patients, but working in these jungle hospitals were only the begginning.As the Japanese gained more and more control over the Americans on Bataan the remaining nurses were sent to another Island, Corregidor. As Corregidor also fell, the Japanese herded the nurses into Santo Tomas internment camp. In these camps though it seemed impossible to loose more and still survive, they did. The women sacrificed privacy, and food. Where they stayed there were three toilets to 300 people, and eight people to one shower, but this was just one of the many sacrifices they had to make. Norman intensely tells of how these angels suffered years of fear and starvation living off only a glitter of hope that the day of liberation would come.Through Norman's book the stories of the loyalty, bravery, and heroism of these nurses are told. They suffered so the wounded soldiers would not half to. They broke the barrier separating women from men, and opened once closed minds so that more opportunities could open to women. In doing all of this, these angels did not do it for glory, or for themselves like Greek heroes, they did it simply to make a difference. In the eyes of others they deserved glory, but they were modest. Nurse \\"Cassie\\" stated, \\"What's all the excitement about, are all of these people hanging around to see me?... I haven't done anything special.\\"(pg231) The book makes the reader grateful for the simple things that they once thought were impossible to loose. It is a wonderful, suspenseful read that tells about nurses who demonstrated the highest level of heroism there is. The things that really went on during their brutal journey are revealed. Things that a mind can't even imagine happened to theses angels, and through it all they survived, and more importantly, never once thought of themselves before another. When closing We Band of Angels, a piece is planted into every reader's heart that will forever remind them of these true heroines that changed so many bandages, minds, and lives with their bravery, and loyalty."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Elizabeth M. Norman wrote the book \`We Band of Angels', a biography about a group of army and navy nurses that survived the terrors and suffering of war and internment camps. The novel begins with the army nurses living in paradise in the Philippine Islands when the first bombs fall. Soon thousands of injured and dying need medical attention from the nurses whom have no experience with war and emergencies to that extreme. Later in the book, these same nurses have to adapt to war in the jungle, and before long have to surrender to the Japanese. These Japanese take the nurses along with several navy nurses to a civilian internment camp where they are almost starved to death. This is an important book to read because it shows the heroism in young women through tragic experiences, and knowing this, can show us how to survive through emotional and physical trauma. Elizabeth M. Norman was trying to show us that heroism can be shown in different ways, whether it is with dedication, or adapting to change or even surviving with each other in new and different situations.The numerous nurses in the story go through this emotional and physical trauma that teaches us how to survive it. The women at first have no idea how to deal with war, and how to live on the minimal resources. They become stressed because they start running low on emergency supplies forthe constant flow of patients and the nurses struggled to help everyone. The fact that they want to help everyone, shows that they are dedicated to their work, and are willing to put the load on their shoulders to make sure their patients are taken care of. A little later in the book, the nurses are forced to leave all of their patients in the hospital to flee for safety. The nurses, after they leave, have a heavy guilt in their heart, showing how much they truly cared for their patients and didn't want them to be hurt. Another example of their determined spirit was in the internment camp. They used their work to keep from dying, it kept them busy and their minds off of their diseases and starvation. This dedication to their work was part of the heroism that helped them survive.Another part of their survival was their sense of staying together. They didn't want to lose each other, their friendships, and their support. The nurses always listened to their superiors and their comrades. This shows that they didn't want to jeopardize the relationship, and start drifting apart. Also in the internment camp Maude Davison, the head nurse, was determined that they to stick together. She told her nurses that the key to survival was to stay and live as a group. This indeed helped, and possibly was the key to their survival. The nurses used the group for protection, and support. When one nurse was sick, the others helped the best they could. In the end the group did help save each of them because all of them were still alive in the end of camp.The nurses on Bataan were smart. They learned quickly and were able to adapt to the new changes they had to make. When the bombs first fell on the hospitals, the nurses quickly had to get used to the constant flow of patients with broken limbs, and gruesome smells. The nurses did this willingly, and worked hard, even though at the beginning they had a little trouble. They became stressed and some couldn't hack it and had to take multiple breaks, but they all adapted eventually, and learned the ways of war. Then again when they moved to the jungle new problems arose, and new changes had to be made. Bugs were a big problem and there was a limited amount of food and supplies to go around. The nurses once again willingly changed their ways in order to stretch supplies and keep the bugs away. Another change that had to be made was when they moved to the internment camp. They had to survive on less than 1,000 calories a day, and with deadly tropical diseases. They had to make this change in order to make it out alive. They used their work to keep busy, and they used each other for companionship. Before to long, the nurses, with their ability to adapt, were able to survive through all the changes.The nurses were indeed heroes and throughout the story Elizabeth M. Norman portrays this. In many aspects she tells the true story of the women, and is able to reveal the heroism of the nurses on Bataan. These women are courageous, determined, and able to adapt to the changing world. Though they may not be the most recognized war veterans, they are definitely shown as true heroes in this book. The book shows a new type of hero, a hero that has problems, and a hero that is realistic. Elizabeth M. Norman tells us the story of female heroes, with strength and the ability to live."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"The nurses that were trapped on Bataan in the book We Band of Angels were real life heroes. They were normal people, but under the pressures of war they performed extraordinary tasks. Unlike heroes of Greek mythology, they did not have superhuman strength or intelligence. They accomplished their tasks through sacrifice. There are many examples in the book of the nurses making sacrifices to save the lives of soldiers, which make the book realistic and interesting to read.To save the lives of many of the soldiers fighting on Bataan, the nurses sacrificedtheir own health. The nurses would work hard for hours and would not get enough rest. Also, when supplies of the vaccination medicines ran low the nurses stopped taking them, and saved them for the soldiers. Doing these things caused the nurses to be vulnerable to diseases. Many nurses died from the after effects of diseases they caught like Beriberi. The nurses also only got one meal a day at times. They suffered from affects of malnutrition. Some of these affects left the nurses weakened for the rest of their lives.The nurses even sacrificed their own lives to save the soldiers. They worked in areas where they fell victim to bombs, shrapnel and even the falling shells of their army's anti-aircraft guns. There was also always the danger of the Japanese killing or raping the nurses as they went through the nurse's hospitals, on the way to fight allied forces. The Japanese were known for committing war crimes, like they did at the Rape of Nanking. Before the Japanese invaded the last stronghold on Bataan some of the nurses were offered an escape from Bataan. Rather then going some of the nurses stayed to save the lives of the soldiers.A lot of the nurses worked so long and hard in horrible conditions, they were mentally scarred for the rest of their lives. They also lost friends or family while they were gone, and never got a chance to say goodbye. The nurses had many problems getting back to their normal lives without income due to the loss of a husband. They said it took them a long time to make up the many years they were in Bataan. The nightmares and shell shock they experienced also made it difficult to return to their normal lives. It was hard for the nurses to forget many of the tough times they went through on Bataan.This book was interesting to read because it told the story of what it's really like to be a hero. The nurses were not perfect, but they accomplished their task, and survived incredibly tough times. The book had a sense of reality that many stories of heroes do not have. The many sacrifices the nurses made make them true heroes."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Thank you, Dr. Beth Norman, for the chance to revisit those inspiring, terrible days. Setting as contrast, the back drop of pre-Pearl Harbor Manila made this chronical all the more compelling. Lest we ever forget, may more writers like Beth Norman set us straight about the place women (and in particular nurses) have played in our history.

Thank you Dr. Norman for giving us this story."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"With so much pressure on historians to be dry and quiet, it is thrilling to read a really great, action-packed story full of real heroes (not heroines in the classic sense who faint and wring their tiny hands at the first sign of chaos) and honest to God danger. These women are representative of our gender today as much as they were when sunning themselves on the beaches of the Phillipines, or quieting the screams of men who were wounded and dying, while slowly decaying themselves. Because honor is timeless, and because readers know the truth when they read it and feel the passion of characters who do things we are not sure but hope that we would do in similar situations, I predict that Elizabeth Norman's book will be a huge success. It is not just the story of nurses in war, it is the story of women throughout history."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"My mother was a WAAC in World War II and I grew up with stories about military women. I am glad to see that there are starting to be books about the exploits of these average American women who just happen to have been in the right place at the right time to become bona fide heroines. In a country in need of heros of either gender, this is an excellent book for high school and college women in need of role models and heroines of their own. These were average women with average dreams who just happened to find themselves in the arms of danger and prevailed. It's too bad that it has taken so long to honor them for what they really did and to give them their due reward."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"The book, We Band of Angels by Elizabeth M. Norman, portrays the lives of nurses in the military during World War 2 in the Philippines. In the book, the war nurses prove to be convincing heroes because they displayed courage, determination, and intelligence. These are all qualities that a hero would possess. The story of these heroes proves to be a worthwhile reading.One of the heroic qualities that were displayed throughout the book was courage. Courage within the nurses was needed to maintain organization during the chaos of war. The Philippines was a gruesome place to be during the war. The nurses set up hospitals in the wilderness of the jungle to be closer to the soldiers fighting on the front line. Although the Japanese were bombing all around the hospitals, the women tuned out the noise of the bombs in order to take care of their patients. As the enemy got closer, they were ordered to leave the hospital but refused. The nurses said that they would not leave their patients unattended because they needed their care. Even though the nurses were not forced to stay, they gathered enough courage to stand their ground and stay with the men. The nurses did this because they could not bear the weight of leaving men to die. This proved to the people who thought that women should not be in war that they would not back down from their duty. This also showed the wounded soldiers that the women had confidence in them and would nurse them back to health. Later on, the hospital was forced to surrender to the enemy. Japanese soldiers watched the nurses day and night. During one night, a Japanese soldier tried to force a nurse to kiss him. Although the nurse was petrified she demonstrated courage by refusing the soldier regardless of the consequences. By committing this act, she sent a message to the Japanese that these women belonged here and had enough courage to stand up to them.Determination was another heroic quality displayed throughout the book. In order to survive each day without knowing what lay ahead, the nurses had determination to get through every situation. Since the nurses in Santo Tomas were broke, Josie Nesbit, one of the head nurses, was concerned that some of the nurses might sell themselves to wealthy men in the camp for money. She gathered the older nurses and asked them to try to raise the morality of the group. She was determined to not let anyone regret coming to the Philippines for paradise and ending up with the \\"wasteland of war.\\" Her determination was the backbone of the morality of the group of nurses. This scene is important because it shows that the nurses were there for more than just pleasure and that even women can remain steady and not be fragile during a rough situation. This scene describes the character of Josie Nesbit. She was always trying to cheer up the girls and was always a leader. She was a determined to not let the girls change the image of an American soldier. In this scene she demonstrates that women can be just as strong and determined as men.Another heroic quality that the nurses displayed was intelligence. Intelligence was important because the nurses needed to decide how to help an injured soldier and they needed to make quick decisions. The nurses were running low on malaria vaccines in one of the jungle hospitals. For the past two weeks, they had been giving themselves a certain amount of the vaccine for malaria each day. If the nurses did not receive the vaccine, they would become ill. In order to save the lives of men, they divided the amount of vaccine that they were receiving so that they would be able to have some for the men. The nurses risked illness by doing so but they knew that they would not be as ill as some of the soldiers. If the nurses had not found out the right amount of vaccine needed, most of the men with malaria in the hospital would have died. In essence, they saved lives with their quick, intelligent actions. This scene is an example of conflict/resolution. The nurses started out with the conflict of not having enough vaccines and resolved it by lowering the amount of vaccine per person while still keeping people healthy. This example of intelligence is significant because the role of the nurses was to save lives and they did so by thinking quickly. Also, the nurses proved to the male doctors and soldiers that women are not just delicate but are also smart and useful in a time of need.Although the nurses faced many hardships, they conquered each one with great heroism. The nurses demonstrated many aspects of a hero but mainly the qualities of courage, determination, and intelligence. The book successfully portrayed a woman in the role of a hero while keeping you interested with great stories of the war."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"The only reason I picked this book up was because it was a required read for a nursing class - I'm so glad that it was.

Norman is a true story about American nurses trapped on the Philippine islands by the Japanese. The story is based in the 1940's right after Pearl Harbor. The author tells the tales of many nurses in the Philippines at that time. Dr. Norman does a wonderful job conveying the true individual tales of the nurses. The book contains information about the life the nurses endured that is very personal, not just the information printed in newspapers all over the country at that time. The characteristics that made them heroes were different than the characteristics found in Greek Mythology heroes, hundreds of years ago. Our ideas of a hero have changed over the years. We Band of Angels is full of recent heroes, and is recommended to anyone interested in a touching tale of real women who fought for their life, and the lives of others.The author focuses mostly on Helen &quot;Cassie&quot; Cassiani, a navy nurse. The author says that she was &quot;most comfortable with Cassie. [She'd] seen her often.&quot; (Pg. 261) In talking with Cassie the author was able to get a more full story of what happened. The reader feels at times that Cassie, herself, is telling the story of her experiences. The author also added pictures taken at some of the important events. The reader can see the events and people there in these pictures. Emotions that the nurses are feeling can be taken from the pictures to help the reader better understand the story of the &quot;battling belles of Bataan&quot;, the heroic nurses.At the beginning of the book the author sets up the story by describing how it was before the war. She describes the hospital in Manila in detail: &quot;The nurses' quarters, elysian rooms with shell-filled windowpanes, bamboo and wicker furniture with plush cushions, and mahogany ceiling fans gently turning in the tropical air.&quot; (Pg. 4) This helps show the contrast to the later living quarters of the nurses. After Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attacked the Philippines. They bombed the island and then raided it. Troops came in and took over most of the Philippines. Manila declared itself neutral and the nurses had to leave and go to Bataan, a small peninsula across Manila Bay from Manila. Bataan was an untamed jungle. They set up two hospitals to take care of the hundreds of casualties coming in from the battlefront. At hospital #2 &quot;There were seventeen wards, each with between two hundred and five hundred patients - bed after bed after bed, spread out on the jungle floor in the open under a canopy of branches and vines, literally as far as the eye could see.&quot; (Pg. 58) After Bataan fell to the Japanese troops the nurses were moved to the small island of Corregidor, at the mouth of Manila Bay. They lived and worked in a complex series of tunnels called the Malinta Tunnel. &quot;Malinta Tunnel was so well built, the hospital staff could continue to work during raids, interrupted by the muffled thuds of bombs and shells landing above.&quot; (Pg. 97) After Malinta Tunnel fell to the Japanese, the Americans were finally conquered. The troops were sent to prison camps, and the nurses were eventually sent to an internment camp. They went to the interment camp of Santo Tomas. The nurses were behind &quot;iron fence[s] and high walls, now topped with barbed wire.&quot; (Pg. 143) The book continues with their struggles of surviving the many hardships of the internment camp. They had to fight malnutrition, cruel treatment from the Japanese, and the sometimes-unbearable sense of not being free.The Army and Navy nurses were heroes to their patients, each other and the citizens of the United States, who anxiously awaited more information on their whereabouts and happenings. Having so many heroes makes the book appealing to its audience. The nurses showed their heroism by putting their patients' health and safety ahead of their own. As they were being hurried out of Bataan to go to the safer Malinta Tunnel, &quot;some of the women wanted more time to discuss the details about [their] patients...to leave instructions about those [they] were worried about.&quot; (Pg. 86) They also say that one of the toughest things they ever had to do was walk away from the patients they left in Bataan, but they had to obey orders. The nurses also showed their heroism when they didn't give up their work. Throughout the stress of the jungle hospitals, Malinta Tunnel, and the internment camp, they never stopped doing their jobs. When surviving seemed unbearable, they would still work. They said, &quot;work was the best antidote&quot; (Pg. 149) when times were tough. The nurses were heroes; they kept their heads as bombs fell all around them, in order to save the lives of others.The characteristics of the nurses that made them heroes were their perseverance, and their selflessness. In Greek mythology, a hero was someone strong (muscular in appearance), witty, and powerful in his or her actions. This shows that the Greeks valued beauty and brains. Today, beauty is not as important in a hero. Actions are much more important qualities in the making of a hero today. Heroes today, such as former political leaders, became heroes because of the things they did, not how they looked, or how much they could do physically. Heroes hundreds of years ago were very different from the heroes today.We Band of Angels is an uplifting and powerful story, telling the unknown stories of the Army and Navy nurses in the Philippines. Elizabeth M. Norman uses such detail, and shows such knowledge of that time that readers are hooked on the tale. The stories of the heroes show the true meaning of a hero today. This book is recommended to anyone who believes in heroes."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This book to me was very moving.

I purchased this book to give to a friend as a gift. I couldn't resist reading it first. It is a gripping story about the experiences of 99 army and navy nurses who were trapped in the Phillipines by the Japanese shortly after Pearl Harbor. The personality of each nurse emerges as the human spirit is confronted with the challenges of daily survival during battles, escapes, disasterous living conditions and caring for the casualties of war. Oral histories, photographs, diaries and sound research are incorporated into a well paced narrative to make this book a real page turner. Elizabeth Norman is a gifted historian. As a nurse, I enthusiastically recommend this book to nurses; and those on the journey to becoming a nurse. CB Flores, President, New Orleans District Nurses Association"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"What started out as a profession sought by the ninety-nine nurses for adventure in the fall of 1941 quickly became a test of survival. After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, several nurses volunteered to go to the Philippines and were soon thrown into the whirlwind of caring for patients non-stop while varying hospital locations to avoid the Japanese. During the war, disease and starvation became the enemy. With little supplies and rations, the nurses were in no better condition than their patients. The story is not remarkable simply because of the pain and shock these nurses experienced, but because of how they handled their situation. They learned the importance of fellowship, love, obedience and selflessness in survival through the way they cared for other nurses and the wounded, including the enemy. The author captures the truth of their story in ways the media failed. Perhaps this is because she realized the reason their true story should be told. After the war, their story was glamorized to recruit for the military, but abridged to maintain how society viewed women. There needed to be an account written to preserve the true story so that it wouldn't be lost. The book only fell short in thoroughly labeling locations on the maps. Overall, Ms. Norman evenly strings together the history of the war and the story of the nurses to produce a remarkable piece of literature for those who would enjoy stories of the untold sacrifices of nurses."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Just read a new book &quot;We Band of Angels&quot; and it is quite high on my recommended reading list for any of you interested in military women's stories. It is heartwarming and at the same time heartbreaking. Told in a style that puts the reader directly into the lives of these valiant nurses - it takes you on a journey through the horrors of World War Two in the Pacific - as if you were there. The author draws you into the Malinta Tunnel underground hospital on Corregidor and describes the almost superhuman endurance of the military nurses working there to save their patients - and she does it with balanced style. She reveals their triumphs and their humor, along with the dreary and miserable conditions under which they worked. When the Japanese capture the nurses and send them to Santo Tomas internment camp you journey with them through their three years as prisoners and their ultimate liberation. The author, Dr Elizabeth Norman, has done a remarkable job - using interviews, diaries, letters, and a wealth of research - in telling this story that has been hidden by history. America seems to forget that women are veterans too - Dr Norman has helped remind them.Barbara A. Wilson, Capt. USAF (Ret)"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"I, too, read Elizabeth Norman's book, We Band of Angels, The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese, over the Memorial Day weekend. She did a masterful job in her research and writing to retell this unique story about this group of America's military nurses and their dedication to duty. This story is unique in American military history, in that in no other instance in our history has this number of military women, been taken captive, held as POWs for almost three years, and all survive. However, it is not unique in its demonstration of military nurses' dedication to honor and duty.The facts in the book speaks loudly to many of today's societal debates, but to Norman's credit, she chose not to get into what many of us euphemistically term \\"pissing battles of bias\\". She tells the story of this historical event and its impact on the women who experienced it. She let the story stand on its own merits for anyone who reads it.Am I biased in undertaking this review of her book? To an extent, yes. I am a retired Army Nurse Corps officer, who worked with, or served under some of the women about whom Norman has written, and who we both tremendously admire. I have also had opportunity to know perhaps more about the blueprint of her story than most of the public-at-large. She has done a masterful job. Had she not, I would not have given her the time of day. Norman's research and interviews led her to more details about this historical event than many of us were aware and has interwoven them into the story in a manner that cleared up some of its mysteries. She told us enough about the lives and motivations of many of these women prior to their entering the military, and their lives following this experience, to let us determine for ourselves the extent to which this experience was a seminal and defining life experience for them, individually as well as collectively.Elizabeth Norman is more than a historian, bringing an objective eye to the reporting of facts or experience. She is an expert nurse and researcher, who knows that historical research is not merely the story of people and events, nor does it lend itself to clinical trials or experimental studies, but rather to the analysis of phenomenon with a view toward objectively explaining events, where explanation is possible and faithful to the occurence. Personally, I do not believe anyone other than a dedicated, committed, expert nurse, who also was a historian, could have written this book with the same degree of accuracy, detail and justice deserved by those nurses who lived it.To nurses, and particularly military nurses, this book reminds and rekindles within us that pride the remaining surviving Army and Navy nurses of the Philippines, Bataan, Corregidor, Santo Tomas, and Los Banos must feel in this retelling of \\"their\\" story. But this book is not just for nurses, it is for all who have fought for this country, and to those who waited hopefully for their family members' safe return. Many of America's warriors are alive and well because of miliary nurses like those of whom this story is about. Those casualties who made it back to our hospitals but still did not survive their injury, not only had an expert nurse at their bedside, but a surrogate mother or sister who did not have to be concerned that their caring or their own grief would subvert their expertise. Neither could their feelings be realistically viewed as a sign of weakness. Their strength and their courage was demonstrated by their desire and willingness to be there and the long hours of work they endured. My only wish is that before all of those many nurses who served in World War II are gone, or the memories become too faded, some of the other defining stories of World War II's military nurses, such as those who served and died on the Anzio beachhead, can be pieced together in a narrative as riveting and as faithful to the experience as Norman's in We Band of Angels.Ira P.

All this is told through the eyes of the 80-90 Army and Navy nurses who worked under battlefield conditions to minister to the sick and wounded. There were no front and rear areas on Bataan and Corregidor and these nurses performed supurlative feats with all manner of bombs dropping around them constantly, snipers, friendly fire and the ever present threat of capture and mis-treatment from the Japanese Army. This needs to be made into a &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; quality movie to further celebrate their outstanding accomplishments and to tell a story that our government may not want told."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Wherever war strikes there are women who sacrificially rise to the needs of the moment to help others survive. The nurses in We Band of Angels are exemplary. Based in the idyllic Philippines, they found themselves very quickly in the throes of hardship. From evacuation to jungle survival, field hospital trauma and starvation, things went from bad to worse. Finally the harsh reality of prison camp under unsympathetic captors. This is their story of survival. I like this book because it describes part of American history mostly neglected in history books. If you like this book I also recommend In the Shadow of the Rising Sun, an even more harrowing true story telling it from an American POW's view."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

Using notes, diaries, and letters of the nurses and many other published and unpublished sources, and interviews of the survivors, Ms. Norman recounts many personal stories which detail the individual experiences which are not usually included in works of history. You learn a little about the Japanese and a lot about American fortitude under the most difficult conditions imaginable. It will make you proud and appreciative of these American women."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"A well-researched and written account that brings the grim realities of the Pacific war and the POW experience under the Japanese to all-too vivid life. Yet, it clearly paints an inspiring picture of true rather than mythic heroism. These women are real with failings, foibles, passions and personal problems... yet, they rose to meet their horrid circumstances with tenacity, dedication and sheer grit.Just as the film Saving Private Ryan showed us that the greatness of the average GI was his sheer willingness to do his job in the face of the carnage of war; so We Band Of Angels show us the equal courage and inner strength of women in war. We owe much to them and we have much to learn from them.Bless 'em all!"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"It's no secret that the Japanese held thousands of Allied military prisoners of war in the South Pacific during World War II. Everyone knows of The Bridge on the River Kwai and the Bataan Death March. The harsh treatment the captured men suffered still affects the way many view the Japanese sixty years on.But less well-known are the non-combatants who were also imprisoned by the Japanese Army in the South Pacific. Many of them were military and civilian nurses, as well as employees of oil and rubber companies and their families. They were American, British, and Australian, and their stories are just as compelling as those of the captured soldiers, sailors, and marines.Elizabeth Norman tells the story of the U.S. Army and Navy nurses on Bataan in We Band of Angels. Although some of them were offered a chance to leave before almost certain capture by the invading Japanese, most stayed on to take care of their patients who were too ill or injured to be moved to safety. Norman was able to interview many of the nurses for this book, but time was critical. When she began researching, most of the survivors were well into their eighties. Some had died, some would die before she could interview them, and some were just not up to reliving the past.Fortunately for us and for history, Norman was able to record some vivid memories and retrieve some fascinating photos and mementos from what was an almost unbelievable experience. We get to know many of these women, following them as they decided to study nursing, then made their decisions to join the military. We learn their personal stories of imprisonment, and what they did after they were freed.It makes you wonder, as you look at the most recent photos of the women, on their porches, in the assisted living homes, at the reunions. They look so unremarkable. How many untold stories are still out there?"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This incredible, well written book tells the story of nurse POWs who overcame significant obstacles and yet continued to care for their patients.

Also, if the author reads this I'd like to thank her for writing the book, I found it very, very poignant that all of the women she wrote about, who by the end of the book I felt I knew like my own friends, are very, very old and many had already died by publication. It's a good thing she told their stories or we would have lost all those voices. Pretty amazing stuff, I thought it was very well written and absolutely riveting."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"We Band of Angels, a well-written biography by Dr. Elizabeth Norman, is an account of the American Army and Navy nurses stranded in the Philippines during World War II. The book gives the reader a true meaning of friendship, hope, hardship, and sense of abandonment. The bloody scene of makeshift war hospitals becomes paradisiacal when compared to the disease, starvation, and labor of Santo Tomas and Los Banos Internment Camps in which many were forced. Dr. Norman gave excellent chronicles and great detail to the nurses' will to unite as one, their everyday thoughts and ideas, the inner need to help and heal their patients, and their fight in the toughest battle of all: staying alive.The women who were sent to the Bataan Peninsula, Corregidor Island, and across the bay to Manila, were nurses on the side of the United States. (There are general and detailed maps of the locations mentioned in the beginning of the book.) Although there were 11 Navy nurses and 88 Army nurses, none perished while in the Philippines. They had thoughts and dreams of family, friends, food, and the life that they left behind when they journeyed to war. By using first hand documents (letters, journal entries, photographs, and interviews), Dr. Norman created an effective way for telling the sometimes heart-wrenching stories. The reader was admitted to the nurses' innermost thoughts, allowing him or her to develop a better understanding of the mental and physical states of the women throughout the war. Ruth Straub's diary is used in the beginning of the book. She was one of the \\"lucky ones\\" who were rescued by planes and submarines from the hardships of being an Army nurse. Her diary tells the reader of her experiences with hunger, the jungle hospitals, and her feelings of relief and abandonment. Through her letters home, pictures, and stories, Eleanor Garen, also an Army nurse, shares her grief and acquisitions. Helen \\"Cassie\\" Cassiani, probably the main focus of all the nurses in the book, had the most intriguing stories and accounts to read. Still alive today, Cassie proved to be a great resource in the book.Maude Davison and Josie Nesbit, commander and leader of the Army nurses, unified their group by re-enforcing the rules and values the military had merited. Forced into Santo Tomas Internment Camp, Maude and Josie convinced their troops to remain together in order to stay alive. Although this sounds quite simple on paper, Dr. Norman gives the reader a background of the nurses' relationships and how it was a difficult time for some because of special friendships that were made. The simple comradeship that banded them all as one military unit saved their lives. The common respect for one another made it pleasant to read among the dark shadows of war.The nurses of Bataan were considered heroes upon their arrival home after almost five years at war. The lives that they saved and the torment that they faced made them paladins. They were some of the first women to experience actual combat action and quickly learned what it took to be a war nurse. The \\"angels\\", as some soldiers called them, were forced to cope with conditions alien to most. With the help of doctors and Filipinos, the nurses were forced to set up jungle hospitals to accommodate the hundreds of wounded soldiers. When the nurses were forced by officials to evacuate their makeshift hospitals, a sense of unfulfilled duty had spread among them. The strength (mental and physical) and courage it took them to leave the sick and dying and to remain healthy demonstrates true heroic qualities. When the nurses were sent to Malinta Tunnel (an underground network of laterals and hallways that contained a hospital), the lack of sunlight, the constant bombing, the many soldiers to tend to, and the tight quarters were just a few hardships the angels were forced to endure. Their ability to roll with the punches made them an exceptional asset to the fight for an American win. As the book continues, the reader finds him or herself continually pounded by the author's words of praise to the nurses' efforts and accomplishments. Although gratitude and praise are due, the elongated paragraphs re-stating the author's opinions can lead the reader to boredom. The truly heroic parts of the book are when the angels win against all of the odds forced against them, not when Dr. Norman is expressing her acclaim.Although many of the nurses are now quite old, afflicted with illness, or deceased, their story in wonderfully preserved and their history remembered in this book. The nurses' story of survival is one that many historians have chosen to overlook. This book was a good overall read and should be recommended to any that want to learn about America's true World War II heroes. They risked their lives so that others may have the chance to live. Dr. Norman quotes Shakespeare as to why the title of the book has to do with its' contents: \\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.\\""},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"As author of a book about nurses of WWII, I found this book to be like a meeting with old friends. My book, No Time for Fear: Voices of American Military Nurses in World War II, contains a lengthy chapter with oral histories of many of these same brave army and navy nurses. Dr. Norman filled in some blanks, and wrote the complete story. These were ordinary nurses with a sense of adventure in 1941 who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. They showed the world what American women are really made of. One correction to some of the comments in other reader reviews: Other American military nurses were captured by the enemy. Six navy nurses were captured when the Japanese took over on Guam early in the war. They were put on a ship, sent to Japan, and then were soon released on a Dutch ship, to be returned. One Army Air Corps flight nurse was on a plane that crash-landed in Germany during the war. She sustained a head injury and was captured along with the crew. All were put into prisoner-of-war-camps. She was the only female in the camp and was released after a few months. What did all of these wonderful, brave nurses do when captured and imprisoned? They continued to be nurses, caring for others in the camps, ignoring their own problems. Nurses are wonderful people."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"One does not need to be a nurse or in the military to be captivated by this book.

A never told story, at least in my case, during history class. Truly inspiring."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"The book We Band of Angels is a story of 99 army and navy nurses who served in the Philippines during World War 2, and of how they survived things such as Japanese bombing, starvation and internment camps. The book was written by Dr. Elizabeth Norman, an award winning author, who specializes in nursing history. This book most definitely is a worthwhile read. The &quot;Battling Belles of Bataan and Corregidor&quot;, as the nurses were called, proved to be heroes because of their survival through almost impossible times during the war, their relentless care for their patients, and, upon their return to the United States, the humility that they showed when being praised for serving their country faithfully.The survival of the nurses is truly amazing. The nurses displayed heroic bravery in the jungle of Bataan when they were being bombed and being hit with pieces of shrapnel. They remained calm and kept on with tending their patients throughout the bombing. The nurses also showed perseverance when they remained in a Japanese internment camp for three years before being released by U.S. forces. Determination was shown when the nurses' food intake per day went below 900 calories. They tried to keep up with their nursing duties and still keep healthy despite the diseases they encountered and the exhaustion they suffered from mal-nutrition. The nurses suffered the same things that all of the other patients and internees at the internment camp did and yet they still tended the sick and injured with unfailing patience and determination.The nurses' loyalty and love for their patients, Japanese or not, was also a heroic display of bravery. The nurses faced gruesome diseases and conditions, such as gas gangrene, calmly and patiently. The nurses were also so faithful to their patients that they almost refused orders to evacuate from the Bataan jungle. The &quot;Battling Belles&quot; showed great regret from leaving their patients when they returned from the Philippines. Some nurses such as Helen &quot;Cassie&quot; Cassiani, regretted it all of their lives. The love, loyalty, faithfulness and patience shown by the nurses is just part of what makes a complete and great hero.The nurses also showed humility when they returned to the United States as they were thanked and praised for their service. In many situations when they were questioned by reporters the nurses said, &quot;... I haven't done anything special.&quot; They claimed that they were just fulfilling their duties. When the nurses were questioned in private interviews they kept their answers to a minimum and claimed that the boys fighting were the ones that should be praised. Many times after the nurses returned home they were received by huge crowds and were often given keys to the city. The nurses felt and said that they did not deserve this honor that they were receiving. Instead of boasting and bragging about their accomplishments, the nurses were humble and thankful for being alive and being back home.The army and navy nurses in the book We Band of Angels were heroes. They went above and beyond expectation and duty. Franklin D. Roosevelt, President during World War 2, said that all of the nurses &quot;...served valiantly in foreign lands.&quot; The nurses of Bataan and Corregidor set an example for all of the heroes after them which was to serve their country with determination, faithfulness and humility. This book is most definitely worthwhile to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"If you are and you saw the 1942 movie &quot;So Proudly We Hail&quot; and liked it, you should read &quot;We Band of Angels&quot;. Very well researched and written, it reads like a novel but it is pure reality: we feel the fear, resent the hunger and the bad treatments with the nurses. This is not your typical war history tale, more a deep socio-historical point of view on middle 20th century women. We must encourage that kind of work that clearly demonstrates that american women (any, for instance) never stayed in the dark and showed courage in many unpublicized situations."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This is a powerful story that has sadly been lost in time. From 1941-1945, Elizabeth M. Norman follows the lives of the daring American nurses that served on Bataan and Corrigedor during World War II. Nothing could have prepared these women for what they experienced. They worked what seemed to be never ending shifts, saw endless amounts of blood and horrifying injuries, and suffered through disease and starvation. The most amazing attribute of these women, however, was their sense of unity and loyalty. When faced with the choice of leaving their sick and wounded patients behind, they grudgingly obeyed mandatory orders to do so. Guilt for doing this still haunted many of the nurses years after the war ended. These nurses stuck together and may not have survived without the friendship and loving support of each other. Despite all of their trials they held onto their integrity and never gave up. No additional work was needed to be done to clarify this book's topic. Norman produced a noteworthy piece of non-fiction. I didn't have any chief objections in this book but keeping all of the women's names and stories straight was a little difficult. I liked the author's use of primary sources (such as diary writings) which helped me better understand what these nurses had to endure. Norman did an excellent job of making these historical events interesting. I would definitely recommend this book to others, not only because it is interesting and hard to put down, but also so others can learn about this untold part of our American history."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"I have alway been a fan of fiction books set in WW2,even though I am not sure why.

It gave me a reference for The Japanese treatment of POW's. While the nurses didn't face the extreme hardships of the soldiers, they suffered greatly and acted with more courage and dignity than I could ever muster.I found the individual profiles of the nurses interesting and made me feel like I could relate and know these women.The story of their return to the States and their experiences was illuminating.

Forced to set up a field hospital in the jungles of Bataan and the tunnels of Corregidor until they were captured.

But criticizing is not necessarily a bad thing and it doesn't mean that the one being criticized is a lesser person because of it. Maybe we need to not accept everything we read as gospel until we put it to a test. And perhaps it might be good to have a healthy skepticism and a BS meter to filter everything we see, read and hear. What is true and what is embellishment? What is bias and what is fiction? And what is propaganda and what is undeniable, confirmable, truth?\\"We Band of Angels\\" by Elizabeth M. Norman for the most part is a good book about the American female nurses on Bataan during WWII. It gives a perspective that is valuable if for no other reason than it adds another piece to the complex puzzle of how people react in a time of war; more specifically the Bataan women in uniform. But it also gives the perspective for better or worse from a sexual point of view. Not sexual in the sense of erotic or prurient, but the battle of the sexes, maleness and femaleness and the author builds on those differences from page 1. Indeed that is the premise of the book. The author tries to make the book more of a political statement than an historical one and she almost succeeds.Being a male, and I make no apologies for it although at times I get the sense from what the author is saying that I should, I take exception to some of the insinuations and downright false statements she occasionally indulges. I have no doubt that the author is intelligent, accomplished, and probably has letters after her name, but she at times lets her bias's overshadow the bigger picture of what WWII, and war in general for that matter, was and is all about. I also have no doubt to the courage and true heroism of the women on Bataan. But even some of the women she writes about do not seem to share the author's conclusions. And that is my biggest complaint-I bought the book because I have a deep interest in WWII, and a part of that interest is Bataan-the horrors of Bataan after the Japanese invaded, the Bataan death march, the concentration camps, the escapes and the stories of survival, the civilian population and the foreigners trapped there with them. All of this is of interest but the last thing I want to read in a historical rendering is a feminist preaching propaganda.To be fair, most of the book is not blatant with it, but the author does get in her digs against the status quo, military leadership, and men. One eventually gets the feeling that the author does not hold the military, then and now, in very high regard and one wonders what her true feelings are about men in general.All in all if one ignores the preaching and subtle innuendo there is some good information here. And it is always interesting to me to find out what happened after the war to the books subjects and the author gives us some of that information.One last thing-I think the book would have been more interesting if it had information on the Philippine people in general and more specifically the Philippine nurses who worked with the American nurses. Hardly a mention is made of them and nothing is said of their outcome. An argument surely could be made that the Americans on Bataan during WWII owed a lot to the Philippine people."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"As described. shipped in a timely manner. would buy from again.

It brings the reader into the minds and lives of the nurses who were trapped on Bataan during WWII. Besides being a moving story, it has great lessons that can be applied to life today.

I recommend it to any one interested in honest and meaningful history."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"(From the book's flap copy) WE BAND OF ANGELS is the story of women searching for adventure, caught up in the drama and danger of war. On December 8, 1941, the same day the Japanese Imperial Navy launched its surprise attack across the International Dateline on Pearl harbor in Hawaii, it also struck American bases in the Far East, chief among them, the Philippines. That raid led to the first major land battle for America in World War II and, in the end, to the largest defeat and surrender of American forces. Caught up in all of this were ninety-nine Army and Navy nurses -- the first unit of American women ever sent into the middle of a battle. The 'Angels of Bataan and Corregidor' -- as the newspapers called them -- became the only group of American women captured and imprisoned by an enemy. And the story of their trials on a bloody battlefield, their desperate flight to avoid capture and their ultimate surrender, imprisonment, liberation and homecoming is a story of endurance, professionalism and raw pluck. Along the way they helped build and staff hospitals in the middle of a malaria-invested jungle on the peninsula of Bataan; then, short of supplies and medicine, they worked round the clock in the operating rooms and open-air wards, dealing with gaping wounds and gangrenous limbs, ministering to the wounded, the sick, the dying. A few fell in love, only to lose their men to the enemy. Finally, on the tiny island of Corregidor in Manila Bay, the Japanese took them prisoner. For three long years in an internment camp -- years marked by loneliness and starvation -- they kept to their mission and stuck together. In the end it was this loyalty, this sense of purpose, womanhood and honor that both challenged and saved them. Through interviews with survivors and through unpublished letters, diaries and journals, Elizabeth Norman vividly recreates that time, telling the story in richly drawn portraits and in a dramatic narrative delivered in the voices women who were there -- a group that was 'liberated,' self-possessed, curious and intrepid long before American society encouraged such behavior in women."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This book shows us the true unsung heroes of the Pacific War.

The women gave a lot during those years and were for the most part ignored by our government. I salute those ladies and although most have left us we are better off having had them in our military.

What these women endured because of their belief in the American system and the fight for freedom for themselves and for their fellow Americans is almost unbelievable.

A superb complex history about nurses and their heroic role in a unique place in war time. In 2002 in the midst of a nursing shortage and national crisis, this book is a must read. Our country has always had these wonderful nursing heroes, we have just failed to adequately sing their praises. Nursing is the infrastructure of the health care system in time of peace and in time of war. Norman's book is a keystone in the body of historical and creative work that is being written around the \\"band of angels\\" called the nursing profession. A must read."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"The nurses that were trapped on Bataan in the book We Band of Angels were real life heroes. They were normal people, but under the pressures of war they performed extraordinary tasks. Unlike heroes of Greek mythology, they did not have superhuman strength or intelligence. They accomplished their tasks through sacrifice. There are many examples in the book of the nurses making sacrifices to save the lives of soldiers, which make the book realistic and interesting to read.To save the lives of many of the soldiers fighting on Bataan, the nurses sacrificedtheir own health. The nurses would work hard for hours and would not get enough rest. Also, when supplies of the vaccination medicines ran low the nurses stopped taking them, and saved them for the soldiers. Doing these things caused the nurses to be vulnerable to diseases. Many nurses died from the after effects of diseases they caught like Beriberi. The nurses also only got one meal a day at times. They suffered from affects of malnutrition. Some of these affects left the nurses weakened for the rest of their lives.The nurses even sacrificed their own lives to save the soldiers. They worked in areas where they fell victim to bombs, shrapnel and even the falling shells of their army's anti-aircraft guns. There was also always the danger of the Japanese killing or raping the nurses as they went through the nurse's hospitals, on the way to fight allied forces. The Japanese were known for committing war crimes, like they did at the Rape of Nanking. Before the Japanese invaded the last stronghold on Bataan some of the nurses were offered an escape from Bataan. Rather then going some of the nurses stayed to save the lives of the soldiers.A lot of the nurses worked so long and hard in horrible conditions, they were mentally scarred for the rest of their lives. They also lost friends or family while they were gone, and never got a chance to say goodbye. The nurses had many problems getting back to their normal lives without income due to the loss of a husband. They said it took them a long time to make up the many years they were in Bataan. The nightmares and shell shock they experienced also made it difficult to return to their normal lives. It was hard for the nurses to forget many of the tough times they went through on Bataan.This book was interesting to read because it told the story of what it's really like to be a hero. The nurses were not perfect, but they accomplished their task, and survived incredibly tough times. The book had a sense of reality that many stories of heroes do not have. The many sacrifices the nurses made make them true heroes."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"We Band of Angels, a well-written biography by Dr. Elizabeth Norman, is an account of the American Army and Navy nurses stranded in the Philippines during World War II. The book gives the reader a true meaning of friendship, hope, hardship, and sense of abandonment. The bloody scene of makeshift war hospitals becomes paradisiacal when compared to the disease, starvation, and labor of Santo Tomas and Los Banos Internment Camps in which many were forced. Dr. Norman gave excellent chronicles and great detail to the nurses' will to unite as one, their everyday thoughts and ideas, the inner need to help and heal their patients, and their fight in the toughest battle of all: staying alive.The women who were sent to the Bataan Peninsula, Corregidor Island, and across the bay to Manila, were nurses on the side of the United States. (There are general and detailed maps of the locations mentioned in the beginning of the book.) Although there were 11 Navy nurses and 88 Army nurses, none perished while in the Philippines. They had thoughts and dreams of family, friends, food, and the life that they left behind when they journeyed to war. By using first hand documents (letters, journal entries, photographs, and interviews), Dr. Norman created an effective way for telling the sometimes heart-wrenching stories. The reader was admitted to the nurses' innermost thoughts, allowing him or her to develop a better understanding of the mental and physical states of the women throughout the war. Ruth Straub's diary is used in the beginning of the book. She was one of the \\"lucky ones\\" who were rescued by planes and submarines from the hardships of being an Army nurse. Her diary tells the reader of her experiences with hunger, the jungle hospitals, and her feelings of relief and abandonment. Through her letters home, pictures, and stories, Eleanor Garen, also an Army nurse, shares her grief and acquisitions. Helen \\"Cassie\\" Cassiani, probably the main focus of all the nurses in the book, had the most intriguing stories and accounts to read. Still alive today, Cassie proved to be a great resource in the book.Maude Davison and Josie Nesbit, commander and leader of the Army nurses, unified their group by re-enforcing the rules and values the military had merited. Forced into Santo Tomas Internment Camp, Maude and Josie convinced their troops to remain together in order to stay alive. Although this sounds quite simple on paper, Dr. Norman gives the reader a background of the nurses' relationships and how it was a difficult time for some because of special friendships that were made. The simple comradeship that banded them all as one military unit saved their lives. The common respect for one another made it pleasant to read among the dark shadows of war.The nurses of Bataan were considered heroes upon their arrival home after almost five years at war. The lives that they saved and the torment that they faced made them paladins. They were some of the first women to experience actual combat action and quickly learned what it took to be a war nurse. The \\"angels\\", as some soldiers called them, were forced to cope with conditions alien to most. With the help of doctors and Filipinos, the nurses were forced to set up jungle hospitals to accommodate the hundreds of wounded soldiers. When the nurses were forced by officials to evacuate their makeshift hospitals, a sense of unfulfilled duty had spread among them. The strength (mental and physical) and courage it took them to leave the sick and dying and to remain healthy demonstrates true heroic qualities. When the nurses were sent to Malinta Tunnel (an underground network of laterals and hallways that contained a hospital), the lack of sunlight, the constant bombing, the many soldiers to tend to, and the tight quarters were just a few hardships the angels were forced to endure. Their ability to roll with the punches made them an exceptional asset to the fight for an American win. As the book continues, the reader finds him or herself continually pounded by the author's words of praise to the nurses' efforts and accomplishments. Although gratitude and praise are due, the elongated paragraphs re-stating the author's opinions can lead the reader to boredom. The truly heroic parts of the book are when the angels win against all of the odds forced against them, not when Dr. Norman is expressing her acclaim.Although many of the nurses are now quite old, afflicted with illness, or deceased, their story in wonderfully preserved and their history remembered in this book. The nurses' story of survival is one that many historians have chosen to overlook. This book was a good overall read and should be recommended to any that want to learn about America's true World War II heroes. They risked their lives so that others may have the chance to live. Dr. Norman quotes Shakespeare as to why the title of the book has to do with its' contents: \\"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers. For he who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.\\""},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Dr. Norman is an associate professor of nursing and the director of the doctoral program at New York University's division of Nursing in the School of Education. She has a specialty in nursing history. Her interest in the role women have played in the profession of arms is apparant in this gripping war story.Dr. Norman writes in her afterword, &quot;This is the story of the ninety-nine army and navy nurses who went to war December 8, 1941.&quot; These women became the only group of American women captured and imprisioned by an enemy. On a monument erected by the men of the Bataan Death March, in the Philippines, the nurses are honored: &quot;In honor of the valiant American military women who gave so much of themselves in the early days of World War II. They lived on a starvation diet, shared the bombing, strafing, sniping, sickness and disease while working endless hours of heartbreaking duty....They truly earned the name &quot;The Angels of Bataan and Corregidor.&quot;This is truly a book best pondered in a group setting. As Dr. Norman studied these women she realized that she &quot;was dealing not with individuals but with a collective persona.&quot; She reports that the women often answered her questions using the pronoun &quot;we&quot; rather than &quot;I&quot;. Certainly this is the &quot;we&quot; of the title. Your Reading Group could discuss the relationships the women formed with one another and whether the &quot;group&quot; saved their lives. You could discuss how the women managed after they were freed from their captors and from their group.Your Reading Group could begin with a discussion of the history itself and branch off to discuss the response these women had to being at war; how they reacted when some in their group were evacuated early; how they reacted to imprisionment; how they reacted to leaving their patients and finally how they reacted to peace. This is also a book that lends itself to a discussion of lessoned learned. Dr. Norman concludes that she learned that &quot;Loyalty, sacrifice, obedience and discipline are genderless.&quot; Would your Reading Group agree?Our interesting word selection is &quot;Canard&quot;. A false or unfounded report or story. A groundless rumor or belief.While there are numerous humbling quotes from the nurses in the book, we selected a statement the author made in the epilogue as our favorite quote: &quot;They (the women) prized their affiliation, their sorority, their womanhood because, as women, they were more naturally comrades than men. I do not mean to suggest that women cannot act independently or that among us there are no individualists....Instead, I think that men feel compelled to prove themselves in isolation, while women feel compelled to prove themselves in accord. The voice of a women is the voice of connection, and this inclination to keep close, to define oneself through affinity, kept the women going.&quot;Using your individual voices your Reading Group will once again connect over a book shared.Martha Burns and Alice Dillon are the authors of Reading Group Journal: Notes in the Margin (NotesintheMargin@aol.com)"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Dr. Elizabeth Norman has written a phenomenal account of the 99 military nurses who were captured and imprisoned in the Philippines by the Japanese during World War II. Having researched this topic through personal interviews, personal diaries and military records, the author introduces the nurses and then vividly describes their care of the wounded and sick, their ingenuity when equipment and supplies became scarce, and their own esprit de corps and valor. I marveled at the way they erected a hospital on the floor of the jungle with a canopy of trees after they were forced out of safe confines in Manila. I feared for their lives during the surrender and while they were imprisoned, especially after the Japanese military took control of the Santo Tomas prison. Their personal afflictions with malaria, dysentery, dengue fever, and beriberi were severe, and yet, they continued to provide nursing care to their patients.. The joy of their liberation brought tears to my eyes. I found myself referring to the assembled photographs so I could somehow relate to these women on a more personal level. I was happy that the author provided information about their later lives so that I could know what effect wartime and imprisonment had on these remarkable women. When the final pages appeared I found myself in awe of their lives and once again tears blurred the final lines.

Although it is told through a second hand view, Dr. Norman's grandmother and other nurses that survived told many of the facts. Not only did Dr. Norman strive to become a nurse from a young age, but she is now a professor of nursing and the director at NY University Division of Nursing and specializes in nursing history. She has written tow other novels bases on the stories of nurses during Vietnam and World War I. The reader always felt that the author was more than qualified on the topic. Yet many times the reader felt the bias towards the Japanese on a more personal level, because Dr. Norman's own grandmother was in fact one of the nurses that survived to tell the story. She tells the story as if the Japanese soldiers are the enemy from the beginning. One nurse that was interviewed for the novel mentioned \\"I don't want the word angels in the title, nursing is a noble job, we were just doing our job, and we were by no means angels...\\" stated Nelson another survivor. Though Dr. Nelson's passion towards the nurses makes the novel thrilling and exciting, it is not purely accurate."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Elizabeth Norman's historical account of nurses trapped on Bataan in World War II, We Band of Angels, was a moving and informative story of the heroic deeds performed by women in the military. It is a very interesting book and is recommended for more advanced readers who enjoy war stories.This story takes place a few months after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entered WWII. The Japanese soon capture Corregidor, a small island in the Philippines, and General MacArthur's weakened troops are forced to surrender due to severe supply shortages. Before the war, some young American women looking for excitement joined the army as nurses, hoping its promises would fulfill their dreams of finding adventure. \\"Women who wanted adventure and romance - self possessed, ambitious and unattached women - signed up...(p2 of pictures).\\" Little did they know just how much adventure they would find and what heroes they would prove to be.A hero is someone who possesses the ability to do great things. They are usually intelligent, have some type of extraordinary ability, and usually channel these attributes towards helping others. Ancient Greek heores were emphasized as being more physically strong than mentally strong. There is also a fallen hero, like Roy Hobbs in The Natural, who had the qualities needed to be a hero, except for a character flaw that led him to a downfall. The nurses on Bataan possessed many of these characteristics and can be characterized as heroes.While the United States was unprepared for what the war would bring, the army officers on Bataan, being so isolated from allied forces, were easy prey for the vicious Japanese military. Though incredibly surprised by the attack and ill equipped for the turmoil that was to come, the officers and nurses on Bataan were ready to keep fighting for as long as they could survive. Every nurse, the \\"Angels\\" as they called themselves, thrust her fear aside and bravely continued to serve the sick and wounded, despite the fact that in many cases they were so ill they could barely stand themselves. Still, unable to get much needed food and medical supplies, the medical officers on Bataan had to give in to the enemy. Some nurses, supposedly picked at random, were allowed to escape the horrors that would come and made it back to America. The others were forced into army internment camps where many men lost their lives in mass shootings and others were brutally punished for minor acts. Though for a while conditions under Japanese command seemed to improve, the Japanese shortly resumed their harsh control. The camps' inhabitants suffered immensely from various diseases and conditions. Most were malnourished, as food was in short supply, and the condition of patients already suffering from diseases became steadily worse, most of them dying. Even through the heartbreaking deaths, terror, and unimaginable living conditions, the people (especially the nurses) never gave up hope. They seemed to be able to maintain faith in their country and that one day they would be rescued. One nurse said, \\"If you gave up hope, you would have just folded up and died (p. 165).\\" And, after suffering, but surviving, terrible conditions for about three years, the rescue finally came. Around Christmas, 1945, American tanks burst through the iron gates of the internment camp, reinstating hope in all. Still, the Japanese would not surrender to the Americans until after they held a group of people hostage. This climax is well depicted by the author, with a lot of suspense. The Japanese could not long withstand the American army and the inhabitants of the camp were soon liberated.The \\"Angels\\" in this story can definitely be viewed as heroes. Elizabeth Norman depicts their heroism by describing many qualities and feelings they had. One quality of a hero that they surely possessed is the ability to put others before themselves. Of course, it is the job of a nurse to care for others, but the nurses on Bataan unquestionably did beyond what they were required, or even expected. These courageous women risked and sacrificed their lives to ensure the safety of others around them; often putting aside personal needs just to protect their patients and colleagues. When one nurse became ill with malaria, \\"she set herself on a cot in the middle of her ward and directed the work of her staff from there. (p. 51)\\" The nurses were very reluctant to withdraw from their work - they persevered and finished the job, no matter what it took. \\"Many nurses were sick with malaria and dengue (p. 140),\\" said Madeline Ullom, one of the nurses. Still, they still kept on fighting. The women stayed determined to survive during even the most difficult moments, and fought to the end, a typical characteristic possessed by heroes.Another trait of heroism these women demonstrated was courage. Though the nurses were non-combatant members of the army, they did much fighting of their own. They showed much bravery in \\"battle,\\" and in the face of the enemy. The nurses did their best to keep calm when treating the thousands of casualties entering the hospital each day, and never lost their wit. The army nurses realized that they had to take risks to protect themselves and their patients. \\"Soon the women began to forage for food...they waited for the guards to pass, then two or three of them would...return with as many cans of tomatoes and sacks of flour as they could hide...(p. 138).\\" They came up with plans, though risky, to steal food for their starving patients and themselves. They kept busy to maintain their sanity and help them to cope with their loss of freedom when under Japanese command. As she entered the internment camp, one nurse \\"Filled up her day with projects and reading and exercises (p.158),\\" another said, \\"The secret to being a survivor is to keep busy (p. 166).\\" The women were intelligent, further proving their heroism.This is truly an account of the courage, strength, and hope possessed by the heroes in the book. Though the story is non-fiction story, it is very interesting and at times what the nurses went through is unbelievable. The author shows that though the nurses viewed themselves as ordinary people, in a time of crisis they were able to gather strength, saving lives to find a hero in themselves."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"Regardless of what some view of the authors writing style, this book fills a forgotten niche of WWII history. I have been a student of WWII for over 40 years, and the information in this book, and they way the story relates to their treatment at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army fits right in with what we know and what had been documented.One historical inaccuracy, is very early in the book. Contrary to the author's allusions, the Army Air Force at Clark Field was not caught unprepared because of officer arrogance. The US was a victim of the fates of bad timing. The Japanese had planned to attack Clark and the Phillipines almost simultaneously with the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese air forces based on Formosa, were delayed by thick fog. The US air forces were in the air, awaiting a Japanese attack, but none arrived due to their weather delay. The Japanese took off as soon as the fog lifted, and by the time the Japanese arrived, the US planes had landed or were in the process of landing to refuel. By a twist of weather, the Japanese caught the US planes on the ground. Not by American arrogance of Japanese capabilities."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"An interesting book giving a realistic view of what not only the nurses went through but also the soldiers on Bataan.

For me, who has read and reviewed scores of accounts of military and civilian POWs in the Philippines, and who was interned with Army nurse Ruby Bradley, the most interesting part is the often sad tale of neglect that followed their return home, a reminder that stories do not always have happy endings."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"What a revelation We Band Of Angels was to me- a Vietnam era USN nurse.At a time when women were still seen pretty much as accessories to the men in their lives, these nurses stepped forward, placing themselves squarely in the path of danger, deprivation and uncertain shifts in politics to do a job...and do it well. They were there to care for their charges, and despite threats,sacrifices and severe conditions, outstripped even their strictest expectations for themselves. I could not put this book down-wound up reading it when stuck in traffic, at the dinner table and when I should have been sleeping. Kudos to both author, and, belatedly, to those women of Bataan/Corregidor."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"A story that needed to be told, and is done so in a thoroughly riveting manner.

Norman's We Band of Angels is a powerful story of a group of American Army and Navy nurses living with the horrors of World War II. At the beginning of the book, these American women lived in the tropical paradise of the Philippines. Here, they enjoyed such luxuries as swimming at the beautiful beaches, dancing, playing tennis, and taking relaxing walks through the dazzling country full of flowers. Then, on December 8, 1941, this place of peace and beauty was transformed into a fiery battlefield when the Japanese began dropping bombs on the nurses' lovely home. At this point, everything began to fall downhill for the nurses. Hundreds of casualties swarming into the hospitals every day left the women and their colleagues overwhelmed with work. From there, many nurses were transferred to the wild jungles of Bataan, where they were forced to make everything themselves, from beds to bathrooms. In the bloody days that followed, these women were confronted not only with surgery, amputations, and shrapnel wounds, but fatal diseases like malaria, and dysentery. After months of little food and strenuous work, the Americans had to surrender Bataan to the Japanese. The story turns here as the nurses who didn't manage to escape the Philippines were taken to STIC, or Santo Tomas Internment Camp. Here our brave nurses had to endure three long years of starvation, fear, and death until the long-awaited liberation. These hard-working women returned home to a nation that at first praised and celebrated them. Later, however, this same nation refused to honor the nurses' leaders with the medals that they deserved. This gripping tale is both heart-warming and heartbreaking as readers find themselves being plunged into a world of courage and sorrow.Feminists, historians, World War II veterans, and anyone looking for an entertaining read will thoroughly enjoy this book. It is one of the better stories of a hero's journey. It perfectly displays the qualities found in a hero: self-sacrifice, modesty, and courage. The way in which Elizabeth Norman weaves the tale with colorful language and vivid descriptions is sure to capture the hearts of any reader.One of the qualities found in many heroes is self-sacrifice. The nurses on Bataan usually worked all day and all night, continually running here and there to fetch whatever was crucial to save a life. Whether it was rolling bandages or assisting in an amputation, they always had something to do. According to Colonel Duckworth, the senior physician,&quot;I heard not a single complaint about long hours and I cannot recall a single instance where there was any personal grievance among the officers, nurses or enlisted men.&quot;Food was also very scarce, and the nurses had to eat whatever they could find. Nurse Ruth Straub wrote in her diary, &quot;The song, \`The Old Gray Mare' keeps buzzing through my head. We had horse meat for supper.&quot; On another occasion she wrote,&quot;Found worms in my oatmeal this morning. I shouldn't have objected because they had been sterilized in the cooking and I was getting fresh meat with my breakfast . . . I'm still losing weight and so are most of us.&quot;The nurses also hated to take care of themselves before their patients. Chief nurse Josie Nesbit said, &quot;It was with great reluctance that the nurses reported off duty ill. They new the need . . . to care for the hundreds of sick and wounded men.&quot;Another quality often demonstrated by heroes is modesty. At the end of the novel, many of the nurses returned to their homes in America. Here they were shocked to find mobs of people and reporters, all hanging on their every word. But they were confused. Why were all of these people praising them? Nurse Helen Cassiani found a group of reporters all waiting to talk to her as she stepped off the plane. She said to herself, &quot;Hey, what's all the excitement about? Are all these people hanging around to see me? . . . . I haven't done anything special.&quot; Nurse Eleanor Garen attended many interviews that led to three articles that were posted in the Tribune. She often said things like,&quot;I've heard they call us \`the Angels of Bataan'. The only angels of Bataan are the angels in Bataan, those wonderful boys who fought and died there. The angels ofBataan are still there.&quot;Probably one of the most common qualities related to a hero is courage. Throughout the strenuous and horror filled times of war, these women had to face things that would make anyone grimace in displeasure. There were countless wounded and ill soldiers with horrific maladies, and buckets of human blood and amputated limbs. They also had to brave the frequent air raids with shells and shrapnel falling everywhere. In her diary, Ruth Straub wrote about her experience with the many air raids.&quot;They got us out of bed at sunrise. More dogfighting overhead. Our main danger- Oh, just as I was writing, the Japs dropped bombs nearby. Much more of this and we'll all be nervous wrecks. To continue, our main danger is shrapnel from our own antiaircraft. Yesterday, a piece went through a mattress. Fortunately, the patient had just left his bed . . . . Here they come again. Whew! Where is all the bravery I thought I possessed.&quot;Through all of these hardships the Battling Belles of Bataan continued to keep a firm chin and patience for the victory they wanted so badly.Over all, the book is thoroughly enjoyable. The language and the intense settingare enough to keep any reader's eyes glued to the pages. The reader becomes attached to the many characters that they get to know so well. They feel the nurses' pain and laugh at the good humor that endured through bad times. The heroic qualities displayed throughout the story (self-sacrifice, modesty, and courage) help people to truly understand what life in war is really like."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This is a stunning portrait of women in service who face death daily, yet never surrender their dignity or grace.

And in the telling, I got a lot more than just an answer to my question; I gained an insight into what made these remarkable women tick, and why it was that they were able to survive when so many others succumbed. \\"We Band of Angels\\" is a triumph of research into a too-little known segment of our history, and in its ability to evoke a new appreciation of the human spirit it is nothing less than a modest masterpiece."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This story tells the experiences of some nurses who found themselves in a situation that would try anyone's soul!

Makes me proud to be a nurse."},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This review was previously published in the Watertown (NY) Daily Times as a Saturday feature--book reviews by amateurs.A look at the war in the Philippines from the perspective of healers who were caught up in the conflict can be found in the wonderful book \\"We Band of Angels; The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese,\\" by Elizabeth M. Norman.It is a fascinating read. I recommend it highly to anyone who cares about history, to anyone who enjoys a story of hardships overcome and spirits triumphant and to anyone who wants to broaden their perspective.Two events came together to bring about the choice of the book for this review. I had the privilege of hearing the author speak of her newly published book about the \\"Angels of Bataan,\\" the army and navy nurses who had been trapped by the Japanese attack and subsequent invasion of the Philippines. And, just the day before (the editor) asked me to consider contributing a report on a favorite book to this feature, I had finished watching the gut-wreching Ken Burns television epic \\"The War\\" on PBS.The book that I heard about and then read and loved in 1999 ties in with one of the particularly gripping stories that Burns presented, that of the young pre-teen Sascha Weinzheimer and her family. They were civilians who were imprisoned by the Japanese at Santo Tomas prison in Manila during World War II. Sascha, her sister and younger brother, and their parents, were among the foreign civilians who had the misfortune to have been in the Philippine Islands at the outbreak of the war.Captured soldiers became Prisoners of War, but the civilians did not. Instead, they were interned--shut up inside a camp. While their treatment was not as harsh as that accorded the POWs, the crowding, the disease and lack of medicines, the meager food and just plain being in captivity all took a terrible toll on the civilians. Many died. Anyone who watched with me and listened to the now elderly, but still strikingly beautiful, Sascha Weinzheimer tell of her years in the Santo Tomas camp will not soon forget it.Ninety-nine American army and navy nurses were in the Philippines at the onset of the war. They were with the defenders who fought fierce rear-guard battles down the length of the Bataan peninsula. Jungle hospitals and open-air surgeries were established and moved and moved again, then to be abandoned as the surviving patients, nurses and soldiers finally were ordered to \\"The Rock,\\" the tiny island fortress of Corregidor. 22 nurses managed to escape from the \\"Rock,\\" ten by air and 12 by submarine.With the fall of Corregidor and the surrender of the last Americans, the 77 American remaining army and navy nurses were captured. The Japanese had a problem. Not knowing what to think of, nor what to do with, women in uniform, the Japanese authorities assigned them to the internment camps at Santo Tomas in Manila and, later, 42 miles away in the countryside, at Los Ba&ntilde;os.The eventual liberation of the Philippines was three years in the coming and, when the American forces did finally come ashore the Japanese forces did not merely roll over. What followed was a hard-fought, tough campaign. The internees at the two camps, physically weakened and emotionally drained by their ordeal, feared the worst from their captors.It is beyond me to imagine the relief they must have felt as soldiers of the 1st Cavalry Division overran the camp at Santo Tomas on February 3, 1945. Set free were Sascha Weinzheimer and her family and the rest of the civilian survivors along with the 66 U.S. Army nurses who had been interned there.American Intelligence knew that starvation of the internees at Los Ba&ntilde;os was near and that the captors, angered by recent American successes, had grown even more brutal. They could wait no longer. 6,000 Japanese troops inhabited the district and Los Ba&ntilde;os was twenty miles behind the lines of the advancing Americans when paratroopers of the 11th Airborne Division staged the February 24, 1945 raid that liberated the camp and its 2,100 internees, including eleven U.S. Navy nurses.It ended well, but... A GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"We Band of Angels: The Untold Story of American Nurses Trapped on Bataan by the Japanese","review":"This book covers the courage of U.S. nilitary nurses during the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese.

A must for any historian or education scholar."},{"Title":"The American College and University: A History","review":"Frederick Rudolph is a master of graceful historical narrative, and this classic account of the development of American higher education should be on the shelf of everyone who teaches in a college or university. From heart-breaking stories of college buildings that burned down before they were completed, to the history of liberal education, to arguments over importance of the extracurriculum, to anecdotes of nineteenth-century professors imported from Germany who found themselves chasing after students with stolen turkeys (&quot;Ach, all dis for two tousand dollars!&quot;), Rudolph will delight you and educate you all at the same time. This is a volume not to be missed."},{"Title":"The American College and University: A History","review":"Both of you who have read any of my other reviews about college and university history books know that I like to gripe about the lack of academic quality in this genre, particularly regarding the histories of individual institutions. This book is different. It passes the test.For the story of how American higher education evolved from tiny rustic roots into the world-leading, mega-institution it became by the late 19th century, this book is a joy, and the justified leader. Its rendering of the critically important evolution of institutions from local sectarian academies to colleges (after the Revolution) and from colleges to research universities (after the Civil War) is both essential and superb reading. American history told without this important social component is incomplete. We ARE our colleges. That's why we love them so much.Rudolph's \\"struggling hilltop college\\" thesis has long been superseded by more sophisticated scholarship, as we know that our earliest colleges were far from the tiny, decrepit, under-supported institutions we quaintly recall. A reader can easily misunderstand the importance of a small college by simply assuming that enrollment figures tell the whole story. Rudolph makes that mistake. William & Mary was always a tiny institution by modern (and contemporary) standards. Does that, in any way, diminish its profound impact on American (and world) history? When Webster argued for Dartmouth before the Supreme Count in 1817, how many students did the College enroll? You get the idea. Before 1900, size really didn't matter.Rudolph's conclusion that the rise of Jacksonian Democracy, in place of Hamiltonian Federalism, created a \\"crisis\\" in American higher education is just plain wrong, and a typical New England perspective. Institutions simply evolved to represent the changes in the society. Before 1860, Yale, North Carolina and Virginia displayed prosperity and excellence. Rudolph's book is a product of his time and place. Henry Adams would have loved this book.The book lets me down in two areas: First, there are no illustrations of any kind. Second, the author ignores the rapid advancement of serious higher education away from the East during the 20th century. This is very much a Massachusetts-centric view of things, which was eroding rapidly by the time the first edition appeared in 1962. As people migrate, so go their attendant institutions."},{"Title":"The American College and University: A History","review":"After more than 35 years Dr. Rudolph's pioneer journey into the history of American Higher Education stands as the model for others to follow."},{"Title":"The American College and University: A History","review":"I purchased this book as I was finishing up onmy masters.

For those who doubt the efficacy of NLP, I say try it, and to those who believe the Enneagram is too rigid a tool to enhance NLP, you might try thinking of the latter as a directionalizing tool, a short-hand personality typing system, rather than something that wills a personality into stone. Each brings leverage to the other and engenders intelligent interpersonal living... An added bonus is that this book includes very useful NLP models that you won't find anywhere else, ie., most happily Anne Linden's Boundaries Model and Process."},{"Title":"The Enneagram and NLP: A Journey of Evolution","review":"The audience for this book is small. It starts from the assumption that the reader knows well both the Enneagram and NLP. If that's not you, don't buy this book.

It does this by combining the Enneagram personality typing system and the understandings of how people work derived from the field of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). The book identifies how the functioning of people 'fits' into the Enneagram, which seems to be accurate. As I am not a big fan of the Enneagram to begin with, I perhaps did not draw as much insight from this work as I would have otherwise. While interesting, I believe the NLP model, in and of itself, is a powerful methodology for therapy and personal evolution. Adding the Enneagram seemed to me to apply more constraints than were necessary."},{"Title":"The common sense book of kitten and cat care, (Bantam reference library, PR68)","review":"This book has a wealth of useful information on the care of kittens and cats.

Simply put, a macro allows you to program actions that duplicate anything you can do with a mouse or keyboard.Macro Express is an excellent program, but its acceptance has, I think, been limited for several reasons, including a) it is a programming tool, and b) its help file has always been mediocre.Joseph Weinpert attempted to overcome these barriers by creating this book, \\"Macro Express Explained\\". My first criticism of the book is that it is vastly overpriced. Having paid the full price for it, I feel ripped off. The price should have been half or less what is asked.Second, the writing, while reasonably competent, does little more than expand the help file that comes with Macro Express. Thus, we are treated to illuminating examples of instructional prose such as \\"The Store 0 if cancelled checkbox means that your macro will not stop is the user clicks the Cancel button.\\" In the Macro Express help file, this same function is defined as \\"If the user closes the input window without entering or saving an entry, 0 (zero) will be saved as the integer variable\\". The book goes on to explain in slightly fuller detail \\"[t]his gives you, the developer, a way to programmatically stop the macro by testing the variable's value.\\" Neither the book nor the help file actually tell you all that much, unless you are already a somewhat experienced programmer.Overall, the book is short of real life examples that would be helpful, although it does have many code snippets.On the whole, the book may be moderately helpful for someone who is struggling to understand Macro Express. But it is very overpriced and will not be very helpful to anyone who doesn't already understand at least mid-level programming concepts.Jerry"},{"Title":"Macro Express Explained","review":"I had my department at work buy Macro Express and it has saved at least 150 hours of work this year alone. I thank this book for making that happen, however, this book does not \\"teach\\" you I feel but rather provides information. Yes \\"explained\\" is all it does.This book isn't bad though. Think about it this way. If you want to meticulously go through every Macro Express feature and save time while doing it, this book is great. However, remember that this will possibly be the one of the most boring books you'll have to plow through in your life. It is certainly going to take a few days of intense studying. This course could easily be taught as a 4 credit hour course in a university. That's how much time it would probably take to go through this book.I read this book through work as part of training and it has well equipped me to create macros in my department. However, I would have never read this on my free time.Moreover, this book could be great as a reference. Overall, if you have the patience to go though this book or the time and resources, I would purchase the digital version, because this book is definitely overpriced! I believe you can find the digital version at the macro express website for about $20. Supposedly this copy comes with CDs to aid, but I doubt they are useful.

As each planting season arrives I remember how much I've missed reading Henry's wisdom, and I berate myself for having loaned out (and lost) those books.

Why?I have read (and re-read) The Earthman for more than 20 years. Every time I returned to The Earthman, I had a patient, passionate teacher by my side.With Henry's guidance, I matured. I learned to accept the rains that turned my garden into a sea of mud. I learned to accept the dogs who had a deep need to explore and &quot;investigate&quot; my treasured plants.Henry is my friend and mentor. I cannot imagine life in the garden without him."},{"Title":"THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN","review":"The two books I have read cover to cover as gardening advice and as literature are this book and Christopher Lloyd's Adventurous Gardener. I have shelves of gardening and horticultural books.It gives you more each time you read it."},{"Title":"THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN","review":"Dear Publisher...please reprint this book. I love Henry Mitchell. I was one of the 'blessed' because I actually read Mr. Mitchell's columns (both of them) for years. I live in the Washington DC area, and subscribed to the Post. Those of us who gardened locally were twice blessed because he was not only one of the best garden writers ever, he struggled with the heat, humidity, and high winds that attack us from all sides. Whenever I am in my garden I think of him. When I look at my Japanese Anemones I remember he said &quot;Once you have them you'll always have them.&quot; There have been times when I thought for sure they were goners, but they always survived. When I see a little plant struggling under a bush, I remember him saying, &quot;One of these days I'll have to crawl under there and pull it out.&quot; When I see a fish tank, I think of him and his horse trough. I miss him."},{"Title":"THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN","review":"I was prepared to not like this book. It's just not my style. Come on, a collection of newspaper columns? We've all read the garden column in our local paper. It's horrible. Poorly written, pushing a lot of chemicals and all the newest plants. I'm an heirloom gardener. My interest is history. What were old gardens like? How did gardeners back then do things? What did they grow? Why? What worked for them and what didn't?My favorite garden books are books about historical gardens and historical gardeners. I don't care for \\"modern\\" gardening and I absolutely loathe \\"how-to\\" books. They're a lot like those TV shows about home renovation. They make it look so easy, but when I actually try doing it myself, it's a heck of a lot more difficult. Or needs specialized tools. Or involves a lot of expensive materials. So I was prepared to dislike Mr. Mitchell and his book(s). Instead, I fell in love.I was hooked from the first sentence: \\"As I write this, on June 29, it's about time for another summer storm to smash the garden to pieces, though it may hold off until the phlox, tomatoes, daylilies, and zinnias are in full sway\\". A real gardener! With a sense of humor! And perspective! And he grows heirlooms! In fact, in many cases, he prefers the heirlooms to newer varieties. No perfect garden here. Instead, he willingly admits to mistakes and how he corrected them.Much to my chagrin, this is the perfect \\"how-to\\" book. He gives complete instructions on many issues and even admits when the process is difficult. He names and describes both new and old plant varieties. And provides the kind of useful information that you won't find in catalogs or nurseries: how a plant performs (or doesn't perform) in the home garden. All with a wonderful sense of humor.Like most of the other gardeners who have read this book, I have issues with some of his opinions, especially when it comes to invasives, but I think it's reasonable to say that any time you get two or more gardeners together, you will get differences of opinions. It's just that kind of a hobby. There is no \\"right way\\" or \\"wrong way\\". What works for one gardener may not work for another.This book is perfect. It can be read and enjoyed by both experienced and novice gardeners. I'm so glad I bought it instead of just borrowing it from the library. I'm looking forward to buying and reading his other books."},{"Title":"THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN","review":"This collection of articles from his long term newspaper garden writing column in the Washington Post was published in 1981, and is sorely in need of a reissue as my copy is broken spined and tattered.This is not a typical gardening book. Rather it is a collection of his commentaries on gardening - the joys, the trials and tribulations, what grows, what doesn't, and how gardeners in general need to buck up, stop whining and dig those holes really deep, filling them with leaf mold and good soil if they want their plants to grow rather than entombing roses in shallow graves of raw clay after having brought them home from the garden center and let them sit bare root in the garage for a few weeks).Mitchell is not for everyone in these oh so politically appropriate times. I recently read a garden writer disparaging him for his loving the invasive honeysuckle, his advocating cutting down of certain forest trees in city gardens, and for spending too much time chorusing about the delights of iris and peony. In his stead, Mitchell also used to write amusing disparagements of typical garden books with their useless charts for what a rose is (perennial, color: white, yellow,pink, red; hardiness:variable, etc etc) or their monthly lists of things to do (November is the time to chase field mice out of the barberry bushes). Also it is to be remembered he wrote for a regional audience - east coast city gardeners mostly, and not for those in Arizona or Minnesota.However, Mitchell is for every gardener who also also loves the written word. He does not have his equal in writing with irony and wit. When I was in college and moved to an apartment in upper New York state, I used to have my mother cut out and save his gardening columns from the Post to save for me when I came home from school. I was delighted when his wife collected them into a book (he sold the rights to her for a dollar after telling her and publishers that no one would want to read his old columns). I was devastated when he died.There is no equal for Henry Mitchell. The best we can do is reread his excellent words. So please reissue his books."},{"Title":"THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN","review":"I always loved Henry when he was in the Washington Post and I have enjoyed several of his other collections.

From the table of contents it shows that enormous work has been done to put this concise book together.

Thank you authors for putting this book together."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Hegel's Logic (Hackett Classics Series)","review":"This is a remarkable piece of philosophical exegesis. In a mere 124 pages, Hartnack explicates the arguments of the Science of Logic. What is particularly interesting is that the Danish author is apparently trained in analytic philosophy, which is notoriously hostile to Hegel and all things Continental. Hartnack makes many references to philosophers such as Strawson, Wittgenstein, Russell, Carnap, and Frege. This is not a mere matter of saying &quot;here's the Analytic Hegel.&quot; These references are used conservatively, and only to bring clarity to Hegel's own text. This is not a book that contains the next great &quot;reading&quot; of Hegel a la Kojeve or Hyppolite. But it is perhaps the book that one should seek out if he or she wishes to achieve a nuts and bolts understanding of what is perhaps the most difficult work in the history of philosophy."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Hegel's Logic (Hackett Classics Series)","review":"I just wanted to recommend this book to anyone embarking on taking on Hegel's Logic. Beware, though, the book, despite being an introduction, is challenging and demands slow, concentrated reading (this is also due in part to its condensed nature; a mere 124 pages covering each and every section of the Logic). This is no fault of Hartnack; The Science of Logic demands nothing less. Hartnack, in fact, provides the gist of Hegel's arguments in an exceptionally clear form. His \\"analytic\\" orientation doesn't matter much to me, nor should it pose a problem for you; if the arguments provided are sound, they're sound. The book holds rewards for the engaged reader on almost every page. Another observation I'd like to make is that the book is designed, in my judgment, for a reader already familiar with some basic concepts in philosophy (think upper-undergraduate level), though I think that a reader below that level may also find it useful with enough effort. In sum, I'd use this book as a steroid supplement before entering the ring and facing the beast itself."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Hegel's Logic (Hackett Classics Series)","review":"Like all of Hartnack's expositions of the idealists, this is a clearly written, easy-to-follow introduction to a difficult philosophy text. Itis highly recommended."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Hegel's Logic (Hackett Classics Series)","review":"Hartnack takes the first of the three sides of logical doctrine and explains it in detail. This is the logical starting point of \\"understanding\\". He will take you from \\"pure being\\" all the way to collapsing the absolute actualities into \\"grounded determinates\\". Dudley is better on explaining \\"syllogism\\", but still good presentation here. The book ends with \\"thematization which transitions the reader into ethics, as it should. 124 detailed pages that can be easily understood. Probably grad level but undergrad for your better students. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Hegel's Logic (Hackett Classics Series)","review":"I've read a few introductions to the Logic and Hartnack's is by far the clearest without sacrificing too much depth.

This book is simple and fun to read. It is an inspiring mix of personal stories, easy to follow guidelines and games, and descriptions of how to move a group through resistance and fear into laughter and unabashed play. I find myself referring to the book often even though I am planning a workshop on an unrelated topic. The ideas about how to use individuals' fears and connections within a group are easily applied to other situations, such as professional trainings or parties. Author Cathy Raphael's love of play and people is infectious. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in playing, or leading fun, dynamic groups of any kind."},{"Title":"Feminism: Mystique or Mistake? (Renewing the Heart)","review":"Don't get me wrong. I agreed with everything Diane Passno had to say in this book. But as a Christian who already believes that current feminism is in no way compatable with Biblical living and that abortion is one of the greatest evils of the United States, I can't say that this book was very strong on persuasiveness or new material. More of the writing was based on personal opinion rather than on studies or research to support Passno's viewpoint.I think that if others like myself read this book, they may very well enjoy it because it rings true with what they already believe. But as far as persuading someone who disagrees on these issues, or providing arguments for Passno's supporters to use against the divergent viewpoints, I thought this book could have been made stronger. It was good, but certainly had room to be better."},{"Title":"Feminism: Mystique or Mistake? (Renewing the Heart)","review":"One day I happened upon this book in a used book store just a few months after I had gotten married. I was struggling to reconcile what I had been taught about women's roles in my family, in church, and in the world I worked and lived in. This book was a huge breakthrough for me. It opened my eyes to some of the truth about feminism. This book laid a lot of the ground work for the next year of my marriage as I have come to understand how I can love my husband and glorify God in my marriage. Submission is something that many women have a wrong perception of. This book helps lay the ground work for why submission is essential in marriage. One additional issue she addresses is the struggle between moms working who are jealous of those at home and the time they get to spend with their children and moms at home who are jealous of those who are working and the identity affirmation they receive. I don't want to share with you what she said, but I have found it to be very true and I encourage you to read it for yourself. I would strongly recommend this book to any young woman who is seeking out her role in her marriage."},{"Title":"Feminism: Mystique or Mistake? (Renewing the Heart)","review":"Sentiments such as these are not easy to find these days. D. Passno dismantles modern feminism and shows the reader what it's made of...a fine idea to start with, and vehicle by which women truly oppress themselves today. (\\"we can do it!\\")Feminism has washed over our entire culture and changed what is considered normal, more than you realize. I was challenged and excited to read this book. Where else can you find thought provoking information about a topic such as the opposition of feminism? This is a subject people get fired from their jobs for disagreeing with. The real revolution is in the bible, ladies."},{"Title":"Feminism: Mystique or Mistake? (Renewing the Heart)","review":"Reading through this book made me realize how feminisim really does not line up with what God's Word says about women. Plus also I have learned things about women that I have never learned while taking Women's Studies classes when I was in college, because those Women's Studies classes were from a more liberal viewpoint (e.g., abortion)."},{"Title":"Feminism: Mystique or Mistake? (Renewing the Heart)","review":"While Ms. Passno explains that she changed her views on feminism, particularly abortion, she says this change made her realize that the important thing was for women to be good mothers, to &quot;focus on the family&quot; but then states that Gods work took her away from her own daughter's soccer game and that it was okay. That is hypocritical.She continued by saying that stay at home mothers shouldn't shun working mothers at church because some mothers need to work. But wasn't the book about putting family first, which would imply that a man and woman would plan and the mother wouldn't need to work. She is going against what she states, because one must assume she works because she wants to, which implies material coveting, which is against Gods word. This book was a way for Ms. Passno to spout her opinions."},{"Title":"Feminism: Mystique or Mistake? (Renewing the Heart)","review":"This book is basically what is stated, and it tries to achieve this by placing the blame for some unfortunate occurences in contemporary society entirely on a movement for equality. It is just said that women are participating in efforts to push back women's liberation even before they fully achieved it. Shame on you!"},{"Title":"Traditional South African Cookery (Hippocrene International Cookbook Series)","review":"I was very dissapointed by the negative reviews of this book and thought it might help prospective buyers to provide some background on the author and her book which was a classic for many years. I quote from 'The South African Culinary Tradition' by Renata Coetzee: 'Hilda's Where is it?' was first published in 1891. This cookery book, however, differs considerably from the Dijkman cookery book (published in 1890)on account of its ambiguous nature. Hilda arranged all the old recipes gathered from family members - among whom where members from quite prominent Cape families - alphabetically, but interspersed among them she added all kinds of other recipes for English, foreign and Eastern dishes that she had obtained from strangers or collected herself on her travels. She did indeed represent the typical tastes of the well-to-do burghers at the Cape when she included items such as tomato bredie, curry, bobtie, bread dumplings, koeksisters, fritters, fricadels, fish kedgeree, yellow rice and pickled fish, Van der Hum liquer, quince sambal, chutney, sour fig jam and abalone and even Malay dishes such as kebabs and sosaties.' Considering the fact thus that this book represents a very personal collection made by a woman who lived more than 100 years ago I have to take issue with the reviewer who was surprised at the instruction to 'leave standing on a shelf for 2 - 3 days'! That is the way things were done in those days! The book may not be relevant any longer but it certainly is a very important piece of Africana and any serious cook, interested in the South African culinary tradition, must find this an informative and interesting book."},{"Title":"Traditional South African Cookery (Hippocrene International Cookbook Series)","review":"I cant believe the negative reviews about this book. those reviewers clearly dont have a clue why this book is interesting - it is a book on history of SA cooking, written in 1891 and acknowledged favorably by for example historian louis leipoldt, one of the greatest authorities on SA cooking. It is a glimpse into the family kitchen of a typical old SA household, not a glitzy Charley Trotter or Bon Appetit cook by numbers.

There is no table of contents at the front, however there is an alphabetical index at the back and a category index.There are no photos or pictures.

While reading the book, I became more interested in Maeterlinck's material and sought out his early plays. This book is great with describing and summarizing Maeterlinck's important plays and essays.

Migrant workers have never had an easy life. Coming from a desperate situation in their homeland to a desperate situation in the fields, where stoop labor pays more than they can earn anywhere else, this novel brings their pathos and courage to the front. Recommended to all who think they know what it is all about. It is not pretty, but stomach hurting food for thought. Highly recommended reading for all that care."},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"Macho is a Spanish word that means male. But, like the Spanish words masculino and varonil, it has many more connotations than masculine, virile or just designating the male gender. The word macho is also used to describe masculine vigor, verve and fortitude. This book by Victor Villaseor portrays the fascinating story of a Mexican youth's journey to the United States in search of a better life for himself and his family. The young man's passion, pride and burning desire for freedom carry this \\"coming of age\\" story. He needs his masculine vigor, verve and fortitude to overcome the trials and tribulations of seeking justice in a \\"white world\\" trying to deny his humanity. But, it is Villaseor's description of the experiences of the Mexican farm workers in the Salinas valley, as they seek respect, dignity and the opportunity to make a decent living, that is the real story being told through the tale of a young man striving to be macho.The Odysseus in this Odyssey is the young man Roberto Garcia. He does not want to pursue his education in a school. He believes that he does not need to know \\"about those things.\\" The seventeen year old does learn the value of education as he is \\"coming of age\\" in Norte America's California. The sights and sounds of the Mexican-American workers are vividly portrayed. The dangers of crossing the border and working their way north to their \\"land of opportunity\\" in overcrowded boxcars and locked trucks is accurately told. Despite the hardships of carrying the hopeful workers to their new home, Roberto is not deterred from the journey. A week's wages in California is more than he can earn back home in the Mexican mountains of Michoacan.The author Villaseor shows the brutality of migrant labor, Cesar Chavez organizing the workers, and the plight of the immigrant experience, as seen through the eyes of young Roberto. During these experiences Garcia grows up to be a macho man and returns home to save his family.This story illustrates the ideals of understanding of who we are as a people; and as peoples. The story of the Mexican migrant workers, the illegal immigrants and the Mexican-Americans history has not been adequately told and included in our common history as Americans. History that is not inclusive excludes the rationale of \\"doing\\" history. Instead of going \\"back to the future\\", we need to go \\"forward to the past.\\" But the stories of the past have all too often been \\"white washed\\". I recommend this work of fiction as an adjunct to our old, tired history books that have been \\"white washed\\" in that they exclude the peoples of color. Inclusive history is the story of many different peoples, men and women of various colors contributing to our world, history as it actually is. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"I'll be as spare as Villasenor himself. An outstanding and underrated author's young and sinewy expression of his views of the disparity between mexican/american and gringo culture. A great and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"Macho! Is very, very fine literature!Villase&ntilde;or accomplishes in 235 pages what some writers can't accomplish in a 1000, with writing so visual that you will see the scenes play out right before your eyes.The exposition was judiciously used, and the bits of history regarding Cesar Chavez were relevant, insightful, and really put the novel into context.Between chapters I found myself putting the book down, and really pondering over what I'd read, savoring it like a good meal with a great glass of wine.Even though the backdrop of the novel is Mexico and the Mexican-American experience...the book, at its core, is truly universal. Many cultures all around the world have backwards notions of what it means to be a man - I say \\"backwards,\\" because some of these moronic notions of what it means to be a MAN can get you killed. And, then what? People come to your funeral and say how honorably you died. What sense does that make? You don't even get a chance to live and enjoy the honor you've apparently earned.If you have to fight to prove you're a MAN, that's not honorable at all - that's barbaric and primitive!This book will truly force you to differentiate honor from stupidity, and nobleness from arrogance.But then again, GREAT literature often does stimulate deep thinking!"},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"Last year for my sophomore English class I had to read this book.

In Macho written by Victor Villase&ntilde;or, that's what happened. A seventeen year old boy, Roberto Garcia wanted to cross the border because he wanted to support his family. He wants to have enough money. He is the only man from the house. Roberto's mom didn't want him to cross the border because she was scared that something was going to happened to him. She was also scared of him leaving them alone. Roberto didn't listen to her. That was the only option that Roberto had to get more money and support his family.This is when the conflict begins, when they caught Roberto in the border. This is what I like that it relates to real life. To all those Mexicans families that come to America for a better life. I also like it because it mixes my language in it, Spanish.If you want to find out what happened to Roberto when he got caught, and what happened to his family while he wasn't with them, read this book and find out. You will enjoy it, trust me, is like if a Mexican is telling you his/her story!!!!"},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"This is not the first book I read by this author--I felt the book was picturesque in the way the author painted the scenery-I felt as if I could close my eyes and become that young man trying to come of age without wanting or needing to become educated--as he said I don't need to know about those things.

Roberto came to the United States because he needed to help his family that is in Mexico because they are poor.Roberto came from Mexico because he wanted to work hard. Roberto works in the fields with other immigrants that came to the United States to work and get a better life. Roberto was discriminate by American people because he was Hispanic and because he could work in some jobs that only American people could work. When Roberto had his fist pay check he decided to send the money to Mexico but he told his father that his father that if he is going to waste the money in alcohol that he is not going to send no more money.I found this book interesting because Roberto had to pass threw discrimination, and insults, calling him names and all of this just because he wanted to help his family. I found that admiring and interesting.I recommend this book to all the people that interest in how immigrants that pass threw so they could follow their dream.Book review- by= Francisco Gonzalez"},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"Macho!Macho! Is a good book. Macho! is about a young man about 17 years old going to the United States. The main character in this story is Roberto. Roberto is leaving home to go to the United States because he wants to make money to take care of his family and since his father is sick he is the only one on the family that could do work. Roberto goes to the United States because it is a really big economy that makes good money for people that just come as immigrants. This book Macho! is written 3rd person point of view. The problem in this book is that Roberto is crossing the border with out papers and needs to make sure that he doesn't get caught. If he gets caught, he would be transported to Mexico again or the place they came as an immigrant. Reading this book really got things to my head, because if you really pay attention of how many people cross the border or come in the U.S. with out papers they got to go threw some devastating times. Immigrants come to the U.S so they can have a better life or a better living. They might come to the U.S. because in their home or place that they came from didn't make a good living and they come to the U.S. to make a better living than before. The author of Macho!(Victor Villasenor) did really like the book, he probably made this book because he made of cross the border or his family members did, I say this because with a last name like Villasenor you know he is a Mexican, he felt the way immigrants do so he made this book. Macho! is a really interesting to me because it relates to what my parents did, they also had to cross the border. I felt interesting because my parents were immigrants and I felt interesting of how Roberto had to go threw to pass the border being an Immigrant and working as an immigrant and how he had to work his butt of for his family, and compare of what my parents did to Roberto, because working as an immigrant is a really hard job. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"The book is mainly about a boy named Roberto. He lives in Mexico with his mom, dad, and many brothers and sisters. Roberto is the one who works and feeds his family because his father does nothing but drink all the time.Throughout the story Roberto meets a man named Juan Aguilar. He tells him that he wants to take him to the U.S. to work and bring back lots of money for his family. Even though Roberto's mom doesn't want him to go because she thinks it's a dangerous trip, he doesn't listen. So Juan Aguilar takes Roberto along with ten other men to start the journey. As they travel they have to overcome many obstacles. Do they ever make it to the U.S.? Or do they get caught and sent back? Read the book and find out what happens. This story is written in a third person's point of view.I thought this book was an okay book because in some parts it would get interesting, and in other parts it would get boring.

Well once you read Macho you will find out that it is not an ordinary book by reading the first few chapters! The book Macho is about a boy named Roberto Garcia who leaves his family behind to move to United States for a better life for himself and try to provide for his family. He moves to California to work at a vegetable field. He is not making a lot of money. But is still sending money back to his family in Mexico but stopped because his father is an alcoholic. The book is written with some Spanish words, so if you do not know Spanish you might have trouble understanding the book. I felt bad for Roberto because he had a rough life supporting his family and himself. The reason why this book is called Macho is because Roberto felt like a man or \\"Macho\\" supporting his family. I personally liked this book because I can relate to Roberto. I have a friend who is working and he is 15 and provides for his family, just like Roberto."},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"An earlier reviewer had used this word - contrived. That's also the issue I have with this book. The suffering and dying that the group endures as it makes it's way north is equal to all of the greatest mishaps that have been recorded for an entire decade. The same group of people die of dehydration, water poisoning, and suffocation in a vehicle. Although there are cases of all three happening over a period of years the chances of all of this happening to one group is almost nil.It just seemed that the author tried to keep the book engaging by cramming it with as much action as possible and it just seems contrived. The amount of gun play that occurs throughout is also greatly exaggerated as most Mexicans don't settle their problems by killing. Yet this book is full of endless shootouts, whether over cockfights or blood vengeance or just plain bar fights. At times it seems that the entire journey is a sequence of skirmishes, killings, and flight. All for the purpose of making an entertaining read.The impression one gets is that the author tried to make his case more convincing over the plight of the Mexican illegal immigrants by exaggerating their hardships and really does not have to do so."},{"Title":"Macho!","review":"As a person who has lived in the southwest all of my life I have heard many stories about ilegal aliens and their reasons for comming to this country trying to improve their lives.

The problem/conflict is about a kid named Roberto Garcia who came to the United States for a better life, and he gets discriminated by white people. I feel bad for Roberto, and myself because it reminds me of some cases familiar in the United States. Mexicans get discriminated against because they are illegal and are being treated like animals. I like that the people in the book never gave up having a better life. I also, dislike this book because at the end of the book it started talking about the beginning again which I didn't really understand what it meant. This book is interesting because it reminds me of Mexican people and since there is a similar problem today maybe most people want to know what happen or started to discriminate Mexican people and other kinds of other nationalities.

Undoubtedly she was the reason his work was so appreciated and adored by the women of the era. Case in point: This book was first published in The Ladie's Home Journal as a serial, even with all of the blood and gore and the vivid descriptive imagery Zane Grey was known to possess. To us today it seems amazing such a magazine would publish such a book, yet that is the power, the talent Zane Grey had to enthrall and entertain his readership; they couldn't get enough. Thundering Herd is the story of the buffalo and of their near extinction when hide hunters swarmed the plains killing them by the tens of thousands, and at the same time helping to eliminate the Indians by killing their food supply. This book pays homage to the buffalo. The hero, Tom Doan and the heroine Milly Fayre have a rather unique relationship in this book, and Milly's story is the most interesting. I encourage you to get this book and read it. It's worth the price. And these Walter J. Black editions will last a life time. P.S.

It is very powerful and very real feeling. There is a great deal of despair in this series, but there is also very hard won triumph.When one reads this and learns about space pirates, at first it would seem unrealistic, until we realize that in our curent world of 2011, piracy and slavery are still active thriving practices. The series covers politics, war fare, intrigue with ecomonics, and finally in the last of the 5 book series (Statesman) there is a sense of uplifting to a new vision.

The problem is that his imagination is limited. After the umpteenth pirate attack on the main character's ship, the rape and murder of his friends and family begins to become laughable. \\"Oh, another pirate attack, whoop dee doo!\\" you might think once you reach the mid point of the book.Anthony also puts in frequent rationalizations for pedophilia, incest, rape, and murder. My problem is not specifically that I disagree with his ideas but rather the clumsiness with which he presents them. The lover of the main character tells him the story of her childhood when she was a prostitute but makes it clear that the man with whom she slept until age ten was a good man, just different. If, perhaps, that character had been a part of the book and shown the reader that he was a good man, it would have been okay. Instead, Anthony violates the fundmental \\"show, don't tell\\" rule of fiction.If you can forgive all that, the writing style is simplistic. While reading the book, I hoped it was intentionally written simplistically to reflect the fact that the supposed author of the narrative is fifteen. However, the later books continue in the same style. If the book had otherwise been enjoyable, this would be a minor point, but given that the content of the book is unappealing, the lacking in style is damning."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"The writing style in this book is pretty basic.

The writing is unimpressive, the characters are poorly developed except for the protagonist, and all including the protagonist are wildly unrealistic.

To say I was dissapointed is a profound understatement, this story is abhorrent, repulsive, and was obviously written to appeal to the fringes and those who enjoy brutality, repetitive and redundant events, and immorality. I for one will not be reading the sequels in this series and regret that I took time away from reading worthwhile stories and wasted it on this less than satisfying storyline."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"This is old-fashioned, over-the-top (deliberately, I'm sure) space opera. There are loooong stretches of technical descriptions that are probably a delight for some readers, but easy to skip over if that kind of thing bores you to tears. (It does me.) As other reviewers have mentioned, the author seems to be obessesed with rape, but there's also a solid core of sympathy for the women, and a recognition that women can be powerful, along with some male romanticizing of those powers. I'm not familiar with Anthony's writing, so I don't know where this comes in his body of work, but it does give the impression that the writer is very young, and maybe at the start of his career. Or else, he very cleverly intends to give that impression.Will I continue reading the series? I'm not sure. I'm more interested in the psychology of a boy who grows up to be a tyrant than in space battles."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"I've been recently reading novels from my past, especially those I recall enjoying. I felt like revisiting this series, seeing if I remember correctly.Back cover of book:Caligula of the StarsThough he was later accused of every crime and sexual perversion in the galaxy, Hope Hubris began as an innocent. Because he defended his older sister against the violent lusts of a wealthy scion, Hope and his peasant family were forced to flee Callisto, one of the moons of Jupiter. Pursued by bloodthirsty scions across the airless desert, they barely escaped with their lives. The illegal space bubble was overcrowded with refugees, all hoping to reach Jupiter for asylum.But the space travelers had not reckoned on the terrible threat of high space - the pirates, barbaric men who rape, rob, and murder, with no thought but to satisfy their bestial appetites. It will take all Hope's ingenuity to survive, but the atrocities he witnesses will never die. There is only one way he can be rid of them...Revenge!End back cover of book.The writing is an autobiography by 15-year-old Hope Hubris to events he has witnessed during his refugee journey to Jupiter. Some scenes are brutal and troubling and won't be suitable for all readers. The horrible crimes committed against Hope and his family becomes somewhat repetitive which I'm not fond of, hence a 4 star rating.The early experiences with good and evil people at this age will define his character to become tyrant. I found it engaging on the levels of family, community, and personal determination despite the disturbing imagery. \\"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant: Volume 1)\\" is still an enjoyment after all these years.Thank you."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"Kid ain't no space tyrant yet.In fact, it is pretty much completely the opposite.

Also, I had heard that a movie of 'On a Pale Horse' was coming out with Jamie Foxx as 'Zhane'."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"Why Piers Anthony is primarily considered a fantasy author, I'll never know. I think that at least half of his greatest work is Sci-Fi, and this book is the beginning of one of his best series. Bio of a Space Tyrant (beginning with Refugee) is a great look at the rise of one person in a sea of chaos to the pinnacle of leadership.In this book we learn of the main character's race for survival as he flees his home planet in a simple space pod along with 100 or so other refugees. This book is not for the prude -it deals with violent encounters and the need and drive for survival in the worst of human conditions.I could not put this book down, and think the rest of the series lives up to its promise.While obviously a lot of events in the book mirror some of the events and historical cold-war issues of our time, I found that a lot of the commentary was refreshing and thoughtful, and it reminded me of Robert E. Heinlein, who often proposed &quot;harsh&quot; solutions to mankind's problems -solutions that very well may have worked had we the will to implement them.I found it to be a fantastic book, and when I got to the end I was truly surprised at the depth of what I had read. I had NOT expected the book to progress as it had.Though out of print in the mass market paperback edition, I would say it would ABSOLUTELY be worth purchasing the trade paperback versions or purchasing the older ones used. A small price to pay for a series that may open up your mind to different ways at looking at the world, and to understanding in a fresh way the human machinations within.If you liked this sci-fi excursion with Piers Anthony, I'd also recommend his 5 volume &quot;Cluster&quot; Series which is also amazing sci-fi (and even more imaginative), as well as his &quot;Omnivore / Orn / Ox&quot; series, and finally, and most especially, his Split Infinity series (which may be my favorite -but is only half sci-fi; the other half being pure fantasy). Really imaginative and compelling Science Fiction here."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"I loved the Bio of a Space Tyrant series. Refugee was one of the most affecting/haunting books I've ever read. It is not for the weak stomached. There is much violence in this book, but it's not about the violence it's about the human will to survive. The first four books in this series, Refugee, Mercenary, Politican and Executive are excellent page turners. The fifth Statesman is good but not quite the same level, a little anticlimatic. But don't miss out by not reading at least the first four!"},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"Here in the beginning, he's not much of anything really, just a kid who stood up for his sister. That one act begins a series of events that ultimately rock the entire solar system.Here in the opening, Hope and his family are fleeing in a transport bubble with many other families. Beset by pirates, a multitude of times, the population within the bubble is dramatically reduced by the time they reach their destination.REally a sad book, but it lays the foundation for what is to come. A series definitely worth reading. I've read it now over a dozen times over the last two decades."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"Maybe it was because I was very young when I read this, but I truly did not like this book.

Their goal is the promised land of Jupiter. On their way they are betrayed by greedy human traffickers, attacked, again and agian, by pirates, turned back by a suddenly xenophobic Jupiter, before finally given refugee status.Mr. Anthony has, and I think very well, captured the plight of the very real refugees that roam the world of today. I think I recognize all the incidents described from news reports. The Jupiter of the book is a thinly disguised USA. It could be Germany, Sweden, the UK, or any other western country that promises as safe haven, but grows xenophobic when they did not anticipate the flow of refugees fleeing from dictators, corruption, poverty, disease, and war. Often fleeing from situations created by the countries they are fleeing to!So, even if the reading is grisly sometimes, it is no imagination. This book is actually very political. These are the experiences that will influence the future tyrant."},{"Title":"Refugee (Bio of a Space Tyrant, Vol. 1)","review":"A child and his ordinary peasant family are forced to flee their home planet after a chance encounter with a higher class citizen. The child, aptly named Hope, is quickly exposed to the indifference of evil, in the form of roving bands of space pirates. The atrocities in the story are awful and fascinating, and the problems Hope encounters frequently seem to have no good solutions. And yet we come to understand him and cheer him on, though some will say &quot;I wouldn't do that!&quot; By the end of this book your feelings may change, as Hope's were forced to. This book will stay with all who read it, and it is by far the best in the series.

In fact I was not certain I wanted to continue with the series after this book but after reading book 2 I am glad I have.This first book is definitely a story of bad to worse to worst and ten somehow past that. Any bright and shining moments seem only to be there to make the next tragedy sting that much worse.

The Split Infinity series followed by the Xanth series absorbed 100s of hours of my young adulthood and I was hooked. Now older and still an avid reader I decided to revert back and try some of Piers' other novels. Unfortunately this one was very dissapointing. Pages and pages of endless description and preaching by the main character adding no value to the story or character development.

Further, states hold a major portion of power over laws concerning the \\"health, safety, morals, and well-being\\" of its citizenry (4). Subsequently, the analysis of state politics is based on the devolution of this power and focuses on political outcomes such as policy formation. In Faces of Inequality, Rodney Hero argues that race and ethnicity are centrally linked to the development of state policy, political institutions, party organizations, and interest group conflict. Hero's theory in this book is logically well-formed - because there are differences among states - despite the same overarching institutional framework (4). Race and ethnic groups are major features of U.S history, are not equally distributed across states, and have had very different historical and political experiences.In order to capture the political outcomes of states, Hero systematically analyzes the relationship of state racial and ethnic make-up to an umbrella of political features using simple state-level regression analysis. This type of analysis makes this book especially appealing to the student of political science. Strength and formation of political parties, interest groups, state policies, and institutions are found to be significantly related to state's race and ethnic composition. Further, Hero finds that these variables give much more explanatory value to political outcomes at the state level. He claims that knowing the social composition while analyzing state-level politics adds a \`face' to American politics. Social diversity disaggregates, contextualizes, and serves as a core influence on and explanation of political phenomenon at the state-level.Hero provides a good review of past theories and studies of state-level political analysis. Preceding this review he develops his central argument - states fall into several patterns according to their race and ethnic diversity (11-15). These patterns are placed into three main categories: homogenous states (states with very small minority populations and few white ethnics); heterogeneous states (states with a large white ethnic population along with a significant amount of minority populations); and bifurcated states (states with large minority populations, primarily black and/or Latino, as well as large white non-ethnic populations). Hero's development of this pattern prepares the reader for a whirlwind of critiques of past studies and theories of state politics. He does a great job in arming the reader and trumping through a hefty load of theories - all the while presenting critical assessments of how his social diversity model could better explain political phenomenon at the state-level."},{"Title":"Musical Theatre Anthology for Teens: Duets Edition (Vocal Collection)","review":"good music for 2nd year players. book had 1st song missing, so just remember to check them when they arrive."},{"Title":"Musical Theatre Anthology for Teens: Duets Edition (Vocal Collection)","review":"This book is fine if you want duets for female voices.

The death of his mother when he was eight years old so impressed upon him the central Buddhist truth of impermanency, that he forsook his aristocratic privileges when he was thirteen and went to Mt. Hiei to study to become a Buddhist monk.But after intensive study, and since no-one in Japan could satisfactorily answer his questions - not surprising when you consider that he was the greatest genius Japan has ever produced - he sailed to China in 1223 in search of someone who could. There he studied under the Soto Ch'an (Zen) Master Ju-ching (+ 1163-1228), attained enlightenment, and returned to Japan to become the founder of Japanese Soto Zen.Zen first became known to the West largely through the writings of D. T. Suzuki, who was a follower of the 'Sudden' or direct koan-using Rinzai Zen. Soto Zen, in contrast, is a gentler method which places greater reliance on Zazen or deep meditation, and is the method that has gained the largest number of adherents in Japan.The present small book of just 119 pages is exactly what it says - a 'Primer of Soto Zen' - and as such, as Masunaga explains, it &quot;does not concern itself with any great philosophical subtleties.&quot; Instead what we find is a collection, recorded by his disciple Ejo, of brief talks, remarks, comments, and exhortations, addressed by Dogen largely to Zen beginners and lay followers, which offers &quot;an insight into the type of Buddhism Dogen sought to propagate&quot; (page 2) - in other words, an ideal book for ordinary folks like most of us.Here, to give you a taste, are a few lines selected at random:&quot;Nothing can be gained by extensive study and wide reading. Give them up immediately&quot; (page 8).&quot;Every man possesses the Buddha-nature. Do not demean yourselves&quot; (page 19).&quot;To enter the Buddha Way is to stop discriminating between good and evil and to cast aside the mind that says this is good and that is bad&quot; (page 29).&quot;To escape from the world means that one's mind is not concerned with the opinions of the world&quot; (37).&quot;One must be deeply aware of the impermanence of the world&quot; (page 38).&quot;When the Buddhas ... state that the mind is plants and trees, revise your preconceptions and understand plants and trees as mind&quot; (page 66).My own copy of this book was purchased many years ago, and is now pretty dog-eared. It's one of those old friends I like to return to. Since it's mainly addressed to beginners it doesn't, as I've indicated, give the full scope of Dogen's thought. With the 'Zuimonki' - which means 'easy for the ears to understand' - we are rambling the plains and foothills of Dogen's thought. But any sensitive reader will find much to interest them here, and the book is an excellent introduction to Dogen the man and to his more advanced thought.To discover just how profound Dogen can be, you will have to turn to the 'Shobogenzo' proper. This has been translated, in whole or in part, a number of times, but an edition I can strongly recommend is Kazuaki Tanahashi's 'Moon in a Dewdrop - Writings of Zen Master Dogen.'Besides twenty texts from the 'Shobogenzo,' this book includes four additional texts and a selection of Dogen's poems. It also contains a fine Introduction on Dogen's Life and Teachings, four Appendices, full Notes, a Selected Bibliography, an incredibly full and detailed bilingual Glossary of a kind one won't find elsewhere, and some interesting illustrations.Dogen's Japanese is an excruciatingly difficult Japanese, so much so that some think it should be called 'Dogen-ese' and not Japanese. Think 'Finnegans Wake' and you'll get an inkling of the problems involved in translating him. The language and thought of the 'Shobogenzo' comes to us from such a height that there can be no such thing as a definitive interpretation, and hence no such thing as a definitive translation.'Moon in a Dewdrop' is the result of a collaborative effort by a team of highly competent American Zenists, some of them very well known. It has always seemed, in my humble opinion, that, considering the difficulties, they did a very fine job. If you enjoy the 'Zuimonki,' I'm sure you'll be bowled over by 'Moon in a Dewdrop.' Dogen leaves most other thinkers behind in the dust."},{"Title":"A Primer of Soto Zen: A Translation of Dogen's Shobogenzo Zuimonki (East West Center Book)","review":"A Primer of Soto Zen: A Translation of Dogen's Shobogenzo ZuimonkiTranslated by Reiho MasunagaThis book was not actually written by Dogen, but consists of brief talks given by him to his disciples and collected after his death.Eihei Dogen (1200-1253) is regarded today as the founder of Japanese Soto Zen and his writings are assuming a reputation for great depth and insight in the West. In recent years many English tranlations of his works have been published, and the western Zen student is in a quandary when considering where to begin to read this highly influencial master.&quot;Shobogenzo Zuimonki&quot; loosely translated means &quot;Dharma for Dummies&quot; and that may give the prospective reader an idea of what reading this book is like. The English title &quot;A Primer of Soto Zen&quot; is somewhat misleading, as the book actually gives no instructions for the practice of zazen (Zen meditation), the primary focus of Soto Zen.The book is a patchwork of brief statements by Dogen. Sometimes he is answering a question, more often, the statement is prefaced with simply &quot;One day Dogen instructed:&quot; or the like. The tone of most of the book is didactic and hortatory. From the content of Shobogenzo Zuimonki it seems that Japanese monks in Dogen's time had grown rather lax, and he felt a great need to impress on them the proper way to behave. Often Dogen is urging his disciples to give up worldly attachments, or practice poverty, or holding up examples of virtuous Buddhist behavior before them.I came to this book familiar with Dogen from numerous anecdotes and quotations found in other Zen books, and was disappointed that it did not inspire me or deepen my own questions as have many of the snippets of his writings I have read elsewhere. For the lay student of Zen in the West, this book is probably not the best place to begin with Dogen's writings.However, the translation is uniformly clear and readable, and the text itself weighs in at just over 100 pages, so if you're interested in what Dogen actually said to his disciples, A Primer of Soto Zen provides a record of Dogen's direct responses to the problems and questions of the monks under his care."},{"Title":"A Primer of Soto Zen: A Translation of Dogen's Shobogenzo Zuimonki (East West Center Book)","review":"&quot;A Primer of Soto Zen: A Translation of Dogen's Shobogenzo Zuimonki&quot; is a very misleading title. I remember I bought this book at a Soto Zen Center bookstore the second time I visited, hoping to understand the Soto Zen tradition and learn more about who Dogen was and how to do zazen. This book does not answer any of these questions. It is rather a collection of talks given by Dogen to his students which were written down by his disciple Ejo. It is also very wrong to assume that this text was intended to be a textbook for a certain school of thought as Dogen was not interested in estabalishing a school but rather in practing in the way of Sakyamuni Buddha. On the back of this book, it says that Zuimonki can be roughly translated as &quot;easy for ears to understand&quot; or &quot;simplified.&quot; Shobogenzo(&quot;The Eye of the True Dharma&quot;) is of course Dogen's 92 chapter magnum opus(which I shall read one day when I have lots and lots of time on my hands) that addresses everything from enlightenment to how monks should flush a toilet when living the monastic life. So this can be looked at as a simplified version of Dogen's Shobogenzo. The tone and content of the talks suggest this as well. Dogen's greatest gift as a Zen Master was to clearly and rationally articulate the essential teachings and practices of Sakyamuni Buddha and the Zen patriarchs. Dogen is constantly putting an emphasis on the practice of zazen and to put everything else aside. He says it simply and convincing without any extra terminology or philosophy. It reminds me of the simple sayings of Sakyamuni Buddha in the &quot;Dhammapada&quot; as opposed to the more complicated sutras.I do not recommend this book if: 1.This is your first introduction to Dogen(Check out Kazuaki Tanashi's &quot;Moon in a Dewdrop&quot;) 2.You are seeking information on the basics of the practice of Soto Zen and Zazen(Check out any of Shunryu Suzuki's books.) If you are really into Dogen and can't get enough then by all means, pick up this book. It will be worth your time. I prefer his writings from Shobogenzo like &quot;Endeavor of the Way&quot; and &quot;Actualizuing The Fundamental Point&quot; myself but maybe you'll have a strong connection with these talks instead. I think it's a good book to pick up every now and then and read a few pages from and remember the basics of my practice and what Dogen was trying to get at in his teachings and writings."},{"Title":"A Primer of Soto Zen: A Translation of Dogen's Shobogenzo Zuimonki (East West Center Book)","review":"There are quite a few long reviews on this book that should suffice for a detailed information without my two cents added. I will, however, note that this book lacks much of the glamor so often attributed to Zen masters. 'Shobogenzo Zuimonki' is plain and straight-forward, and Dogen does not lead one to indulge in wild, philosophical explorations. Rather, he points to a quite ordinary and much more 'down-to-Earth' Zen, which is refreshingly simple."},{"Title":"A Primer of Soto Zen: A Translation of Dogen's Shobogenzo Zuimonki (East West Center Book)","review":"I love this book.

I learned many tips on topics I thought I was already an expert on.Not only did the authors provide valuable information on each topic, but each technology was compared in an unbiased fashion. I felt each chapter provided enough background and detailed information for me to decide if it's a good fit for my application. The authors point out critical questions to ponder in each chapter when making architectural decisions. The chapter on &quot;Data Storage Options&quot; is a great example.I found the theme of using the sample application throughout the book as a cohesive and a good way to demonstrate and contrast the different open source technologies. The sample application represented a real world scenario and demonstrated more than just the simple (and non real world) usage of the technologies.I only have one wish, I would have liked to seen a little more coverage of Apache Axis in the web services chapter.It would be impossible to thoroughly cover each open source technology included in the book since each one is a book unto itself. However, after reading this single book I feel educated enough to choose and further evaluate open source technologies that will meet my specific application needs.

Perhaps by the necessity of a limited budget. Or maybe you consider Open Source to be ultimately more reliable than closed proprietary code. For either reason, or better, for both, this book might interest you.The authors shamelessly plug the combination of writing in Java and using Open Source applications that have arisen to support it. Starting with using Ant as a &quot;super-make&quot;. Then testing modularity and programmatically with JUnit. If you need to build business rules, why not try Marc Fleury's JBoss? Plus front end UIs can be enhanced with SWT, if you want a native look and feel, instead of the default Swing/AWT. Also discussed are JMX, JDBC, JNDI and more.All these packages are free and by now are very well tested. Sam-Bodden and Judd try to motivate you with concrete code samples. Because the packages can be forbidding in their totality. The authors show how you can integrate them into your needs in a systematic and doable fashion.

Although it is not designed as a guidebook (it is heavy on foot-notes, further references etc) it encouraged me to go and visit some of the lesser known sites of Rome where archaeologists have recently been working. I loved the chapter on food supply especially and went to see Monte Testaccio, a pile of broken pots discarded from the boats that carried wine up the Tiber. It's extraordinary - as high as a natural hill - and the book gave full details of the internal structure, the types of vessel that made up the pile, and some of the statistics for how much alcohol Rome consumed. There are some other great chapters too and the authors are well-known experts: Kathleen Coleman, who wrote the chapter on sports and pastimes, was the technical advisor for the Russell Crowe movie Gladiator.

This book ranks among my most valued ones, and is always within constant reach for reference on optimization algorithms. The book covers linear programming, nonlinear programming, geometric programming, dynamic programming, integer programming, and stochastic programming. A wide array of methods which seem impressively complete are covered in this 903-page book. The addressing of the topics is geared more towards making the reader understand how the algorithms were derived (which is welcome, in contrast to chasing up the original research papers), and using them. Just about every method is illustrated clearly with examples - a welcome feature of the book. One minor drawback is that all examples and exercises that are applied to engineering, are drawn from mechanical and civil areas (note: there are also many examples that are mathematical toy problems). Having said that, I must hasten to add that I am an electrical engineer, and I have no problem at all in using this book. Strongly recommended for people who work with optimization algorithms!"},{"Title":"Engineering Optimization: Theory and Practice, 3rd Edition","review":"This work is one of my favorite all-around optimization books. It covers a lot of ground and it is very well written from a pedegogical point of view. Covered are a full range of linear and nonlinear methods, and for both constrained and unconstrained problem types. Also treated are geometric, dynamic, and integer programming techniques. Many of the algorithms within the book are presented with step-by-step examples which greatly assist the reader.One downside is that I found the explanations of SQP and GRG methods to be confusing and insufficient. As these two techniques are among the more efficient and robust for many NLP problems (which are essential for engineering applications), this was disappointing. I hope Professor Rao will write a fourth edition with improvements in these particular areas. Otherwise, this book stands out as a useful and practical reference for both students and practicing engineers. If I had to have only one general book on optimization, this would be it.

Amy had been driving the car when slick roads and too much alcohol resulted in a tragic accident. Because both women were severely facially damaged but shared a similar body build, and had exchanged personal items before getting in the car, a case of misidentification results in an extraordinary opportunity. Realizing that no one will mourn her, Amy assumes her best friend's life.It seems the perfect solution for a woman with no family. She continues the role of beloved daughter, filling the gap for Robin's family and sparing them tremendous grief. Although Amy is in love with Robin's brother Paul, it is not until a year and a half later that she learns she gave up his love with the identity switch. Further, the ideal impression she had of Robin's family does not bear up under reality. Amy's identity switch brings professional success, when she becomes a well-known soap opera star and marries a fellow actor. But as things come unraveled, she soon feels as though she is trapped in her own personal soap opera.Author Carole Bellacera pens an exhilarating romantic suspense with UNDERSTUDY. Switched identities may be a long favored plot device, but Bellacera finds a way to add her own exciting flair, resulting in tale that readers will find impossible to put down. Although Robin and Amy are complete opposites, Amy's transformation is incredibly believable. Further, the secrets of Robin's life become driving motivation for Amy to confront the truth of the past as well as her own personal truths. Secondary characterizations are likewise memorable, especially Bellacera's thoughtful and insightful handling of Amy's husband's complicated feelings toward her and his past. A novel rich with psychological insight, UNDERSTUDY comes very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"as a college student myself, this book was able to create a strong sense of reality. i don't want to sound cliche, but i couldn't put this book down! if you are a diehard fan of the &quot;lifetime movie network&quot; this is the book for you!!! the vivid words and details create such an imaginative dreamery that i feel confident in saying i'd attempt to direct a movie out of it!!!this is a brilliant mix of suspense and romance while the pages turn you through roads of philosophical wonder and psychological prowess!"},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"Robin Mulcahey had the perfect life. She had won awards for her roles in plays and as a soap-opera star. She was married to Declan Blair, an Irish film actor. She had it all.But everything about Robin became a lie back in 1996. Robin and her best friend, Amy Shiley, were in a horrible car accident. Robin died and Amy was mistaken for her. From then on, Amy pretended to be Robin and stepped neatly into her new life. Amy suddenly had more than she'd ever dreamed possible.Amy, of course, feels guilty for assuming Robin's life, but who could it ever hurt? Then there is Paul, Robin's older brother ... the man she still loves.***** An awesome novel that will capture your attention quickly and easily! I could not help but wonder how many of us would have grabbed the chance for a better life when it was offered to us on a silver platter, as it was for Amy. But the lives of the famous are not all that grand. In fact, author Carole Bellacera did a pretty good job showing how fake it could all be. (Personally, I would find fame to be a prison and not something to strive for.) The author also did an incredible job at showing the conflicts of emotion Amy goes through. Very well done! Highly recommended! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"I feel this time around Carol Bellacera has dug deep to find something that every person who has felt they have lived an unhappy life can relate to.

You will cheer for both characters and you are almost to the brink of tears once you read the epiloge."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"After reading EAST OF THE SUN, WEST OF THE MOON by Bellacera, I found every other book she'd written and read them all. And now she's actually topped herself with UNDERSTUDY! This is a great writer who pens can't-put-down books! You'll be hooked from the Prologue to the last page. There's one word for this book - WOW!"},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"No one can deny that Robin is different after the car wreck that shattered her face and took her best friend, Amy's life. Before the wreck, the wealthy young beauty was well on her way to becoming a drunken tramp. After much surgery, she is able to return to life with her looks restored, and an apparent new depth to her character.The reason for the change is one that only Robin knows. She is not Robin. The wreck was so damaging that the two girls could not be told apart, and it was assumed that Robin lived and Amy died. But that is not what occurred. Now, Amy is trapped in a lie, one she is only too glad to live. Being Robin gives her a family and wealth. It paves the way for her to become a successful soap actress and marry her handsome leading man. There is only one drawback. She is in love with the man who the world believes is her brother. As the years pass, the lie eats at her, and Paul, the only man she has ever been in love with, is haunted by the memory of the sweet girl with whom he shared a brief moment of true love.Then, terrible secrets emerge that open the door to the whole truth. As Amy's heart hangs in the balance, will Paul be able to forgive her for all the years of untruth?***** This novel takes on a topic that shows the dark side of one of the ultimate fantasies, living someone else's life. Ms. Bellacera fearless takes on taboos that will shock readers. Even though Amy's lies are wrong, one can not help but feel sorry for the mess she creates for herself. *****Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"I enjoyed this.Two girls friend each other and become as inseparable as real life sisters. Robin, the extrovert rich kid with a family secret, takes Amy, the sweet innocent, firmly under her wing.Amy falls for Robin's brother but he is betrothed to another; and here begins the romantic thread of the novel, the springboard for some great plot twists caused by the complications of this relationship, which in turn carries the whole story hurtling towards the denouement.But I am rushing ahead! So... we get to that point where all seems well and then a devastating car accident turns everything upside down.A negative point now which won't go away. I did struggle with the change of identity between the two girls and how easily this was accepted by the people who knew them both intimately; and all down to a clever plastic surgeon! Amy also managed to step into her \`sisters' shoes and take up her acting career with amazing success. I did have to suspend belief quite a lot in this area, but once I'd got past that in my head (it is fiction after all) I was lured along by the pace of the plot and how the romance between Amy and her \`brother' would pan out. Did she come clean and risk the fallout of her deception, or did she stay locked in the false world she'd created for herself and simply deny herself a chance of being with Paul?The style reminded me very much of Jackie Collins; the rich American family background, plenty of explicit sex and strong language, oh and a slightly larger than life plot.Very readable; although the pictures, the highlighters and the explanation of words, was not needed."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"I have to say that I was sadly disappointed with the book. I am an aspiring writer and bought the book because of my mentor. The story has a good plot and I am familiar with Richmond and Williamsburg in Virginia, which is the setting for the book. But a part of the way into the book I had to stop reading. The scenes and words were trashy and extremely sexual. I thought to myself, if this is what it takes to be a writer, then I am not a writer. I tore the book up and threw it away. If it had been written without all the extremely sexual details, it would still be a great story, but as it is, it was not for me."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"The plot of this novel is pure soap opera escapism. Amy had a deprived childhood, with an alcoholic father who committed suicide and an alcoholic mother who ended up catatonic. When she met Robin Mulcahey on their first day at college, the two girls became best friends in spite of the fact that they're as different as night and day. Well, except for their appearances. Physically, they could be sisters. Amy falls in love with the seeming perfection of the Mulcahey family, including falling head over heels in love with Robin's older brother Paul. A terrible crash kills Robin and leaves Amy unrecognizable, but when the Mulcahey family mistakes her for their daughter, Amy decides to go along with the charade and take over Robin's identity. She can't bring herself to hurt them by telling the truth.The contrivances in the story, combined with the taboo feel of the romance (although there is no actual taboo), makes it feel like something I would have read in high school. What saves it from being just a pulp novel is the sympathy the reader garners for Amy. Bellacera's smooth prose and top notch characterization of her two female leads takes the edge off what could be considered a trashy romance. You want Amy to be happy, so you go along with some of the over-the-top-ness of the plotline. The last fourth of the book just whips by.I'm not so sure I'm keen on the story's structure. The vast majority of the book is told in flashback format. The prologue is the accident, and then the entire first part of the book details how the two girls met and everything that led up to the accident. It's done again in smaller sections throughout the rest of the story, too, and it takes some of the suspense out of it as a whole.But the author's easy prose and strong characterization make up for it. I ended up devouring it, though I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Understudy","review":"Wow!!!! Excellent book!!!! I am an avid reader and I picked this up never having heard of Carole Bellacera and am I ever glad I did!!!!

We're reminded that Jesus told his followers that not even a sparrow falls to the ground apart from the Father's will and that we are much more significant than birds. Sanders points out that we one of us has unique giftings from God. On the next page he adds, &quot;The circumstances surrounding our lives are not accidental&quot; but are devised by God the Father. He tells us the circumstances are not just to guide us in terms of process, but to increase our knowledge of God Himself. Expect obstacles, he warns. These come for two reasons: to develop our faith and so that our character might be strengthened (p. 13). An element of mystery is included in the process of walking in God's guidance. Proverbs 3:5 is quoted. &quot;The disposition of events is not in our hands, but in God's&quot; Sanders reminds us on page 19. This book is a powerful tool of encouragement for Christians.

Watson's tale importantly serves to humanise science by humanising scientists. He paves the way for a now-large literature."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson's account of his and Crick's race to determine the structure of DNA is very exciting. Very little technical information makes it accessible for the non-scientist. The Double Helix is very quick reading, and is one of the most captivating books I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"After reading this, I really have to wonder about the value of awarding prizes in science when most (all?) discoveries build on previous discoveries. Does science need competition to advance? Watson did seem fueled by a competitive desire to be first to discover the structure of DNA. However, his ethics seemed questionable and as other reviewers mentioned, he basically stole Rosalind Franklin's data and work. I would like to read a more objective third-person account of the \\"discovery\\" of the DNA structure.Having said that, this book provided a moderately interesting account of the time and the personalities involved, and it gave me some insight into scientific collaboration and in-fighting. I did not understand the science so I skipped quickly through those parts. I never got too involved in the drama and did not get any deep insight from this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Science and I have never been on a level playing field. We go together like jalapenos and cheesecake. When the opportunity arose to do extra credit for my biology class, I was ecstatic. That is until I found out exactly what the assignment was. I had to read a book, a scientific one of course, from a list compiled by my instructor, write a review, and post it on here on Amazon. If I wasn't so desperate for the extra points I would have torn that book list into a million pieces, but describing my need for an A as desperate would be an understatement. Naturally, I chose the book with the least amount of pages, James Watson's Double Helix. The title alone made me drowsy. I was in for a big surprise, though. I actually enjoyed the book and even learned a little bit in the process. The story was extremely well told and I found myself eagerly awaiting the answer to Mr. Watson's burning question, \\"What does DNA look like?\\"James Watson was en exceptionally intelligent man, as was clearly demonstrated in his book by his eloquent writing style, extensive vocabulary, and impressive syntax. He was, however, not an intimidating scientist, which allowed me to relate to his story with ease. Watson was full of ideas, a quick study, and very receptive to the work of his superiors, but at the time of his brilliant discovery, he was merely a student, fighting to get funded for his research. He had studied biology, chemistry, and physics, but was not particularly fond of any of them. Unfortunately, Mr. Watson was at a disadvantage because all three disciplines were the building blocks for understanding the composition and structure of DNA.Although James Watson was funded to research viruses while away in England, his immediate fascination with DNA quickly derailed his educational focus, and with several incorrect theories about DNA already spread, he was unquestionably discouraged from his desired area of study. The entire book boasted his bliss and reverence, having met and worked with some of the worlds most famous and respected scientists. Watson was clever enough to draw knowledge from each of them which assisted him throughout the stages of the project.The best part about reading the book was that while I was devouring my literature, my Biology professor was covering DNA and genetics in class. I felt like the smartest kid in the world because I truly understood all the material he was discussing, thanks to Mr. Watson. The novel included supportive illustrations which assisted me in following some of the more difficult language, such as nitrogenous bases, and phosphate groups. I was astounded to know that I had a firm grasp of a minute portion of the scientific world.I thought the book was great primarily because I could understand it. While it may sound facetious, it's absolutely true. Unless you love science, the terminology involved sounds completely foreign. I was utterly terrified just thinking about how I was going to attempt to comprehend my newfound author. My fright was quickly put to ease as I turned each page. Initially I was dreading reading a few pages per night, and soon found myself reading five chapters a night and finished the book, in its entirety, within just a few days. I would undeniably recommend this book to anyone like me who feels inferior when it comes to the sciences. It is a superb account of a scientific breakthrough intertwined with a story of friendship, inspiration, competition, and triumph."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I found this book to read much more like a soap opera than a true scientific account. I think that it was this tendency that kept the pages turning. ALthough this was required class reading, it was a fast read, especially in comparison to some of the sleep-inducing journal accounts out there."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix, A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA, is a great book, which I would highly recommend. Written by James D. Watson, it is a novel about the adventures and struggles James Watson and Francis Crick went through to finally discover the double helix structure. The book is very well written and you can never put the book down. The subject is so informative and interesting that you can't help but keep flipping through the pages. This was such an amazing discovery, which makes the book that much better to read. Watson is great at thoroughly explaining the challenges they went through. They fail many times, like all scientists sometimes do, but it all paid off in the end. He tells the story very well, and explains the different encounters he had with many different scientists. He talks about his times working with Crick in the Cavendish laboratory, and what they went through to finally discover DNA. Watson writes a lot about the scientific part of his discovery, but also writes about the adventures and vacations he went on, which make the story that much more interesting. The novel also has pictures in it, which I love. They help me follow the plot of the story, and help me form an image in my head of what he is talking about. Some of the images are also diagrams that are labeled to help you understand the scientific part of the book. I would recommend this novel to anyone, even if you are not interested in science or DNA very much. The book is well written and gives a great story of how one of the best discoveries of all time was made."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix presents the narrow of window in time (1953-1954) just prior to solving the DNA structure when molecular biology was still a new field. I enjoyed Watson's book, particularly his concise perspective on the event leading up to their triumphant discovery. It was interesting to learn that the majority of scientist at the time were largely unaware that DNA was the \\"transforming principle\\". As this book points out- although the discovery of the DNA molecular structure was credited to James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick, the quest to elucidate the structure of DNA was many years in the making and accomplished through the efforts of many devoted scientist. I read the Norton Critical Edition of the Double Helix that was edited by Gunther S. Stent. This edition includes a series of photos, notes, and a great introduction by along with 13 reprinted reviews by a number of scientific minds that offer views on James D. Watson and commentary on the ethics of scientific discovery. As many reviewers have pointed out, this book is the perspective of one tenacious mind and should not be considered in light of other historical narratives that are available in print. I agree with the reviewers included in the book that the Double Helix will remain a literary achievement apart from its scientific merits. Prior to reading the Double Helix I was vaguely aware of Rosalind Franklin's x-ray work with Maurice Wilkins; however it was only after reading this book that I realized how important x-ray crystallography was to the discovery of the DNA structure and how underappreciated Dr. Franklin's efforts were. I am eager to read Maurice Wilkins book (The Third Man of the Double Helix: The Autobiography of Maurice Wilkins) and at least one of the books dedicated to the contributions Dr. Franklin (Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA&Rosalind Franklin and DNA). Overall, I recommend this book to emerging scientists and self-confessed DNA addicts- the Double Helix is a great piece of literature that illustrates the excitement of discovery and the people who defined molecular biology."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recently read this book for my undergraduate genetics class. Out of all the required reading that I have had to do in the sciences, this was by far my favorite. Watson is quick, funny, and tells a compelling story. Watson is somewhat biased (aren't we all) but he tells a fairly objective story from HIS point of view. I loved the way the book kept me on the edge of my seat and thus I read it very quickly. For those of you who are not science people, this book will not \\"go over your head\\". This book describes a critical discovery that influences us all today. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"James D. Watson bares all in The Double Helix, whether he attempts to or not. Though Watson attempts to hide the fact that he and Francis Crick stole the discovery that the double helix is the structure of DNA from colleague Rosalind Franklin, he instead shows that they did while loosely trying to disguise it. In the process Watson shows himself to be a misogynous, spending more time talking about how Ms. Franklin could look more attractive with a different style than discussing her work. Essentially, Watson created a heck of an interesting read, maybe not what the general science buff is looking for. A perfect read for the critical history of science student."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I remember upon first reading The Double Helix I was delighted with the fact that Watson was a slacker and still managed to make one of the most important discoveries in biology. There was hope for me too! It is a pleasure to read a book about scientific discovery where the researchers are not mercilessly driven type-A personalities confined to their labs. A well-written account of the personalities and community behind a major scientific discovery, of the molding of disparate facts into a new theory that changed the field."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I began this book with some trepidation. I am not a science scholar by any means, so I wasn't sure how much of the book I would understand. And true, I didn't grasp a lot of the scientific explanations, but what I found interesting, and humorous, was the description of the many characters and their personality traits. They could all be right out of the TV show \\"The Big Bang Theory.\\" The book is a quick read, as long as you don't get bogged down in the science, and interesting to discover the workings and social interactions of the scientists involved in their quest to discovery DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"What a great book! I totally understand how the structure of DNA was formed and loved the journey getting there! This book was assigned for a class I had, but it was very enjoyable to read. Some of the science is difficult to understand if you don't know much about chemistry and how different molecular structures are laid out, but the big picture can still be understood."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"One of the best books I have read, and it is fascinating to hear from the discoverer on perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, discoveries in the scientific arena. The discovery of the structure of the DNA is an important milestone in the annals of science and to get such a fascinating writeup from James D Watson is just fantastic. In a research environment, there is always stress, and to understand the frustrations and self-doubts lingering in these great minds just serve an important reminder that at the end of the day, the human element plays a vital cog in shaping your life.This book is such a fast paced read that you can finish it in one setting, and the best part is, you are not reading some kind of a fiction. These are true events, these are events that have shaped mankind's though process towards life. It was interesting to read what went through the minds of Francis Crick, James Watson, Maurice Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and many others when they were on the cusp of something so life changing. I've always though that Linus always referred to Linus Torvalds, but then got to know that there is another genius who goes by the same first name, Linus Pauling. I really liked the way Watson discusses about Rosalind. Initially, she comes across as haughty and arrogant, but finally, Watson realizes how wrong they were to have judged her like that and has very good things to say about her academic accomplishments. In a way, it is very interesting to note how science was a male dominated affair and the women folk could never invoke the same respect compared to their male counterparts.Anyway, it's a great first account and makes for stupendous reading. It's totally a must read for people who realize the importance of this life changing moment in science and history. If only, research is conducted the same way today as it was in those days. Today, driven by the need for quick results and profit, the whole face of research has turned out to be an ultra-fast, competitive and result oriented slug-fest."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"A reference with intersting insights to the challenges individual researchers face in pursuing their \\"out of the box\\" hypotheses. Illustrates how pursuing new ideas within established research institutions can land on deaf ears and how research scientists may need to pursue their own interests while being supported financially with grants for other approved research projects."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is both entertaining and informative. It probably is not a perfectly balanced view of the events however. Watson writes at length about parties, pleasure trips and the like and one gets the impression that 1960s Cambridge was merely a great party place. Obviously Watson and Crick spent hours doing some of the most significant scientific work of the century but the reader doesn't get much feel for how much of the time was spent on science instead of the parties."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I listened to this audiobook that I borrowed from my library. I love genetics but have very little reading time at this point in my life - so I wandered to the library in search of audiobooks.I don't recall the name of the individual who read the book - but he did an excellent job and was completely unobtrusive.The book itself would have been a very dry read and may have taken me weeks to finish had I not listened to the audiobook version. As it was I was done in two days and completely enjoyed it.This book is told from Watson's (of Watson and Crick fame) perspective on the discovery of the structural nature of DNA. There were several scientists all working toward the discovery sometimes together and many times opposing. This book is told in a rather personal set of remembrances. His feelings of the other scientists and their decisions are very human - at times frustrated, at times annoyed, and at other times filled with respect and honor. The excitement at the science and the discovery comes through and following the piece by piece uncovering of the truth engages the listener from beginning to end. In addition you get the underlying feeling that you are starting to know these different scientists through Watson's eyes.Because it is written by a scientist much of the writing is dry which is why I am so glad that I listened to the audio version of this book. For those that are scientifically minded or interested in Genetics this is a must read. I advise the audiobook version."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book was required for one of my college courses, which is the only reason that I finished it. Parts of the book were interesting, but it was hard to follow. Also, Watson has the very dry humor of a British scientist, despite the fact that he is an America. All in all, I did not enjoy reading it, but someone who is thrilled by DNA might be interested in it."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This was a great book sold by a great seller. The book was in great condition, I got it in a timely manner, and the value was perfect. Thank you for a great buy! I highly recommend this seller!"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This is how science should be taught in schools - through real stories, of real individuals, with all pitfalls of egos, politics, and everything in between. This is both an amusing and an educational account, from the perspective of James D. Watson, of their race towards the discovery of DNA. What is remarkable and refreshing is that for once we see the real process of discovery, which takes numerous dark alleys, backtracks, breakthroughs, and a healthy doze of paranoia about \\"who will get there first\\". Every student should read this book, if for nothing else but to dispel the myth of the \\"genius innovator\\" on an uninterrupted path towards the next big discovery.Not being familiar with the field or the terminology I am sure I missed some of the more subtle points and jokes, but it was nonetheless a great an educational read. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I wish I knew a little more about nucleotides, purine, backbone and so on; not knowing or remembering any of that, I couldn't enjoy the book the way I would've liked - to genuinely enjoy this book you would need to understand the basics of the science discussed here. Yeah, I did enjoy the details of the various personailities, the gossip and the humor, though, that won't make up for the excitement one gets when the main puzzle is unravelled.This is Dr Watson's story, the way he saw it and it's fairly evident that Rosalind and Maurice would've seen it pretty differently. Planning to get hold of Maurice's book to get his perspective on the race."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This is a racy &amp; insouciant account of the months leading up to the deciphering of the structure of DNA ____an intellectual achievement on par with Relativity ,Quantum mechanics ,the theory of evolution and psychoanalysis .Watson is as incapable of being pedantic as he is of being dull ."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I am an undergradudate student dreaming of a biologist. I think this book is very helpful to pre-scientists as well as lay people, for it shows failures and disappointments hidden behind a 'great discovery' together with how they are treated and overcome. I was also impressed by the scientific passion represented vividly in this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The race to discover the double - helix structure of the 'molecule of life' is the subject of this book. James Watson who was then a twenty- four year old visiting American scientist worked with the team of the British Francis Crick , and this team succeeded in beating the Linus Pauling team to the discovery. There are of course many ' doubles' in the history of science, perhaps most famously Newton- Leibniz invention of the differential calculus, and Darwin- Wallace's discovery of evolution through natural selection. But the ' double ' here was avoided in part by Crick- Watson's fierce competitiveness, and making use without permission of the work of another .(Rosalind Franklin) In other words the story here is valuable in being a realistic ( if incomplete) story of how this monumental discovery was actually made. But it makes in a way the whole process seem if not less exciting, than less emotionally and spiritually satisfactory than one would like in regard to a discovery of such great importance. Compare the kind of wheeling and dealing done by Crick and Watson with Wilkins in filching the Franklin work, with the very different spectacle of Einstein alone through thought- experiments wholly transforming the way we see the world.I also to tell the truth did not find the Watson who tells the tale a particularly likeable character, and Crick even less so.This book however does give a real sense of how scientific work is often done, and does in its best moments provide a sense of the excitement of great discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"It has been mentioned by reviewers that Dr. R Franklin's contribution goes unappreciated. Of course she had died of cancer when Watson and Crick et. al. received the Nobel Prize; otherwise she would have been included, as she deserved. That aside, the principal value of young people's reading this book, aside from a passing familiarity with a key discovery of modern times, is the way Watson and Crick interacted to get to the truth. Each would attack the arguments of the other- not in the tricky sort of way one associates with TV lawyers, but pointing out the limits of the other's arguments and contradictions with established principles of chemistry and physics. It is somewhat akin to Talmudic argument. It has a good deal owed to the logic of Aristotle and the thought processof thesis, antithesis, synthesis repeated over and over developed by Hegal. The book provides enough insight to be of value without such technical detail that would take it out of the range of an average reader."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Even though I read this book for my college Biology class, I wanted to tell readers that there isn't a need to have a strong biology background to enjoy this book. At first, one may be hesitant because a Nobel Prize winner wrote this book, and may be full of complicated scientific jargon. However, this isn't the case and is really enjoyable to see the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; discovery of DNA. This was a very fast reading and interesting book; I think it should be a must for anyone wanting to further their education in science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The discovery of the structure of DNA was a monumental leap forward for the world of science. Whether or not you are looking to forward you studies in this area, I recommend opening this book. Watson provides a vibrantly colorful description of the exciting race to find a solution. A biography, the Double Helix adds a hint of humanism to a scientific search. His writing is fresh and direct, without any hesitation to state what he feels. Apart from being highly informative, it is an exciting retelling of the research process. Upon reading the novel, however aware you are that Watson and Crick will be receiving Nobel Prize for their discovery, you are still caught up in the chase.A discovery of such epic size could not have been achieved by two scientists alone. Watson delves into descriptions of the scientists who provided essential pieces of information. Over the course of the novel we are introduced to Maurice Wilkins, who would be awarded the Nobel Prize along side Watson and Crick in 1962. Rosalind Franklin is depicted, giving her an undersized portion of recognition she deserved, as without her work with radiation Watson and Crick would have never gotten any where.It is fascinating to hear the overlooked aspects of what happens on the path to discovery. When we are introduced to Watson he is an unfocused American graduate studying physics, who on account of sheer luck stumbles across bio chemistry and his future boastful partner Francis Crick.In the Double Helix, Watson does more than merely recount the steps of his discovery. Here, is a very human story about an important scientific endeavor. You travel with Watson as he tastes wine and debates politics; a reminder that science is also a part of everyday life. Therefore, it is a narrative that holds appeal for all people with all levels of interest in science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"** The Double Helix was read as the December selection for our book club. **I marginally enjoyed reading The Double Helix simply because I never would have read it had it not been a selection by my book club. I enjoyed the perspective, and did find the final chapters engaging as the final pieces of the DNA puzzle were discovered. The book as a whole, however, was quite difficult to get through with feigned interest. Watson recounts the experience by pulling from personal letters and his journal, and it is quite obvious to the reader throughout. The writing style and quality is subpar, and he certainly focuses on aspects of the experience that I doubt many readers care about.The book itself is not horrible, and this first hand account certainly carries value, but it isn't something I would recommend to anyone other than those with a very keen desire to understand the discovery of the structure of DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I found this somewhat interesting, but it got into some 'history' that I didn't care that much about.

I read it about 30 years ago. The book is insightful to the world of research and discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"As a science teacher it is horrifying to me that anyone is being required to read this self-serving piece of fiction for a science class. (Unless perhaps as a negative example of deplorable ethics.) Watson's account of the discovery of the structure of the DNA helix is so fraught with falsehoods that it could at best only be called historical fiction. His need to vilify and degrade Rosalind Franklin (whose essential (and stolen) work he used) can hardly be something that is admirable. For a factual account of events read Rosalind Franklin &amp; DNA by Anne Sayre instead. No, it will not be an easy read, but you will certainly get a different view and it is backed up with facts and dates."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I thought it would be an extended version and up to date of the original book containing recent achievements in this rapidly growing field.

The model is correct but did not deliver the source to life as advertised."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"James Watson and Francis Crick were both brillian scientists, there is no doubt about that. Although they are given more credit than they are due, they did make a monumental discovery. Rosalind Franklin first interprete the B form of DNA as having a helical structure, and later, in a private, unpublished notebook, as having &quot;interchangability.&quot; Although Rosalind Franklin contributed equally to the discovery of DNA, Watson and Crick made the final, crucial step. However, Watson's portrayal of Rosalind Franklin as &quot;Rosy&quot; is inaccurate an inexcusable. Even Maurice Wilkins, another scientist involved with the discovery of DNA and was honored with the Nobel Prize, states this clearly. Although the personality clashes between Wilkins and Franklin caused a lack of communication which may have ultimately impeded the discovery, he says, referring to a ridulous Double Helix passage in which &quot;Rosy&quot; nearly physically attacks Watson, &quot;Jim wrote a novel.&quot; I advise any readers of this book to be wary of such departures from the truth, and to read Rosalind Franklin and DNA (widely recognized among educated readers as the clear and balanced account of the discovery of the structure of DNA.)"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"In my 5th attempt to read this book (err rather start it) as required reading for a class, I immediately noticed typos as well as the author's inability to refer to all of the \\"characters\\" by one name; instead going back and forth between their first names or last - after a while making it very confusing with all of the Watson's, Wilkins, etc....as to who was who. Now I'll have to assemble a character sheet because this otherwise brilliant man completely missed that we as the reader are not going to have an easy time remembering the names of EVERYONE he mentions, let alone properly pairing their first & last correctly. Ps - as a woman in science his references to \\"Rosy\\" are typical, sexist, debasing, etc...She was a feminist who's fellow colleagues thought she'd be better off if she'd doll it up and be less opinionated. Right, because we should just all be - quiet and pretty. If it weren't required, I wouldn't have bothered reading this man's \\"interpretation\\" of the events as they transpired. I question his co-worker ethics. Yeah, it was the time, place and culture to pitch a hard working gal (trying to be one of the guys) under the bus. But did he have to go as far as taking full credit for her work too?"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Prof. Watson tells us his story of the discovery of the DNA structure, a crucial scientific break-through.It is more or less a race between the US (Linus Pauling) and the UK (the duo Crick/Watson).The reader should have a decent chemical background for a full appreciation of the problems involved, for instance, the crucially important discovery of the ketone function.This book gives also a good picture of the working and living conditions, the character clashes, the calm atmosphere and the closeness at the English top universities in the fifties of last century.A worth-while read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Although The Double Helix by James D. Watson is not the most riveting-can't-put-it-down book, it does offer a fascinating first-hand account of the events leading up to one of the most impacting scientific discoveries ever. Its manifestation of the unique existence of a scientist exposes what type of competitions, manipulation, and discovery exist in the science arena.The introduction of other key figures who played prominent and influential roles in the discovery of the DNA structure is at the very least, enlightening. The network of knowledge necessary to ensure there are no foibles in a key discovery is something that the general public may have never taken into account. Also, it evinces the professional barriers that exist between the genders. The back story of Rosalind \\"Rosie\\" Franklin is fascinating as it examines the \\"glass ceiling\\" and what type of personality a woman needs to adopt in order to survive in a male dominated field. The end of the end of the book-where Watson realizes her seemingly callous attitude emanates from her essential need to incorporate survival methods is refreshing. The science terms are difficult to follow if one does not have previous scientific background, but there is enough universality imbedded into the story to keep a reader's attention.Another aspect that proves to be surprising is the fact that scientists are not without their weak fields-just because they excel in chemistry does not mean they are equally capable in biology. Reading of how Watson and Crick were unsuccessful on several occasions somehow made them human-like they were mortals rather than some higher power intellectuals. Somehow, there seems to be an idea or stigma attached to scientists that suggest they are always brilliant and do not make mistakes. This book sheds that concept.Watson and Crick needed to do research, work hard, and learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish their objective. They even needed help from their friends. They beat out a great scientist in Linus and won the \\"DNA Race.\\" Their discovery has changed the world, and this book depicts them in a humble role-two guys doing their job."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"As a young woman in the still male-dominated world of science and technology, this book was utterly disappointing. Unfortunately, it is an easy read and proposes to be fact, misinforming its millions of readers as to what really went on behind the scenes of the lab. If you read this book, I suggest you immediately read Anne Sayre's &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA.&quot; If you are a woman reading this book, then that doubly holds true.Watson's portrayal of the one woman involved in this great discovery is not only biased, but pure fiction. It is unexcusable. Franklin was responsible for much of the research that led to Watson and Crick's discovery of the structure of DNA, a discovery which gained them and Wilkins the Nobel Prize. Not only did Watson and Crick use her findings without her knowledge or consent, but did not even give her the proper credit for it.For a great scientist to make a statement such as &quot;the best place for a feminist is in another person's lab&quot; is horrific. A step backwards for any woman attempting to make a name for herself as a serious scientist. That this book has been so widely read and acclaimed makes it even worse."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Edgar Allan Poe once said \\"I intend to put up with nothing that I can put down\\". The Double Helix, frankly, is not a book to put down, but that is only if you can put up with the stale depictions of the scientific endeavors that occured in the Cavendish Laboratory, conveyed in an all but enthralling manner. The non-fiction novel is basic and rather tasteless. Expect no enticing extravaganzas with this, but more of a dull, yet informative tale portraying the discovery of DNA. appealing, yes, but that is to the bare handful. One with scientific interest, impressed by marvelous scientific discoveries and realizations such as man's exploration with space per say, might be impressed with what James Watson's Double Helix piece has to offer. What do you get from this book? If you're biology-savvy and possibly a history buff, this book might be worth giving a try. If you're the common man-or woman-who tends to enjoy J.K. rowling's Harry Potter series, Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, or are on the intellectual side and prefer Steinbeck, Capote, or Miller, this would be as desirable of a pick-up as a rich, medium rare steak for a five year vegan. Nonetheless, a science and literature lover might enjoy this book greatly. The goal of this brief review is not to inform you on all the events that occured-such as the disputes between the protagonists, possible sexism, the detailed location, and magnificent discoveries-but to inform you if this is the right pick-up for you. As aforementioned, this is for the science buffs, not the common person. This day and age, with technology at an all time high, there is no reason I can think of for someone to want to invest time towards a novel with such a researchable storyline. I personally felt the book was an informative read, something to read in school if mandated, not on spare time. I can't think of any event in the book that I'd say was my favorite part. I assume, with all the scientific marvels in the universe-there are more fascinating scientific reads out there, and I will leave it at that."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"QUICK REVIEWThis book is a semi-interesting, semi-enjoyable story of the research and path of discovery of the scientists who figured out the structure of DNA.FULL REVIEWFor the reader to really enjoy this book, he/she needs to already know some things about DNA prior to reading it. So in that sense, that is one of the book's weaknesses. However, someone who does not know anything about DNA probably wouldn't be interested in it in the first place. So the problem kind of takes care of itself. The book, though, can still easily go over the reader's head in parts. The author does not try to walk the reader through the understanding of the research that went on, and thus the reader can get lost in the specifics and the jargon. However, that is not what the author is interested in doing anyway. He wants us to see the personalities and the human side of the story rather than the scientific details. In this he succeeds. The story could have been dry, but it keeps your attention by making you interested in the people involved and the dynamics of those people behind the discovery. It is a good book that may or may not engross some people, but the reader can't help but get caught up in the excitement when they close in on the final discovery, knowing that they will receive the Nobel Prize and what it means to the biological world. It is a good book but not a great book, and will probably be enjoyed by any reader who is interested in the topic."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This Book is very cheap and very interesting!

Crossreference this book with Gleick's book \\"Genius\\". Wherein we read that in1967 Watson comes begging Feynman for his \\"seal of approval\\" at some social event at The University of Chicago. Feynman relented and said something like \\"yes that's how things can get discovered....in crazy ways....\\"Well, I finished it. Took me only three days to read it which for me is a record.And at first I was thinking, \\"well here we go again another book on DNA\\" but toward the end of the book ( about two thirds I think ) I began to start cheering in my mind with \\"C'mon Crick!...C'mon Watson..\\" then I got to the end of the book...and then for some reason everybody \\"ran away\\". ( please see A below )(Of course all throughout the book one gets the impression that this \\"Quest for The Holy Grail\\" was just a \\"student romp\\" that somehow it was just serendipity. Of course that's what really makes the book. The idea that these two young \\"college boys\\" with a \\"Devil may care\\" attitude could pull of this great discovery like it was simply \\"a day at the tennis courts\\". And in that way it reads like a double O spy thriller. But that's not how it really was. DNA was promised to Cambridge and King's College by people much higher up. Watson was along for the ride as part of the American contingent in and \\"Anglo-American deal\\" since DNA was really something that was captured from Germany after WW2 and there's every reason to believe that the Germans in fact already knew the structure of DNA years before the Americans and British. There was no \\"intellectual freedom\\" happening here. Never on a deal this big. And even on smaller \\"scientific deals\\" you wouldn't get too much sympathy for being a \\"cavalier\\" James Bond like Watson makes himself out to be. The research team leaders won't allow it....because they're usually afraid of governments taking away their research grants. )( A ) Thats right. All the key players suddenly took off and abandoned their \\"hard won effort\\" DNA. They magically stopped \\"working\\" on it. At least that was the impression I got. Here they were saying \\" we solved the secret of life\\" now \\"we're going to walk away\\". ( \\"Walked away?\\" you ask, sure \\"where's the cure for cancer?\\" I reply. If you've solved the structure for DNA the cure for cancer is starring you in the face!) I wasn't exactly surprised but then let me see if I can explain it to you.Oh where did those magical optimistic years of the 1960's go.....?Yeah well governments do that.When you own the \\"discoverer you own the discovery\\".Look at it this way. Why is it that if in fact \\"The Secret of Life\\" was figured out as was stated in the book that whenever any one of these Nobel Laureates gets some kind of nasty disease that they.........well you know........they follow the crowd down to the local...you know where .......and opt for the same.... you know what treatment as everyone else.....but don't they understand a molecule better than everyone else?.....certainly better than the \\"experts\\" they go to....why are these Nobel Laureates listening to those guys????So I wanna know....and .....so should you.sjwI mean isn't that why they get the prize in the first place?"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I was initially daunted by the very subject of this book. My girlfriend lent it to me and I wasn't sure I would enjoy it as much as she had--she's a molecular biologist and I'm a historian. Having helped her in a lab once or twice, I was well aware that genetic science was far beyond anything I could remember from seventh grade.But The Double Helix was no problem. Some have called Watson's tone condescending--I, for one, am glad he talked down in his book, because dealing with DNA on a lower level is the only way I could ever approach it. And it's to Watson's great credit that he not only helped discover the double helix, but can write about it in mostly layman's terms and make the story understandable.The most fascinating thing about the book, for me, was the nature of the research and the scientists themselves. Most of my life I've thought of scientists with the subconscious imagery of Frankenstein in my head. Here, Watson gives us a mostly genial but very often competitive world of collaborators and laid-back geniuses. Not at all what I was expecting, but very good reading.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"-- Interesting book about how the structure of DNA was discovered. Describes the whole process very well without getting too deep in the science. The narrative does justice to a dramatic sequence of events.-- Maybe Watson is being modest, but, it seems like he didn't do much in discovering the structure. He was just there discussing things with Crick and others.-- Linus Pauling was subjected to harrasment by Sen. McCarthy. He was denied a passport to travel internationally to attend a meeting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"In the dilapidated and torn down laboratory known as the \\"Cavendish\\" of Cambridge University, two scientists James D. Watson and Francis Crick work in unison to discover the structure of DNA. As they work jointly to piece together information about the double helix, they also have competition against the admired and better known Linus Pauling. At the same time, what is enjoyable about this book, is that everybody works in a cooperative manner, as they all have different abilities in the field and knowledge, in order to come to a final conclusion. The success of Watson and Crick came from the many different individuals with different experiences in science. Yet at the same time, the fact that it is a competition to discover the mystery of the structure of DNA titillates the reader. Although from the cover, this book seems very unapproachable, not because of its size, but because of its science nature, one would think that the jargons used in this book would be quite difficult. Rather, this book does not take much technical qualifications to understand, and as a matter of fact, it is quite easy to comprehend. What is positive about this book is the humor, and clever wit that takes place. An example would be on the bottom of page 68, \\"After Pauling's success, no one could claim that faith in helices implied anything but an uncomplicated brain.\\" The Double Helix is an excellent book to read, with great illustrations of models, pictures of certain individuals, and x-rays of DNA, making the moment of discovery in this book vibrant and dynamic."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I didn't like this book at all, even though I'm very interested in the subject area. I think (judging by this book) James D. Watson is not a very good writer in general, and not very good popularizer of scientific ideas in particular.The book is full of irrelevant details, mostly biographical, but they'd be irrelevant in a well-written biography as well. For some reason the author gives a lot of details of his personal life, which to my view have nothing to do with his work on DNA structure. This is also the case with other people's lives Watson describes in his book.Another serious problem with this book for me - I think the author completely failed to show importance of DNA structure discovery for biology, even though he says that it's of high importance a number of times throughout the text. He just fails to substantiate his claim.Watson's discourse seems to be more on the chemical side of his and Crick's discovery, but even here he is far from being clear and concise as one would expect from a popular book written by a Nobel prize winner.After reading this book, one is left wondering if they came to their discovery by pure chance, prompted by Paulings's and other people work, tweaking here and there rather than following some broader picture, vision they had when starting their search of DNA structure.Finally, the quality of Watson's writing is not that high to my taste, comparing with other scientists. One example which immediately comes to mind is Erwin Schroedinger."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"\\"The Double Helix\\" is Watson's scattered memory of how he and Crick discovered the structure of DNA, along with other significant figures who were involved. Self-absorbed, biased, and disorganized as it is, Watson frankly revealed what scientists are like behind the honorable mask they put on for the masses.The truth that Watson is a bad writer does not take away all the attractions of the book, fortunately. Some occasions Watson dwelled on seemed to have no relationship with the DNA discovery at all. Moreover, his prejudice against Rosalind Franklin is extremely annoying. Still, Watson and Crick's story is generally fun to read, and it was somewhat entertaining to see what evil schemes they used to rise to prominence.Despite to all the turmoil and controversy Watson invited when the book was first published, it has become a modern classic out of most people's expectation. Remarkably, Watson revealed scientists' real intention to do researches- for fame and profit rather than having the sacred wish to improve human life. Scientists are, after all, human, so they party, compete and do extremities in order to achieve their goal. Watson, in particular, is probably among the most notorious to have written this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is a personal account from one of the discovers of the DNA structure. I read it because I was interested in how scientific discoveries are made.It's a good book. I like it because it illustrates how intense the competition is in research, and also gave me some ideas in how to do research.Some ideas I got from the book are:1. I must have a good sense of what's important. In the book, Watson and Crick were very sure that DNA is the important pursuit, whereas many others didn't realize that.2. I needs to be very confident in my own judgements. In the book, Watson went against his home institution (where his grant was coming from) and left wherever he was and went to Cambridge, because he had no interest and saw no big developments in what he was told to do.If you are a student, and are interested in going into research, you should read this book (it's quite short). It might give you just the right ideas of what personal traits are needed in a good researcher. I suspect little has changed since in academia since the discovery of the DNA structure."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"For those who are interested in a future with genetics, reading The Double Helix, by James Watson, is highly recommended.

The reader follows Watson and Crick, step by step, through the discovery of the structure of the basis of life. The downfall of the book is that it is very bias towards who had the most impact on the discovered of DNA.The perspective in the story does not portray the complete truth in reference to the importance of others in the groundbreaking discovery. Two other people who eventually were in the party that received the Nobel Prize for the structure of DNA were Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, the latter never officially receiving her prize for she died from radiation before the Nobel was issued. Although Watson gives some credit to the two scientists who did virtually all of the research he and Crick used for their structural model, he certainly did not attribute enough. Franklin was scorned to be cold and unsocial where she really only was trying to hold her own in a scientific world dominated by men.

They would not have won the race if not for her meticulous scientific research and one hundred hours spent developing the photo that led to Watson's aha! moment. Even if Franklin had been a man, the ethical lapse displayed by a Watson who looked down on being \\"nice\\" is damning to the basic character of the man and not good science.

This novel was written by famous scientist; James D. Watson, who was also the author of this book. Watson and a group of other famous scientists, such as Francis Crick, come together and try and figure out one of the most significant questions of our time, which is what is the basic building block of life? Yet, Crick and Watson are not the only men trying to solve this question. A man by the name of Linus Pauling and his men are doing just the same.Due to the fact that Crick and Watson were basically competing against Pauling and his group of scientists, errors were made. When one group of scientists would present and idea of a pattern that may be considered the DNA helix, the other group of scientists would find any little detail that would make the pattern wrong or incorrect. Not only did these men analyze the other groups work, they would take their original idea, and apply it to their own. These men were feeding off each others ideas. Eventually, the two men that finally figured out the DNA helix structure were Watson and Crick. This meant that Linus Pauling and his men did not discover the structure, and Crick and Watson felt a great deal of accomplishment.The DNA helix structure is very helpful because its nucleic acid carries all of your genetic information in your cells. These sequences of nucleotides will determine in each person their individual heredity characteristics. An example of this would be if you were born with a disease such as Cystic Fibrosis. If this were the case, this means that a parts of your DNA molecules are not normal and that a defect is in one of those molecules. Another reason that DNA is such a wonderful discovery is that police and the FBI can use it to trace criminals that have left a finger print or hair behind a the crime scene. This method has been used in many criminal cases, and has been proven to be a very useful tool.After reading this book cover to cover, I was not very happy with the end result. For me, I am not very interested in how the DNA helix was found. The book seemed to drag on longer than it needed to, which made reading it very difficult and boring. For someone who is extremely interested in how the DNA helix was found, then this would be a great book for them. The book seemed to be more of a biography, rather then just about the DNA helix. Watson used a lot of scientific terms that made parts of the book confusing. The book did not flow very well either. Also, people and events that Watson mentioned in the book did not have any real significance or importance on how the DNA helix was invented. Overall, I did not like this book, and would not recommend it to anyone who is not extremely interested in the foundation of the DNA helix."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"All I can say is, some lunatic at my school thought that a bunch of 9th graders would be able to read, understand, and write about this book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"You have to like science and like to read about it, then u might possibly enjoy this book.

I was lucky enough to have had someone send this great book to me while I was stationed in Iraq in 2003. I was absolutely engrossed in Watson's sometimes colorful, sometimes biased and always entertaining recounting of the discovery of DNA.Watson, an American originally studying physics, stumbled upon the field of biochemistry almost by accident. He seems to have been a bit of an unfocused graduate student who by chance ended up working with Crick. Countless numbers of little dead ends as well as one very big one are remembered. Of special interest is the 'political' nature of the relationships between scientists of different universities working similar aims.And the competition. Scientists, it seems, are as competitive as any of us. Very aware of their main rivals Watson and Crick tracked the progress of Linus Pauling and they react with glee as they discover he's made a critical error that will set his progress back indefinately. They are almost as competitive with their cross-town London rivals Marurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin.A special mention should be made of Rosalind Franklin. Some have accused Watson and Crick of stealing the Nobel Prize. Nothing was further from the truth. Watson and Crick determined the structure of DNA from the work of Wilkins and Franklin. Franklin was an unfriendly and cold person, as confirmed by co-workers, but a brilliant scientist. Watson spends several pages defending her work and wishing that she had lived so that she could share in the Noble prize [not awarded posthumously]. Any talk of Watson and Crick stealing Franklin's glory is bunk not borne out by the facts.The Double Helix is one of those rare science books that highlights the human element of discovery with all its foibles. I highly recommend this entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Double Helix is a worthy read. In a few hours of reading, one catches a fairly representative look into the scientific commmunity, though the eyes of one man. Some people critique this book as being one-sided. Of course it is! Watson admitted that up front. The book was written as an account his perceptions of the events and people involved with the discovery of the structure of DNA, not as a documentary. Like any human, Watson's perceptions of the events were scewed in his own favor. This, however, adds to the value of the book, rather than detracts. From my experience in the scientific community, the issues of ownership of ideas and work, plagarism, and politics are both real and complex. Double Helix does a good job of exemplifying these difficult issues."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recently reread The Double Helix and greatly enjoyed it, because (a) Watson conveys vividly (but perhaps not completely) events leading to the discovery of the structure of DNA, one of the great discoveries of the century and (b) he gives a warts and all description and shows that science is not a glorious straightline progression.What distinguishes him from most of the other participants, and explains his passion, is that (as a biologist) he was investigating the structure of DNA to gain insights into genetics. Therefore he saw elucidating the structure as a step to bigger things (e.g. Human Genome Project), not as an end in itself. Most of the other participants as biophysicists were content to find the structure. One of the beauties of the double helix is that the structure itself gave a very immediate indication as to the mechanism of genetic replication.I have been intrigued by the strongly polarised reactions to the book reflected in the reviews on this site. I think that some of the criticims of the book are unfair. Watson makes it clear that it is a personal account and reflects his own perceptions of the events at the time. From reading other accounts (e.g. The Path to the Double Helix by Olby) it is clear that his memories of some events are not shared by other participants in those events, including Crick and Wilkins.I can certainly understand why many readers (and in particular women) object to the characterisation of Rosalind Franklin, particularly the repeated derogatory references to &quot;feminists&quot;. On the other hand Watson acknowledges in the epilogue that his perceptions of her at the time of the events described were wildly wrong. Even in the body of the book, he never denies that she contributed key information (although he doesn't explain why they did not acknowledge that contribution more explicitly at the time - Sayre could be right that Watson is trying to put his spin on events to obscure this aspect). As I read the book his perceptions and comments about Franklin were almost entirely reporting or based on Maurice Wilkins complaints about her. Notwithstanding Anne Sayres' defence of Franklin in Rosalind Franklin and DNA (which I recommend to balance Watson's account) it does appear that Franklin was far from blameless in the bad relationship which developed between Franklin and Wilkins.It is also clear, even from Watson's account, that Franklin (and others such as Chargraff) had good reason for believing that Watson and Crick were not serious scientists. So her reserve when dealing with them is understandable.As well as the objectionable personal description of Franklin, Anne Sayre also criticises Watson for the suggestion in the Double Helix that Franklin rejected the suggestion that DNA was a helix. Franklin's private papers disclose that she thought that there was clear evidence that the B form was a helix, and Crick thought that she was not far away from demonstrating the double helical structure through her X-ray crystallography work. However, for most of the period that the events in the Double Helix unfolded in 1952 her work focussed on the A form of DNA which was not clearly helical on X-ray evidence. Both Watson and Wilkins are clear that when the possibility of a helical structure was discussed with Franklin on various occasions during 1952 she reacted negatively (and very strongly). Only in early 1953 did she begin to actively work on the B form and to turn her mind seriously to the detail of helical structures. This reflects either rigorous scientific standards or an overcautious approach depending on which side of the fence you are on. Either way, if she had been prepared to indulge the idle speculations of Wilkins, Watson and Crick earlier she may have found her name on the paper announcing the structure of DNA to the world either alone or with Wilkins, or Crick and Watson."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is almost totally about the human side of science, the story of people on the quest for the structure of the genetic material where all knew that the winners would get Nobel prizes. Watson was one-half of the team of James Watson and Francis Crick, the men that first constructed the correct model for DNA but this book is also about all the others around them in their corner of England with a great deal of Linus Pauling thrown in.Watson writes about the antagonism, friendships, rivalries and social structure of the scientists as well as the British culture that he is living in. This is a human-interest story, easily followed by people with little knowledge of biology. Forty years have passed since this book was first published; yet it still remains the best book about the human side of science and how scientists interact and gather data as they stagger towards the truth.The book also has relevance in the current debate over global warming, especially given the recent publication of some e-mails between scientists conducting an internal debate about the environmental data. As is demonstrated so strongly in this book, the presence of dissension among the investigators cannot be used to justify the conclusion that global warming is not happening."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"A must read for everybody who is even vaguely interested in modern biology, this books describes the key event that lead to today's age of biotechnology: the discovery of the double helix by Watson and Crick in 1951-1953 through the eyes of one of the discoverers, James Watson. At the time of the discovery James Watson was a young, brilliant student in the laboratory of Francis Crick in Cambridge. The two formed an unlikely pair: the smooth, young, ambitious American and his English colleague, every inch the typical English university scholar. The scientific path leading to the conception of the Double Helix (the structure of the DNA) is described and it is not a path with nice views only. The descriptions of Francis Crick and Roselind Franklin are not very flattering to say the least.The book is a very smooth read, especially for a &quot;science&quot; book, maybe also because James Watson dared to vent his personal opinions on his colleagues. This may not be very scientific, but it makes the book interesting to read. And of course the highlight in not every scientist's life is there: that one time only moment when you have a deep insight and all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place and what is left afterwards is this feeling of utter joy and satisfaction. And in the case of James Watson of course also the Nobel prize."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Most readers of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; would be further enlightened by Anne Sayre's &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot;."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix a hysterical science novel. By Raphael MermeyI thought that the double Helix was an outstanding piece of science literature. I liked the humor in James D. Watson's writing. He always found a way to make a serious topic funny. One example of his humor was when he stated that: At first he was only occasionally felling ill from his work but by the end of his apprenticeship he was violating the terms of conventional biochemistry. He was totally board with the normal rules. Another example of his unconventional sense of humor was when he was describing was describing the food at one of the labs he worked was working at and how sometimes he got sick from not eating at all. Another important part of this novel was the competition. Who would solve the double helix mystery first? The competition was between Linus Pauling (A well known and highly respected scientist) And the team of James D. Watson and Francis Crick. Up to this point in Watson's and Crick's careers neither of them had been well known. In fact Crick had been known for going off on tangents and then realizing what he though was a great idea had just been his imagination. But even with his defects he was a crucial part of figuring out what the double helix was.I liked the way the book did not leave out parts where every one needed every one else's skills and expertise. This is a trite in a book or in the world of science and I thought this was one of the most successful books at doing that which I have ever read. They showed that one of the most important reasons for Watson's and Crick's success was many different people with different backgrounds in science.I thought The Double Helix was an outstanding science novel, that had a great sense of humor and increased my knowledge, and was truly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Clarification is in order. First of all, this is not a substantive science book. For all the significance of the discovery it chronicles, The Double Helix never bothers to explain how, for example, x-ray crystallography actually works, or what the difference between a keto- and an -enol is, or even why Watson's and Crick's discovery brought on a new era in the life sciences. Aspiring students of genetics and molecular biology are urged to inquire elsewhere for answers to these questions.Second, to label The Double Helix a book on scientific method is almost equally misleading - the reason being that there is no room in the rarefied formalism extolled by the likes of Karl Popper for Watson's subjectivity and sarcasm, not to mention the latter's frequent excursions on nubile au pairs and the deplorable student housing market at Cambridge.Third (not that it matters for an appreciation of the book, but it's a common misunderstanding), Watson and Crick did not discover DNA itself, or even the function of DNA. Rather, they were awarded the Nobel Prize for solving the molecular structure of DNA.With those clarifications in mind, The Double Helix is a profitable read. Watson shows us non-scientists that the practice of science is \\"just\\" another human endeavor, and not some remote, sterilized activity conducted by emotional eunuchs in white coats. Watson's first-person narrative is downright conversational, as if he's talking shop over a pint of stout in an English pub. He is unabashedly honest about both his ambitions and his naivete (he was only 23 at the time the events in the book took place). And his sometimes scathing portrayals of his colleagues - in all their brilliance and banality - give the impression that working in a world-class research facility is a lot like working anywhere else.Francis Crick comes across as that certain guy we all knew in college (wherever and whenever that was) - impish and boisterous, egocentric but big-hearted, who might be dapper if he didn't sleep in his clothes, whose eccentricity is the bane of faculty advisors, whose attention is everywhere but on task, whose breath sometimes smells like beer after lunch, and whose serendipitous genius comes through at all the right times. The supporting cast is equally colorful: Maurice Wilkins, the quintessential English academic stuffed corpse; Rosalind Franklin, a Freudian caricature of icy feminine competence in a man's world; the godlike Linus Pauling playing with his tinker toy molecular models in California.And it wasn't just his colleagues who made Watson's work interesting. There were the aforementioned au pairs, the pubs and the parties and the formal receptions, there was the professional competitiveness between the English and the Americans - with Watson (a Yank in Cambridge) more of an American insurance policy against the Brits getting all the credit for solving DNA if Pauling wasn't fast enough. And there was the Cold War, which had an impact on research priorities and, sometimes, hampered communication in the scientific community.But most importantly - although Watson never deigns to make this point explicit - The Double Helix is a fascinating chronicle of the scientific method in action, notwithstanding the politics, the distractions, and the idiosyncrasies of the protagonists. The task itself was daunting. Watson and Crick already knew what DNA was composed of, and they knew with some certainty the proportions in which the bases were represented, but there could only be one correct way to put all the pieces together and the haystack was a big one. The researchers were quick to offer and to accept criticism, and false leads were abandoned without regard to ego or sunk time. Even though each wanted to get there first, London shared their findings with Cambridge, Cambridge shared their insights with London, and England and California held nothing from each other for long - admirable examples of the \\"sociable competition\\" of science that expedites discovery.In the end, Watson's and Crick's success relied heavily on Wilkins's and Franklin's crystallography, with important contributions from whomever happened to stop by the lab during the two year period, and insights from conferences and the textbooks and articles Watson happened to read at the time. Creativity, serendipity, and openness to the ideas of others eventually yielded hypotheses, which were tested using Pauling's modeling methods. It could not have been done alone, as Watson makes clear, and the structure of DNA would have been discovered sooner or later. While ultimately it doesn't matter who gets the credit for the discovery, the world seems a better place for James Watson's being involved, if only because The Double Helix is such an entertaining read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix was a one of the books on my high school biology teacher's reading list for the class. The name itself, The Double Helix, had shied me away from reading it; it sounds like some boring old book that will describe the structure of DNA in some very big and boring words. However, after finally reading the book, I completely changed my thoughts on this book. I found the novel to be an easy and exciting to read in an almost fictious hero-like story.Watson's story is not just a mere account of the events that occurred, but it also contains many of his personal thoughts and views of the events. Watson's purpose for writing The Double Helix was to explain that scientific research was a combination of \\"the contradictory pulls of ambition and the sense of fair play.\\" Watson involves the reader in the \\"race\\" of the DNA structure with Linus Pauling and in the underhanded use of Rosalind Franklin's X-ray data. I, like many others, was sucked into the thrill of Watson's first-hand account of this dishonest race. During many points in the course of the novel, I was anxiously waiting to turn the page to see what Watson or Crick might do next. As Sir Lawrence Bragg puts it in the foreword, \\"I do not know any other instance where one is able to share so intimately in the researcher's struggle and doubts and final triumph.\\"The Double Helix was not only a good read, but also it has reinvigorated my spirit in the field of research, especially the active field of genetics. My first year of college courses in chemistry and biology had began to turn me away from research in particular areas, for the courses just did not seem to interest me anymore. However, this book has provided me with a new avenue into the exciting world and life of scientific research; I am again looking forward to going into the genetic research field.I observed a very interesting point in the book, which is that all the data and diagrams that were discussed throughout the novel are also taught in our chemistry classes; it is in this fact that I find science's beauty, that only 50 years ago this data was used to solve the structure of a totally unknown molecule/idea and is now taught in elementary chemistry classes.The Double Helix is an exceptional novel that I recommend to all."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I recommend this book to anyone with a curiosity about DNA or an inside view of the world of science.

This account of the discovery of the structure of DNA, by one of the key participants Dr. James D. Watson, includes a lot of both. Written as though from his perspective at the time, The Double Helix presented a fascinating and candid look at the work which led up to this amazing discover.For the non-scientist, this book is an important reminder that scientists are human too. For the scientist, this book is an important reminder that scientists are human too. It's just nice to know that at times even the great scientists struggled with their choice of research topic or felt a little adrift too. It also makes for a great read, very casual and easy to follow with lots of drama and personality clashes. The science included is pretty minimal and is explained well with helpful pictures, so I think this would be a pretty easy read even for people with no science background.The casualness is occasionally a downside, as people are referred to by their first or last name at random and there's no cast list. Despite that small flaw, I would still say the relaxed writing style is strongest point of the book. Watson's surprising openness about everyone's feelings for each other and his ability to convey the rush he and Crick were in to finish the structure made this a very engaging book. It was pretty cool to feel like you were actually there during the race to discover the structure of DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I needed this book for a class and got what I paid for.

I've been telling the story as it unfolds to my 9 year old daughter - although I wish that Watson had been somewhat kinder to Rosalind Franklin - and I cannot help but to apostrophize on what happend in the interim with some of the ideas and people and in doing that, the incredible gravity and wonder of both the discovery and how Watson tells the story keep smacking me like a big wet fish in the face.

This book was recommended to me by a professor. Although I am just an ordinary person, I am glad that I read the book. I had a hard time understanding the technical side of the book, but the personal side was a definitely understandable.Watson's portrayal of what a scientist has to go through in order to become a great one had me interestedt to the very end. I felt myself riding the emotional train that he and his colleagues were on. Everytime he thought that he had &quot;it,&quot; (the answer to DNA) had me at the edge of my seat.I did not know that such a simple concept to us now required so much work and discipline to uncover. The amount of trials and errors that he and his colleagues had to go through to achieve it. It is just an astounding accomplishment. He not only had to figure out the key to DNA but he also had to persevere superiors always looking &quot;over his shoulder,&quot; less than enthusiastic colleagues, and lastly people, who just did not want him to succeed. For someone to overcome all of those obstacles is just amazing and they deserve to reap the rewards of all that nerve racking work.In conclusion, this book is a great read even if you are not hoping to win the Nobel prize or any other scientific prize."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book give lots of information on DNA and is detailed on the events that took place while workin in the lab in England.

However, my hypothesis was disproven and I understood the makings of the DNA.

James Watson was only 24 when he and Francis Crick (who was supposed to be working on his PhD) discovered the \\"secret of life.\\"I really enjoyed reading about this process of scientific discovery. Watson is very candid about his limitations. He discusses his reluctance to learn different subjects because they are too hard. He talks about reading journal articles and attending talks and not understanding anything.What stood out was his determination to understand DNA. He knew it was important and he was willing to do what it took to discover its structure. He spent a lot of time thinking about it and a lot of time seeking out people who could teach him what he needed to know to continue making progress. I think that this determination was the major reason for his success."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Honest yet condescending and superficial. These adjectives would be the best way of describing not only the tone of this memoir, but also the personality of its author, the famed James D. Watson who, with the help of others, discovered the structure of DNA. The slight tome gives a unique, inside-look at the inner workings and egos of the scientific community, especially in regards to winning fame and renown. In fact, that seems to be the only goal - there isn't much regard to the fact that their biological work with DNA and helices could actually benefit society. The quest for the Nobel Prize is the dominant theme of the book, and the author is very alienating in this regard. The ending is abrupt and frankly anticlimactic, although, as previously stated, the honesty was rather refreshing. However, the memoir was filled with suspense and intriguing in its descriptions of bickering and competition between scientists. It would have been nice to see some analysis or reflection, but there is little imagery or imagination. The Double Helix is literal and informative, and distinguishes itself only by being the first of its kind. It's more personal than a thesis but less inspiring than a textbook."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is an innaccurate version of events in the the discovery of teh structure of DNA. What most people don't know is that Rosalind Franklin was crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick actually stole most of her data via Wilson, her supervisor, adn passed it off as their own discoverery. She was a brilliant scientist and should have been an independent researcher at Kings College, but because she was a woman she was made an assistant to Wilson. She was extremely dedicated and plowed through all the obstacles at Kings College. However, her supervisor, Wilson, showed most of her data to his old friend Crick, who shared it with his partner Watson. They too were studying DNA, although they were on completely wrong track. The data that was pilfered included the famous photo 51, which Franklin obtained over a course of years' work and revealed the spiral shape of DNA. They also positioned the competent of DNA, such as the bases, exactly as she hypothesized. Watson, Crick, and Wilson received the Nobel Prize, while Franklin could not, because she died at the age of 38 due to radiation exposure from the X-rays she used to capture photo 51. The men only mentioned her in passing when accepting their prize, and definitely not as the source of the actual discovery. Then Watson had the gall to write a book that casts her in a horrible light, as an inferior person who was bad tempered and selfishly hoarded her information. He also calls her \`Rosy' throughout the entire book, although she despised that name. He once even went up to Rosalind and demanded that she hand over her data. He was a complete bigot, and thought her inferior and was furious when she refused to share her own findings to him. He harps about her appearance in the book, and it is obvious that is the only way he perceives her, and not as a thinking person. And for the record, she was actually quite striking, and wore the latest in French fashions. She was extremely dedicated, and her level of determination would have been completely accepted in a man. That's why I give this book a one, and if I could I'd give it a zero. Watson is just begging for comeuppance for what he wrote in this book. I would reccomend reading other books about Rosalind's struggle, such as 'Rosalind Franklin: The dark lady of DNA'"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"While James Watson is not on the list of authors I'd generally recommend reading, this book is an exception. Those interested in the history of molecular biology should definitely read this book. Given the nature of the topic, it is light and enjoyable reading. Certainly this account is biased to some extent, which makes it necessary to read other books on the topic as well.

Both Watson and Crick were insufferably arrogant, loud, ostentatious, obnoxious - but it allows the reader to see that enthusiasm and shear pushiness gets places.

As relevent today as in 1968."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix by James D. Watson chronicles James Watson's and Francis Crick's etraordinary discovery of the structure of DNA. This book shows the not only the critical problems and solutions they found but also Watson's thoughts and perceptions of the people around him. Watson's views of his colleagues Sir Lawrence Bragg, Max Perutz and his competitors Linus Pauling, Rosalind Franklin, and Maurice Wilkins are harsh and biased yet they still provide some insight. An interesting look at the competition that takes place between the scientists is also present as Crick and Watson race to be the first to solve the DNA mystery. Watson's description of glee at Linus Pauling's failure to find the structure of DNA shatters the idea that all scientists have a noble drive which is to improve the world.This book begins with Watson's various travels and studies. Before arriving at Cambridge his main focus had been bacterial and viral phages. However, after arriving in Cambridge and meeting Francis Crick, their shared interest in solving the DNA myestery exploded, and their efforts that would eventually lead to success began. It is important to note that during their time of model building and researching, both Crick and Watson were really supposed to be working on other projects. Their discovery, which revolutionized science, was produced during their spare time. Watson clearly explains the thought processes he and Crick underwent while also providing an imporved understanding of DNA.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun read. The Double Helix is short, informative, yet very entertaining. The language is easy to understand and all of the scientific topics are well explained. Watson's dry humor is spread throughout the book making it a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix by James D. Watson is a true story based on the real life discovery of the structure of DNA. The book takes the reader on the journey from the beginning. It provides background information on what James Watson and Francis Crick, who co-discovered DNA, were doing. It starts with their early work that did not involve DNA at all. Watson soon becomes intrigued by DNA and when he met Crick in Cambridge some years later, peaked his interest also. This is where their story together began on their journey to finding one of the most important pieces of science ever discovered.Watson and Crick's brilliance are appreciated as they struggle through their problems in trying to work out the unknown and please their employer Sir Lawrence Bragg at the same time. At certain points in the story, both have to put DNA on hold, while they worked on other experiments as instructed. They keep working with the DNA structure in their spare time. When they reach a dead end, they start over and logically work their way through what they know. With the help of others, such as Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins and the use of their x-ray diffraction pictures and other technologies, they are able to obtain information that help them on their way to fame. Not only does this book provide the reader with information on Watson and Crick but gives insight on other scientists and their theories at that present time, such as Linus Pauling and his alpha helix. In the book's conclusion, it is finally revealed how Watson and Crick were able to discover the structure of DNA. With knowing how they discovered the structure, the reader is able to obtain a better understanding of what DNA is.This book is a very easy read. The language it contains is simplistic and easily understood. The book is not lengthy. It is well written and keeps the reader interested, but in turn, still teaches facts and the history of the discovery of the DNA structure. I highly recommend this book, if you are interested in science or not. It is an enjoyable read that provides the reader with information and some humor. Overall, I would highly recommend The Double Helix by James F. Watson."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I found the book to be the complete antithesis to the expected writings hidden behind the scientific cover. Watson and his clan's quest for the helixical structure of DNA made for an entertaining voyage within these pages. Unexpectedly, as many scientific based books that I have been privy to read lately, this book was very approachable, dare I say readable. The exploits recounted by Watson were very entertaining; they could even be considered witty and humorous although it was biosciences humor. The teamwork and competition aspects of the discovery of the double helix were unexpected but welcomed because I felt that they were the driving forces behind the people. I was impressed by Watson, Crick and Franklin all bringing something to the proverbial table even though I found it a tad bit lucky or coincidental, but that is how these things work sometimes. This, accompanied with the race against Linus Pauling (already a recognized scientist of the time) helped lend to an educational, insightful and entertaining few hours of reading about the basic structure of all of us. I felt like I took a little something with me when I was finished with this work.......and I do mean literally."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is exceptional for anyone wishing to know the tale of the &quot;discovery&quot; of DNA. It's great for knowing how exciting science can be (and should be) for the people involved. It's great in that it doesn't require too much, if any, technical knowledge to understand. My *only* complaint is inevitible -- it's one participant's view. I read this years ago, so I don't remember how much, if at all, Dr. Watson dealt with this, but how sad that the female scientist who the got much of their information from was not honored and is pretty much forgotten by most people, simply because she died before they were up for the Nobel Prize (the Nobel foundation doesn't award posthumously). And how ironic that she died from cancer brought on (most likely) by the machinerey she used to do her science.Read this book, it's great. Just keep some solemnity for those whose voices aren't quite heard."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Comments can be directed to respectfulempiricist.comThis is a marvelous little book that brings out impressions of the many great and not so great minds involved in the ultimate understanding of what DNA looks like and how it multiplies. As the title implies, Watson is describing his own subjective mental picture of the people and events that led up to his and Francis Crick's ultimate Nobel winning discovery, a discovery that has stood the test of time.Watson describes the personalities of the many people involved directly or otherwise. Though he uses kind words, it is apparent that different people and different times grated on him. He also describes his travels, academic frailties and personal loneliness. The latter while thinly veiled, was mentioned throughout the book.Though there was description throughout the memoir, it was not burdensome to the non scientist. I used a dictionary about five times and had my much more scientific daughter explain some things to me. While there is academic jargon it was not burdensome. I was able to read the book in nearly one setting as it was written for the layman to spend a little time inside the thinking and personality of a true genius and a humble one at that.Those of us who did not study science when it was convenient but rue it today, can read this book and learn something about the history of one of the finest events in scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson was brilliant in bringing pieces of his vague memory and prejudices. What we have here is in part the fact of history and in part a very enjoyable work of fiction.Really, people who read this book usually finishes in a few hours. This is amazing compared to the time it takes to read the hopeless eulogy given by Anne Sayer.However, as a man of considerable authority, Watson should have taken the usual scholary precautions and double-chekced when he was talking about &quot;people&quot;. I think any serious reader must consult Anne Sayer, albeit painful, for a balanced viewpoint."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson's ego and narcissism are things that have always been talked about; this book depicts them with the utmost clarity. It's a funny book with a skewed view that he addresses in the prologue. It is his take on the events that revolved around the elucidation of the DNA structure.One of my \\"favorite\\" parts is when he is talking about attending Franklin's seminar on her X-ray crystallography. He admits his thoughts were: \\"what if she removed her glasses and did something novel with her hair?\\" Despite his personal downfalls his gung-ho and risky attitude sped up this important discovery. It is also a realistic view of the politics and competitive nature of a scientific career.I recommend this book to everyone. It is not written in a way that would be over anyone's head. It's definitely good for scientists and people considering the field."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"An absorbing account by Watson, but would like to hear some other sides of the story, from Crick and the others who contributed to the double helix discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Good book, very easy to read despite its scientific background.

WatsonThe Double Helix is the tale of the ups and downs of an adventure shared by two men. This novel depicts the struggle of James Watson and Francis Crick to discover the structure of DNA while attempting to simultaneously focus on other tasks at hand. They yearn to make this discovery before rival biochemist Linus Pauling beats them to the punch to thus win the Nobel Prize, which is foreshadowed for whoever might secure this discovery. Having previously put their search on the shelf for a while Watson and Crick return to the task of solving DNA when Linus Pauling becomes presumably close to solving it himself. After much trial and error Watson finally comes to the idea of the double helix and base pairs which proves to be the correct structure for DNA.Watson is able to effectively captivate the reader and create a bridge for the reader to cross, enabling him or her to delve in the Watson's world of science. He is fully able to depict the complicated biochemistry that is present in his story in such a way that it is more easily comprehendible for his audience. Watson is successful in vividly relaying the accounts of his story with plentiful detail that creates a tremendous picture in the mind of the reader.On the other hand, constant reference to numerous scientists and other people is a cause of confusion for the reader as he or she tries desperately but usually ineffectively to recall which person was responsible for which action when they resurface at different times throughout the novel. The inclusion by Watson of all these characters removes and scatters the focus of audience from where he intends it to be, which is on his struggle with DNA.Despite this imperfection The Double Helix is still a great novel. It does so much to further the understanding the discovery of the structure of DNA. It is a great complimentary learning tool for anybody interested in biochemistry and DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Ok. I'm giving this book a 4 because of the importance of the discover of the structure of DNA. In terms of actual reading material, however, I'd probably give it a 2 or 3. I do believe that James Watson is a great scientist, but he is not writer. His writing style is only adequete and far from interesting and he really doesn't do a great job of putting interest into the subject matter. Someone who does not have at least a little background in the general concepts or biology/organic chemistry/physics will probably not get much out of this book.Now on to the science side of the book. Watson describes the various events that took place while he, Franscis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin worked on discovering the structure of DNA. Again, Watson does not really put much vigor into these events but does describe them realistically (science can't always do interesting). He focuses on his relationship with Crick, battles with Franklin, and competetion with Linus Pauling--the Nobel prize winning chemist who ironically get the structure of DNA wrong. Through his writing, Watson at times reveals his pompousness and his ignorance of certain scientific concepts, but overall shows his devout eagerness of discovery.I would say that this is an important book to read if you are at all interested in science. However, it is probably too boring for just a fun read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book by James Watson tells his story, in the years he worked on the structure of DNA. As another review noted, this is the story &quot;warts and all,&quot; including his and others' worries about grants being renewed, family, relationships, jealousy, pride, food, and living in England where the labs and accomodations were always cold in winter.I know almost no biology, and while a lot of the discussion was over my head scientifically, I followed the gist of it.The ghost of Rosalind Franklin continually follows James Watson. I've heard Dr. Watson speak publicly twice, and each time he was asked about her. When he was interviewed on NPR, the interviewer persistently went into the interactions between Watson and Franklin. The gist of his response is that she lost the recognition she should have gotten because she refused to collaborate and work with others, and she refused to work with models. Clearly, while Franklin's X-ray photograph of DNA was a major step in pointing Watson and Crick to the double helix AT GC structure of DNA, it was NOT a self-sufficient proof of the double helix, as she herself refused to consider a helical structure of DNA."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I would mostly echo the many accolades that James Watson's book has received on this site and over the years. *The Double Helix* is indeed a classic.However, after seeing 'The Secret of Photo 51' on PBS' Nova program, I realize now that Dr. Watson's work is science fiction rather than science.Like many other young science fans, I grew up with the accepted wisdom that the collective genius of James Watson and Francis Crick cracked the code of life: DNA. In college, I did hear about someone named Rosalind Franklin that was somehow wrongly denied a share of the glory in this magnificent achievement. At the time, being naive and ignorant as I was, I dismissed the contributions made by Rosalind Franklin as being merely that of a technical assistant (rather than as the KEY insight that it really was) and simply dismissed claims on her behalf as being those of the 'politically correct' rather than people sincere about preserving the integrity of science.I freely admit now that I was totally wrong. Rosalind Franklin's contributions to the discovery of the nature and structure of DNA was absolutely crucial to the magnificent moment of science that took place 50 years ago. It seems clear on the evidence that Watson nor Crick could ever have made the mental leaps and had the insights that they had had Dr. Franklin's work not been 'available' to them.What is more disturbing about this whole sordid affair is -- not that Dr. Franklin did not get all the accolades she deserved (which the scientific community is making belated ammends for) -- that Dr. Franklin's work was quite literally stolen from her ... she never gave permission for Watson &amp; Crick to have her results, they never informed her that they had surreptitious access to those results, and Watson &amp; Crick -- for all intents and purposes -- gave her no credit for her contributions.In the *Double Helix* -- rather than simply sweeping those inconvenient facts under the rug -- James Watson goes on to malign Dr. Franklin in both a personal and vicious manner. Even though she was one of the leading pioneers and pillars of X-ray crystallography, James Watson wrote in his book that 'Rosy' (as he derisively referred to her as ... never calling her by her proper name) was not capable of understanding her own results and suggested that she was a lowly technician rather than a leading researcher. To make matters worse, James Watson spent a great deal of time in his book on describing Dr. Franklin as being unattractive, unfeminine, and unsociable (in truth, she was a very attractive and vivacious woman).As I write this on April 25, 2003, the world is commemorating the publication in Nature of Watson &amp; Crick's supposed 'discovery' of the nature of DNA -- an event that heralded a new genomic age of science. The second paper in that issue of Nature after Watson &amp; Crick's paper was a paper by Rosalind Franklin and her graudate assistant Raymond Gosling. Dr. Franklin's paper contained a facsimile of 'Photo 51' -- the X-ray photo of DNA that was key to Watson &amp; Crick's fame and glory. Dr. Franklin's photo alone -- with absolutely no need for the 'insights' of Watson &amp; Crick -- proves the double helical struture of DNA.It seems tragically ironic that a book entitled *Double Helix* devotes so much ink to maligning and belittleing its real discoverer.In summary, if you view the *Double Helix* as a fictional account of how great and smart James Watson is and how homely and dull-witted 'Rosy' is, then this book is still a classic. But I don't think I can view the tale told in its pages the same way as I did before I knew the true history of the double helix."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book is a must for any body interested in how great discoveries actually happen.

Watson writes about how he and his partner Crick work their way towards one of the great dscoveries of the 20th century. Watson also writes about personal dislikes and how men and women of science can be every bit as petty as their lay counterparts.

Watson is a great book. I have learned a lot by reading this book. It is a simple book that contains lots of humor. I have discovered that Watson is a smart, but at the same time funny, while competing with an admired scientist, Linus Pauling. Watson makes the book fun to read because he conveys his process vividly and shows how important DNA is to the world. All of this started in a dumpy, worn down chemical lab at Cambridge University called \\"The Cavendish.\\" Watson was interested in investigating the structure of DNA to gain more insight into genetics. James Watson shows that his discovery was also part of Francis Crick, his partner that helped him. However, Crick was sometimes not very helpful because he wondered off. Watson had to get use to the structure of Cambridge where they had meals and everyone sat together on a special table on an elevated platform and were expected to engage in an enlightened conversation. I also like the part where Watson is honest by showing his ignorance on X-ray crystallographic techniques. I also enjoy the sarcasm in chapter 15 where they say, \\"After Pauling's success, no one could claim that faith in helices implied anything but an uncomplicated brain.\\" Also the information from page 83 describes that ratio of bases of DNA: where A-T and C-G, which is what I have learned in class. Therefore, I believe that The Double Helix is a great book worth reading because it does not contain much technical terms and is also a short book that will show important the discovery of DNA was and still is to the world."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"James Watson's book, The Double Helix, gives the not-so-scientific public excellent insight into how the scientific process was put to work less than fifty years ago to make a discovery that changed everything we know about biology and medicine. In an age where science is becoming increasingly important yet even less understood, this book portrays science as the dectective story that it is while throwing a delightfully human light on the scientists whose passion it is to unravel the puzzell. A quick, enjoyable, and necessary read for anyone who is or ever has been interested in science, as well as anyone else who likes a good &quot;detective&quot; story."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Though the structure of DNA is now common knowledge to virtually everyone (both scientist and layman alike), reading this book really put into context the excitement of of having made this huge discovery. I really enjoyed reading this little book and it actually changed my perception of researchers from &quot;strange people with thick glasses who spend their whole day looking at a dark spot on some rare beetle&quot; to &quot;interesting people with somewhat thin glasses who still spend their whole day looking at some dark spot on a beetle&quot;. Seriously, if you think science is boring - this book is especially for you. Recommended"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This book was a great success when it came out, more because of what it revealed about the persons involved than becasue it revealed any great insights about DNA. The story it told was far from the public's preconceived notions about dry, dull scientists plodding away relentlessly towords some foregone conclusion. This was a story with sex, intrigue, gossip and a great race to see who would win the big prize- since it was well known that whoever cracked the structure of DNA was a shoe-in for a Nobel.Reading it today, over 40 years after in was published, and after a brief career in scientific research, I'm struck not so much by the antics of Watson and Crick as I am by the cavelier way they denigrated their rivals, poached on thier areas of research, and stole from them when necessary. Especially noteworthy is the way women were abused in this old-boy world. You don't have to be a radical feminist to be astounded at the way the abuse heaped on females in general, and on Rosalind Franklin in particular.Franklin was the first to produce the excellent x-ray crystallography that led Watson and Crick to their insights into the structure of DNA. With little regard for her or her work, they used her data without permission in their publications, and were pleased when a researcher with a dislike for intelligent and independant women arranged for Franklin to be sent away to another institute- and essentially banned from continuing work on DNA. Franklin produced a wealth of good work in other areas, and tragically died young before her story could be told.Writing &quot;The Double Helix&quot; ten years after the events of the book, and though acknowledging some of Franklin's contributions, Watson still seems loathe to give her any real credit. In the epilogue he acknowledges that her contributions were under valued at the time, yet he resists stating the obvious- that without her work, his would not have been possible. She truely deserved equal credit with Watson and Crick (and Wilkins) in the discovery of the double helix.Read this book, but also read &quot;Rosalind Franklin and DNA&quot; by Anne Sayre for a more complete picture."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Although The Double Helix by James D. Watson is not the most riveting-can't-put-it-down book, it does offer a fascinating first-hand account of the events leading up to one of the most impacting scientific discoveries ever. Its manifestation of the unique existence of a scientist exposes what type of competitions, manipulation, and discovery exist in the science arena.The introduction of other key figures who played prominent and influential roles in the discovery of the DNA structure is at the very least, enlightening. The network of knowledge necessary to ensure there are no foibles in a key discovery is something that the general public may have never taken into account. Also, it evinces the professional barriers that exist between the genders. The back story of Rosalind \\"Rosie\\" Franklin is fascinating as it examines the \\"glass ceiling\\" and what type of personality a woman needs to adopt in order to survive in a male dominated field. The end of the end of the book-where Watson realizes her seemingly callous attitude emanates from her essential need to incorporate survival methods is refreshing. The science terms are difficult to follow if one does not have previous scientific background, but there is enough universality imbedded into the story to keep a reader's attention.Another aspect that proves to be surprising is the fact that scientists are not without their weak fields-just because they excel in chemistry does not mean they are equally capable in biology. Reading of how Watson and Crick were unsuccessful on several occasions somehow made them human-like they were mortals rather than some higher power intellectuals. Somehow, there seems to be an idea or stigma attached to scientists that suggest they are always brilliant and do not make mistakes. This book sheds that concept.Watson and Crick needed to do research, work hard, and learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish their objective. They even needed help from their friends. They beat out a great scientist in Linus and won the \\"DNA Race.\\" Their discovery has changed the world, and this book depicts them in a humble role-two guys doing their job."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"this is easily one of my favorite books. some dislike it for watson's dramatization of certain social elements in the story, and for the way in which crick and watson made their discovery. but i think the book should be appreciated as a text which makes science more accessible to the general public. and perhaps most impressive is how watson does manage to include some science in a way which i think will not distract the lay reader, or bore him."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This is the story of the search for the structure of DNA, told by the one who (with Francis Crick) discovered it. But it's far more than that. It is also the story of a young man who tries to find his way in the world of science. The book is very well written, in a charming informal style. However, this is a highly personal account, and should not be considered as the objective truth about the subject. Especially the fans of Rosalind Franklin will testify this. Nevertheless, I recommend this book if you want to savour the thrill of scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"This firsthand account of the discovery of DNA dispels a lot of the notions that ousiders have about how science really works. Watson's descriptions of the competition, politics, dead ends, personality clashes, mistakes, and eventually inspiration reveal that discovery is not as clear-cut a process as it sometimes might seem.Watson is honest in his introduction that his account is just that, the story told through his own point of view, complete with possible faulty memories and personal prejudices. I was intrigued by the portrayals of the personalities of so many famous figures that I've been learning about for years in my biology and genetics classes - Francis Crick, of course, along with Maurice Wilikins, Rosalind Franklin, Linus Pauling, and many more. I was touched by Watson's admission at the end of the book that his unfavorable impressions of Rosalind Franklin stemmed from the fact that she was a woman trying to make a name for herself in the male-dominated world of scientific research in the 1950s.There is quite a bit of biological jargon in this book, and though it could probably be read by someone without any knowledge of genetics, it will be appreciated more by readers with some background. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in genetics and science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The structure of DNA was discovered before I was born. This book allowed me to look back to a time when the structure of DNA was unknown. Could proteins be the genetic material? Seems like it since there are so many amino acids. Could DNA be the genetic material? But how could only 4 bases create such diversity? How could these 4 bases possibly fit together? These are questions that every scientist now knows the answers to. But these questions used to be very puzzling. &quot;The Double Helix&quot; truly is a personal account in the race to discover the structure. The book explains the many ideas that were considered, the fears that someone would beat them to it, and the feeling of triumph when they knew they had succeeded. &quot;The Double Helix&quot; is a book for scientist and non-scientist alike."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I think the Double helix is a wonderful and entertaining book to read. The great scientist James D. Watson clearly describes about the discovery of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) structure, which can be consider to be the greatest discoveries in the millennium. The author is very detailed in explaining how, when and where the discovery took place. He emphasizes on the role of recreation and day dreaming in the context of everyday life in sparking fresh insights towards possible connections. He also explains his motivations of research and his ambitions in getting a noble prize. I think Watson's style is very personable as he includes a lot of stories about his life such as personal vanities, annoying mannerisms and even his formal dinning parties. I think this book is fun to read and can be shared among children as to motivate them in expanding their ideas."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"+++++In this book (first published in 1968), \\"Honest Jim\\" (as a scientist friend called him) or Dr. James Dewey Watson has explained his \\"version of how the structure of DNA was discovered\\" and \\"this account represents the way [he] saw things then, in [the fall of] 1951 [to the spring of] 1953.\\" (The discovery was announced in April 1953.) That is, he has \\"attempted to re-create [his] first impressions of the relevant events and personalities\\" that he encountered along the way to making the discovery. Thus, understand this is not a book of historical facts.Also, because of the personal nature of this book Watson states that \\"many of the comments [that he makes] may seem one-sided and unfair, but this is often the case in the incomplete and hurried way in which human beings decide to like or dislike a new idea or [a new] acquaintance.\\"This book revolves around five main people:(1) Dr. Francis Crick (1916 to 2004) of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England(2) Dr. James Watson (born 1928) also of the Cavendish Laboratory(3) Dr. Rosalind Franklin (1920 to 1958) of King's College, a division of the University of London(4) Dr. Maurice Wilkins (1916 to 2004) also of King's College(5) Dr. Linus Pauling (1901 to 1994) of the California Institute of Technology.However, along the way the reader meets many other people, both scientists and non-scientists.As Watson explains, the above five people are in a \\"race\\" to discover DNA's structure. However, I got the impression that neither Franklin nor Wilkins knew they were in a race. By the end of the race, Watson was \\"one of the winners\\" who shared the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Crick and Wilkins.According to the official Nobel Prize internet site, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won a shared Nobel Prize in physiology \\"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.\\"This 29-chapter (with epilogue) book is a fast read (but only if you gloss over the science parts). As Watson proceeds in this story, you'll find that he is quite sociable and takes us to such places as pubs, restaurants, and \\"smashing\\" parties.As you read this book, you'll find that there is considerable tension between Watson and Franklin (who was an expert in X-ray diffraction crystallography) as well as between Wilkins and Franklin.For me, this book imparts four major things:(1) THE THRILL OF DISCOVERY. That is, this book effectively conveys, especially in the latter chapters, the struggle to find the correct answer. With each chapter, the anticipation mounts toward the final climax: the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA.(2) HOW SCIENCE IS DONE. For example, both Watson & Crick and Pauling used molecular models while Franklin & Wilkins used X-ray crystallography. However, all science is not done as it is conveyed in this book. As Watson states, \\"styles of scientific research vary almost as much as human personalities.\\"(3) THE QUESTION OF ETHICS IN SCIENCE. For example, Wilkins told Watson secretly that Franklin \\"had evidence for a new three-dimensional form of DNA.\\" When Watson \\"asked what the pattern [of this new form] was like, [Wilkins] went into the adjacent room to pick up an [X-ray diffraction] print [or photograph] of [this] new form [called the 'B' form]\\" and showed it to Watson. This was done without Franklin's permission. It turns out that this X-ray photo was critical and \\"gave several...vital helical parameters.\\"(4) WATSON'S HONESTY. In all of this book, Franklin is portrayed as an unattractive, unapproachable, and angry person whose scientific work is questionable. However, in the book's epilogue Watson devotes the last two paragraphs to her and her achievements. He admits that \\"my initial impressions of her, both scientific and personal...were often wrong\\" and that she was a person of \\"personal honesty and generosity\\" as well as of \\"intelligence.\\"Two good features of this book are that it has photographs (a total of 19) and diagrams (a total of 11) throughout. My favorite photo is the one captioned \\"X-ray diffraction photograph of DNA, B form\\" taken by Franklin in late 1952. My favorite diagram is captioned \\"Schematic illustration of the double helix.\\"This book was written for a general audience so they could experience the thrill of this revolutionary discovery. Thus, I was surprised that it had no chapter table of contents (but the photos and diagrams each have one), no chapter headings, and no index. I feel these would have made the book more user friendly.Also, I feel what was needed was a science glossary and name index/page. The former is needed because the reader encounters many scientific terms (especially those related to DNA) and thus a glossary would make the science more accessible to the general reader. The latter is needed because Watson encounters many people and a name index/page would have helped the reader keep track of these names. Besides Watson talked with other scientists to clarify ideas, and in a way they indirectly contributed to the discovery. Thus, a name index/page would have acknowledged their indirect contribution.Finally, in the epilogue Watson states, \\"All of [the major] people [in this book], should they desire, can indicate events and details they remember differently.\\" Thus, I recommend these books:(1) \\"Linus Pauling: Scientist and Peacemaker\\" (2001). In this book, refer to the science article entitled \\"The Triple Helix\\" which describes the race to discover DNA's structure. Note Pauling's observations throughout the article.(2) \\"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\\" (first published in 1975) by Anne Sayre. This book clears up Watson's misconceptions about Franklin who died in 1958.(3) \\"The Third Man of the Double Helix\\" (2003) by Maurice Wilkins. Wilkins finally speaks out on what really happened from his perspective.In conclusion, Dr. James Watson tells us honestly his version of how the structure of DNA was discovered. He effectively conveys the struggle to find the right answer and the thrill of discovery. Don't deny yourself from reading this exciting book but be sure to read the recommended books to get the full story.*** 1/2+++++"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"_________________________________________________________________When &quot;The Double Helix&quot; came out in 1968, as a geneticist I naturally read it. And it has stuck far more firmly for me than any of the many other books I've read over the years about genetics.Why do I remember this book so well? I've wondered. The answer is right in the first sentence of &quot;The Double Helix&quot; that reads: &quot;I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood.&quot;In his account of how the structure of DNA was discovered, Jim Watson doesn't try to tell the story from a disinterested point of view. This is my version, he says, and I'm not going to touch it up to cover the warts and other blemishes. Yes, for instance, Watson and Crick were patently and terribly unfair and unjust toward Rosalind Franklin but Jim doesn't deny it. He makes it plenty clear.Most writing in and about science is well varnished. But varnish gives a gloss and it's not easy to hold onto. Jim Watson forgot the varnish, on purpose. Watson's brashness (and Crick's conceit) season this narrative in a memorable way, a way I can't easily forget, even if I wanted to.This is first-rate personal science writing. Five stars, for sure, or more. It's about one of the most important discoveries in the history of science. I hope you'll enjoy (and remember) &quot;The Double Helix&quot; too."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I read this book for the first time when i took undergraduate biochemistry in college. I could not put it down. Now, ten years later, i found it at a second-hand store and re-read it, and once again read it in two sittings. This book reads like a thriller. You definitively catch a sense of the urgency of their research. I was flipping pages nervously, like i didn't know Watson and Crick were the ones who won the race.In the edition i have, Watson is very thankful about the contributions that Rosalind Franklin made to their discovery. He is crystal clear about how she was the one convinced that the backbone was on the outside, and had not he followed her advice, it would have taken him even longer to figure out the structure, and who knows?, Pauling might have gotten there first. In the epilogue, Watson is all praise about Rosalind, acknowledges how his opinions about her were often wrong, how excellent the quality of her work was, and ponders about the obstacles that she encountered in her career in science for being a woman.I wonder if these comments were missing in other people's books, because according to their critiques, one comes out with the idea that Watson and the male-dominated scientific establishment gave Rosalind the cancer that killed her.This is an excellent, honest account of an event that took place when the author was 25 years old. I could not believe my eyes when i read that sentence. Twenty-five, worrying about girls and tennis and the structure of the most important molecule in the universe. These facts might count for something.

The new book by Meyer Friedman and Gerald Friedland, &quot;Medicine's Ten Greatest Discoveries,&quot; of course contains a chapter on this achievement, interestingly entitled &quot;Maurice Wilkins and DNA.&quot; It tells the story of Franklin's involvement with the DNA research and the political abuse to which she was treated during her fellowship at Kings College London--a post from which she was ultimately fired. It also shows how Franklin's conflict with Wilkins--and his with her--probably cost the two of them the first prize in the race for the discovery. It was a race which Watson &amp; Crick won by a whisker."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The title of the book says it all - this is a &quot;personal account of the discovery of the structure of DNA.&quot; Told from the point of view of James Watson, who later shared the Nobel Prize with Crick and Wilkins for the discovery. Both Crick and Watson were theorists, who analysed other peoples' data (I've heard more than one biochemist say they &quot;stole&quot; it from Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin) and correctly deduced the double-helix structure of DNA.The drama mostly centres on Cambridge and King's College, the universities where these scientists were studying/working at the time. Also figuring prominently in the story is Linus Pauling, winner of 2 Nobel Prizes (one in chemistry, the other for peace). He was hot on the trail and this competition that gives the narrative a driving energy. It's interesting that both he and the Watson/Crick combo both independently came up with a triple-helix structure with the backbone on the inside before W &amp; C turned that idea inside out and put the backbone in the correct position, on the outside.This brings us to the contribution of Rosalind Franklin. Her contribution to the discovery are significant - she first expounded the idea that the backbone must be on the outside, and her X-ray diffraction pictures led C &amp; W to a helical structure. She did not win the Nobel Prize - the reason is not because she was female or difficult to work with, but because she passed away at 37, before the prize was awarded. Whether her gender or personality would have excluded her were she still alive is, of course, debatable.What is most enjoyable about this book, however, is the personal style - Watson gives us an inside look at London, time spent in pubs, boring conferences, and his relationship with Watson, Bragg, and other famous scientists in London and elsewhere. This is the personal aspect, and he makes no qualms about telling unflattering stories about these people (and himself). These include run-ins with Franklin, Bragg, and his first postdoctoral advisor. Throw in a healthy dose of interdisciplinary squabbling (biologists vs. chemists vs. physicists) and you get an entertaining story of one of the most important discoveries of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I read this book as a requirement for my undergraduate biology class, but I ended up enjoying it quite thoroughly. I think the depiction of Watson &amp; Crick, as well as their adventure to discover the Double Helix as naturally assumed by pairs of DNA, was far more entertaining than one would assume coming from a \\"science\\" book. There are really three major points that make this an interesting read. (1)The unbelievable ease of reading in this book was unexpected. One would normally assume that a \\"science\\" book would be difficult to say the least but in fact the layout of the book was really reader friendly. (2)The race against another, more well-known scientist, in Linus Pauling to discover the structure of DNA, and (3) the teamwork approach to this discovery that Watson &amp; Crick took. I was personally enthralled with the overall competition between the two different groups and how Watson, Crick, and Franklin came together to add to one purpose. It was very interesting to see all of them bring something different to the table in regards to their scientific specialties. Overall I thought the book was an excellent read but I was surprised to see the personality clashes with Watson and Franklin. I would recommend this work for anyone who has a creative want to learn more about the human side of science and DNA in general."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Many people undoubtedly never pick up this book because they think science is too boring or too complex to make for a true page-turner. How wrong they are! This is edge-of-your-seat fascinating. I doubt that Watson could write a super suspense novel, but he did something greater. In my humble opinion, he wrote one of the finest books of scientific achievement ever written.

Nasar. 8 1/2\\" x 5 1/2\\".Written by Dr. James D. Watson in 1968, reprinted several times, this is one of the most intriguing, personal stories of scientific endeavors written to unravel the molecular basis of heredity and the genetic code of life itself, the DNA molecule - deservingly referenced as the Holy Grail of scientific inqiry. With an explanatory apology, Watson describes his maturation from an initial lazy undergraduate at Univ. of Chicago having primary interest in ornithology and avoiding chemistry and physics courses,to doing post-doctoral research abroad, first in Copenhagen and subsequently in Cambridge where he began serious research with Francis Crick that culminated in elucidating the molecular structure of the double helix DNA molecule with base-pairing of A-T and G-C, allowing a model construct possessing correspondence to its X-ray crystalline lattice structure. Much of the time it appeared to a 'Mission Impossible'. Success came in 1953, Watson was then 25 years old.The author's prose and pace of relating this story reveals the passion of his quest to establish his mark in science - and he relates intimate anecdotes of his cohorts, teachers and the scientific cult of divisions enjoyed by the scholarly, erudite academicians in England and elsewhere. In the end, he shared along with his associate Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins, the Nobel Prize in 1962. The future of medicine was forever changed.

Good for reading in the subway.But the Norton Critical edition, edited by Gunther S. Stent, is the one to get if you can only afford one. Its typeface leaves much to be desired, and, in my copy, some of the pages are hard to read because the printer seems to have run out of ink in the middle of the job. But the edition has materials that are indispensable for an understanding of this classic work of science.

Watson writes candidly about the frustrations, setbacks, anguishes and the breakthroughs involved in the process of discovery. The intense rivalry between different labs, particularly between Cambridge (Watson & Cricks) and Pauling (in the US) is insightful. Key players at the time were acutely aware that whoever solved the puzzle would have a place in scientific history, and rightly so. Competition is perhaps a good thing, even in the sciences!Key observations / points from the Double Helix:i. Watson's openness about the failures, progress, wrong turns, thought processes and other associated aspects of research.ii. Cricks' incredible confidence (arrogance?) and commitment - he worked with Watson despite clear direction from Bragg (Sir Lawrence Bragg, the lab Director) to focus on his PhD.iii. Open communication between smart people is critical to success. Scientific development seems to revolve around that. Why is business generally so poor at doing this - communicating?iv. A combination of theoretical, experimental (x-ray / lithography) and model building (it is hard to think in 3d, but easy to see) was critical to the ultimate solution. Particularly the latter, model building. This reminded me of Richard Feynman's book (Surely You are Joking Mr Feynman) where he describes something very similar. Theoretical folks obtain insights from experiments and vice versa.v. Hanging around smart and communicative people is a good thing and should be aspired to - something I am lacking at the moment.vi. Watson learned fundamentally new fields (after some considerable reluctance) from scratch after discovering that he had to learn them.vii. Intense rivalry between different labs for solving the gene structure first.viii. Watson's comments that it was much more satisfying to try and have a shot at glory by attempting to solve the gene structure than to never have risked a thought. Reminded me of other academic environments. Even if business people and / or academics adopted a very small part of the general principle that Watson and Cricks' did, they would be much more innovative.ix. Have fun. Watson and Cricks spent a lot of time travelling, eating out, drinking, chasing girls, attending parties - they seemed to be acutely aware of the fact that they (particulary Watson) would be labelled boring and thus strived to be interesting. Have (am?) i been guilty of that as well??x. No ego. Watson, Cricks and most others in the community apprear to talk straight, admit to faults quickly, learn and progress.Overall, a candid first-hand account of the pursuit of the discovery of the \`secret of life' - a must read."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The earlier chapters are somewhat disorganized, but understandably so perhaps: Watson is not exactly a writer. \\"The Double Helix\\" is a fascinating tale about how DNA structure was discovered and understood in detail. It is written in novel form, like a biography - which adds a little more humanity and simplicity to it all. Therefore, anyone can read it.As you get to the middle, it gets quite involved as Watson narrates the ups and downs that he and Crick (and others) encountered. He also writes about the jealousies, tensions, and hardships in science research. He describes his partner, Francis, as a constant talker - almost obnoxious. I found the way Watson described Rosalind Franklin a little unsettling. It seems that he just casts her off as a choleric woman having a hard time in a men's world of science and research. It's clear that he doesn't give her the recognition she deserves. I doubt that Watson and Crick would have solved the structure of DNA without Rose's hard work in crystallography and x-rays.On another note however, it's good that Watson wrote this book when events were still fresh in his mind, as he claims. As for DNA itself...people shall keep on making more and more discoveries a thousand years from now. Watson and Crick (and others) just helped hurl things up to the horizon. Discoveries on DNA, chromosomes, genes, etc. shall continue to unprecedented heights. And who knows what else is out there that we don't know?I almost gave it 4 stars, but truth be told: my mind was less than piqued by Watson's writing style.

James Watson, the author of the book, speaks not only of his research with Francis Crick, but his relationships with most members of the DNA team; Maurice Wilkins, Linus Pauling, and Rosalind Franklin are all characters in the book. It's interesting to read Watson's views on these people, but if it's one complaint I have about this book it is that it is in the point of view in which you can only understand Watson's views. You do not fully understand what these other people contributed. It is a very bias piece book. It's pretty sad that after all the work Rosalind Franklin did, she is not recognized as genuinely as Watson and Crick are. It is sad that she died probably of cancer, and as a result of her work with radiation.As previously stated, this book was very informative, but not overly scientific. The vocabulary was explained, which was helpful, coming from someone who does not have a very large genetic vocabulary to begin with. Watson is quite humorous, as he once states that he likes to be \\"seated near the evenings box of chocolates.\\" He talks about his personal life, too, as opposed to simply stating the facts that he has discovered while working with DNA. He talks about his sister, Elizabeth Watson, and he talks about his disliking of \\"Rosy\\" Franklin. Watson journeyed to many different colleges throughout his life, and he speaks of those with the highest dignity.This book was an overall good to read. It was very informative yet also enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"(Referring to the UK Penguin edition, 1971)As Dr. Joe Black of Louisiana College Professor Emeritus attests, &quot;It reads like a great mystery&quot;--a rarity for science books of the popular thread.This book truly is the exciting account of Watson and Crick's race to discover the structure of DNA. The book is as plainly entertaining as that. Watson writes with plain elegance, which no offense to most scientists, is refreshing. The author relates not only his excitement and energy of his work toward the Double Helix, but also the (now) historical context of the race to discover as well as the immense gravity of the implications of its discovery.The reader does absorb a little science jargon in the descritions of the biological and physics work of Watson and Crick respectively, but the writing is so direct that it appeals to the lay reader. It is a must read for any student interested in medical and/or biological research and genetics. Science has come a long way since the discovery of DNA's structure and this book describes the event that changed the course of science forever."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Watson and Crick's discovery has been compared to Darwin's for biological impact and it would be fair to rate Watson's book alongside Darwin's &quot;Voyage of the Beagle&quot; as a work of scientific literature. The technical details are graspable by the layman, and Watson's skills as a portraitist are hard to overrate. No one else who has tried to tell this story comes close to this protagonist's inside version."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I am a college student in Northern California and an extra credit oppertunity was presented if we read this book. In college we read many books some of which are very boring to read and this sounded like one to me. It was imperitive that I did all I could for my Biology class so I went out and purchased the story of James Watson and Francis Crick. I love to read adventure stories and this book (Double Helix) was a great adventure novel. I had no idea that a scientist has the ability to write a story of discovering DNA in adventure format. James Watson was much like myself, and I could relate to him real well when he went on to write about how he wanted to avoid different aspects of science just like myself. All he was interested in was genetics and DNA extraction and he would do all it takes to put himself in the position of discovering the Double Helix. Through some luck and alot of knowledge Watson and Crick meet up with each other and went on to eventually decoding DNA. I recommmend this book to all that are interested in reading a great adventure story about Watson and his travels through Europe and what eventually brought him to meet one of the worlds greatest scientist ever. This is a book I finished and really, really enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I found the book fascinating and couldn't put it down.It is too bad the CD of the movie cost almost $200.00"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Wonderfully written book that unfolds like a novel, making the story of discovering DNA's structure unforgettable.

I read the original while in graduate school in the 90's. I really enjoyed the new edition's annotations by the editors. The letters and excerpts from notebooks greatly add to the intrigue and drama of this amazing story. For instance, the inclusion of letters to Rosalind Franklin and Linus Pauling's thoughts on nucleic acid structure from his notebook just add many more layers to a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"While I am glad to see the current rush to purchase M. Greene's best seller (which I reviewed), there are good arguments for putting first priority on Watson's The Double Helix. Not only did Watson and Crick win the Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA, but Watson reveals much about what makes a Creative Genius tick (which Greene's book does not). One of these ingredients is non-conformity, even non-conformity with the mainstream of one's own field of research. Watson is non-conformist to the point of embarrassment, revealing his arguments with colleagues whom I would describe as Ingenious Followers in part at least (as well as those colleagues' own weaknesses). Secondly, Creative Geniuses have an unusually strong motivation typically. In the case of Watson and Crick, they had a competitive spirit to win against their colleagues (who were also trying to unravel DNA) in the race for the discovery, and their competitive spirit was an absolute obsession &quot;day and night&quot;. Thirdly, they built ingenious toy models of DNA with movable parts which enabled them to use more sensory modalities to help them think. Fourthly, they kept up completely with what their rivals were doing, which is to say that they sought and used information wisely and in a timely manner. Fifth, they used the computer technology of their era to the fullest (which Creative Geniuses sometimes do not do - compare Roger Penrose, whose books I have reviewed). Sixth, they were incredibly mobile - they went to different countries frequently to learn, to attend seminars, to talk with experts in particular areas, especially countries in Europe (where Creative Geniuses are more common, in my opinion, than in most parts of the world). You will find many other characteristics of Creative Geniuses by reading the Watson-Crick story yourself."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA written by James D. Watson is a rather engaging with a easily readable down to earth style book on the discovery of the structure of DNA. James D. Watson and Francis Crick worked on the structure of DNA, as did other of the time L. Pauling and R. Franklin were hot on the heals of Watson and Crick.This is the story of how they made history, a story by a scientist about scientists, this is a superbly human tale of how a very unusual 23 year old American saw his chance for scientific immortality and set out to seize it.If you like reading about about discovery and how it was done, then you'll like this book. Written in a folksy mannor, this is a book that is thrilling as you get to experience the discovery firsthand. Here you'll read about observation, the suspense of making this discovery before others and the mounting tension associated with science. You'll feel Watson's brilliance come through the narrative, his frank tone mixed with humor all making this a fast read, but never boring.You'll be transported back to college, Cambridge, off to London and Paris, experience things like wine, movies, and girls, but you'll feel the undertone of scientific politics at its finest. This is a very entertaining book about the beautiful experience of making a great scientific discovery."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"gfsdffdg oh dear god it was just terrrible. i hated this book so much. i cant even believe i read the whole thing"},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"GOOD UPDATE OF CLASSIC CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE.WATSON IS NOT LIKEABLE, BUT TELLS IT AS HE SAW IT - WARTS AND ALL.'ROSIE' WAS ALSO NOT LIKEABLE BUT DID HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE.CRICK WAS FUN.THEY WERE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO KNEW MORE THAN THEY DID E.G.

In my opinion, the book was very well done for a person looking for some real insight into the technical parts of the discovery of the structure DNA.I recomend it for a person trying to learn about the discovery of DNA from a scientific standpoint, or for someone doing a research report. However I would not reccomend this book for an individual looking for an easy read. This book will go hand in hand with a high intensity biology or bio-chem class, but not for a \\"hobby reader\\".In conclusion, I give this book 3 out of 5 stars; I think the intensity and density of the technical terms at times were difficult to get through and brought down the enjoyment of certain parts of the book, but once past the technicallities I think that this book was very interesting and great insight to the real story behind one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"I bought this used Double Helix for my MCB reading.

It is really a story of drama, espionage, deception and a little bit of exploratory science. Captivating narrative and inspiring in some ways. But, not the &quot;high class&quot; I was expecting.Personal Chatter:The book gave glimpses of how much pressure &quot;doing science&quot; can be. I thought pure science (or at least the kind that gets people the Nobel) is generally done with a pristine pursuit of the truth with not much time pressures. But, in the world of annual conferences, research paper deadlines, high profile spending, and expectations of &quot;ROI&quot; in almost anything, it was only a matter of time before any serious science had to answer to corporate/defense spending and peer pressures. In light of such a situation, it is no surprise that there can be people who actually have a game-plan (and in some ways, a business plan) to get the Nobel prize. Venture Capitalists invest in people and ideas to make companies that will be bought by others or will go public. Defense spending (and increasingly corporate spending) invests in scientists to get big-tag prizes, and protectionist patents that will give them first dibs at cash-cow-products/projects. At least, that is the reality of today."},{"Title":"The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA","review":"Before one sits down to read this novel, you must first understand that it is the personal account of James Watson, one of two Nobel Prize laureates who won the race in the discovery of DNA. As a result of his singular perspective, certain aspects will be biased to a given degree, an example being his views on Rosalind Franklin (an individual whom many believe Watson stole research material from).In this novel Watson actively reflects his trials and tribulations in his struggle to research the biochemical deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). As he unravels his tales and discoveries leading up to his ultimate success, Watson, humorously adds his own sense of style and wit in the telling of his personal encounters as well as Crick's (his partner). He is also able to balance the pros and the cons of his tedious scientific exploration. At times thoroughly illustrating his frustration in his attempts to understand DNA.Reading this novel allows a reader to easily identify Watson's passion and drive in his analyzes of DNA in correlation to other \\"building blocks\\" of life (e.g. RNA). These characteristics provide an explanation why he is so willing to further investigate DNA even after its discovery as a unique structure, unlike other scientists within the same field of research.Although this is not a difficult novel to peruse through, \\"What is all the hype about?\\" is a question that may resurface several times within the reader's mind. Thus, one must remember the time frame in which this discovery was made. Unlike our current scientific advances in the field of genetics, Watson and Crick were pioneers (along with a handful of others) in this field and prompted a new branch of biology as well as biochemistry to evolve as a result of their findings. Without this discovery many questions regarding medical and health issues would still be left unanswered. More importantly our current understanding of genetics would not be where it is today. Let alone the discoveries made within the Human Genome Project."},{"Title":"The Manor Houses of England","review":"211 pages; 7&quot; x 10&quot;; hardcover.The author lived from 1854-1930 I believe.

I would sooner see more of Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch and Jacob Hertz quoted.This does not, in my opinion take away from the work, but two things do: I would find the translations easier to read if it were not in italics and (much more importantly) the passing off of Rashi's commentary on Song of Songs as a \\"translation\\" is far less than honest, no matter what they believe the text is an allegory about the relationship between G-d and Israel or a love poem (more likely it is both)."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"Thank you so much Amazon for providing an affordable Chumash.

The translation is excellent (and in my personal opinion, far more readable than the JPS version), and the commentary is very helpful. I will note that this is an Orthodox Chumash, and the commentary does reflect that--it's heavy on rabbinical references, and where disagreements arise, defers to Rashi.It's nicely printed--very durable, surprisingly thick paper for such books, and the text is pleasantly large and easy on the eyes--probably Times New Roman, 12-14 point, would be the best comparison. My only issue is that the English translation is set in italics, which is a very minor thing. It's also larger than some of the other volumes out there, even some single-volume editions of the entire Tanakh. But with the larger print, it's very well worth it.I do, however, disagree with a previous reviewer that this is 'only a starting point.' Rather, I've found that it grows with the reader (though one should always read multiple commentaries). The Hebrew text is well-printed, clear and in a large size, with both vowels and cantillation markings. Sections that use a different trope depending on whether they're being read at home or in the synagogue (ex. the Ten Commandments in Exodus) have both versions given. Additionally, Rashi's commentary is included in Hebrew, in the traditional Rashi script. The Targum Onkelos is printed alongside the Hebrew text, useful for those learning Aramaic in preparation for Talmud study in the original.The haftarot are also included (English and Hebrew) with a brief introduction relating each to the parashah it accompanies, but otherwise there is little commentary. Other references include maps, an index, and illustrations (ex. of the priestly vestments).In conclusion, if one is looking for a single-volume Chumash, this one is highly recommended, particularly for converts and those returning to Judaism after many years away, and who are thus not as familiar with the material.Artscroll [...] publishes this volume, making it available also in other colors and sizes."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"The Chumash is just beautiful and well worth the price.

It will give someone a taste of traditional learning, but for the real thing a student will need to take the time and effort to read the sources in the original.Ultimately as other reviewers have pointed out the commentary summaries are chosen with the bias towards the haredi interpretation of charedi Judaism. When they find the text of Torah problematic, such as the Song of Songs, they just refuse to translate it correctly and instead \\"translate\\" it according to their interpretation of Rashi.Bias is not only in what one includes but what one excludes.That said this sefer does what it sets out to do.

It does not have transliteration, however it does have lots of the commentary that is so important to the Jewish people."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"Keep in mind this is very Jewish, which is not a bad thing, I use it every day to study the Torah portion.

Very easy reading the notes are very informative. They give understanding as to what was meant and being said. If any student of the Bible wants to truly understand what God was saying and is saying to us then they need to add this product to their library along with other Jewish books. The good news is truly of the Jew. Very much worth the money."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"This is a must for any Jewish home. Almost every Orthodox Shul (excluding the Chasidishe Shuls in Brooklyn and Kiryas Yoel) in America has numerous copies for the Torah readings. This Chumash is also a required purchase for any potential convert (the vast majority of Orthodox Rabbis require this for conversion)."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"The Stone Edition Chumash which has the Torah, haftarah, and various commentary by Rashi and other great sages, is one of the best study guides for Torah. It has a very clear and accurate translation and also has the Hebrew texts along with the aramaic texts of the commentators. I recommend The Stone Edition Chumash for all serious students."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not Jewish. I'm something of an amateur religious studies kind of guy, and over the years I've read the sacred texts of almost every major world religion.Of all of the copies of the \\"Old Testament\\" I've ever read, whether from Christian, Jewish, or secular sources, this is by far, -far and away- the best. I've recommended it to my Christian friends as an excellent source. It's an easy read on the basic level, but the notes and explanations allow a student to expand the reach of their education.It's not cheap, but it's well made, beautiful to hold, and will probably outlast you."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"I have been so engrossed in reading this Torah, that I even take it to work.

Running commentary and explanation along the bottom of the pages fills in all necessary information from Talmudic and Midrashic sources, as well as a compendium of notes from the traditional commentators. Includes Hebrew and English texts on opposite pages, along with Rashi and the Aramaic translation of Onkelos."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"I have used this Chumash literally thousands of times and variations of it since I was a young child. Now, older and wiser, I study in Yeshiva and learn Torah on a daily basis. What Artscroll does is pick and choose which commentaries to include in order to fit their agenda. Before reading it, I know which midrash or Rashi they will cite in favor of an equally valid Onkelos, Rambam or Ramban (or the other way around). If you wish to stick to one view that is valid, though the views of Gedolim are contingent upon numerous variables. While make no mistake about it if it is a choice between this and some conservative or reformed Chumash- the choice is obvious. Though I do believe, as does my Rabbi, that for all the good Artscroll does, they do equally if not more harm."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"This is the best book I have every purchased, other than my Bible.

I often learn from the Artscroll Commentary and appreciate it. It does use a wide variety of traditional sources. It lacks Hertz's breadth , willingness to encounter the world outside, effort to see Tannach through non- Jewish eyes always. Its translation too reflects this tendency to insularity which I believe costs the Jewish people a great deal. Again I learn from this Chumash, appreciate its excellent presenting of traditional Torah knowledge including reading of Midrashim. But I think it lacks Hertz's broadmindedness and Hirsch's magnificent sublimity .It is a more down- to - earth kind of work. I cannot help but feeling it reflects a certain change which from my point- of - view is regrettable in the Jewish world, a change from being ready to intellectually challenge and meet with others, to one in which we hide within our own insularity.This is a good Chumash but I can imagine in my mind the Jewish people creating a far better one."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"Aside from the direct translation from Hebrew, the added Rabbi commentary really helps the reader to fully understand the scriptures.

If you only want one Chumash in your library then make this the one.Being a convenient, easy to read, concise one volume Chumash, the author had no choice but to narrow his commentary. After all, you cannot fit the waters of the ocean into a bucket. One must understand that the commentary does not even scratch the service of inner meaning of the text. It is simply a minimum line or put in a positive way, a springboard to further study.So I suppose it is only fair of me to suggest another Chumash that one can advance to. &quot;The Call of the Torah&quot; by Rabbi Elie Munk is a five-volume set also published by Artscroll. Rav Munk combines both the classic commentaries of Rash&quot;i, Ramba&quot;m, Ramba&quot;n etc, the &quot;peshat&quot; of his teacher Rav Hirsh and also the more hidden Torah of Kabbalah. This as well as his own beautiful and intelligent ideas, adds up to a Chumash that is a must for all Jews that wish to delve just that little bit deeper."},{"Title":"The Chumash: The Stone Edition, Full Size (ArtScroll) (English and Hebrew Edition) The Torah: Haftaros and Five Megillos with a Commentary Anthologized from the Rabbinic Writings","review":"I used to use the Hertz Chumash that is common in most Conservative and Orthodox synagogues. Now when I am in synagogue, I go looking for a Stone Chumash, which I find far superior to Hertz. Unfortunately, others do as well, and the supply is not yet up to the demand. Now I own my own.Not only is the Stone Chumash an easy-to-read translation with fascinating commentaries, it also includes various tables and charts, such as geneology charts and timelines of events, and drawings of items in the Mishkan, which help give the Torah more meaning. For those who want more depth, the Hebrew text includes all of the traditional commentators in the margins."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},D=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function E(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",B,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",N,"See more"))],8,D)):b("",!0)])}const M=u(x,[["render",E],["__scopeId","data-v-a22a53c4"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/44.md","filePath":"people/44.md"}'),q={name:"people/44.md"},P=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
