This book was an absolute pleasure to read, as I found myself going beyond the assigned readings. I finished the entire book from beginning to end within the span of two weeks!Even if you aren't very interested in art history, THE STORY OF ART remains a must read; at worst, you will be entertained, and at best you will gain an entirely new perspective on art. The prose is masterfully written and the analysis he presents is very accessible. He discusses everything from ancient Greek sculpture to Renaissance painting to modern architecture. The reproductions of the artwork in the book are also extremely good (there are several high-quality fold-out pages included, such as one of Leonardo's Last Supper pre-restoration). I was very pleased with both the amount and breadth of coverage he provided.Even though I haven't read any other introductory art history books, I find it hard to believe that any other book could do the job as well as Gombrich has done it here. I would highly recommend THE STORY OF ART to anyone who wants an art history primer."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"I must say that this is the best comprehensive art historical book that I have ever come across. It's actually a book that I have been reading more for pleasure than for study, and I recommend it to anyone who is even remotely interested in painting, architecture or any artistic elements. The photos are fantastically sharp and accurately placed near if not next to the corresponding text and in no way is it difficult to read or understand. The author writes as if he were explaining it to the reader for the first time, but it does not feel elementary in any way. An excellent book with fantastic promise. I have learned much with very little effort - the best way to study!!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"One of Gombrich's many virtues is his ability to convey in clear, yet rich prose his depth of understanding and love of art. However, as I rethink my art history survey offerings I feel a need to break away from texts that have such a strong authorial viewpoint as this one. I'd prefer a text that presents a number of interpretations of a single work, such as the one by Laurie Schneider Adams, or a more neutral tone, as in the survey by Stokstad. It is essential that students learn to question what they read. There is a long tradition for art history texts to come across as &quot;Bibles.&quot; The prose is so eloquent, and the cultural mastery so impressive that many students leave a course believing that they've learned the &quot;truth&quot; about certain artists, rather than cultivated opinions based upon clusters of available information."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"In my opinion, \\"The Story of Art\\" is the best gift for yourself and others. Why?. Because it is one of those few books that allows you to achieve several objectives at the same time... It can introduce the reader to art, or allow him to continue with his studies. It gives him the opportunity of learning, but also entertains and captivates him.Yes, of course that it is long, and because of that somehow scary the first time you see it. But if you manage to start it, you will find that you will finish it in no time at all. The reason for that is the author, E.H. Gombrich. His prose is fluent, and easy to understand, but what is more important, he doesn't merely enumerate facts: he tries to explain them, setting them in a historical background. And by doing that, compels and engages the reader, making him think about art and its \\"evolution\\", and about why the story of art is \\"A story without end\\".The book brings a lot of illustrations regarding the artworks discussed by the author, including several fold-outs that I appreciated enormously. The reproductions allow the reader to \\"see\\" what the author tries to explain, and make the book even more dynamic.Now in its 16th updated edition, this book is already a classic. Maybe the reason for that popularity can be explained by the author. Gombrich's aim was to help others to understand art, from cave painting to postmodern art. He believes that his book is immensely liked by students and art-lovers because \\"it has made them see how the story of art hangs together\\".On the whole, I highly recommend \\"The story of art\\" to everybody interested in art. I believe it is exactly what you need :)Bel&eacute;n"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"I took an Art Appreciation course my senior year of college and this was the text book that my instructor gave to us. From day one I loved the course and I highly enjoyed reading the book. Dr. Lambertson stood before our class the last day of teaching and told us not to sell our books back because we would regret it later. He swore by this book. He was right too. I was so desperate for money that I sold back my edition of the book and since that day, five years ago, I have kicked myself REPEATEDLY for selling that book back. There was so many things I wanted to look up in it and then remembered that I'd been enough of an idiot to sell back my copy of the book. I'm very, very pleased that Amazon is offering this book up for sale.The book itself combines the history of the world and art (which makes sense). It shows how history influences art and how art changes over time. The photos and prints in the book are spectacular as well. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about art (or history) and if (like me) you're trying to get someone with artistic talent interested in art history I'd recommend getting this book for them.I'm buying two copies. One for me and one for my artistically talented sister. Thank you Dr. Lambertson for introducing me to this book."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"This book is concise, even though fairly comprehensive. It gives beginers in this field the necessary basis and never gets boring. One reads and learns, and enjoys the many pictures in the book. Gombrich is simple, clear, and above all, he loves the master pieces he introduces. He makes one discover the major periods, the major movements and also the life of the major Masters.It is as instructing as a History book, and as captivating as a Novel: the Story of Art is definitely a good title!The first book one should have on the subject."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"About a year ago, I suddenly decided that it was about time I learned something about art history. After reading all the reviews about this book, I decided that this was the book for me. And so it was. I would never have imagined that it could be so entertaining to read about art history. A previous reviewer called this a simplified historical description of art from the perspective of an authoritarian male, white, european. Maybe it is simplified. So what! That's excactly what I needed at the time I bought this book. It has always been quite clear to me that this book was only an introduction to art. Since it was so entertaining I was able to finish it, and I have finally learnt to appreciate art. Because of this my second visit to Louvre in Paris was a lot more fun than my first visit there.I guess it's true that the author was a white, european male. What does this have to do with anything? The book is mainly about western art, so I don't see why it matters that he's european. And in the history of western art, how many non-white or female artists are there? I guess there are some from the previous century, but that is quite a small part of the book. So the author was a white, european male, like most of the artists in the history of western art.Some people have pointed to the fact that the book is a bit biased. Well, that is probably one of the things that makes it such an entertaining read. I highly recommend this book if you need an introduction to art."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"this is a wonderfully conceived and written history of western art from cave painting to the late 20th century. gombrich tells the story by focusing on the essential ideas or achievements characteristic of each artist and art epoch. each chapter is about 5 or 6 pages of text and several large format art reproductions (there are several fold out images of works such as botticelli's &quot;birth of venus&quot; or pollock's &quot;one&quot;). the narrative is conversational, concise, well informed, and extremely intelligent; the book reads as though you are strolling through an immense museum with gombrich at your side, commenting on paintings and sculptures as you go.gombrich manages to teach the reader how to look at art at the same time he explains the main historical developments and style points of each movement or period. new students of art will find the book is a pleasurable and clear guide; experienced readers will enjoy gombrich's judicious use of detail and selection. a bibliography, chronological charts of art epochs and artists' lives, maps of europe and an index conclude the book."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"If you would like to own only one (I hope not) single volume about Art, this is the one. It is concise, yet not oversimplistic, educative and entertaining and it tells the story, not just facts. Kind regards, Mario."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Whenever people mention art or art history, I think back to my Humanities classes at Michigan State. Gombrich's &quot;The Story of Art&quot; was a delighful text. Thorough, yet written in a way that was understandable to someone with very little exposure to art and all the nuances. &quot;The Story of Art&quot; makes the &quot;Study&quot; of art enjoyable. I have often regretted re-selling my text back to the book store since it would have made a wonderful reference. How delighted I am to find this book to still be available!!!"},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"There are many good books on art. There are some great ones.

He tells it as it is with great passion and enthusiasm. I have read lots of other art books but they don't have it all like this book. It is like a magical ingredient, it's well written and yet accessible to all. I bought my first copy when I was 19 as a student. Now I am a teacher and I use it to pass on the knowledge to the next generation. Quality as they say never goes out of style and this book is quality. Sure there could be more female exemplars but this book does the job."},{"Title":"The Story of Art","review":"Well Known Reference book on art. Good Read if you enjoy this topic.

For Voltaire's part, when he is spoken of, it is generally in regard to &quot;Candide,&quot; certainly a great work, but not the be-all or end-all of his particular genius. &quot;Letters on England,&quot; a series of musings on his exile in England from 1726-1729, is a work which gives a much different perspective on Voltaire from the cynical, suspected atheist we've all come to know and love.The primary focal points of the &quot;Letters&quot; are comparsions of England and France in the realms of religion, politics, and the arts and sciences. While Voltaire clearly criticizes the French institutions of his day, he does not intend us to look at England as the ideal society. In religious matters, Voltaire derides the monolith of French Catholicism, acknowledging the relative harmlessness of English sectarianism - saying &quot;if there were only one relgion in England, there would be danger of despotism...but there are thirty, and they live in peace and happiness&quot;. Politically, Voltaire admires the progress England has made since the Magna Carta, even though it means limited enfranchisement, and division of legislative power. In the arts and sciences, Voltaire examines the ingenuity of philosophers like Bacon, Newton, and Locke, and the ability of authors like Shakespeare, Pope, Swift, Wycherley, and others, to make their reputations and livings largely independent of a feudal patronage system.Throughout the &quot;Letters,&quot; Voltaire privileges common sense, forward thinking, and right reasoning. As I understand it, the main purpose of satire is as a social corrective. Voltaire points out the flaws in both the French and English nations, not to be simply critical, but to encourage progress in thought, in science, and the institutions that govern civilized countries. Voltaire was no revolutionary, mind you, but it is obvious throughout the text that he cares deeply about France and its international relations. Voltaire looks so far ahead in his writing to anticipate our own current debates over health care (the availability of infant innoculation, and euthanasia), equal opportunity regardless of faith or race, and so on.For such a brief work, Voltaire covers a lot of intellectual ground in &quot;Letters on England&quot;. His style, enthusiasm, sense of wonder, and incisive commentary makes this a non-fiction counterpart to Montesquieu's fictional &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. While Voltaire himself dislikes and distrusts translations, I've always thought that if you can read a translation, react strongly to the material, and get the basic points, then the translation must be counted as successful. Leonard Tancock's translation in this Penguin Classic edition must be counted by me, at least, as successful. My admiration of Voltaire has been enhanced, and I feel just a little bit more enlightened. &quot;Letters on England&quot; is an excellent work in any language."},{"Title":"Letters on England (Cassell national library, new series)","review":"Letters on England is enlightening on several levels and a very interesting description of the society politics and science of England in the mid 18th century from a French point of view. Voltaire being profoundly interested in all aspects of life and all types of knowledge provides an astounding account of sundry aspects of England from his patently Voltaire style. He makes the book interesting by including his take on some of the peculiarities of English life. Many of the letters are rather short and they need not be read in any particular sequence. The style is strait forward and they are relatively objective for Voltaire's work. I think these letters are indicative of Voltaire's style and provide a unique glimpse of many often overlooked aspects of English culture in the 18th century.He is particularly interested in the Quakers and devotes several of his letters entirely to their customs and beliefs. Yes these letters are certainly interesting. For anyone studying religious toleration (or intolerance) in England these letters may be of certain value.My favorite and possibly the most endearing letters is the one devoted to Francis Bacon. He alludes to the fact that Bacon was involved in an embezzlement scandal for which he was removed from office. Of course this is certainly true but he, as many others have, forgives him for this since he has provided so much for mankind. I feel that Voltaire saw much of the same in Bacon that he saw in himself. We must remember that Voltaire too was a fantastic speculator (investor) and many accused him of possibly crossing into the realm of less than legal activities.Voltaire's Letters on England are wonderful to read and after breezing through this book you will probably wish, as I have, that there were more to read. That being said I will note that I believe that had anyone else written these letters (except for maybe Montaigne) they would be in some academic library but not published widely. We can thank Voltaire for achieving the fame he did because having such immediate access to these letters is great for students historians and curious readers alike.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Letters on England (Cassell national library, new series)","review":"This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. Voltaire's (mostly complimentary) commentary on the English spans religion, government, philosophy, and science. It's always interesting to read a great thinker's take on other great thinkers. Most of Voltaire's subjects will be familiar to modern readers (e.g. Quakers, John Locke, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Shakespeare...) which makes the book easily readable by a contemporary audience.The humor is sharp and the observations are keen throughout. And it's free!Note that this version leaves out a letter on Pascal that is included in some other collections."},{"Title":"Letters on England (Cassell national library, new series)","review":"Material receive in great condition.

He speaks (well) to aspects such as rhythm and shape of line in each chapter, never sacrificing the other musical parameters to the all-too-common primacy of pitch. There is a useful balance of prose to musical examples.Benjamin includes linear analyses of several examples. This provides a solid introduction to Schenkarian concepts for lower-division students, and yet they can easily be skipped by those who prefer.This text has a satisfactory anthology of JS Bach pieces at the back. This is important at schools where textbook budgets for most students are slim.I have yet to use the last few chapters in my one-semester course, but in a year-long sequence, they would be welcome."},{"Title":"The Craft of Tonal Counterpoint","review":"I just want to warn people who want this book as a self-study course. Think twice.I especially have a hard time understanding the graphical analyzes, - it is poorly explained. Trying to work with this book, you really miss a teacher to present a clear structure which this book doesn't have. Or at least you can't see it!But still, as a reference book it's great, there is so much in it!One more thing, this book deals more or less only with the instrumental music of Bach - it hardly covers choral harmonisation. This is strange as it is said that Bach himself gave his students 4-voice choral harmonisation assignments in the beginning - he wrote the bass-line and sometimes even the melody line - then they filled in the other voices.One last thing,I do miss the general species approach which is so great for structure in self-study.I feel that either I would have to find a teacher to take me through this book or buy another book, which is so sad, because you get the feeling that this author knows what he is talking about! - the main reason for the 4 stars.So think twice, and if you are short on money and want to study by yourself - buy another book!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i am yet to finish the book but is kind of boring to me.

The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece.

It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner. I wanted the story to go on. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"While this book is often relegated to \\"girl's fiction\\", Little Women should be read by anyone interested in American literature and history. Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. These sisters are very differnt. Meg, who dreams of having a husband and a family. Jo, who is a tomboy and who dreams of being a published writer. Beth, who is nice and sweet and loves to play the piano. Amy, who is vain and a good artist. Everytime I read this book, I cry. If you have or do read this book you know why. A very touching story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a really great book! If you haven't read it yet, READ IT TODAY!!! It's a great book that reads all too quickly. It's very strongly emotioned,so just about the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who are ashamed to cry! Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!? Log off, shut down and read!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"MAY17,2001YES, I HAVE READ lITTLE WOMEN. I ENJOYED THE BOOK BECAUSE FOR ONE IT WAS DURING THE TIME OF THE CIVL WAR TIMES,AND BECAUSE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE READING ABOUT MY SISTERS."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a wonderful book that shows how 4 sisters love each other through happiness and sorrow and pain. It is one of the most wonderful books of it's times."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is great! I love it and would even say that it is my favorite book. It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls. The book is set around the 1800s and includes all the prides,joys, fashions and styles of this time. I recomend that you read it. I know I enjoyed the descriptive tale of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a very interesting, realistic story. The different situations that these four girls go through are both heartwarming, sad, and interesting. I recommend that every person should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was an amazing book that pretty much kept me reading the entire time. I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read. It is the complete and unabridged version and the reader can tell that there's a difference. The story centers around four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy who are growing up during the Civil War. Add one loving mother, Marmee, the boy next door, Laurie, his tutor, John Brooke, and Friedrich Baher, a German professor and you have the best book of all time!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read.

Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic.

This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book.

My daughter (11) loved this book adn so did I when I was a girl"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"it is a really nice novel. it is so good that i wish i could read it more. it was like i was witnessing the whole story myself . it was a really nice experiance. we can learn so much from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Definitely a classic that I think should be required reading.

I recieved mine new from a seller."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"THis book was delivered in the condition promised (Brand new and shrink-wrapped). Great price too!Thanks."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people.

This is awesome reading!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is timeless- beautifully written, interesting, and with themes that transcend generations. I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

I bought this copy because I wanted a nice, hardbound version and I liked the illustrations."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"An adorable book that may seem long at times.The story is about a family with four daughters,Meg,Jo,Beth and Amy. The book opens when the father is away at war. It is Christmas time and the girls and their mother, whom they call Marmee, haven't much to live on but love. This book is a recounting of their lives, until three of them get married and have babies of their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places. Iprefer to watch my soap operas on tv. And some of the words were British, and I never did find out what they meant. Other than those faults, it was a grand book, and I give it a rating of 3.5 stars:)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book month ago. I love it. Lousia May used her childhood stories wrote this book. In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers. If you like to knew about Louisa May Alcott, you should read this book, Jo acted a lot like Louisa May herself. I like is book very much it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have been wanting to read LITTLE WOMEN since I was in BYE BYE BIRDIE in high school because of an allusion made to the book by Rosie Alvarez and Albert Peterson. However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN. It has all sorts of great messages about faith, love, and life. It's a great book and I now know why it is Albert Peterson's favorite novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Oh,my sweet Lord I love this book!How original and captivatingcan one book be?From a girl who L-U-V-S Harry Potter ,Redwall,Chronicles of Narnia,The lost years of Merlin,Artemis Fowl,His Dark Materials,and the like,this book was quite out of theordinary.But I found this book thoroughly ripping and a smashinggood read.What a marvelous book!Warm and tender with a lot of TLC(tender Loving Care)!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"You should read this book because it is really exciting. It is about 4 girls and their rich next door neighbour Lauire. The girls miss their Dad who is away at war. Although the family is poor they are happy. Beth (the second youngest) catches a disease and her sisters care for her. At the end, Christmas is very special because their father comes home from war. I think only girls should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a good book overall. There are enjoyable, funny, romantic and sad parts in the book, but sometimes it was too detailed and descriptive. I did like the closeness of the family shown throughout the book through good times and bad. I like how they all learn about life while they're growing up together. I would probably have to read it again to fully understand it and get all that it has to offer.I also like the richness of the characters. Jo, the tom-boy, Meg, the pretty, mature one, Beth, the sweet, shy one, and Amy the artistic, prim and proper one. They are fun characters to read about along with Laurie, Marmee, Aunt March, and others.I definatly think this is a good novel to read because it is a classic and it would be a good one to read to learn more about the time period.I just wish it wasn't so long."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book is the coming-of-age story of four sisters. In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead. It offers just as much and more... esp. with entertaining situations that as compared to the reviewed are so much more the delightful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Please note that I am rating this particular edition of the novel. The book itself is surprisingly wonderful and easily deserves five stars. This particular edition, however, is flawed. My copy had forty pages missing and replaced with a portion that was already printed in the prior chapters. This was very frustrating, and things were only salvaged when I discovered the power of Google Books. To ensure that your reading pleasure is not disrupted, please consider getting another edition of this fantastic book!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read.

Everybody loves the well-known March girls.Messy Jo,beautiful Meg,sweet Beth and the artistic and ever perfect,Amy.Whether they're putting on a play or forming a secret society,they always do it with confidence and with smiles in their hearts.This lively book will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat the whole way through."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a absolutely great book!!

Take my advice and read both Little Women and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly every year since childhood. This book, as well as Anne of Green Gables, are in my opinion among the best literature about girlhood. As I pass through each stage in my life, I find that I understand one of the girls a little more and see more and more of the universality of its theme. Someone once said that Little Women shows how when you are young, all possibilities seem to stand open before you but as you make choices in life one by one other doors close to you. I plan to pass this book on to my daughters."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"That was one of the best books I've ever read.

My favorite character is Jo, the tomboy. She dosen't like any thing about being a girl. They all miss their father. Jo miss's him. She think it's so dreadful to be poor."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book first some twenty years ago. It was our high-school text book. I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently. This book is very poetic. I like the way the four girls are each interested in different things; for example Meg is very motherly, Jo is a tomboy and loves to write and do plays, Beth is shy and thoughtful and Amy is good at art and is very concieted. Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money. They realize that without a lot of money they are really very lucky and also realize that there are others with money that don't have as much family love as they do. I think you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite pieces of classic literature. When I realized I didn't own a copy, I decided to invest in one. So I purchased this edition.I tried reading it, and the font didn't agree with me too much.

Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like the book Little Women because it tought me I dont need money to be happy. The characters Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo, were happy because they had each other.

Meg was the oldest. She had soft brown hair,and was pretty.Jo was a tomboy. The only thing nice about her was her hair."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 10 and on a vacation, and for my lil brain at that age it was great, but now it's just a little too simple that the children always try to do the right thing no matter what, always do as their mother tells them to, and always end up learning something wonderful.

I like James bond more. I grade it 5 stars. This is a girl but one who is a tomboy. But that is my opinon. Most people love it but I did not"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it. Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband. I just can't get behind that."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a very good transaction.

I loved it so much I got it on my kindle."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book has become one of my favorites. I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book. Maybe because they don't stock it?"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Not sure what I can add that other previous reviewers haven't already added except to say I liked it too!

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

Unfortunately whoever published this version left it full of spelling and punctuation mistakes! I can't believe it's sold like this. Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him.

This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read \\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott almost twenty years ago and it remains one of my favorite coming-of-age stories. The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago. It was one of my favorite books as a child. Each of the girls is an amazing charactrer with her own strengths.I love this book as much today a I did when I first read it. There are no formatting issues with the kindle version and you can't beat the price!!A fantastic read that showcases the strength that is woman."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i had heard of this book back in school... i am 27 yrs old now and read it for the 1st time and let me say i have no idea how i let this book slip for so long. it a wonderful story and i will always remember it. it a must read for all girls of any age. so glad i finally read it. would give more than 5 stars if i could."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Near the end of the nineteenth century, a family with four girls is growing up in \\"genteel poverty;\\" their lives derive much strength and goodness from the example and teaching of their loving parents. They are the March family, and they consist of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, guided by their loving \\"Marmee\\" while their father is away in the war.We first meet the \\"little women\\" when the older two are in their teens and the younger two are approaching those adolescent years. We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free. What a lovely tale. Definitely on my list of alltime favorites. I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Despite the Jessie Wilcox Smith illustrations on the front and back covers, I was very disappointed to discover that the artist's color plates that so perfectly capture the characters and events in this American literary classic, were omitted from this edition. Intending to give it as a gift, I ordered this book because I was under the impression that it had the famous Jessie Wilcox Smith pictures. What a disappointment!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How to review a beloved classic such as Little Women? I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover. I was amazed to find this very one on Amazon, because my mom gave me this version 23 years ago, for Christmas! I'd already read Little Women at least twice before she gave me this book. The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old girl (that was the age I received this), because she will keep it forever!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, being one of the classics of American literature, is not surprising to be said one of the best books I have ever read. The story revolves around the home life of four close sisters and two strong, moral parents. As Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up, their adventures and mishaps provide examples for any reader of all ages. As they grow up, they struggle with many ideas. First, they are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they want to be bad. Second, as they grow up, they confront different types of relationships with boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marraige. Finally, two of the most important ideas in the novel are dreams and work. The girls spend their childhoods and adult lives trying to balance the two and fulfill both necessities. Also, throughout the book, society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is portrayed to give the reader a strong sense of what it was like to be living during the 19th century. The book gives the reader some mportant guidance to people in similar circumstances in their adolescent years. The novel motivates positive decision making, looks past materialism, teaches morales, and shows us the importance of real happiness."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This hardbound book by Louisa May Alcott is a MUST for anyone wanting a truly \\"good\\" book for their child or themselves to read. The book is printed on quality paper and beautiful cover. There is also a bookmark incorporated into the binding to keep your place. We have used this with the Unabridged story on CD to help the younger children with their reading. They can listen and follow along. It is a quality story, a timeless classic, in a quality binding. It far surpassed what I had expected in terms of paper, binding, etc. I am so happy we got this book, and the price was more than reasonable for what we received!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This edition of LITTLE WOMEN is great! First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy. This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original. I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang. Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women is a heart-warming story. It is one I would read more than once. I dont see how anyone could not like it,exept maybe boys. I chose it because I had seen the movie and i heard that the book was one you can't go your life without reading,so I went to my school library and checked it out.This book is about four sisters growing up during the 1800's. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome. These things bring them closer and closer. During the war their father must leave for war as a chaplain. While he is there he gets injured and Marmee (the girls mother) has to go take care of him. The girls must help there mother out by taking care of themselves. The girls have to deal with many other things such as losing people they love, getting married,saying goodbye, and falling in love.My favorite character was Marmee I liked her because she was so loving and hardworking. Through the many difficult trials in life she remained strong. When I grow up I hope I can be like that,I don't want to tell you anymore i want to let you read the other things yourself. I hope you don't have anywhere to be because once you start reading this book you can't put it down. I recomend this book for girls of any age, young or old I am sure you will enjoy.WARNING:THIS BOOK CAN MAKE YOU LATE!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was our reading selection for October 2002. We thought this timeless classic story of four sisters was wholesome and heartwarming.This coming of age story that was inspired by the author's real life family teaches family values and morals.

A few of us have read the many times and we all highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is heart-warming and inspiring. It is the story of a family of four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy, their friend Laurie, and their search for their &quot;castles in the air.&quot; The girls go through life trying to follow the example of their good and generous parents. They correct their faults by listening to, learning from, and teaching each other and the people around them. Each person chooses a different path to try and get their wishes or &quot;castles in the air,&quot; as the four March girls call them. The eldest sister, Meg, wishes for first a house full of luxurious things and a lot of money. She then also would like a good husband and healthy children. By the end of part one of the book, Meg is well on her way to getting her wish. However, her priorities seem to switch places. Beth is the &quot;pet&quot; of the family and she deserves it. She is a shy, sweet girl who only opens up to those she trusts. She is the third child and is very attatched to her older sister Jo. Beth's castle in the air is only to live quietly and to take care of those around her. God grants her wish.Amy is the youngest March sister. She has artistic talent and so understandably her wish is to be an artist. Amy tries her best to improve herself and be a lady of society. Her hard work and good sense reward her in the end. Jo is the second eldest sister and the most unique. She doesn't care what others think, except for her family and a few special friends. Jo is stubborn, quick-tempered, and blunt. However, she is also kind, forgiving, and full of passion. She learns her lessons the hard way, but tries to catch others and save them the fall. Jo's dream is to support herself and her family by doing what she loves best, writing.Laurie, or Teddy as Jo calls him, is the neighbor and life long friend. The girls, especially Jo, teach him to get over his bashfulness and help him to grow into a fine young man. He struggles, but this is a hopeful book, and he wins his battle. He also wishes to love and be loved by one of the March sisters. All of the charachters do end up getting their castles in the air. It is very enjoyable to read how their wishes change throughout the book. Little Women is a fantastic novel. It is full of smart lessons and important morals. I especially enjoy how the story tells the difference between loving someone and being in love with someone. I like how the book is hopeful and am inspired to try and correct my faults and go out in search for my own &quot;castles in the air.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was in the middle of Meg and John's first real dinner together since their babies were born and all of a sudden the story switched to Laurie and Amy.

Following the trials of the four March sisters was something that I didn't want to stop when the book ended. It was overall, a book of good will and good nature, full of people who are struggling to find themselves and ending up in places they never quite suspected by the end. But what I found most astonishing about Alcott's characters was how I found a little bit of myself in each one.What I found most fascinating was the culture of the mid-1800s- learning what was proper and not proper, and being astonished at just how much women's roles have changed since then.The book is a very quick and easy read, perfect for young people and adults alike. I was literally absorbed into this story, much like I was with the movie version starring Winona Ryder that was so perfectly cast and faithful to the book, I should hope that all filmmakers are as kind to the literature on which they are based.I highly, HIGHLY recommend Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story takes place mostly at the March's house and the Laurence house which is important because it gives the reader an idea of how the each live and helps the reader understand them better.This book is mostly about four sisters named Margaret, Josephine, Elizabeth and Amy March,their mother Marmee March, Theodore Laurence, Mr. Laurence, they are always helping each other and others in need and are happy the way they are and will always be friends, are always thoughtful, truthful, and use manners even when talking to each other and others and even though they have very few money they still enjoy their lives and Mr.Laurence enjoys the company of them at his house, even though the Laurence's are wealthy the girls him and his grandson the same way they treat each other with respect and tells about their lives.In my opinion this is the best book I've Ever read ! I think this is an educational book because it teaches that money isn't everything that's better to be happy the way you are and you don't need money to be happy and you can be happy by helping people and that you should respect elders and others.I would recommend this book because it's educational and a good book to read when bored or just want to read a book or read an interesting book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong.

It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee.

It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago.

I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task.

I recommend this to people who havea love of mischief and a spirt for adventure.I learned as you grow up that there aredifficult and humorous times in life."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\", written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four sisters, Jo March who is fifteen-years-old, Meg March who is the oldest, Beth March who is thirteen-years-old, and Amy March who is the youngest by twelve-years-old, who live in England with their mother, Marmee. They are poor, and their mother mostly does the working, while their father is out fighting in war, but help out by working little jobs outside of helping in the house. The four sisters go through so much in life, but they don't care much about what others think because they are happy that they were blessed with a father and a mother who love them very much, and they always got each other.\\"Little Women\\" is an amazing book that I recommend to anyone. It teaches people a life lesson, and shows how a person with less fortune lives throughout their lives. As I read this book, so many emotions went through my head, I found myself crying, happy, and wanting to read the book continuously without stopping. This book was originally written in 1868, it being the first novel book that she has ever written. Louis May Alcott was born in the year of 1832 in Massachusetts. She was the second daughter to Bronson Alcott and Abigail May. She had three sisters, Anna, Elizabeth, and Abby. When Louisa was about ten years, her and her family moved to Harvard, Massachusetts. On a hillside farm they planned to establish a model community, Fruitlands, making use of no animal products or labor except, as Abigail Alcott observed, for that of women. She and her small daughters struggled to keep household and farm going while the men went about the countryside philosophizing. In a few months quarrels erupted, and winter weather saw the end of the experiment. The only lasting product of Fruitlands was Louisa's reminiscence, \\"Transcendental Wild Oats.\\" Her and her family moved to Concord and for the next three years lived across the road from Emerson in a house they called Hillside, a relatively happy period preserved in the first chapters of Little Women. Closeness to the Emerson family was important to Louisa. Her first book, Flower Fables, 1854, was written for Ellen Emerson, whose father she idolized. Years later Alcott told Emerson about her early romance. \\"He was much amused,\\" she wrote, \\"and begged for his letters, kindly saying he felt honored to be so worshipped. The letters were burnt long ago, but Emerson remained my 'Master,' while he lived, doing more for me,--as for many another--than he knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a great, good man.\\" In these years, Louisa \\"got religion,\\" as she later put it. Running in the Concord woods early one fall morning, she stopped to see the sunshine over the meadows. \\"A very strange and solemn feeling came over me as I stood there,\\" she wrote in her journal, \\"with no sound but the rustle of the pines, no one near me, and the sun so glorious, as for me alone. It seemed as if I felt God as I never did before, and I prayed in my heart that I might keep that happy sense of nearness all my life\\" (Louis May Alcott). On March 1, 1888, Louisa visited her father for the last time. \\"I am going up,\\" he said. \\"Come with me.\\" \\"Oh, I wish I could,\\" she replied. Bronson Alcott died on March 4, and Louisa May Alcott on March 6. She was buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery in Concord. Her grave bears a Civil War veteran's marker. Throughout her life, she was successful, writing books about inspirational families and people. She was a great person in general as well, leaving a great memory of a wonderful woman who was loving and caring"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't remember if I ever finished this book in high school. If I did, I didn't appreciate it as much as I did now - many, many years later :DIt's a lesson on good manners and right conduct, on faith, on family relationships, parenthood, sisterhood, brotherhood, friendship, neighborliness, courtship, marriage, child-rearing, dreams, frustrations , life itself - all found in the saga of the March sisters from when they were teeners and tweeners through their adulthood. I have highlighted quite a number of lines in this book that I would have shared if not for space limitation. The message is timeless - if we would all have the sense and character that was instilled in the March sisters; if all families were to see and act on its role as the most elemental unit in society(but the most important nonetheless), this world would be a better place for all of humankind."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Unfortunately, I just couldn't embrace this book. However, I also couldn't give it less than three stars because it is such a time tested classic and I could understand why generations of readers have adored it. For me, personally, I found it too feminine and sentimental. The narrative was laced with morals and the romantic and flowery language was tedious. The characters were well developed, though some were more sympathetic than others. As a writer, I had a natural affinity towards Jo, and how could any reader not be fond of gentle Beth. Meg doesn't become interesting until she becomes a mother and I never felt much depth in Amy. Of course Marmee was full of sage advice, Laurie was quite a rascal, and Professor Bhaer was the epitome of kindness. While I did care about what happened to the March family and I was pleased with the conclusion, I didn't feel devotion to the book itself because I'm just not the type of romantic individual who can identify with such feminine notions."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I purchased this audio book to introduce my 10 year old daughter to Little Women. We began listening to it while driving on a seven hour trip. We found that while the story can still engage a modern reader, this version of the audio book was not well delivered. The recording is just a bit flat. The reader sounds like the schoolteacher from Little House on the Prairie. The production does not deliver on the emotional aspect that underlies the text. Maybe we've been spoiled by superb audio-book readers like Jim Dale. But I found this recording a bit disappointing. My daughter finished by book from a print copy rather than continue to listen."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a kid, and loved it. However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version. I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book. The longer version is definitely better.This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. I aquired the audiobook version from audible and listened to it in my car with my seven year old son. I really didn't expect for him to like it and though he never seemed to pay attention to it - however he always knew what was going on and was quite upset that the ending didn't play out the way he wanted. Apparently my little 7 year old boy who revels in dirt and climbing trees is a closet romantic and expected a wedding - no matter that the characters were a bit too young to get married.The short summary - We follow the March family, 4 dutiful daughters and their mother through the period of time that their father is away at war (I believe he's a chaplain). They befriend their neighbors and go through several trials, all learning to be better people through it all.It doesn't sound very exciting does it? Well it's not exciting in the shootem up explosion type way - but it is very engaging and endearing. Many people argue that this book has lost it's luster since the girls spend time sewing, studying and functioning in rather \\"old fashioned\\" ways. Some have even complained of the overtly religious overtones. I personally though it was a wonderful story of four young girls learning each in their own way - that life can be hard, life can be heartbreaking, death is very real, but then so is love, friendship and joy. Some argue that Mrs. March is an unattainable visiage of a \\"perfect mother\\" however I argue that we see her only through her daughters' eyes - and that every mother is on a pedestal in the eyes of their daughters. We don't know if the moments when she is out of site, she is sobbing at her loneliness or having bouts of internal rage at the behavior of her children. She simply projects and outward calm, which most mothers attempt to keep in front of their children.There is a certain beauty to this story, each of the girls has their own personal battle to fight within themselves and we watch as they find ways to overcome, either their envy, their vanity, their selfishness - some turn to friendship, others to prayer. I have to admit that I too had hoped for the ending that my little son wanted - even though I knew it was silly to wish for two young people to end up together, but who knows what the future holds for them after the last page of the book.The simple fact that a little seven year old ADHD boy was able to love and care about the people in this story, and to have hopes for them - shows the power of the writing contained within. I highly recommend this book - even to those who are not into \\"romance\\" or \\"period literature.\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story about four sisters who live with their mother. I thought it was a great story because it is really easy to figure out what they are doing in a jiff. The best part of this book is that it shows the characters have feelings and emotions that are throughtout the whole story. The story explains to me what it was like to live back in the older days. Yet to me this book seems new. If I could say who represents me most,it is Jo. Jo is a great reader and it comes in handy when she meets a boy named Laurie. Laurie is a rich kid who ends up being like family to these sisters. This story really reminds of how life is sometimes. Will you find out what happens to these sisters?

A MUST-read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"very timely delivery. got for granddaughter and know she will love it. every young girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My first actual introduction to Little Women came from watching the Winona Ryder version of the film on a snowy, beautiful day in New England during my sophmore year of high school. I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked this book sooo much! Sometimes the way the language was back then, i had a little bit of a hard time understanding it, but all in all what a wonderful story, and i fell in love with all the sisters in the novel! Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott has been undervalued for most of its history. This book is a true American Classic. Published originally in October of 1868, it is a story set during the Civil War, but Alcott does not deal with the specifics of the war. Instead, it serves as the pretext for the absence of Robin March, the father of the four \\"Little Women\\", for a large portion of the first book. The novel today actually consists of two books, the original \\"Little Women\\" from 1868, and the sequel \\"Good Wives\\" which was published the following year in April of 1869. The two volumes started being treated as one in 1880.The first book deals with the growing maturity of the four sisters, and in particularly of Jo and Meg as they have to learn to help their mother out more and do with less during the war, and while their father is away. Meg is the eldest at 16 when the story begins, and Jo (who clearly represents the author) is 15. There is then a gap of a couple years with Beth being just 13 and Amy 12. Their lives transition from that of young girls to young women, and each sister has her own unique traits. Margaret \\"Meg\\" with her beauty is following the traditional path in entering society and heading towards marriage. Josephine \\"Jo\\" is attracted by intellectual pursuits, in particular reading and writing. Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" is very shy and demure. She is also a peacemaker between the sisters, and enjoys helping others. Sadly, she also falls sick and never fully recovers from scarlet fever. Amy is the baby, and likes to tag along with others. She is also used to getting her own way.The first book is masterful in its simplicity. The story feels real, undoubtedly largely due to the author drawing on her own experiences, but Alcott also cleverly avoids adding too much into it and thereby making it unrealistic. She chooses a good steady pace, and the characters are well defined and consistently portrayed. Her dialogue is not perfect, but that adds to the overall realism of the telling of the story. It is a wonderful story for young women to read, and is also very readable for older readers.The second book is fairly good too, though it fails to be as believable as the first book as Alcott allowed herself to be convinced to have Jo marry. Alcott never married, and the union she chooses for Jo is a bit unusual and thus it doesn't feel right. Outside of that, though, the second book is a worthy successor to the first. Meg's choice of husband fits perfectly with the character and ideals that she develops in the first book. Most of Jo's actions in the second book also fit well with her character up, including her avoiding marriage with Laurie, her friend and neighbor who plays an important role throughout both books. Only at the point where Jo marries does it not fit. The tragedy of Meg's passing is beautifully described, and the reader is touched by the goodness of her character. Lastly, the full development of Amy fits well, including her choice of spouse.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Little Women\\" includes a very informative introduction by Elaine Showalter and extensive notes by Siobhan Kilfeather and Vinca Showalter. One of the important notes is that this edition is based on the original publications, and not those which were amended by Alcott for later editions, though obvious printer errors were corrected. There is discussion of some of the changes which Alcott made in the notes to the text. This is a wonderful book, but I will take part of a star away and round down for Jo's forced marriage."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book because of Jo March. And I never cry when Beth dies, because she annoys me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was thrilled to find Little Woman for free on Kindle. I remember reading this book over and over again when I was a child. I believe the version I read back then (many years ago) was slightly different from this one.

Either way, this is a wonderful book for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.\\"Everyone is no doubt familiar this opening line. It comes from Little Women, the beloved classic of the four young March girls. Meet sixteen-year-old Meg, the plump and matronly oldest sister; Jo, the awkward and rambunctious tomboy; Amy, the spoiled and artistic blond; and Beth, the quiet and reserved youngest sister. With their father away at war, the girls grow up under the watchful eye of Marmee.Of course, the March family is not perfect, which is why we love them. Meg succumbs to vanity a party when she borrows a dress that is far too stiff with a train that is far too long. She also fears during dances that her earrings will fall off. Jo refuses to forgive her sister Amy for an act of vengeance, until a skating disaster reunites them. Amy receives the strap at school for ignoring a rule about candy. And Beth loses a beloved bird during a disastrous week when the girls experiment with idleness. Even the one who most often instills moral guidance, Mrs. March, admits that it's taken her over forty years to only partially cure her anger.While the entire family is creative, Jo is the writer amongst them. This is my main reason for liking her best. We're both always reading. Jo likes to receive books as presents, is most attracted to homes where the owners have libraries, and typically cites examples from literature to prove her points. We're also both always writing. Jo writes plays and contributes news to the family newsletter. She loves sharing stories about what happens in her life. I also most identify with her habit of getting herself into scrapes.Despite the absence of their father, the family is close knit. The Marches sing together. They help the needy, even to the point of giving up their Christmas breakfast to help a starving family. Not being rich themselves, they produce their own plays and a family newspaper for entertainment. Under the moral direction of their mother, they also learn many life lessons. I embraced many of the principles myself such as refusing to let the sun go down on my anger. Little Women continues to be one of my favorite girl books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a coming of age tale chonicling the lives of the March Sisters.

The first three quarters of Little Women were amazing, couldn't stop reading. The last quarter was slow. I had to skip a chapter or two to keep from dozing off, but the ending was very nice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"EVERYBODY has to read this book.

Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the &quot;poor&quot; outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood. END"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I hate to say it but this is a book designed primarily for women. I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried. I thought about giving this book a solid three stars but that would have been too generous. It is regarded as a classic but to me it was a sentimental piece of rubbish. 2 generous stars"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"She is better then any other writer! Sakespeare is tied with her.

This book is a diaryof their lives, until three of them get married and have babiesof their own.The book ends with them all attending a birthday party, and eachrealizing that they couldn't be happier for they all have whatthey always dreamed of.As I said before, this book is overlong at places.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am absolutely torn as to how to rate this book.On one part, I feel awful about giving it a BAD rating, because it is a classic novel with an impeccably clean story.On the other hand, I can't bring myself to give it a GOOD rating, because the whole thing read like a Puritanical rant.Therefore, I think I will go with a 2.5 out of 5 star rating.I feel that Ms. Alcott said it best in the following quote: \\"'You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the Ten Commandments?...This man says, \\"An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy\\"...The next, \\"The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fantasies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\"'\\"As this quote was found in Part 2 of the book, which was written some years after Part 1 was published, I can only assume that the quote itself reflects real criticism that Ms. Alcott received for Part 1 of Little Women and reiterate that \\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\\"Of course, all of this is coming from one who is long past childhood and young adulthood and therefore somewhat jaded in both spiritual and relationship matters, and as this book is basically the epitome of happy endings and moral tirades, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it as much as I may have 10-15 years ago."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!)."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book a long time ago and absolutely hated it. Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago. I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars. I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like. I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps). Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The heartwarming story Little Women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters growing up in New England in the 1800's during the Civil War. They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer. Little Women brings the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one. The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance. Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest who strives to help the less fortunate in any way she can portraying herself as an angel. Amy is the youngest, who is quite selfish and spoiled.

This book leads you to realize what family love is."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters coming of age during the Civil War. Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm so glad to see that the cover and illustrations for the hardback version of LITTLE WOMEN have stayed the same; this book (along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's A LITTLE PRINCESS) were staples of bedtime reading when I was growing up, and as I became an avid reader on my own later on, LITTLE WOMEN revealed more layers to me. Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with?

It looked to me then that it was a girlie book, but I still enjoyed it very much. I think I read it twice. Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side. The Marches are a respectable and educated family, but they're not wealthy, so the book depicts the troubles and efforts of the four girls, their little successes and disappointments.

Never have I read a book that better deserved the title, &quot;classic.&quot;This is the moving story of the 4 March sisters, each strong in their own accounts and weak in others. It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole. Though the recent film treatment of the book is probably the definitive screen treatment, it could never capture the sense of beauty that the book did, or develop the characters as well.I was only 15 when I read this book, but I consider it to be one of my all-time favorites even still.I would not recommend this book to ANYONE, but anyone with an appetite to learn and an appreciation for life in general (or lack thereof) should find this book a reminder that despite wealth, poverty, sadness, happiness, death, and all other aspects of life that may separate us, we are all human, and the one thing that keeps us us together is love. -Ben, age 16"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm 52 years old and remember well reading this as a kid, and loving it.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big.

It started out that I just wanted to get more AR points than this other girl in my class who had been unable to finish the book because she had thought it was so boring. I was anticipating the worse, but I began to read it and I just fell in love with the dear little book. It was just so great! My favorite character by far was Jo. After I read it more people in my class became curious and four other people in the class read it including the first girl who gave up on it. She tried again and after she finished it she said that she had loved the book too."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Book little women is a classic tale of four sisiters liveing with there mother, there father risking his life in the civil war. it tells what it was like to be a girl in the times of the war.

I strongly recamend this addion for its beautiful illustrations that complament the classic story, you will treasure"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book. Read it to your young daughter, or buy your 4th, 5th, or 6th grader her very own copy to treasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"One of the novels that I have read this summer was \\" LITTLE WOMEN\\" by Louisa May Alcott. The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings. The characters just all around have great qualities and are so loveable. It's a nice life story to read about. The genre is like a biography but not quite. It's a great old fashion book to read and shows the true meaning of family. It's a sure attention grabber! The Little Women have gone along way in their lives and will continue to live their lives to the fullest ability no matter if riches come or do not come their way."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a book that once you read it you will never forget it.

You wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I haven't read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women but I recently listened to the audiobook recording which was read by Jamie Lee Curtis and I thought it was a very good story and I liked the characters, especially Jo, Marmee and Laurie. Jamie Lee Curtis gave a wonderful reading performance and I would have liked it if this had been an unabridged audiobook intstead of just abridged but unfortunately she only recorded an abridged version but anyway I highly recommend this audiobook and I will have to look for the paperback book too!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I finally read Little Women when I wa 23. When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book. I was surprised that the book was even better than the movie. I think this should be on teen's summer reading lists. Even though it was written a long time ago, it is definitely still relavant."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As I began the first chapter of this book, I thought I had made a mistake in purchaing it. It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up. Each sister is unique, with different ideas and priorities. \\"Watching\\" them grow up through out the book is entertaining and heart-warming."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but &quot;Little Women&quot; retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of &quot;Little Women&quot; come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, &quot;poor little rich boy&quot; Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to &quot;Little Women.&quot; Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- &quot;scribbling&quot; down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But &quot;Little Women&quot; is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as &quot;heartwarming&quot; stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the &quot;perfect little homemaker&quot; image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.&quot;Little Women&quot; is one of those rare period novels that is still relevant, funny, and heartbreaking today. Fun, sweet, and a beautiful experience."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming story that transports back in time and tells the story of the March family. It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"zzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzz z z zzzzzzzzzzzz zzz z z z z z z z z zz"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have loved this story since I was a little girl.

I decided to re-read it and I am glad I did. So much fiction today is lacking in plot, character development, and thought, in short, this is good literature. This is one of the best books around for people of all ages. I so appreciate that the March family experienced the joys and pains of everyday living and handled both with dignity, spirit, and a genuine love for each other. Even though poor, the March family rose above it. So many lessons are taught in this book that young people, particularly, could benefit from reading it.

It wasn't the book I remembered. Deciding to stick with it, I kept going and it picked up steam as it went along becoming the book I enjoyed previously.I wonder how young girls react to this now when \\"The Hunger Games\\" and \\"Gossip Girl\\" seem to be the norm and are so vastly different from this. The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit. While it has largely aged well, it must be read for the time period in which it was written.I am very glad I re-read it as an adult."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book serves better as a decoration piece than one you want to spend time passing around to friends.

The characters are all so real, each with their own personalities that jump off the page. They make you care deeply about what happens to them. It's lovely to see how they struggle with their own and each other's flaws.Little women is overall a wonderful classic.

My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose.

I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book. Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned.

Just for that reason, consumers should eschew this version, and Amazon should have them change it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As an unabridged edition, all of Alcott's words are there. The narrator, Sandra Burr, takes us through the classic work in a style that takes the listener inside the story. Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion. Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School. This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War.

Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done. I like how the language and story are so old fashioned and find myself using such dialect after reading it! I would recommend this book to anyone who likes bitter-sweet stories that make you think."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott. This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

Aside from a few typographical errors in the Kindle version, this book is an excellent e-book freebie. I had put off reading it since I was very young but had always wondered at the hype of this book. It may well be considered a literary classic, although I still don't consider it a must-read for every young girl."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is best read at a younger age. As an adult, I can see the important lessons in regard to friendship, family and finding your place in the world even when it goes against the norm. I appreciate the simple tone and wording that would make this book an easy read for a middle school child. And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult. I'm glad to have read it to try to understand the perpetual love people have for it, it wasn't something I enjoyed enough to ever want to read again.

Says that I need more words for review, so here are some more. This is ridiculous Amazon! Ok"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult. I downloaded it so I could reread as an adult. So glad to have a free version for my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Please make it shorter and not to have so many confusing plots in it. But it was still a little bit good."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, is a wonderful and amusing story about a family, mainly four sisters learning as they grow. Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up. This story is a perfect example of how family's should love each other and not give up on anything."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In the senior class of the &quot;Great Books&quot; program at the college I attended, one of the weekly speakers asked how many of the women had read Little Women. Nearly all of the women in the class raised their hands. Then she asked how many men had read it. One man raised his hand - the chair of the English department! That was when I decided to read this book, and it has become one of my all-time favorites! I would recommend this book to everyone - men and women, young or old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved the book. I thought that Louisa May Alcott did anoutstanding job describing Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. I likedthe book also because it described a family in poverty, andshowed the whole picture, not just the good nor just the bad.I loved the book because all four of the girls get to go fromyoung ladies to women, and they all are allowed to marryfor love, and they're not forced to marry. I cried at the partwhere Beth died of Scarlet Fever. But other than that sadpart the rest of the book was great"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It takes a real man, who is secure in his manhood, to admit to reading a book like Little Women. I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic. She is the third person who marries, and she marrys \\"the Laurence boy\\". She complains to many people that her nose is flat."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"You know the story. If you don't, many of these other reviewers have done the job for me. For me, this is my most favorite book in all of American literature. Growing up, I had a friend who was just like Beth and everytime I re-read this book, I remember my childhood adventures with Beth. The fictional Beth in \\"Little Women\\" was as much of a friend as my other friend, too.I cannot recommend this book enough. If you haven't read it -- you must read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is, to put it simply, an great book. Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a book for all ages. I have read this book numerous times and highly recommend it. It was the first book I bought my 8 year old daughter to read. That was two years ago, and she has read it twice. Its a great book to share with young girls. It has mystery and romance on a level that young girls can understand and women can relate to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great read.

Delivered quickly and will no doubt order from them again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I enjoyed it a lot. All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be.

Times and manners may have changed since the more gentile era of this book, but there is still a lot that resonates here, all the way to the present day."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I found this book very &#34;comfortable&#34;. I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Great classic read. I enjoyed this book decades ago when I was in high school, but enjoyed it even more this time.

I have always enjoyed reading, but having this has renewed my love of reading!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It was interesting to read the Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication of Little Women many years after having read the revised edition we've all come to know and love. It's still the fiesty, independent Jo I admired, so I enjoyed reading this version. There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite novels as a child. I just recently read it again and it was still a wonderful and entertaining book. It is still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The series about the March girls have been my favorite books ever since I first read them. they are a sweet series."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book so much!

A must read..."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a timeless story of four sisters and their lives as they grow into adulthood. I read it first when I was quite young, but even now as I reread it, I never tire of it. Parents, you should buy this for your daughters.

Its about thier love life thier emotional life...and so on. It is a must to read for all kinds of ages."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War? Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves. Louisa May Alcott also wrote the book kind of like a sequal to Little Women called Little Men,if you would like to know what happens with Jo."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of these four girls and their experiences growing up is one that all readers can relate to. I have read the book multiple times, and each time I do I discover a new thing about these vivacious girls. I would especially recommend this book to anyone with sisters because the relationships between the four sisters is the main focus of the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was the first book I have ever read by Lousia. Through the years I have read ALL her other books but this one remains my favorite. If you read it you will understand why it is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old. The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air.

After I read Little Women, I got the other little women books, such as Beth's Story, Amy's Story, Meg makes a friend, Jo's Story, Little Women Birthday stories, Jo's troubled heart, Beth's Snowdancer, and Jo's boys. I'm sure one of the girls personality's will match yours. Please get it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. I've even got the movie. I'll tell ya, Little Women took my heart away (but it's still there) GOD BLESS YOU ~Amanda"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is a classical novel of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.

It is, afterall, written during a different period. Even after knowing the story and seeing all the movie versions, I still wanted to read the original...no movie will make you cry more than the Book. At the end you will not want to say goodby to these sisters.

Also, the story is set in a period of our history which is so fascinating."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book reads like a children's novel and is an extremely pleasant reading experience. Really lovely!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of four sisters growing up in their mother's house in (I believe) New England. We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today. For a period book, the writing is very smooth and clear enough for our generation to understand. In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then.

This is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really loved this book. But there were points in it when I thought &quot;This is so girly. I am tired of hearing 'This is this, Jane' and 'Oh my!'&quot; It was an awesome book and easy to read even at 600 pages, but there were points when I just asked &quot;When is this ever going to end?&quot; It is an epic and a classic and will forever hold a place in my heart (if I ddon't get sick of it)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is interesting and heartwarming, but sometimes it can also be annoying, because all the girls want to be good so much. I think there are a lot of girls who don't want to be good at all. I don't like it that the author takes wanting to be good for granted."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I liked the way that the book delt with things that people actually went through. I can not relate to wearing a dress with a hole burnt in it to a party, but I can relate that situation to spiling something on yourself, or getting a surprise stain on your new dress while dancing. They showed the family in all living conditions. Them living in poverty being angry about not having all of the things that they wnat, and them doing good for others by giving them their Christmas breakfast. Sisters will always argue, but they learned to love each other in spite of the things that made them mad. Each of them had something that they had a passion for and they loved each others work. They all loved to read the stories that Jowrote, and tey loved to hear about all of the parties that Meg attended, and listen to the music that Beth played, and Admire the pictures that Amy drew. They were each special in their own way, and love each other even more because of it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is my all time favourite book.It is the heartwarming story of a family during the American Civil War.It describes the joys &amp; sorrows of four girls belonging to the March family &amp; follows their journey through life.As a child it was their personal stories that fascinated me, but as an adult I appreciate the authentic potrayal of the turbulent times that were the American Civil War."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I recommend this book, Little Women for not only child but adult. This is a very heart-warming story. It is a story about 4 sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy during the Civil War.

Though she was a very tomboy and quarraied with Amy so often, she ran through her dream to be a writer. I admired her intent mind. Also she had a kind heart to think about others even though sacrificd herself. Mr. March became ill during he went to the war. However Mrs. March didn^t have enough money. Then Jo cut her long beautiful hair and sold it to make money for her father. It was very hard thing for Jo but she sacrificd herself. What I was most moved i 4 sisters^ strong cooparation.

I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Don't get me wrong. While I'm the type that shrieks and covers my eyes when watching something like \\"Spiderman II\\" at a kissing part (or at a violent part, for that matter...) I don't mind books about marriage. And so the first part, Little Women book I, was a perfect portrait of a family. A good book, despite the heavy prejudice I carried against it, as it was (gasp) A Required Reading Book.The Part II, Good Wives, was -- er....interesting. Let's go through it, marriage by marriage.Meg's marriage. Cute. Same age, good match, and even I, who have decided that my marriage to ANYONE (or dating, for that matter) would be a sign of the Apocolypse, could understand why some less fortunate souls devote their life to another, staying with that person forever (well, not in the twenty-first century they don't - unfortunately). Meg and John Brooke was good. Nice. Sweet. You get it. Now let's move on.Laurie (Theodore's his real name, for all you thinking that to name a male child Laurie is about the greatest measure of torture you can inflict upon a boy) and Amy.

What a disappointment. I couldn't even read the whole thing. I only read the first 176 pages out of 470, so if the last half is better than the first half, I wouldn't know. Thank you to other reviewers for giving me the major plot points. I skimmed a few of those and that was enough for me. I didn't want to spend any more of my time reading what I felt was a boring book. I liked three characters, Jo, Laurie and Beth, but again not enough to want to read the rest of the book. It was too syrupy sweet with the mother teaching her girls values such as helping those less fortunate than yourself, control your temper, work hard, be polite etc. These are nice values, and this might be more desirable for a parent to read to young daughters. Although be aware that there are a couple of deaths of main characters. For me, this book was not good enough. I want entertainment, creativity, surprise, unexpected events and interesting characters. I prefer books like Twilight and Harry Potter for young adults and myself.Data:There is no sexual content which makes it appropriate for children. Setting: 1860s the North during the civil war.

It was already bad enough that the March sister were extreamly good (too good)and how they complained about stupid stuff, like noses and how they were poor (which doesn't even make sense if you have a servant and a manor!)but she killed of Beth so early in the series and Jo didn't even marry Laurie!!

Instead, try Harry Potter :)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott, Little Women (Signet, 1880)I figured attempting to struggle through this for five months (actually, five months and one week) was more than enough torture, and so I gave up about a quarter through the book (I ended on page 124 of 455). I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible.

Recently I sat down in excited anticipation to read this story to my ten-year-old daughter, only to have both of us fall asleep in record time. Poor Ms. Alcott's stories have fallen on the sword of the sparkling fast-paced prose of the likes of J.K. Rowling and the modern poetic stories of such authors as Alice Walker. Little Women is the story of four New England daughters of a father away fighting in the American Civil War. Illustrating their bravery and spirit, coming of age, romances and tragedies, I remember happily losing myself in their story, but now find the language so ponderous that it is impossible to re-read.

This is one of those books I could see myself reading again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions.

The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too).

I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own.

Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv.

It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading. Free on Kindle -- so Kindle readers, download and enjoy this enduring American classic. Not just for children or for girls; I'm a 61-year-old man!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was in the 7th grade, my mother gave me Little Women for Mother's Day from my dolls (yes, I still played with dolls in the 7th grade). Reading it was a life altering experience. I remember reading parts of it to my mother in the kitchen while she was cooking dinner. When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today. I ended up having 4 daughters myself, daughters whom my family refers to as my \\"Little Women.\\" One of my girls even calls me \\"Marmee.\\"! Jo inspired me to write St. James Place.St. James Place"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved this book when I first read it as a girl and I loved it even more the second time when I read it as an adult.

If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price.

I fell in love with the March sisters and laughed at their idiosyncrasies and cried at their heartaches (I did!). There are even a couple parts in the book, relating to managing anger and nurturing marriage, that spoke deeply to me and have helped me in my personal life. Even the poetry \\"written\\" by the March sisters in different parts of the book are amazing.This is a must-read! It is also an easy read.

The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I like this book alot.

The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands. Jo, for instance, tells her husband-to-be, \\"I have my duty also, and my work. I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you...\\" (p. 509).The Sterling editions are well priced and nicely produced. They have decent bindings, generally good if spare illustrations (the illustrations in this volume are especially spare), and include a ribbon for marking one's place. These editions would make a nice addition to a child's library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"i love this book every thing about it i don't think i would read it very fast but i read it in 4 days i couldn't put it down my favorite is Laurie he is so funny and sweet, and Jo is so sweet but tries not to act like it i could go on and on.

The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted.

She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins.

Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

As I enter my 40s, I am thoroughly enjoying reading the books that kept me enthralled endless nights. I hope that the person who left the bad review does not give up on the \\"classics\\", and that they will find one that sticks with them forever.

I finally did one day when I saw it on my friend's bookshelf and asked to borrow it (to which, of course, she agreed; we exchange books as often as we exchange words). I read it in a week and when I finished it I thought, I should have read this years ago!! I went to the library the same day I found out there were sequels. Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping. It's about life and growing up and everyone on the planet should read it!Now I hope I've made my point; I have to go to the library now to get Little Men."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women has been an endearing classic since its publication, and it has touched the hearts of many people. However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us.

Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative.

The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old. I had to read it for school-it was a desperate last choice for the required reading. Boy, didn't I see this coming! It took a while, I will offer that (I eventually had only read half by the test.) But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady. Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely.

Who cannot shed at least a few tears when sweet, gentle Beth dies? Whose heart cannot be ripped apart in agony when Jo rejects Laurie's declaration of love for her? This book is a masterpiece. It's a role model - an encourager. To the person who said that the Marches were the &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they when I grow up.

Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said &quot;told yah so&quot; and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading. They still haven't read it but thats their loss!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I chose to read Little Women for my 6th grade English book report because I had heard that it was a really great book as well as a great American novel. I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge. But if you want a way to pass a rainy day (or even a snowy one), this is one of the greatest books to curl up with."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"If you've never read this book, you simply have to! Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out.

I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day. And the conversation in my novel BLOW OUT THE MOON about Litle Women, Jo, and Amy is one of the things that happened in real life just as it does in the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story. Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older... This is a great book for teaching these things to children."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale of four sisters struggling their way through life during the Civil War. I have read this book more times than I can count, and I still love it. Once I pick it up I can't put it down, lost in this seemingly fantasy world, which was actually quite true more than 100 years ago.My favorite thing about Little Women has to be the characters. Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages.

If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition.

However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM.

It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book. After years of avoiding this paragon of femenine literature, I finally gave in and read it, and I'm glad that I did. This book is great. The author's use of language, the way that she writes is a pure pleasure to read. She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching. But for one glaring miss on the emotions of one character, I think the book is flawless and stands as a wonderful exposition on character and human relationships.

Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now. Then my sister bought this book, and I just found myself intrested in the first page of the book!!!!!Its about 4 sisters Meg, Jo, Beth,and Amy. It warms your heart when the sisters sit together near the fire and read the letter from their father, and when Jo cuts her hair. You laugh when Jo and Laurie meet their 1st time and talks funnily. You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy. But the sad part, I think is how Jo loves Beth and is ready to give her whole life for Beth. Mr. Bhaer and Jo gets married and .....read LITTLE MEN!!!!!! I LOVE ALL ALCOTT'S BOOK, AND WISH SHE WAS STILL ALIVE!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was in the 8th grade, I was casted as Meg in our school's play of &quot;Little Women.&quot; That was my first experience with the story. I soon picked up the book after that and could not put it down. It was wonderful! This is a story of four sisters facing the hardships of a nation at war, finding love, losing family, and having to grow up. This is a must read for every young woman as well as adults who will be able to appreciate this story all over again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women was a classic,but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was interesting, I'll give it that, but it didn't have the key things that a good piece of literature should have.It was set in New England and told the lives,sometimes dull lives, of the four March girls. Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less. Remember there are always two sides to a loved classic book; it may be loved by some but disliked by others."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I remember first reading &quot;LW&quot; when I was in 5th grade. I had heard other girls requesting it in the library and so I bought at a schoolbook fair. I really liked the beginning but then had trouble whenmy 11 year old A.D.D-afflicted brain could'nthandle it's rather long length.Curiously, I never got beyond aboutthat part of book,then one night, having nothing to read I decided togive it another go and I loved it!Then in my 20's,(and A.D.D better under control)I got the humor, understood all thesister's hopes and ambitions betterthen ever,especially Jo's and Amy's. It really was a &quot;progressive&quot;book for it's time in that these girls had ambitions beyond just getting married, is about following your bliss,doingwhat makes you happy and living your life to the fullest. That's what makes it so timeless."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this in Jr. High, but could hardly remember a word, so it was so refreshing to read again and this time to relate to Marmie as a mentor of sorts.

Heart warming and story that is sure to touch any heart."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Haven't read it yet but wanted to have it available -- it was a favorite book from my childhood & I'd like to have it where I can easily access it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott. It really made you stop and be glad for what you had. This family treasured everything and it really made them better people. I have gone on to read Jo's Boys and Little Men.

It teaches good moral values."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women by Louisa May Alcott should be read by middle schoolers because it shows great moral values. For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book Little Women is truley a literature classic. This book reflects on the lives of the fictional March family as Yankees during the Civil War. While Mr. March is away fighting in the war, Mrs. March and her four daughters Margaret, 16, Josephine, 15, Elizabeth, 13, and Amy, 12 (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)must learn to cope while their nation is at war. The four girls must learn many lessons in life and grow up to be fine women even during hard times. The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls. At times this book could run on, so that is why i rated it 4 stars, not 5. However, this book still is great and a timeless classic and Louisa May Alcott did a fine job with the book. I enjoyed the book alot."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When I was a little girl, I didn't read very much, so I read this book the first time as a teenager.

The movies don't do it justice."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is a one beautiful book to read ,the beauty of the book is that it has so many central charecters and each one holds his and her grounds completely.Amy is a wonderful girl ,who keeps the string of happiness in the family,but its the Mrs. march who is the driving force in the book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Alcott's novel recounting the lives of the March family is aremarkable book reflective of her own unusual upbringing (the Marchesare all modeled after her real-life family, from her artistic sister May to her scholarly father). The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston. What a wonderful way to come back to a book that shaped my life and ideas of independence."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"OK, so after the 17 hundredth time (yes, I'm exaggerating), I have finally finished Little Women, and I'm so glad that I did! It's so totally excellent, and each chapter has a moral. Like, not to be vain or to not waste time or to not put much stock in riches, for money never was the equivalent to true love and happiness. I cried &amp; sobbed, and laughed and just generally thought &quot;I wish I were as contented as Beth, or as clever as Jo, beautiful as Amy &amp; charismatic as Meg.&quot; You fall in love with each of these girls, and Miss Alcott gave such a perfect description.

Families really can be that happy. I would highly reccomend this book and any of Louisa May Alcott's books"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The book was rich in a kind of sensitive way. It was writenfrom the eyes of Jo, the tom boy. There are 4 sisters. Jo and Amy havea temper tantrum. Mr. March is away working.

While reading this book you will meet Amy, Meg, Beth and Jo. You will get to take adventures with Jo and see what it was like for her to br a tomboy, a writer, and an older sister.

The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play.

I believe that everone should take some time to read it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women captures the heart of four young girls as they deal with a changing world, growing up, and the harsh realities of the Civil War.

It tells the story of a family living in poverty, but are much richer in love than any family I know of. There are four sisters who love each other very much, but are often quarreling as sisters do. I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before.

This is the story of four sisters, living at an unstable time in American history, who learn to overcome poverty and selfish wants to become mature and accomplished women. Their triumphs will bring a smile to your face, while their trials will bring you tears. The March sisters will win their way into your mind and heart, and their story is one you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women by:Louisa May Alcott.This book is an amazing book. It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not. But I still think this was a great book and I reccomend it to anyone searching for a book that you can not help but care about the characters."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"When i was nine years old i read little Women. Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book.

Heartwarming=)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this was a really good book and it is one of my favorites. this was one of my first books i learnt to read. i have the soft cover and hard cover and now on my kindle. this book just tells us a little what life was like back then during the war. if you enjoyed this book i think you should read Pride and Prejudice if you have not read these books you should not be able to call yourself a female this book is also for men. i am still in school and when i asked one of my friends if she had read these books she asked, \\" aren't those soap operas?\\" My male teacher who was listening to the story was shocked to hear that she calls herself a girl. so read and recommend this book and much loved classic even if you are just protecting your gender. these aren't just sterling classics but titanium classics. this is a huge must read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The Whole Story Books is a fantastic line of classic literature with various information in the margins that relates to the stories. In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting. But overall I think it is worth reading for its messages, plus it's free on the Kindle so I have no complaints."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Ms. Alcott presents a charming mixture of realistic children's behavior and idealistic moral lessons.

A wonderful book for any mother and daughter to read together.Priya Florence Shah, author of \\"Step Into Your Feminine Power And Rule Your World: 24 Empowering Ideas for the Modern Indian Woman\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This novel touches my soul and warms my heart in ways I never thought possible. I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children. Perhaps the picture is deceiving customers and we are not talking about the same edition?GABRIELLE"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women, always a classic.

I was planning a trip to Concord, MA so I wanted to read it prior to touring the actual Alcott house.

I first read this book when I was 8 years old (I'm now 68) and I fell in love with all the characters. I've seen all the movie adaptations and also loved them (especially the Susan Sarandon, Winona Rider version, although K. Hepburn was a \\"capital\\" Jo!) I occasionally had a bit of a giggle about some of the sentimentality, the over-the-top language, (especially Amy's) and the dated mannerisms (so glad I didn't live back then ~ I'd be a social outcast!) On the other hand, the story is so heart-warming and charming, I soon was able to overlook the fact it was written more than 150 years ago.

They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again? BORING!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I would have never picked up this book had it not been assigned in one of my college classes. I was not too excited about having to take this 'American Culture' class, and on top of it being assigned to read this lame book, Little Women. Oh, but how wrong and narrow-minded I was, as this turned out to be my all-time favorite book! We were only assigned to read the first part, but I loved it so much I let my other classes slide to read part two. If you're not too sure about this book, throw your doubt out the window and read it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I consider the book Little Women a five star book because it is a well educational story of 4 young ladies that grow up to be women. They learned how to be women by taking care of themselves when there mother left to go help there father since he got sick while fighting in World War 2. Beth got scarlet fever. She was very sick and they sent a telegram to the mother. The mother came home and Beth got better. A few days later the Mr. Lawerence boy brought home a sepcial surpirse...the father. He came home just in time before Beth got sick again. Soon after she died. Amy went off to Europe with her Aunt March and Mr.Lawerence and the boy Mr.Lawerence were there.

I like the TV show &quot;Little Men&quot; so my mom suggested I read the &quot;beginning of the story.&quot; I was reluctant at first, but once I got into it I couldn't put it down! I like how all of the 4 sisters were close to eachother. Amy really got on my nerves because she was so snobby and ladylike, but all of the other characters were interesting. It is definitely one I'll read again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Most people either hate or love Salinger's novel because they either relate to it or they don't; Little Women was a novel in the same way. If my 53 year old dad read this, he would not have appreciated it as much as 19 year old me, who loves Jo and Beth the most because they struck a chord in my heart. Alcott, more than any other author, invites you warmly to sit on the couch with the Marches as they laugh, cry, think, and charm you right into their home and their lives. I was a silent cousin while reading this novel, and I still think Jo and Laurie should be together. Feminists, put your guards down because this book is not about submission or female inferiority, it is about overcoming everything with love, both for males and females. Don't watch the movie EVER. You'd strip away all the justice of Alcott's classic by watching the Cliff Notes."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is by far the most compelling book of the century. This book shows the struggles and hardships of four girls and the people around them. Throughout the book, there are many difficult situation that the girls have to overcome. If you haven't read this book, you really should because it redefines our modern day concepts of family life and love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Many people think diferently from me about the point the author wanted to put across in her writing. I think that the author wanted us to see the struggle that everyday life can be for the rich and poor alike.I also thought that she potrayed the girls as wanting to be good, becuase she wanted us to realize that deep down inside of all of us there is a part that wants to do its best."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a great book for anyone to read!

Get up and read this great book!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I'm not usually the type of person who likes to read, but when I started reading &quot;Little Women&quot;, I could not stop. I read for hours a day, often with a flashlight in the middle of the night. I cryed when they cryed, and laughed when they laughed. I felt as if the March sisters were my own, and Marmee was my second mother. As I read, I would loose myself into a world filled with love, warmth, tragedy, and hope. I have two sisters of my own, and as I read, I realized how special they are to me. The book inspired me to be a better person. I recomend this book to any woman, young or old, for the chronicles of the March family are not just a story, but a lesson in the true meaning of life;love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was introduced to LITTLE WOMEN at the age of 12 or 13.

I love my hair so mutch so I dont think that I could ever do that mutch of a brave thing for my family.

At first I thought that it would be a girlish book, and I did not accept the offer. I will now mention that I LOVE to read. Several years later, one of my very good friends that had the same taste as I handed it to me and said, &quot;Read it.&quot; I obeyed and it turned out to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This classic story about the March sisters and their joys, hardships, and growing up has proved to be a great lesson to me and my friends. My favorite character is Beth (although I am nothing like her) because she is exactly like the person tht everyone wants to be. She is so kind and thoughtful, but so humble about her generosity.

It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down. There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering. An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away. It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes! A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies! I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a story of four sisters with thier own point of views. This book has a very strong romantic field, but yet it has all of our child hood fantacies. The story is about four remarkable young girls, and as the pages turn they all grow up. Each one finds thier own love but desperate times happen more often. I love this book and, I think that this is a remarkable story of four sisters growing up together. As you read this book you may feel sad but everyone faces tough times. So read this book, It truly is worth reading."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is a charming book for all ages old and young. It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to. When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what. There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I can't remember how many times I've read it in total. I think every child growing up should know this story. It's a classic. It's enchanting and heart warming and I'm sure boys and girls alike would enjoy it. The movies are also enjoyable. There are 3 versions that I can think of."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I finally read Little Women last Christmas break after seeing all of the movie versions many times. I like the movies but nothing compares to the book. Even though it was written so long ago and I expected it to be hard to read, this story really touched my heart. If you have always wanted to read this book, you should do it!!! I put off reading it for so long and I was so glad when I finally read it. The themes of family and love abound and will really move you.

If there was a 6 stars mark i would have given it to Little Women:)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is my favorite of Mrs. Alcott's. It's wonderfully done; extremely descriptive. It is realistic, with ups and downs. Each character has its own personality; nothing has ever been like it before, in all my almost 13 years. It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls. I also loved the fact that Jo was a writer, because that's what I am; I just LOVE to write stories, especially about horses. I recomend this book to any old fashioned girl like me."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"What a great novel this is!!! It brings back so many memories of my childhood, I really love it. It is very easy to read (English is not my first language), very entertaining. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Some will say that LM Alcott is too openly preachy, but her unabashed devotion to all the tried and true virtues is refreshing. The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is one of my favorite stories, it's very honest and kind, loving and hopeful.

Thanks"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this book as a young girl and thoroughly enjoyed it then. Forty plus years on I enjoyed it just as much if not more the second time round. A book of it's time, very engaging and endearing the story follows four sisters throughout their moral upbringing to womanhood. Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times. I would definitiely recommend for a heart warming story. I read it in abou four long stints, so be prepared to put some time on one side!Denise12/12/23"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I have long been a fan of Louisa May Alcott and highly recommend Little Women be read to younger children as well as for teens. The engaging girls in this story are examined for their faults as well as their virtues. While it is an old fashioned tale, the message is timeless regarding choices that are made by young people. Also highly recommend &#34;Eight Cousins&#34; and it's sequel, &#34;Rose in Bloom&#34; by LMA."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by \\"Little Women.\\" It was one of the best books I have ever read.

I read it in my 20s and enjoyed it as much inn my 40s. Rarely do I reread any books, but L.W. is timeless annd a wonderful escape from modern daily life. Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.

It is a lovely and inspiring book."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is about a time and a place that our generation knows nothing about. I'm 36, and the world today is nothing like the world when Little Women was written. It's a great story about a mother and her daughters, and their struggles and joys at a time when the country is at war and their father/husband must go off and fight. The story is filled with happiness and sorrow, love and pain."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Okay, so I know it published in 2 parts. This book all to books together. P.S. watch the movie after.

It reads easily, there are no typos that I have found yet and of course the book itself is... well... a classic! The story is one of a kind. One of those stories you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I really liked Little Women... the only problem was that in some parts the book got a little boring and wordy. I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A classic I always enjoy reading. Such an endearing story. Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book had such an impact on me as a kid, it was fun to re-read it. I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times. It moves quickly and I can see why it continues to be popular. If you haven't read this one, read it!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This was actually the first book that I read on the kindle available for my phone and I was slightly skeptical. However, I really enjoyed reading it and loved that I could read it no matter where I was. The story was great, a little slow to start off, but overall a great book and I would highly recommend it, especially to girls of all ages."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"this is a good classic book that we've all heard of. i like it a lot.my only problem is that its a little too moralistic in some places.I would like to invite you to New Life Tabernacle in Arab Alabama.

The text in the story was extremely descriptive and the whole plot of the story is definately #1 for a lot of the books that I have read. It was a book that was hard to put down, with all the struggles and problems the characters overcame in it. I advise mostly everyone to read this book, because it is pretty easy to read, and you seem too be done not long after you have started!

I have always been fascxinated by this book and when I read this it just blew me away. When I read this I actually feel like Im in the attic with Jo, in the dressing room with Meg, sitting at the piano with beth, or trading lemons with Amy. I think this is my all time favorite book and that it will continue to be a beautiful example to all of us. ( But I still was upset and mad when Laurie married Amy instead of Jo!!!!!!!!!!!)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It shows not only feeling and emotion on the part of Mrs. Alcott, but of these four girls, who by the 2nd page, feel like family. No one could ever guess that this beautiful story is fiction. It seems imposible that such intrecate detail can come from the imagination of another. I was read to this book when I was very young, but only did I understand it's full meaning until reading it again recently. This is a classic book that is not to be missed. Read this book and if you are anything of a semi avid book reader, you will feel as passionatly as I do."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott has written her books with a feeling few of us posess. From the triumphant tale of Amy, to the tragic one of Beth, the writer shows us a world of which we have rarely dreamed. I recommend it to everyone who likes a good book!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This is the best book ever. I love it and a whole family can read it !"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This timeless novel appeals not only to the young, but to the seasoned reader as well. None have captured the hearts and minds of the feminine creature as has this famed American author. Whether the reader desires a realistic period piece or a touching story about life, love, death and the human condition, Alcott covers all the bases. Few women can come away from &quot;Little Women&quot; without having made a connection to the personalities which transcend the constraints of the time the novels reflects. Jo is every author's heroine. Beth, our picture of healthy mind, healthy soul, and healthy spirituality. Meg is the mother-to-be in us all, and Amy the ill-tempered blossom who grows to the beautiful woman (inside and out) that we all dream we are. Classic novels are more than artillery for our educational arsenal, they are explorations of ourselves. &quot;Little Women&quot; does not disappoint to be all that and much more."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott weaves a wonderful and touching tale about the March sisters:Amy,Meg,Beth and Jo.The way she describes it,tells the story,has a touch of old-fashioned charm in it,taking one back to the days of long gowns,bonnets,rich lords and ladies and the such.The four sisters' personalities are also vividly described in Louisa Alcott's eyes."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This story is very interesting and good.It talks about alot of different things, like sorrows, mishaps, love, etc.I especcially like Jo."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"a very nice story. you can read it as many times as you want. it is always fresh."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them. But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little women are the perfect compliment to little men. Large men can like them too, however, if they are careful."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women's Dreaming GlassesI have always had extremely vivid dreams. While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book is okay but it is DEFINETLY not the best. Meg, Jo, Beth and Amys' father has gone to war and they all have their own problems. Meg suffers from her own vanity, Jo suffers from her temper, Beth is in danger of dying and Amy suffers injustice at school.I don't reccomend this book to boys, but it might be good to some girls."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This book, Little Women by Louisa May Alcott was boring. I did not enjoy her style of writing at all. Another factor that lead to me not liking this book is that it was from the 1800's. Young teens like me are not into these types of boring \\"1800's\\" books. This book was a torture to read. You might ask, \\"what was going through your mind as you were reading this book?\\" Well, to all of those people out there, my answer is \\"boring!\\" Louisa explained everything that was going on... only a little bit too much. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a mature mind and enjoys reading classic style books."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The rating is for THIS edition of the book, feminist ideologue Elaine Showalter's genital revisionism blots the text everywhere. Nor is the theme concerned with the &quot;tension between social responsibility &amp; individual and artistic freedom&quot; except in the fevered dreams of academic collectivists obsessed with &quot;group identities&quot; who have instigated more cultural disintegration then anyone since the anarchist 60's by eroding all Individual Responsibility &amp; intellectual standards. Since acquiring a CEO from Disney the Penguin Classics once a distinguished series has become largely a pulpit for multiculturalists, feminists, post-colonial theorists and academic careerists brainwashed by Edward Said to &quot;re-frame&quot; &quot;de-construct&quot; and deface in the name of a politically reductive, emotionally vacuous jihad against Western Culture.

There was absolutely no humor and I frankly didn't care what happened to the very unreal characters. The four sisters were too different to be actually related and Beth was too much of an angel. At the end of the novel, I did not find that I was attached to any of the characters.The book did not give me any emotional satisfaction and there were too many plots going at once.However, I will give some points to the quality of the plot. It was very realistic and surprising. Set during and after the Civil War, the March sisters(Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy)struggle to grow up and, if not conquer, at least suppress their worst faults.In short: This is an okay book, but I would never reread it.Recommended instead: Anne of Green Gables series(characters are much more satisfying)"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I felt that Little Women was a very moving story. I had tears in my eyes when Mr. March returns from the War. Louisa Mae Alcott was a very talented writer, indeed. I'm sure her story has touched many other hearts just as it has touched mine. Anyone, young or old, should read Little Women. It is a story of unfaltering love for one's family, even though times are hard and the limits of tempers are tested, the March family still shared its love."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"\\"Take care my skirt don't trip you up...\\"\\"Don't Meg pull fair?\\"\\"Oh, yes she tries to but she don't love Bethy as I do...\\"If you're looking for a copy of Little Women with lots of colorful illustrations don't buy this copy there are none.If you're looking for a copy with extra information about the author don't buy this one there's only a very short paragraph at the end about Louisa May Alcott that comes after the 15 \\"book discussion\\" type questions that are not very useful to an independant reader.I was not impressed with the wording of this Sterling Publishing edition of this beloved children's classic. I've read other editions of Little Women and don't remember the word don't being used so poorly throughout the novel as it was in this edition.

I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women Louisa May Alcott, 2004, 520 pages. $9.95Sterling Publishing ISBN 978-1-4027-1458-0Have you ever had a brother or sister and you just can't be without them? Would you do anything for them? That's how it is for Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They are not perfect but great sisters. They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full. The interesting theme is love, I would recommend this book to children ages, 12 and up and I would also recommend the book to young adults, because the book is very enjoying."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Wouldn't it be fun to live in the early 1900's?

It came quickly from Amazon. It is a 300ish page hardback with moderate sized text. It is quality material, pages and binding. It is well worth the price. I recommend reading this book for all children, \\"growing\\" empathy for the opposite sex for boys as well as providing models for girls. It is an essential addition to the libraries of children's depts of public libraries, elementary and junior high schools, and a supplemental text for undergraduate courses in Victorian literature.

Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this story when I was 11. It was a bit too mature for me then, but I enjoyed it so much at 13. I identified with both Jo and Beth. I noticed Jo's literary bent and Beth's inherent shyness in myself.My British mom owned two volumes of Alcott's story--Little Women and Little Wives (sometimes known as Good Wives). Little Wives or Good Wives is simply Little Women, Part II in the U.S. As a young girl, I preferred the story of the girls before they married. As I grew older, I appreciated Part II or Little Wives so much more.I didn't often re-read the entire books. I had my favorite chapters. I just loved the chapter--Experiments--when Marmee permits the girls to enjoy the first week of their summer vacation with no household chores. It ends with them all thoroughly fed up with their life of leisure. Jo especially feels the need for work and gives a dinner party with disastrous results.Another favorite chapter of mine was when Meg goes to \\"Vanity Fair,\\" a weekend of frivolity at her wealthy friend's home ending in a ball where the rich girls lend her a gown to replace her old torn one. With the help of makeup and frills, they make her into someone quite different, taking away from some of the freshness and innocence she still possessed at 17. This is the night when she overhears a couple of old biddies talking about how good it would be for the March family if Meg could manage to marry the wealthy Laurence boy (Laurie). They were convinced that Mrs. March had her plans for the two.But Alcott made it very clear that Marmee was quite a different sort of mother--she wanted nothing but happiness and love for her daughters, and she didn't believe that a great deal of money was necessary in order to be happy.The moral lessons in this book abound. The sickness and death of Beth are looked upon as life experiences more than terrible tragedies, and death is seen as a beginning to a new life. Beth talks about how she'll miss Jo even in \\"heaven,\\" and Jo says after Beth's passing, \\"We must thank God that Beth is well at last.\\"Meg thumbs her nose at cranky, wealthy Aunt March when the older woman says that should Meg marry her financially-strapped suitor, John Brooke, that she'll inherit none of her money. She lets her know in no uncertain terms that love means far more to her than money.Jo gives up writing her \\"potboilers\\"--the violent, mawkish thrillers that her German professor friend hates and instead pens a touching story about her sister, Beth, and wins his approval and a marriage proposal. She has already turned down Laurie's proposal because she realizes that although she loves her \\"boy\\" as a friend that she needs something different in a husband.So there are many lessons, but I never felt as a child that I was reading a book of sermons. I felt as though I were reading about real people and I learned to care about them. I loved all of it--the fashion talk--the way Meg and Amy cared so much about style and how Jo would carry a lemonade-stained glove crumpled up in her hand and wear a gown that had fireplace burns on the back of the skirt and just laugh and enjoy herself.I read all the Alcott books to my daughter when she was ten. When I read the final words of Jo's Boys, \\"Let the curtain fall forever on the March family,\\" the tears rolled down her face. I remember just a while after I had given birth to my daughter thinking, \\"Oh, wonderful, I'm going to share Little Women with her--what a joy!\\""},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read this as a young girl and love it even today.

The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"5 stars!!!!

Some tragic things happen, but the March family definitely cares about everyone that comes into their lives and stays strong even while the man of the house is fighting in the Civil War.

I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition. I love the Barnes and Noble classics series! The text is highly readable and easy on the eyes (while maintaining elegance), and the covers are well bound and lovely for a paperback. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined.

However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition. Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This may sound ridiculous, but I was bound and determined to hate this novel. I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I decided to reread Little Women before reading the Pulitzer Prize-winning March by Geraldine Brook, which is written from the viewpoint of the family's father, off serving as a Chaplain during the Civil War.As always happens, as I read a favorite children's book as an adult, I find things that I love to be reminded of, but also notice how many life messages simply slipped past me during the early reading. There are some great life lessons about marriage and relationships, especially after a child is added to the mix, for example.There were certainly aspects of the book that come across a bit too sweet and cloying, but those are balanced by the images of a young girl Jo (and her mother Marmee) stepping out a bit from the controlling and limiting expectations on women of the time.I read the book now from the viewpoint of a military spouse who has also watched my husband deploy into a war zone. I also do many workshops for military spouses dealing with the current deployments so I know what they deal with. My first reaction was that the March family and mother especially had it pretty good in comparison. They have a fulltime maid Hannah for one thing, something that any military spouse would give a lot to have! But many of the emotions, thoughts and fears of current military spouses are matched in this book (and even more so in March).All in all a great read, a nice view into a totally different time in our history -- now I want to watch the movie again!Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help!

I first picked it up about a year ago in a bookstore when |I was bored, which pretty unusual because I can usually always find something to read.It was the name that caught my eye. I had read a biography of Louisa May Alcott in a Social Studies textbook, and I knew about this book. But I had never read it.It was a small, thick copy in Scholastic Classics Edition. I opened it and the first sentence got mee hooked, about how tomboyish, bookworm Jo March wishes she had presents for Christmas.And then, I read on and on. I learned about grownup, sweet Meg, shy and music-loving Beth, and artistic, pretty Amy. 'But of course I had to leave that bookstore. But my very nice aunt bought the book for me.In that edition the book was 560 pages long, and I finished it in less than three days.This terrific book of love, laughter, friendship, and family is sure to charm everyone who takes the time and patience to read its thick volume. But, believe me, it's WORTH IT!!!"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I read Little Women recently and I would probably reccommend it to anyone that is okay with a sad, romantic book. The main character is Jo, a tomboy growing up in the late 19th century. It is Jo's story as she becomes an adult, and I think it is a great coming-of-age book for both boys and girls. (Girls would probably enjoy it a little more than boys.) Either way, it's a great book and you should read it as soon as you get your hands on it."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!JANA"},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love. The novel chronicles the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, during the time of the civil war.Each girl has her own unique characteristics and traits which Ms. Alcott does a brilliant job bringing each of them to life. Meg, the oldest, womanly, beautiful and proper; Jo, the author and tomboy; Beth, the frail gentle caring soul; and Amy, the youngest, the vain artist.Each of the girls lean on each other for support while their father is away at war and their mother taking care of the sick. The girls entertain each other by putting on plays in their attic that Jo has written. The girls also befriend their neighbor, Laurie, who falls in love with Jo.Throughout the years the girls experience Meg's courtship and marriage to Laurie's tutor, John; Beth's sickness and brush with death; Amy's venture overseas to study and travel with Aunt March; and Jo's travel to New York to \\"escape\\" and further her passion for writing.

I enjoyed the book alot.Read about Meg, the pretty and mature one, Jo, the tomboy, Beth, frail and quiet, and Amy, the spoiled and confident one. You can relate the these &quot;little women&quot; as you read.But don't forget loving Marmee, fun and lovable Teddy, and mysterious but caring Mr. Lawrence.I devoured every page of the book. I read almost 100 pages each day! The only part I found somewhat boring were the chapters about Jo in New York. Well the letters were a bit boring.There are so many memorable moments in this book: Meg's vanity fair, Jo's haircut, Amy's punishment and humiliation at school, Beth's sickness, the birth of Daisy and Demi, and Jo's school.

There are lots of references to Dickens, 19th century schools of thought and people and places of the times.You can read the real book young-- I read it in 6th grade, and it's still one of my faves.But your child will not get it until they are much older, not matter how gifted they are!!!!!!!!!!!!An adaptation is not the answer. It's like feeding your child a pint of spaghetti sauce that has been drowned in a quart of water--the original is there, but the flavor is gone. And so it the nutrition!!!There are plenty of books your child will enjoy and RELATE to. Wait to read the real thing.

We like to talk about the characters, analyze their behavior and choices.i don't agree when people says this book tells the girls to become housewives. It does not.

It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics. My teacher recommended \\"Little Women\\" for me to read. So, I went off and bought it at the bookstore. In this edition you read an introductin first which I thought was a bit boring and long. It tells about the back round of the author and how this book was made. This story is broken up into two parts. The story starts out with four girls- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic. All in all, I thought this story was pretty good and I am not disappointed in it. I am very happy I read it. I know it is a classic and I do understand why."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little Women","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"The Sensuous Woman","review":"The \\"how to please your man\\" tone had my inner feminist cringing a bit, but most of the advice was quite solid. Respect for yourself and your feelings, a giving attitude, and acceptance of the little foibles that all men and women are prone to will make you happier and more exciting in bed. Ms. J has a no-nonsense, big-sisterly style that is quite assuring. Her advice about \\"veneral disease\\" is strictly 1969, but even there she has something timeless to say - \\"If...there is something wrong in the genital area, don't sit around frozen in fear, run to the gynecologist.\\" For the most part she says what countless others have said since - Self-confidence is sexy and taking responsibility for your own pleasure is even sexier."},{"Title":"The Sensuous Woman","review":"The first time I read this book I was too bashful to read it completely.

It really taught me alot, and for those women who are too embarassed to practice the Keigle (sp?) exercises, don't be. The exercise alone is capable of bringing a man to his knees - trust me, I know. I have told countless people about this book and those who bought it AND utilized it swore that their sex life improved greatly.

Reading it helped me become quite the popular guy with the ladies throughout my teens and twenties, and for that, I thank the author.I found it again recently at age 34 while home for the holidays. Having 20+ years of experiencing human sexuality behind me (and being quite the student of it during that time) has helped me see that this was probably a fine book for the average repressed girl of the 60s and 70s, but has no place being read today other than for nostalgic purposes.The edition I speak of was a paperback published in 1971.The book contains more information on wearing a dress to complement your legs than it does about birth control or disease prevention. It speaks openly about how fantastic orgies can be, yet advises women to run when a man takes out the handcuffs.Conflicts like this are unhealthy and quite possibly dangerous! Did I pick up on them at age 12? Of course not, but by contemporary standards, this book should be shelved and shared with young women as an example of where the country's collective mind was 30-40 years ago, but certainly not today."},{"Title":"The Sensuous Woman","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 13 years old. I had no idea that I would hang on to the advice and information it contained and refer to it even now at age 38. In fact I just gave it to a dear friend who told me that she hadn't had an orgasm in the last 15 years of her marriage. Needless to say, she thought something was wrong with her. She thought she would never feel &quot;those feelings&quot; again. She was stuck in the mentality that &quot;good girls&quot; accept what they get. The Sensuous Woman changed her life. She has blossomed into a wild, vibrant being. This book definitely helped set her on that path. I can't recommend it highly enough, especially for women who don't know the joys and beauty of their own sensuality, or for those who have been made to feel bad for thinking that there could be something to sex besides dutiful intercouse."},{"Title":"The Sensuous Woman","review":"A friend shared this book with me on a plane nearly 30 years ago.

The saga begins at the beginning, embracing the intimate originality of the Viking myth from its origins in the Scandinavian countries to the wonderfully adventurous, yet poignant infiltration into the New World. As the 1,000th celebration of Leif Ericson spreads throughout the globe, this book is a must have for anyone with an interest in truth about Norse groups who went &quot;a-viking,&quot; touched today's and tomorrow's beliefs with their culture, and in fact, first met with the American Natives. It is clear, as found in the pages of this meticulously researched and documented book, that recent archeological finds support a few ancient theories but dispel others. The book is enhanced with colorful maps, numerous photos of artifacts and narrates the generational tale of the family who, even in their struggles, introduced the globe and the ages to a new continent. Delightful accounts of Norse mythology, day-to-day living, and culture help bring the heralders many of the world's ethnic groups across the ages to the here and now, a literary gem which applauds the anniversary of their amazing accomplishments."},{"Title":"Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga","review":"&quot;Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga&quot; is a book which should be on the shelves of any ordinary person who is seriously interested in the subject. Having said that I should warn potential buyers that the book is written by a number of authors of differing views. Readers should not just pick bits and pieces out of it but carefully read the whole. As would be expected, the book leans to the view of conservative scholarship, that the only proved contact between Vikings and North America is that of L'Anse aux Meadows, but some contributors seem to feel this means they must deny the possibility of any other contact and in my opinion they go overboard. For example, a strong attack with all the old gossip is mounted on the authenticity of the Kensington Rune Stone but what is not riddled with errors has by and large already been refuted. Surely too it was not necessary to describe R.A. Hall jnr, Emeritus Professor of Linguistics at Cornell, who for nearly thirty years has been one of the strongest supporters of the authenticity of the Kensington Rune Stone, as an 'amateur'. Nor was it reasonable to refer only to his 1982 book while omitting reference to his &quot;The Kensington Rune-stone: Authentic and Important&quot; published in 1994.In the attempt to protect received history, no mention was made of the probability that some of the survivors of the fourteen ships which went missing from Eric the Red's voyage of settlement to Greenland made it instead to North America and took residence amongst the natives. Similarly lacking is any mention that in the course of returning from his original voyage of discovery Lief Ericsson rescued Thorer and his crew who had been wrecked in the waters between Vinland and Greenland. Thorer's ship had been carrying timber which possibly came from North America and suggests prior knowledge of that country. Biarne Grimolfson perished in the 'Irish Ocean' when his ship was attacked and sunk by Teredo worms. The survivors reached Dublin in the ship's boat. This points to direct Atlantic crossings at a very early date but no mention of this or the implications of this advanced navigational knowledge was made in the book. The theories of Farley Mowat about pre-Viking European contact with North America are misrepresented as being about contact by early Norse when anyone who has read his book &quot;The Farfarers&quot; will know that Mowat proposed early North American contact by people other than the Norse.In some sections of the book the reader is not being told the full story. In this and similar respects I think the book does the reader a disservice.Nevertheless, my view of this book is by no means entirely negative and I believe it should be on the shelves of anyone with a general interest in Vikings and the North Atlantic. My primary concern is that the reader should be aware that like the 'curates egg' - &quot;parts of it are excellent&quot;."},{"Title":"Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga","review":"What a complete package! Absolutely loaded with huge beautiful pictures of everything from ancient maps to medieval Scandinavian jewelry to charts of what individual experts think the Vikings dubbed &quot;Vinland&quot;, this book has it all. Someone familiar with the subject will find it gorgeously re-introduced in this extremely professional layout, and yet anyone new to the subject will find this book to be inviting, informative, and fun to read. While this book doesn't dig quite as deep as either Jones' textbook-format &quot;A History of The Vikings&quot; or Haywood's geographically well-documented &quot;The Penguin Historical Atlas of The Vikings&quot;, this is still like a huge compilation of every other Viking book I've seen yet, giving the subject the spotlight that it needs after so many recent discoveries. A very professional complete package for everyone."},{"Title":"Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga","review":"This series of essays by Norse scholars is better than any novel I've read in years. So many mysteries, beautifully articulated! Why did a Bishop drop his gold ring in the choir loft? Why did witnesses come forward twenty years later to swear a wedding took place in Greenland just before its population completely disappeared? Why did the Vikings skedaddle out of Vinland? Why did they disappear with their furniture from Greenland but leave their livestock behind? Why did the majority of women die young and the majority of men live into their fifties?Don't start reading this wonderful book if you're supposed to be doing something else; you won't be able to put this down.What I like best of all, even better than the outstanding illustrations, is the tone of the writing. You are drawn into another historical era and invited to live there.--Linda Donelson, author of &quot;Out of Isak Dinesen: Karen Blixen's untold story&quot;"},{"Title":"Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga","review":"This sumptuous and lavishly illustrated volume of 432 large pages, was published by the Smithsonian Institution in 2000 to coincide with the thousandth year, as close as we can reckon, of Leif Erikson's pioneering voyage to North America where he founded an outpost in \\"Vinland\\" that was used by subsequent expeditions until finally being abandoned after several skirmishes with the native inhabitants -- this according to the two pertinent surviving sagas.The book is an impressive compendium of scholarship by 40 writers in 32 different articles, naturally from often different viewpoints. It gets a five-star rating not because I don't have disagreements with certain conclusions of a number of articles, but because of the wealth of information it contains on Viking/Norse life and legacies for anyone seriously interested in the topic. It's divided into seven sections, titled Viking Homelands, Viking Raiders (in Europe), Vikings in the North Atlantic (including Iceland), Viking America, Norse Greenland, and Viking Legacy. (The term \\"Viking\\" is ill-used as applied to Iceland and the farther lands -- or for that matter in Europe after about 1100 -- but the label seems irresistible to publishers in titles, even to the Smithsonian. At least Greenland gets a proper \\"Norse\\" label.)Obviously it's not a work to be read cover to cover in one gulp. Since there are too many topics and regions covered in detail to look at closely in a review of any reasonable length, I'll focus briefly here on \\"Viking America,\\" which presents eight major articles. Their topics range from Ellesmere Island in the High Arctic where Norse artifacts have been found, to, of course, Vinland in the far south (just how far south a matter of complex disputes often passionately held.) Too, it explores what the lore and the sagas tell us on one hand, to hard archeological digs on the other, both subject to interpretation. An interesting wrap-up article in this section is intriguingly titled \\"Unanswered Questions.\\" The Canadian archeologist Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, who wrote two articles and collaborated on another, has been in charge of the famous L'Anse aux Meadows site at the northern tip of Newfoundland since its discoverers Helge and Anne Ingstad finished their work there in the late 1960s. With the Ingstads she believes the site is in fact the remains of Leif's settlement of Leifsbudir -- although others, including Carl Sauer, Erik Wahlgren and myself, have strong doubts on that score. But even if we're right, this in no way diminishes the importance of the site, as this is the first thoroughly, physically confirmed site of Norse occupation found in America. If I may register a guess, it might have been a strategically placed \\"way station\\" occupied for a few years by some other unrecorded Norse voyagers presumably from Greenland, which would open other intriguing questions. There's a good possibility that we'll never know.Another engrossing article deals with the native peoples of these regions: the Innu, Dorset, and Thule Inuit in northern Canada and Greenland (it was the Thule \\"Eskimos\\" who remained after the Dorset and Norse were gone), plus the now-extinct Beothuk Indians of Newfoundland; a panel of four maps shows their respective areas of occupancy from AD 900 to 1500. Several articles in the America and Greenland sections look at contacts and relations between the Norse and \\"natives\\" (remembering that the Norse Greenlanders were no less \\"native\\" than the Thule, having lived in southwest Greenland for over 300 years before the Thule ever arrived in that region). One article includes a recounting of an Inuit folk tale as told to the Danish Greenland official H.J. Rink in 1858, of a bloody incident and reprisals between a group of Inuit and Norse hundreds of years before, complete with color illustrations drawn for Rink by an Inuit artist.The above comments scarcely touch the surface of the riches to be found in this volume. The general tone is scholarly and carefully conservative in most respects (sometimes too conservative and one-sided in my view, as if the writers/editors were reluctant to delve much into matters subject to heated controversies except to dispose of them as quickly as possible). Nevertheless, all in all it's a most impressive compendium of fascinating information not obtainable elsewhere, and the editors and writers are to be congratulated for that."},{"Title":"Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga","review":"This great book takes you from western Europe and Russia to L'Anse aux Meadows, Newfoundland in a gigantic arc of detail and archaeology.

The pitfall, it seems, is an agenda established by the editors to discount the slightest consideration of evidence of any kind for Norse contact south of the Canadian boarder, reinforced by gratuitous remarks throughout the catalogue (we wonder by whom) denigrating pre-contact research.

But he has done a guidebook to an industry that seems very fragmented - with this book, you get a good grip about what is fragmented and what is already standardized. The author really penetrates deep into the concepts, drilling down into position-service APIs, geocoding languages, and privacy aspects. Sometimes, he even manages to make the stuff funny, and it is readable all the time. There are a lot of tricky things here, and as a developer, you had better have a clue about which traps there are to avoid. So far, cost seems to be the biggest problem for deployment - GPS is too [costly], mobile phone networks do not offer this as a service (which they could, and this is very well covered in the book).It is a five-star in my view."},{"Title":"Creating Location Services for the Wireless Web Professional Developer's Guide","review":"This guy really took on a big area - and you get the impression it is still very much an area being worked on. There seems to be a lot of hot air and very proprietary solutions in the field, but not in the book. He concentrates on standards, since he like me realizes that the proprietary standards will not go anywhere. None of them can become big enough.He talks about positioning systems, APIs, how to add geocodes using the Geographic Markup Language - really useful. The only things I missed were some more examples from real services. But he does say that since many use text messages phones, and almost all interfaces are proprietary, it is hard to talk about without being extremely specific. There could be more about how to use GPS on PDAs, though, but I guess there are not actually that many services out there.The book really digs down into the subject (there is even a chapter on privacy), and I found it extremely useful. Lots of stuff there I did not know before. There could be more software on the CD, although there are pointers to lots of it. So I got it anyway. Good buy."},{"Title":"Creating Location Services for the Wireless Web Professional Developer's Guide","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I provides an excellent overview of location sensitive technologies and services. I particularly liked Chapter 10 (&quot;Pulling it all together&quot;), which provides practical advice on how to build new applications. The chapter on privacy was also extremely useful. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mike Fink: A tall tale","review":"MIke Fink is a story with lots of surprises and great pictures.Mike was able to do many things that seemed impossible.

Kellogg endows him with burly good looks and a great big smile, even as he has to twist a few arms to get attention paid to his exploits. The cartoon-like illustrations are colorful and boisterous, which perfectly suits the rhythm of the text. Lots of fun for any kid who enjoys tall tales (especially tall tales with a Mark Twainesque flavor, as this has rivers and steamboats a-plenty!)."},{"Title":"Mike Fink: A tall tale","review":"It is clear that this is a tall tale as Mike runs away from home at age two days. The illustrations are very well done. BUT Mike Fink was a real person, and I would prefer a real story about the real character instead of this yarn. Kellogg could have made up a character and told the same story. It has nothing to do with the real Mike Fink."},{"Title":"Best Of Josie & The Pussycats","review":"This is a nice collectors item that no doubt will be worth something someday. It's a collection of the &quot;best&quot; Josie and the Pussycat stories that have appeared in Archie Comics over the years. It features the very first story with Josie, Melody, Alexander, Cabot, Pepper and Albert titled &quot;A Gym Dandy&quot; from the comic &quot;She's Josie&quot; #12, February 1963. They also have little samples from when Alan M. and Alexandra first appeared in the stories, and when Valerie also first appeared. It goes through their music career as a band and their various friendships. It was nice to relive these stories. One of my all time favorite stories was not in here though, it was titled &quot;The Ghostly Guardian&quot; which appeared in the October 1990 issue of Betty &amp; Veronica #21 Double Digest, where the gang visits an old mansion and discover a hidden passage, and a treasure. Overall this is a good paperback to own!"},{"Title":"Best Of Josie & The Pussycats","review":"I've always been a fan of both the \\"Josie\\" comic books (created and drawn by the one and only Dan DeCarlo) and the \\"Josie\\" cartoon.

Josie was a female Archie.... All red hair and things always happen to her. In 1963, Josie created a band , The Pussycats.In 1966-1967, The Archies were on animated on TV and into the music scene with Sugar,Sugar. By 1968, Valerie joined the group in the comics and the rest is Pussycat comic history (or is it HER-story). This was before the Pussycats hit Saturday Morning TV themselves. If you havent gottenJosie and the Pussycats - The Complete Series(See my review), go get this treat! BUT do missJosie and the Pussycats (PG-13 Version), this movie does not capture the cartoon in live action...it is a piece of trashThese 12 stories and short selective panels in this collection created a Pussycat history.The best of these in a wonderful story from 1988, (Cat at the Crossroads) where Josie wants to quit the band.It is a nice way to get the best of the Pussycats. The art will never win awards for best comic, but it is in the classic Archie comics style.

Josie was not originallly about a group of girl rockers, Alexandra was actually a witch (and NOT metaphorically speaking as she was in the TV show), Brother Alex was actually an egomaniac as opposed to his cowardly TV persona, etc.We have here the comic book evolution of the Josie concept and even how it eventually got to be a television show. We have here how Valerie joined the band and even Hanna-Barbera themselves (in cartoon form) welcoming the girls to their cartoon show (of course, nothing is mentioned here about Hanna-Barbera originally balking at including the African-American character of Valerie, a sad chapter in cartoon history that fortunately ended with them doing the right thing and welcoming Valerie aboard).Incidentally, the comic book stories, as evidenced in this collection, were usually more interesting than the cartoon tv series, which pretty much told the same story every time about \\"meddling kids\\" foiling the misdeeds of archvillans.But anyway, buy this and get some pretty cool cartoon history."},{"Title":"Best Of Josie & The Pussycats","review":"I absolutely loved this when it arrived.

It contains several short panels featuring the appearances of some of the other characters like Alexandra Cabot and Alan.

Originally, Josie was a regular, old teen cutie/good girl art comicbook created by Dan DeCarlo in 1963, with tales of teenage hijinx and feminine wiles that were pretty similar to the \\"Betty And Veronica\\" stories, just with a different cast of characters. In 1969, \\"Josie Comics\\" was revamped to become \\"Josie And The Pussycats,\\" with Josie and her pals in an all-female band that was sort of the \\"girl\\" equivalent of The Archies. If you set aside the mild sexism of having the band dressed in Playboy bunny-ish leopardskin costumes, these are pretty fun stories.Although this is a great collection, it could be better. The focus is on the band, a concept that came after Josie had been around for years, so the earlier, perkier episodes of the original \\"Here's Josie\\" comic are passed over pretty quickly. The first Josie story, from 1963, is included, and the artwork is so stylish and so cool, you'll wish (as I do) that they would go back and reissue all the original stories in chronological order: this was vintage DeCarlo, the sort of stuff that inspired \\"Love And Rockets\\" artist Jaime Hernandez, so good, you'll thirst for more. Also, several stories are referenced by having only one page of touched-up artwork included, so that we \\"meet\\" various characters -- it's an okay idea, but it interrupts the flow of the book, and just doesn't feel very satisfying. The late '60s and early '70s take up most of the book, which is rounded off by a couple of later episodes from the 1980s, when the Pussycats got a mild punk/new wave makeover. While no mention of it is made in the book, this volume was issued in conjunction with a 2001 live-action movie which some consider a camp classic. All in all, this is an enjoyable collection, definitely worth picking up if you like to read vintage Archie stuff. But put me down as voting in favor of a more complete reissue of the earliest, most DeCarlo-icious episodes. That would be awesome!

I have read almost all of her books and consider this one of her best."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"'Echoes\\" is actually one of Binchy's older novels, and it is classic Binchy with a convincing blend of human drama, social commentary and romance. As with almost all her novels, \\"Echoes\\" is peopled with memorable characters and filled with poignancy.\\"Echoes\\" tells the story of Clare O'Brien, a grocer's daughter growing up in a small Irish holiday resort. Clare is a bright girl and dreams of a life beyond her present circumstances. Then there is David, a doctor's only son whose mother is class-conscious and disapproving of her son's friendship with Clare. There's also Gerry, a photographer's son. These three lives intersect and the story focuses on them growing up amidst the class prejudices of the times and how individuals discover what life is about and what truly matters.I'm a long-time Binchy fan and I've been collecting her books since I first read Circle of Friends back when I was in college more than a decade ago. Her stories are always so real and down-to-earth, peopled with characters that are not just well-developed but ones readers can relate to and genuinely care about. The story here flows seamlessly and pulls you in, and as with most of Binchy's works, makes you feel all warm inside."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I'm surprised this book doesn't have as many reviews as her other titles.

From then on I was hooked! She writes with such a charming flair, that it's hard NOT to like any of her books--and I've got 12 of her books to prove it! I recommend this book very highly...take patience in the beginning, it WILL get better!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Poor, poor, poor.After rereading this book, I wondered why I wasted my time again. Maeve Binchy is usually a very reliable story teller and this book is not up to her ususal standards. The character descriptions are great in the begining but towards the end,the story line and characters fall apart. The ending is extremely unsatisfying.Choose another book by this author if you're new to Binchy,such as Tara Road. But if you must read Echoes,get it from the library, don't spend your money on it."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book was thoroughly depressing!

If somebody hadto be sacrificed I could handle it being Gerry Doyle, therewas something disconcerting about his character.Angela O'Hara was great; her pairing with Dick Dillon wasat first a bit surprising but satisfying in the end.This was a pleasant story about average Irish people, howthey work, live, and love, and how and why they keep somany family secrets."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Very well written, as always.

That being said, I thought Echoes was a great story! I appreciate how well Maeve is able to make all the characters seem like real people.. they are never overdone and you can maybe even recognize them in yourself or in your friends. Perhaps one of the better aspects of any book I've read by Maeve is her story-telling style. Maeve is gifted at putting the words together, such that it seems like you are having a conversation with an old friend.If you have read by Maeve before, Echoes will not disappoint. If you are new to Maeve then Echoes will likely have you hunting for your next Maeve story. Echoes is a bit long, but once you get attached to the main characters (especially Clare) it's difficult to set aside the book for very long."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy is a magical author. Echoes is a story with the power to evoke many emotions. Her characters jump from the pages into your imagination imprinting a reality. You feel that these are real people. Clare and David are characters with faults and you love them for it. But, they also have strength that resounds within anyone reading it. At the end of the book you feel fulfilled and wish you could walk the beach of Castle Bay. Maeve Binchy has an incredible talent for creating stories you not only relate to, but that you live the story out with the characters. Read just one of her books you will want to read them all."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I consider myself a huge Maeve Binchy fan, and this book by far, was my favorite one. I loved the details that are her trademark. It was a book I devoured in 2 days."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I normally prefer romance novels, but this was nice for a change. It's a story about many different people in a small town on the coast of Ireland. Some set goals and work hard for them, others do not. One fellow had movie star good looks, was very smart, but never committed to anyone or anything. Girls loved him. It was fascinating watching what happened to these people over the course of many years. Some people I loved, others I disliked. The only negative for me was the ending. It was ok but sad.CAUTION SPOILERS: It was sad because a guy cheated on his wife. She suspected it all along but never wanted to admit it to herself. When a friend proved it to her, her husband was sorry but couldn't say so and he couldn't make any promises for the future. Yet, she forgave him and I assume stayed with him. That was too sad for me. I wished there was more explaining why he did it, or reasons to trust that he wouldn't do it again. I'm writing this a day later, and I'm still sad thinking about it. I wish the author would have given us a happier feeling at the end. Although, I am glad I read the book, and I will continue to think about some of the characters in the future.Sexual language: none.

Wonderful characters whom we care about very much and a story which reaches out and brings you in as though you, too, were a resident of Castlebay. Kate Binchy is a marvelous reader and her narration does full justice to this terrific book. In one of the editorial reviews above I noted that Kate Binchy is described as Maeve Binchy's daugther which is a mistake. She is Maeve Binchy's cousin and narrates quite a few of the novels. Echoes is wonderfully read and produced and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I am always looking for new works by Maeve Binchy.

I love Maeve Binchy but I'm glad I didn't read this book before reading the Copper Beach, the Glass Lake, and Evening Class, which were all wonderful, or I never would have read another book by her. The characters start out so promising, and then their personalities become completely unpredictable towards the end. I think the plot wasn't well thought out for this novel, because the ending is tragic and severe, comes suddenly and really doesn't make a lot of sense. I recommend people read The Glass Lake, which is one of my favorites, and don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I am not a member of Amazon.com and so decided to take a kid's review. It says above that I am 12, but I am actually 14.When I read this book I was captivatated as it is based on themes of change and this is conveyed very strongly by Claire O'Brien, daughter of the local shopkeepers, who grew up alongside the local doctor's perfect son, David Power. Claire receives a scholarship for college and it is there that she meets David again and they fall in love. The perfect part, though, is that it is not a mushy-mushy happy ending as there is betrayal, but the title of Echoes fits this book very much as the story seems to echo and you don't know what happens to David and Claire. It was my first Maeve Binchy and I thought it was brilliant."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I've read everything Maeve Binchy has written, and in my opinion this is by far the best of her many novels. It's about a group of friends growing up together in a small seaside town in 1950s Ireland. As they get older they discover there are differences of status between their families, and Claire and David, who are beginning to fall in love as teenagers, discover his family is not receptive to their relationship.The story moves on, through their college years and beyond, and along the way Binchy shows the passage of time by subtly blending social and political changes in with the characters' lives. Binchy has fantastic story-telling skills, and these are best exhibited in her earlier books, such as this and Light a Penny Candle; I did find some of her later books a little disappointing."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I started reading this book about 6:00 one night, and ended up staying awake until about 4:00 to finish it. I loved it, the beginning anyway. The characters were very real and the story was very good. I got very caught up it in, and couldn't put it down. Then came the last fifty or maybe a hundred pages. Maeve Binchy set up an amazing plot, a little depressing maybe, but still good, but the ending was no where near my expectations based on the rest of the book. It seemed like she spent months building up the story, then realized &quot;Oh no! I only have two days to my deadline!&quot; then hastily wrapped up the book in a very unsatisfying way that was untrue to the characters and very disappointing. Read it anyway, it's still a very good book, just don't take the ending as personnally as I did. I spent the next day very sad and very tired."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have never, repeat never, read a book as touching and involving as this one. I have no clue why this was my first introduction to such a superior storyteller as Maeve Binchy. I'm only saddened that I've waited so long to read one of her books. I can't wait to get another. This lady has a gift. This book is enthralling. Definitely not a story you will soon forget if ever. The characters are amazingly real, you grow so attached to them faults and all. You will be happy for them at times and your heart will absolutely break for them at other times. Simply fabulous. Although a little slow in the beginning you won't be able to put it down when things start happening. Although I didn't like the way the ending left me hanging, I couldn't dare think it wasn't worth it. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story! However this one isn't good, it's wonderful!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"ECHOES by Maeve BinchyHere's a book I read earlier this summer - ECHOES by Maeve Binchy. It's the story of two people, David Powers and Clare O'Brien, and how their lives seem to be destined to come together, despite what social status dictates. They grow up in the same small town of Castlebay in Ireland, travelling in different circles, since David's family is well to do, while Clare's is part of the working class. But they eventually find their lives intertwined as they approach adulthood.Clare's desire as she's growing up is to leave this small town, where she knows she would be trapped forever, expected to live out a life as traditionally as women have in the past - get married, have babies. Clare wants more for herself, and with the help of her teacher Angela O'Hara, who had remained single so far into her adult life, she tries to meet her goal.David's calling is to be a doctor as his father before him. For him, his parents prefer something better than being stuck forever with a lower class girl like Clare. It is their hopes that he marries into a prominent Irish family and continues the family practice.But fate has something different in mind. The story of David and Clare had me glued to this book, and as always Maeve Binchy tells a great story, filled with wonderful personalities that surround the main characters. I highly recommend ECHOES as one of Binchys' best books to date. Don't be put off by the length. It's worth the read!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This was my third Maeve Binchy experience and by far my favorite. Better than CIRCLE OF FRIENDS or TARA ROAD. A rich story, and wonderfully developed characters. The town of Castlebay is described beautifully, and Clare's experience at the university in Dublin adds a nice variety to the setting. I agree with other reviewers that the ending was not completely satisfying because it left me hanging, but I really did enjoy ECHOES. Pour a cup of tea, curl up with this book and be transported to your own Irish cottage in Castlebay."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is a great story of life in a small Irish village. The characters are wonderfully real to life. Maeve really captures Irish village life mentality. Once you get in to the book it is hard to put down. I couldn't wait to pick it up and read when ever I had the time, it leaves you wondering what is going to happen next? I loved the story but not the ending. I wish we had known how things were going to turn out for David &amp; Clare."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy has an uncanny ability to create characters which the reader grows to know and enjoy and hates to let go at the end of the book. In this novel, Binchy details the lives of a group of young people in the town of Castlebay, Ireland, from 1950-1962. There are the usual class distinctions which are far more important to the adults than they are to their children. One young woman, Clare O'Brien, renounces the usual life of her working class parents by working hard enough to get scholarships to school. She studies under the tutelage of Angela O'Hara who was also academically gifted, but whom circumstances have trapped in a dead-end teaching job in her hometown. Clare works hard for her degree, thus separating herself from her family. However, her academic successes have not put her on an even level with some of the young people who come from more prominent families. She and a wealthier young man fall in love and they must battle a variety of negative outside influences. This is an engrossing tale which causes the reader to really care about the characters and what becomes of them."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"In looking through books on tape at the library, I ran across ECHOES, and decided to give it a try. I had never heard of it before, but have found most of Maeve Binchy's stories to be more than good. What at great treat! This is a terrific story about a small seaside village in Ireland called Castlebay. I was immediately hooked on the story.Clare O'Brien is the daughter of a poor shopkeeper and meant to stay in her place in this village where your birth status decides your life. The assumption is rather amazing since the story takes place in the 1950's and early 1960's. Clare is very bright and stands out in a family where her siblings are certainly not overachievers. She's helped and motivated by a young teacher who sees herself in Clare and wants to give her a chance at a better life. Clare works hard and wins several scholarships, which enable her to go on to the university in Dublin. This story is filled with a cast of characters who seemed very genuine to me. The unfolding events explain how Clare changes and how the village people, both rich and poor, view the young woman. Clare's own family, seem to be at odds with the fact that she wants to improve her lot in life, and her choice of a husband is not well received by anyone.The author's daughter, Kate Binchy, read my audio book. She was such an excellent reader, that I will now look for her name on other audio books. She was able, with different Irish accents, to keep each character totally unique."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Started off slow and then was involving. Binchy's characters are very well-drawn and their personal dramas have a very realistic tinge. She has the fabled Irish gift for storytelling that is lyrical and lovely and that draws one deeply into a tale. However, I found the ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I always have enjoyed Maeve's books set in 1950s Ireland, and this one is no exception. Plot lines are not Maeve's strong point and, as often is true of her work, about 75% of the way through, the lack of discernible plot leads her to try to tie up the ends with improbable melodrama. Until then, it is an engrossing book, showing Maeve's gifts for depicting characters, relationships, and a good deal of depth about the realities of life. Her characters have wisdom and insight most of us would envy.I especially liked the characters of Angela and Clare, which were developed very well. Most of the men who are part of the action do not fare so well and have fewer dimensions.Overall, it is a highly enjoyable book - the sort which I'd like to have in my bag during a train or bus ride (which, indeed, is just where I gobbled it down.)"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the best book I've ever read! Characters that will stay in your heart forever."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Binchy happens to be my favorite author but this novel was truly disappointing.Yes,it had it's moments but overall it's was not very pleasing.I would'nt recommend this as a novel by binchy to read first.It would discourage you to read others which are mostly very good.Instead I would go with Tara Road,Circle of Friends,Evening Class or my fav-The Glass Lake.It was uneventful until nearly the end.Binchy is known for a slow beginning but Echoes just never seemed to get very good."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I was mentored by a high school teacher who is closer to me than any person on the planet. In this book, Binchy captures the symbiotic growth experienced by both the teacher and pupil through a relationship that spans decades, from teacher and child to the eventual woman to woman relationship. I loved seeing that transformation on paper. To some, the maternal bond Angela and Clare share may seem unrealistic, but to me, it was perfectly depicted.Also, I find the ending fitting--in fact, I would say perfect--in that sometimes, as adults, we make very different and difficult choices that we would not have made in high school or even college--these sacrifices make us more compelling women in many ways, although they also may make us weaker to those whom expected so much of us."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book was truly breathtaking! As Clare grows up, the reader experiences everything she goes through in her life as a young adult. Her good times keep the reader waiting to see if they will last. When she goes through hard times, the audience holds their breath to see if she will get through the situation alright. I think this book would be enjoyed be readers everywhere"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have read many Binchy novels and have always enjoyed them. &quot;Light a penny candle&quot; being my favorite.

A great read for all folks...."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"My mom turned me on to Maeve Binchy this summer with Tara Road. I loved it. Echoes is also wonderful until you get to the end. The ending is so abrupt and disconnected it is hard to take. The women is the story is complex and mulit-layered so it's a shame that we don't get to know how she handles the next phase of her life. I'm almost afraid to try another book this one was so disappointing."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This was a great book until about 100 pages from the end. I loved David and Claire despite their flaws (and maybe because of them) and felt very strongly about the huge cast of peripheral characters. The main story centers around David and Claire but intertwined are many side stories, not least of which centers around the small Irish town which is a character in itself. There were a few things I disliked such as the constant repetition and though I liked Angela as a character, I found the story involving her brother tiresome. Also I'm not sure a detailed account of who liked who and was dating who each and every summer was exactly necessary to plot development. But overall, I would rate the majority of the book 5 stars.Then the book changes entirely. I won't spoil the ending but once David and Claire change their life course (and you'll know what I'm talking about once you there), all hell breaks loose. Characters go completely against their development and one of, if the not THE, most important them of education/bettering yourself/getting the hell out of the small town is completely forgotten. You begin to dislike David and Claire until the very ending when you'll REALLY dislike them. I literally groaned at the plot twist and just sped through the rest until I was done with thing.*SPOILER ALERT*So my advice is to read this great 5 star book and stop once Claire learns she is pregnant and Dr. Powers has a seizure. Yes, this would be an unsatisfactory ending but not nearly to the level of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Yes, this is a \\"re-issue\\" of one of her earlier novels but, that doesn't change the fact that this is still one of Maeve's better books. It starts off with unanswered questions that keep you pulled into the plot line and characters all the way though the book while enchanting you with the town in Ireland that you'll want to visit by the end of the book!I picked the book up one night at 8pm and didn't put it down till 5am the following morning. I just HAD to know what happened and all the answers to the questions before I could go to sleep. I passed the book along to 8 of my friends and all of them (male and female alike) all enjoyed and read the book in the same time or less than I did.Maeve Binchy is one of the better contemporary writers of our time. I just wish that more of her books were made into films. I want to go to the places that Maeve takes me!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I love every book Maeve Binchy has ever written. Her writing style is superb and I never want her books to end. I feel like I know the characters personally."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I am a great fan of Maeve Binchy's books. She brings all her characters to life. \\"Echoes\\" is a wonderful read and one of Binchy's best books."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Never predictable, but always engrossing, in Echoes Maeve Binchy is at her best. From the first few pages, till the last I was involved with every believable character."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Typical hometown family story that you would expect from Madge Binchy. She was one of a kind. We have lost a great author."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I was in the middle of reading this when Maeve died so I felt a tad guilty that I wasn't loving this book. I appreciated the totality of the story when it was over but it just didn't keep my interest like everything else of hers I've read. It felt like it was the (long) story of someone's life that just wasn't all that exciting."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I love reading this author's books. She's great at developing characters. If you are looking for murder and mayhem, then you'd be better off reading someone else's work. I have read other books of Binchy's that I enjoyed more than this one. But, this was my second time reading this book (once when it first came out) and it still held my interest throughout."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Excellent book, I couldn't stop reading it. It was one of those books that I got so into that I just couldn't stop reading it, I had to find out what happened. I finished it much faster than what I usually do. I would recommend this book to my friends as well as colleagues."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I agree that it was slow to begin and that the ending wasn't exactly happy. But I really enjoyed reading it and about thinking about it. I enjoy a book that ends with a bit of reality. Not everyone keeps on pushing thru hard times and sometimes people just need the time to consider what they really want. I know people were upset about the ending but I think that it fit the story. It is worth reading and getting to know these people. I also have enjoyed many of her works."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I was in bed with the flu and wanted a comforting, long story to read and knew I could count on Maeve Binchy. Great characters, and an enjoyable read. I do wish the ending gave a little more information and I felt like the last part of the book was a little untrue to the characters, but overall a great book to snuggle in with."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I think the great thing about Binchy is her unpredictable endings, this is no exception. Again Binchy gives a great insight to Irish life and the witty Irish attitude!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maybe it's me, but this book dragged on and on. I liked the beginning,but by the middle it became too repetitive for me. Who saw who in Dublin, who said what to who, who wore what. Like a movie that is too long, I think 100 pages could have been eliminated. How many times do we really have to hear about Angela's arthritic mother, or mrs. O'Brien looking tired? The limitations of Irish life in a small village in the 50's is very well done, as are the influences of Catholicism."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The beginning is good, but the last 200+ pages seem very forced an formulaic. I finished the book because I had started it, but I didn't really want to. The story seemed to be heading in a predictable direction and I was disappointed at the end that I had wasted several hours of my life on this book. I love some of her other books like the Glass Lake and Firefly Summer, but this one didn't do it for me. I don't want to spoil the book by giving out details, but as usual the main woman is trod upon in some way and just sits there and takes it."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I'm a Binchy fan, but felt that this book lacked some of the really great content of her other books. Although the descriptive writing which helps you to feel as though you are there in the town was there - the characters and story did not engross me and pull me in as her other characters have."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I don't expect a happy ending all the time, but I was rather depressed at the end of this. Clare was on her way to being someone great, and she lets David and his family crush her into the ground! I felt like she had succumbed to the &quot;sterotypical housewife&quot; scenario without so much as a word about her career. Still a great read, though."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have always enjoyed Binchy's books. My favorite being &quot;LIght a penny candle&quot;. But this book was so difficult to get into. The characters did not come to life for me as in her other novels. She took a long and sometimes boring path to develop the characters. I found this book to be a bit of a HO-HUMMER!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I read this book after reading Circle of Friends, and I was afraid I might be disappointed, but I was not. This book was just as engaging and entertaining as Circle of Friends. You become attached to these characters, they mean something to you. You feel as though you've known them forever. If you read this, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I found this book very captivating...I would start reading it and before long, hours had passed and I had not noticed! You get drawn into the life and goings-on of the characters in the book to where you fill as if you have been to their town and lived there forever. A great book if you have a busy life..written in a way that if you don't get a chance to read it a day or two, when you pick it up again you it's as if you never put it down!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"a great read, fleshing out the characters in her usual style. The development of the story was great and would have liked it to continue to see how the characters lived out their lives."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy has always come through. Great books. Have read all her books and passed them to friends who also enjoyed."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Engaging story told with the late Ms Binchy's excellent attention to characterisation. I read this novel when it was first edition, and enjoyed it just as much when I reread it last month. It has something for all ages."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I bought this book for someone else to read. I did not read it personally. The person that read it enjoyed it ."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This gal sure can spin a yarn! Reading this book is an instant ticket to a small seaside town in 1950's Ireland. The main characters tend to be cheerful and optimistic while handling life's ups and downs. Very inspiring to a pessimist like myself.Although The Glass Lake is my favorite Binchy novel so far, this ranks as one of the better ones. But even bad Binchy, like the disappointing Scarlet Feather, is better than most mass produced paperback romances -- or \\"Oprah\\" selections, for that matter! I did think the ending was quite abrupt, but other than that, it was enjoyable, and as always, sad to leave the characters behind :("},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"For those of you who read these mixed reviews, do not give up on &quot;Echos&quot;! A fan of Maeve Binchy's works, I enjoyed this book. The landscape, the language, the people are very tangible in all of her works. Maeve Binchy writes about people living in Ireland with such color that you feel as if you know each place intimately by the completion of a book.Sometimes life is not what you expect. But just as people have hopes and dreams, each person has a story to tell. At times this book gives a melancholy tone, much like the sea-side town it takes place in. The overall story is as real and beautiful as life can be."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Another wonderful story by Maeve, a powerful storyteller. I can picture Castlebay in my mind's eye as if I just returned from a summer vacation there. I felt that I was not finished when I turned the last page. Maeve left the future of Clare and David to the reader's imagination. This is my third book by Maeve, and I am reading Evening Class next!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"ECHOES was my first exposure to Maeve Binchy, and I was not disappointed. It is the timeworn tale of the girl from the wrong side of the tracks, who wins the love of the wealthy boy. But it doesn't necessarily end happily ever after, and for that it's a step above your run-of-the-mill romance novel.Binchy's enchanting depiction of Ireland in the \`50s and \`60s and her loving characterizations warmly send the reader into that time and place. It was a treat for me every evening to come home from working in the corporate frenzy of the new millennium to return to that simpler time. Nothing too terribly shocking or powerful, not a whole lot to contemplate when you reach the end, just a welcome respite for a few hundred pages.If, as many reviewers here have suggested, ECHOES is not Maeve Binchy's best work, then I find myself very fortunate to be able to work my way through her catalog."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the only Maeve Binchy book that I had not read. Once again, I was not disapointed. It took a while to get into, but once I did, I found it impossible to put down. The charecters and their problems are extremely well devleoped, and I loved Claire's spirit and determination. By the end of this book, all of the charecheters had learned something very valuable, and they all had the courage and grace to continue with their lives. This book reminded me of &quot;Light a Penny Candle&quot; in many small ways, and also a little of &quot;Circle of Friends&quot; in places. I highly recomend &quot;Echoes&quot;, but give it time to develop throughout the pages."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"In 'Echoes', Maeve Binchy has created a masterpiece, chronicling principally the lives of the two protagonists, Clare and David. They are two children growing up under the watchful eye of Castlebay, the sleepy Irish seaside resort where they live. The small-town mentality dictates who one can and cannot associate with: in other words, Clare from the huckster's shop and David the doctor's son can never be compatible. However, Dublin, and the lure of education, takes the two away from home and here, on neutral ground, they discover a mutual admiration and respect of the kind neither has ever known before. However, as their lives get drawn closer and closer together, they also realise that there is no escaping from Castlebay and their roots.Binchy's characters are extremely realistic, from the determined Clare to the passive David. What makes the book so eminently readable, however, is the league of supporting characters she creates, such as Angela, the supportive teacher struggling to keep a secret of her own from the prying eyes of the town, to Gerry Doyle, a man whose passions are too great to be contained within the confines of a small Irish town.The authress has a gossipy, chatty style that almost lulls you into believing that, far from reading a book, you are actually having an enthralling conversation with a close friend.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in life, love, or gossip."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the second novel that I have read by this author. I first read Circle of Friends and absolutely loved it. You can't help but get caught up in the characters and their stories. Maive Binchy is a wonderful story-teller. It's a catch-22 with her books...I can't put the book down, yet dread finishing it. Although the plot took some sad (and/or awkward) turns, Claire O'Brien is an unsung hero wise beyond her years."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy is a skilled storyteller with a strong career behind her (and hopefully before her). Her subject is always Irish life, but her earlier books are more of a retrospective on growing up in Ireland in the 1950s or 1960s. The Ireland of that time was a far more provincial, tradition-bound place than the cosmopolitan Celtic Tiger of today. People stayed where they were brought up, and were expected to take after their families, for better or worse. If you were the son of the town drunkard, his was your lot. If you were the son of the town doctor, you were at the top of the Irish food chain (as opposed to the Anglo-Irish aristocracy, who were another thing altogether), and medicine was your expected profession. If you were a daughter rather than a son, husband and children were your destiny, with your status determined by your mate's.Such is the world that Clare and David were born into in Castlebay. Clare's parents are shopkeepers in this summer resort town, relying on the tourists to keep them afloat. David's father is the doctor, and he goes to a boarding school rather than the parochial school in the village like Clare and the other children. Clare is very bright, and fortunately has a champion at the school in the form of Angela O'Hara, a lay teacher at the school. Miss O'Hara is herself the daughter of the town drunk who was able to get an education despite her community's expectations. Clare and David both go to University: \\"the\\" University in their world, University College, Dublin, and not unexpectedly from the reader's point of view, fall in love.Echoes is a less satisfactory story than Binchy'sCircle of Friends, which is set in the same period and has a similar theme. The ending is unresolved and the message is mixed. The village characters aren't as well rounded, and characters seem to make stupid decisions for (to me) poorly grounded reasons. I enjoy the retrospective Binchy stories as much as her contemporary ones, but this one isn't the pick of the bunch."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I've read almost all of Binchey's novels and this is one of her best. She is very skilled at creating numerous characters and somehow managing to intertwine their stories. This is evident here, with the main characters being Claire and David who are from the same town of Castlebay but from distinctly different upbringings. To put it simply, Claire was raised poor to a family that works round the clock in their little shop, and David comes from money with a doctor as a father. They discover love while in college, as Claire is very bright and won several scholarships to school and David is studying to be a doctor. When Claire discovers she is pregnant, their lives change forever. They believe love will overcome everything in their way, which is a great concept but idealistic. The reality is that being married with a newborn baby can be mundane and demanding.I especially like this book because I can relate to Claire--I did not marry until I was 29 (although Claire is much younger), but I had gone to school for a masters and owned my own home. I decided to be a stay at home mom because my mother always worked and I always felt this void when I was younger. While I love being home with my children, at times I have felt \\"there has to be more than this!\\" Being married and home with children can be hard for someone who has struggled to be independent, and Claire finds herself in this position as she gives everything up while David continues to do what he loves. The end of the book is tragic but believable and no one could have told this story better than Binchey."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Let's get this straight -- Echoes does not end with all of the plot strings tied up in a happy bow. In a way it echoes life itself. Plans go astray, promises are broken, moments of greatness are reached and the story keeps going.Binchy does an excellent job making the reader care about Claire, the spunky scholarship girl with dreams beyond her tiny seaside hometown. You cheer her on through her academic victories, laugh and cry with her at the cast of small town characters and urge her to fall in love with David, the Doctor's perfect son.Because Claire's character is so artfully presented, the last hundred or so pages are painful. What seemed like a perfect story of love unbounded by class becomes a lesson on unfullfilled dreams and changing priorities. You are sad for Claire, even mad at her for giving in to her situation. You rail against the people who hurt her and complain about an ending that leaves too much up in the air, but never once can you complain that the book is unbelievable.And for the ending. We don't know what happens to David and Claire. They both have a life ahead of them, with hopes that it will be together. I think, with a spark of optimism, that Claire sees that her life isn't over and maybe her dreams have just been delayed."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"After reading Tara Road, I was ready to read every Binchy book I could get my hands on. This novel started out very slowly, but by the time I got to the middle, I was glad I had trudged through to the &quot;good part.&quot; What I did not know, however, was that the middle was the ONLY &quot;good part.&quot; The last section of the novel was so disappointing. Clare changed so much, and in ways that were not true to her character. The Clare that Binchy had made me love would not have done the things that she ultimately did at the novel's end. If she had left out the first 200 pages and the last 100 pages, the novel would've been a good read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The end was not closure for me...I felt it should have went a little further. The story itself was slow and I put it down quite a few times before I finished it. Usually I read a book a day but this one took me a week because it was slow..."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have read 7 of Maeve Bichhy's novels and this one wasn't one of my favorites. With her other novels I was drawn right in with the characters, this one took me a while. My favorite is still Circle of Friends."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Pure Binchy, very readable and a good story. Not as good as some of her others, but, as usual, I wanted to keep reading 'til the end without stopping. Binchy is one of my favorite authors, so this story satisfied me. The two main characters are real and honestly portrayed, and the small Irish town where most of this story takes place sounds like a place I'd like to visit."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy is nothing more than a formula writer. She has shown that she can write a good friendship yarn; however, she doesn't seem to progress as a writer. Novel after novel, she churns out the same type of story-line. Perhaps it's time to turn her talents towards other topics. A very disappointing read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I COULDN' GET PASS ONE CHAPTER. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T TO MY TASTE RIGHT NOW...

It started off prominsingly enough, we were introduced to intersting characters, each pursuing their own dreams. However, about three quater through the book, it seemed that the story itself was unsure what it wanted itself to be. Was it going to be about dreams, pursing or giving up because of other priorities in life? Was it going to be a romance? Or was it going to become a thriller, with a slightly crazy man pursuing his love? The book tried to bring in a bit of everything and ultimately left all the areas underdeveloped."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have been unable to read this book, because the type is so small and dim.

Her inate ability to draw together the many characters and their individual stories, then weave them into a truly believable story is an art in itself and no-one does it better than Ms Binchy. The characters from this story are rounded and believable, from the town doctor, his haughty wife and medical student son, to Clare, the shopkeeper's daughter, who is determined to \\"study\\" herself into a better situation, to the hard-working schoolteacher, who guides Clare through her school years and beyond, This group and all the other characters, who move through the story, make for a very interesting read"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"Maeve Binchy never disappointed. I enjoyed the story of the characters who sought to achieve the dream of an education, the teacher who inspired and, of course, the clash of classes in the time it was written. (It probably still exists!) Ms. Binchy can make you laugh, cry, and care. You want them all to succeed. Not all do,but the reader will enjoy discovering which ones rise above class prejudice and the resentment and disappointment of those who do not."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I love Maeve Binchy as a storyteller. In fact, I am in the process of reading all her books. This one had a wonderful story, but was very slow in plot progression. I did enjoy it, but it probably won't be my favorite."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The book starts out in the 1950's in a small seaside town in Ireland and follows the lives of two young people and their families. David Power is the son of the town doctor, while Clare's family runs the general store. Clare dreams of something more in life and is aided by one of her teachers to strive for scholarship to help her try to escape her destiny and class. In contrast, David is expected to become a doctor and marry right. We see Clare's struggles as she finds herself between worlds, where she has left her past behind, but does not fit in with the more educated class. When love turns her head, jealousy, fate and bad choices turn her vision of success into something entirely different. While I appreciated the vignette of life in Ireland during this timeframe, my frustration with some of Clare's choices made the latter part of the book difficult for me. I wanted her to succeed, and while her life did not turn out the way she planned, we did see her grow up by the end of the novel."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I loved this book so much the first time I read it -- probably 10 years ago - that I bought it to read again electronically. Rest in Peace Maeve Binchy! We will miss your wonderful books."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"What an unfullfuling, unrewarding waste of time. The disappointment is more sharply felt because Binchy's set up is actually promising. The characters are engrossing, if one dimensional, and the vibrant town plays a leading role as well. The heroine and hero, Clare and David, are carefully portrayed and the reader cannot help but become emotionally attached to both of them. The reward for this attachment? An ending where the heroine becomes an object of pity and the hero proves himself to be an abject heel, an anti-hero in every way. Why is this the fate that Binchy creates for brave, brilliant, studious Clare O'Brien? Here's a girl longing from a young age not just to \\"be different\\" and get out of her small town (cliche by an standard), but to do it by scholarly excellence. The obstacles she faces are real and seemingly insurmountable. The sexism of the time and place, the narrow rigidity of the nuns who teach her, her parents' lack of support, her siblings' constant stream of problems and scorn. Why does Binchy want to write a book about a girl like this failing to fulfill her destiny as a major achiever because she has sex and \\"gets caught?\\" Binchy is simply promoting the age-old chauvinistic not to mention Catholic punishment of the good girl who falls to temptation. It doesn't seem to matter that Clare preserves her virginity much longer than her peers, that she takes a spiritual, values-driven approach to love, that she is waiting for something true and special, and that when love comes to her it does so with full force in the person of a seemingly mature, honest and loyal young man. What young woman wouldn't fall in love with sincere, hard-working, good David Power? What young woman wouldn't believe in the sincerity of his feelings and his promises? Nevertheless, Clare is punished by a string of belittling mistreatments, slights and betrayals. What motive can Binchy have than to punish her heroine for believing in true love other than the social and religious judgement of which she seems so critical? By punishing Clare, Binchy punishes her readers as well - it's not a fun ride, nor does it have the benefit of being a cautionary tale. Is all of Clare's spunk, drive and talent just flushed away with the arrival of her baby? What a boring old story. David, whom we watch grow up and come to care about chapter by chapter, is revealed to be a self-involved, uncaring, philandering pig. Ultimately he embodies the worst of his mother's bad qualities and little of his father's goodness, contrary to how it apepars to the town. If Binchy were a more sophisticated novelist and this were a much greater work of fiction, it might be interesting to see our hero and heroine unravel and prove to be not what they appear. However, Binchy just isn't that great a writer - this is not Anna Karenina or Madame Bovary. If you are looking for a good old-fashioned love story with a happy ending, this is NOT it. If you are looking for a good old-fashioned love story with a sad ending, this is NOT it. This is a bad love-story that builds up to a hoaky, B-movie plot twist and leaves you emotionally empty. Here's a question: why don't any of the bad guys get punished? The hypocritical snobs never get a comeuppance, and even more sadly, they never learn a single lesson. Where is Charles Dickens when you need him? Or any good writer for that matter? No one in this novel grows as a human being. No one expands their understanding of human nature or evolves as a result of their relationships with one another. Angela O'Hara, who is set up as Clare's older alter-ego and a voice of wisdom in the novel, also remains mired in her prejudices. What's the point? The story isn't entertaining enough to justify the characters' lack of growth. It is an exercise in static; it features a lot of potential that goes nowhere. There is no catharsis nor is there any emotional sweep. Binchy is a hugely popular best-selling writier. This reader's humble opinion will do little or nothing to shake her fan-base. For myself, however, this will be my first Binchy novel and my last."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"The book was typical Binchy, very satisfying with an assortment of characters. It kind of fell apart once the two main characters married because they \\"had to\\". It seemed forced and sad. Time to reread Tara Road and Scarlett Feather!"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is the first Maeve Binchy book I have read and I will read more. Having been to Ireland and the area she is writing about her description put me there so vividly in my mind. The story is a lovely story and well written."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This is one of Binchy's \\"bigger\\" books ~~ but it's very engrossing reading though and I have managed to read it in a week in the midst of all the household chores, kids, cooking and so on ~~ it's very good though a bit darker than her other books. Several of my online reading friends highly recommended this one and I was surprised that I haven't read it since I have made it a point to read all of Binchy's books (I have a couple left now to find and read). One of the online reading buddies strongly recommended this book as it was her favorite book.This book is about Claire O'Brien, one of the numerous O'Brien children ~~ her parents own a shop in Castlebay, Ireland. This is a small town that is also a small resort in the summertime ~~ that is when they get their best business ~~ from the tourists. Claire is one of the two daughters ~~ her sister, Chrissie, is more flamboyant and outgoing than Claire is. Claire was just bound and determined to move out of Castlebay and see the world. Angela O'Hara is her teacher with her own secrets. David Power, the doctor's son, is a distant friend of Claire ~~ even though he is older, his life has always been entwined with Claire's life ~~ they ended up in Dublin during his medical residency and her undergraduate studies. There is Gerry Doyle, the good-looking photographer's son, who took over the business when his father died of cancer. All of their stories are entwined as only lives in small towns are known to be.This is one of Binchy's older books and it is very well-written. She has a way of capturing your imagination and taking you down a path to a different life in the same small-townness of our lives. The characters are familiar to you and to me ~~ because they are based on realistic people. Their stories are comforting because they are familiar. This book is definitely a good read ~~ one I would recommend this summer to read wherever you are.6-2-05"},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"This book started out somewhat slow and I almost took a trip to boreville until about the 60th page or so when it picked up a little.

Binchy shows the trials and tribulations of a small town, of those trying to escape it, and those who must return to Castlebay. But foremost, the novel depicts the story about Clare O' Brien, and the way she is a central figure in most peoples' lives. And it depicts social class, and perhaps that there is a remote possibility that love can conquer all."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"I have read this book three times and I still can't get over it.

The characters are so well-developed, and the 'mood' of a small Irish tonw in the fifties very well presented.

A delightful and enthralling read."},{"Title":"Echoes","review":"An avid reader of Maeve Binchy's books, I was not disappointed with Echoes. I was hooked from the first pages and it just kept getting better. It's Binchy's ability to make you feel as though you know each character intimately that makes her books so enjoyable. Although I have never been to Ireland, after reading a Maeve Binchy novel, I feel as though I lived there my whole lfie. I was a little disappointed with the ending of this book, but it was still a phenomenal read."},{"Title":"Mucha: The Triumph of Art Nouveau","review":"I was first introduced to Alphonse Mucha in a rather unorthodox way: comic books. Years ago, when I was still an avid colllector of comics, I particularly enjoyed those illustrated by Joe Quesada. As I studied his drawings in such books as Ash and Ninjak, two elements of his style stood out. His female figures were very curvy and voluptuous, quite different from the angular nature that predominated his work. Also he had an intriguing way of indicating panel borders with byzantine stained-glass motifs and curvilinear meanderings of his pencil. I have since learned that both of these elements were directly influenced by Mucha.Although Mucha's most popular art does not vary much in content (most of his work consisted of vertically oriented affiches with a single female figure as the subject), he remains one of my most favorite artists. This book presents some of what I feel to be his best work. Don't look to Mucha for variation in theme or deep symbolic meaning. Instead, enjoy his work for it's strengths: beautiful women and intricate ornamentation."},{"Title":"Mucha: The Triumph of Art Nouveau","review":"Alphonse Maria Mucha,one of the great masters of art.It is sad to see that so many art academics dismiss his work as &quot;unimportant&quot;,but I guess a lot of failed artists have a problem with pure talent.This book is one of the best around that is still in print,highly recommended and definately worth the price,especially at Amazon..."},{"Title":"Mucha: The Triumph of Art Nouveau","review":"Mucha's style very much defined the Art Noveau movement. In fact, he sometimes claimed it as his own. A grand claim, perhaps, but this extract from his ouvre puts some weight behind it.It includes some of his jewelry, bronzes, and stage design, but those are minor parts of this collection. His well-know graphic works dominate by far - product wrappers, post cards, and theatrical posters. It says a fair bit for his popularity that, shortly after his posters were put up to announce some new production, they were torn down again by collectors.A whole chapter describes his work work Sarah Bernhardt, with whom he seemed to have a happy professional symbiosis. Sarah had the \\"problem\\" of a slender figure in an age when roundness defined a woman's beauty. Mucha's style was about long, flowing curves of drapery, vegetation, and figure - a natural match to Sarah. His publicity posters certainly advanced her career, but it seems that her inspiration advanced his, too.The text is informative, but tends towards a kind of history that I find dry. The pictorial presentation is effective, though. It includes many of his graphic works, and often the sketches that led up to them. The pictures also show his tendency to repeat an image with little or no variation - a plagiarism of self that must have been handy for meeting tight commercial deadlines. It gives an interesting insight into Mucha's work habits and how he would develop an image.There may be better books on Mucha out there, but this one is certainly worth having.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Mucha: The Triumph of Art Nouveau","review":"Nice book, comprehensive overview of his work.

I honestly think Ms. Ashwell should stick to books about her amazing decorating, and treasure hunting guides. I, like so many others was trying to get a glimpse into Pamela Anderson's house, as I hear she has a very shabby chic residence, and that would have been a nice touch for the book.We the fans read these books to glean ideas and to be creative with them, and I am not too sure if I would use some of these ideas in the \\"sumptuous settings\\" version. They are okay, but I think Ms. Ashwell's strengths lie in her Decorating and putting together of homes and restaraunts. The pictures of Madres, Jennifer Lopez' restaurant are lovely - what a great job was done there.Please hurry and do your next book Ms. Ashwell, but please, please keep the theme along the lines of the first three books!! We love them!"},{"Title":"Shabby Chic: Sumptuous Settings and Other Lovely Things","review":"I am glad Rachel has done a book about entertaining. As is her special talent, she showcases great new ideas for vintage items. However, I would love to see her do a book about entertaining in general and not for celebrities. I would give this book more stars if so many pages had not been devoted to Jennifer Lopez's restaurant - and I couldn't figure out why J-Lo had a tight budget. (I'm also wondering how the 'accidents' that happen in restaurants are going to keep those vintage china pieces in tact.) Next time I'm hoping for birthday parties for women, men, boys and girls. I would love to see Christmas, Easter, Valentines Day, Thanksgiving, or just theme parties for no reason.

I wasn't expecting another book like the first ones and had I, I think I would have been disappointed. What I was expecting, however, was just another beautiful book filled with wonderful images to give my brain a creative spark. And it did just that.It's not really a how to, it doesn't lay things out easily, and it's not really for home ideas and living. But it is beautiful, thoughtful, unique and true to Shabby Chic. So if you're in the need of some more inspiration and love her books, this would be a great match.

Rachel spends too much time on areas that I feel have no practical use for the average reader - such as Jennifer Lopez's restaurant. How many readers just happen to have a brand new restaurant that they need decorated in the Shabby Chic style? Each chapter is solely made up of just one function, instead of showing several different examples. She showed us how to decorate for one birthday party - a little boy's birthday. How about showing us some ideas for little girls, teens and adults? She completely skipped over any type of holiday gathering too. I thought she would have included several ideas for decorating the table for Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas but there was nothing mentioned about it. As a devoted Ashwell fan, I must say that I was really disappointed with this book."},{"Title":"Shabby Chic: Sumptuous Settings and Other Lovely Things","review":"Hello like alot of people we love Shabby and we love Rachel's style.

The ideas are great and simple, the style is typically Shabby Chic, as its creator wrote this book, but in a little bolder and more flashy colors than in her other books, as many projects are outside and need to be seen under a very harsh sunlight.It is Rachel Ashwell's fifth book, so, we could imagine it is the same as her four preceding others, but no, she manages to surprise us in it : by remaining true to her palette, we can guess an evolution in her tastes and choices, which are always so chic, so elegant, so British, quite elegant enough for any French Castle, and I know what I am speaking of, as I am French and have been raised in a very chic Parisian family.As you understood, I am a big fan of Rachel Ashwell's design, I only regret she's not more well-known in Paris.So, if you like or are curious of Shabby Chic, this book is more that a must, the kind of book you will keep your whole life.By the way, the pictures are gorgeous, a usually, and the explanations honest and easy to understand, as usually too.I recommend strongly.Yael from Los Angeles"},{"Title":"Shabby Chic: Sumptuous Settings and Other Lovely Things","review":"The ideas and photos are just superb!

I know quite a bunch of people who decided to become physicists after reading it. Two interesting aspects should be mentioned. First, it was really written by Infeld, though thoroughly discussed, in a daily basis, with Einstein.(Infeld was a refugee under Einstein's protection, and thought he had to justify his temporary shelter at Princeton by writing something, which would also provide some income!). Another book by Infeld, &quot;Quest&quot;, an autobiography, is the source of this and of many other interesting things about that period. Second, this book introduces very clearly a revolutionary contribution of Einstein's which is rarely recognized: a new method in physics which consists in obtaining knowledge from the comparison of observations of the same physical system obtained by two different observers. Though this had been done before (by Mach, for instance), it was Einstein who transformed it into a new tool for science. Physics was transformed by that, and quantum mechanics could then go even further, in the role given to the observer. This story is wonderfully told in this book."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"While it would seem likely that one should go to another source to explain what Einstein's work really means and how it came about, this extraordinary book, coauthored by Einstein and Leopold Infeld, is perhaps the most cogent and interesting account of the origin and implications of relativity theory ever written. It offers the general reader - even those of us not steeped in Physics and physical theory - a fascinating glimpse of one of the most significant intellectual leaps of the last century. Much more comprehensive and engaging than such relativity 'primers' as Russell's ABC's of Relativity, it is both a very stimulating and readable account.Since Time Magazine recently selected Einstein as the Person of the Century, it seems timely to recommend this book as a fascinating introduction to the mind and work of someone who is normally thought to be beyond ordinary human comprehension. That he is an exceptional intellect is beyond question. What is remarkable is that he is able to communicate clearly to those of us less blessed with brillance. This is a wonderful book for any who have an active interest in how the universe works and how revolutionary new insights about the universe can be achieved with thought alone. An amazing book."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"Physics can be difficult to learn when theories and formulae are thrown at you with no historical context. You begin learning about motion, and then electricity and magnetism, and it's almost impossible to see a coherent connection between the ideas. Many people have heard of relativity and quantum theory, but do not have even a general notion of what they aim to explain.Like mathematics, you can learn physics without knowing about the people behind its development (though you will encounter many of their names in important expressions), but it never hurts to study how such ideas began, and how they came to be what they are today. Einstein and Infeld's book is aptly titled. They show how and why certain concepts came into being and what significance they hold. Beginning with \\"The Rise of the Mechanical View,\\" they describe vectors, motion, forces, and energy. With \\"The Decline of the Mechanical View,\\" they show how the behavior of electricity, magnetism, and light waves poses problems for the mechanical view.The next two (and most interesting) sections explore field, relativity, and quanta, and how they have proved more accurate in describing physical phenomena than what was previously known. Einstein and Infeld describe everything with a minimum of mathematics so that anyone with an interest in the development of physics can understand the contents. Although such math is necessary for a precise understanding of physics, the aim of the authors, which they frequently repeat throughout, is to give the reader a broad understanding of the general underlying principles. They have succeeded in giving an account of where the human construction of physics started, what has been covered since then, and where it is heading. It is a simply written book, suitable for readers who don't know physics and want to learn, but also helpful for students of physics who want to see a broader picture of its evolution."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"As the authors state, \\".. thought and ideas, not formulas, are the beginning of every physical theory\\". True to this statement, this book focuses on thoughts and ideas and does not use any formulas at all. This makes it good as an adjunct for standard texts that contain the formulas, but not as a substitute for such books. This book is divided into four sections: the rise of the mechanical view, the decline of the mechanical view, field and relativity, and quanta. It is thus about how the mechanical view of Newton evolved into the modern view of physics (relativity theory and quantum mechanics).I would like to focus on how this book might be perceived for three different classes of readers.(1) For those who have never taken a physics course (or did and tried to forget the experience as soon as possible) -- The lack of any mathematics may be comforting to this class of reader, but it will nonetheless not be an easy read for them. The basic concepts, such as inertia, may be difficult to grasp for those with no previous physics background, but the author's do a good job of describing things. (A task made more difficult without recourse to the shorthand of mathematics.) I would, however, recommend this book only to those who are motivated to go well beyond their comfort zone. However, if they focus on the concepts that are being described and are patient in following the lines of reasoning, they should be richly rewarded.(2) For those who have taken physics courses, but do not have advanced degrees in physics -- I put myself in this group and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I liked this book because it focuses on the why (the basic underlying theories of physics), rather than on the how (problem solving). In doing so, it provided a much better understanding of what is behind the equations than I found in physics texts. I got a very clear picture of the deficiencies of Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's equations, and how this led to relativity theory. I found this very illuminating as it more clearly showed me Einstein's thought process. If found this even clearer than that presented in Einstein's book on relativity (prepared for a general readership). Of all the groups of readers, I think that people in this group will get the most from this book.(3) For those with advanced degrees in physics - People in this group may have already been exposed to the concepts described here, but this book will still be very helpful in that it shows clearly Einstein's logic in developing relativity theory and the quantum theory of light. Much of this may be old hat to this group, but the book will still be of interest from a historical perspective.I think that this book does an admirable job of appealing to and satisfying the needs of readers who approach the subject with diverse backgrounds."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"This book provides a still useful account, from 'the horses' mouths', of what Alfred Korzybski called the Newtonian and non-Newtonian views in physics. As Korzybski noted, all human beings form a view of so-called 'reality'. Understanding how scientists do this can have value for the rest of us. In this excellent book, the authors emphasize general formulations and a non-mathematical approach: \\"Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone\\" (29). The book includes chapters on \\"The Rise of the Mechanical View,\\" \\"The Decline of the Mechanical View,\\" \\"Field, Relativity,\\" and \\"Quanta.\\" Readers will be rewarded with clear explanations of some potentially forbidding notions. These are interspersed with useful comments on physico-mathematical method, theory and the goals of science. Einstein's and Infeld's discussion demonstrates their view that \\"Science is not just a collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is a creation of the human mind, with its freely invented ideas and concepts. Physical theories try to form a picture of reality and to establish its connection with the wide world of sense impressions. Thus the only justification for our mental structures is whether and in what way our theories form such a link\\" (310)."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"This is the best short book that I know of on the history of physics--equally useful for the casual observer of science and the serious physics student. Einstein is capable of presenting the basic ideas of physics in a way that is succinct yet complete--and he never loses sight of the broad, revolutionary ideas that make the history of physics so exciting. This is undoubtedly because physics actually IS exciting for Einstein, and this excitement comes through in every page.This book reads as if Einstein thinks of physics as a really good story--complete with all characters and action of any good story--that he really wants to share with his reader."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"Written by Albet Einstein you would expect this book to be too complecated and boring, think agian. He makes a point of simplifying concepts. If you aren't familiar with Einstein's work, it is really interesting. One thing he gets into that I find interesting is the question of what light is. Is it a substance, a wave, both? Another thing, is that the speed of light is a &quot;universal speed limit&quot;. As matter moves it shrinks and at the speed of light it disappears.

It is deceptively accessible because it is profound physical principles simply explained as Einstein and Infield saw it at the time, it is physics and not mathematics. The math used is basic and the book explains all of it very carefully. It is not a comprehensive book on physics.After reading this short book (perhaps many times over)the reader will gain a wonderful understanding of both classical and modern physics as Einstein saw itIt is deceptive because the physical principles are simple and also a profound part of Einstein's thinking about classical physics, modern physics, relativity and quantum physics, and Einstein's though processes in developing relativity and quantum physics from some seminal basic concepts in classical physics. It also explains what physics is all about, its philosophy, the scientific method, and the history of physics.It is fascinating to read of the evolution of Einstein's thinking in physics to his discovery of special and general relativity and quantum physics, told in his own words with the help of Infeld. This book is one of the all time classics of science.Excellent for both children and adults with an interest in science, physics, and Einstein. may be used as a suvey text, although it was not written to be a textbook. a scientific classic. extremely easy to understand explanation of Einstein's thinking on classical and modern physics. the math is explained, where it is used.It also includes Einstein's views of quantum physics and statistics, and it does not suggest that there was any conflict between Bohr and Einstein on this issue, although there were famous debates between them. This book suggests that Einstein had by the time the book was written accepted the statistical nature of quantum physics.I would also recommend Einstein's \\"Relativity and the General Theory\\" and also the classic paperback of reprints of the original works of Einstein and others on relativity (more advanced but of great value to see the original papers).In the Evolution of Physics are extremely clear explanations of what is science, physics the history of thought in physics, the evolution of classical thought in physics and how it led to relativity, and quantum physics. What we mean by modern and classical physics, relativity, the statistical nature of quantum physics as distinct to the use of statistics in everyday usage and in classical physics, the difference between between math and physics, theory and evidence, the contradiction between theory and evidence as the ultimate source of new theories which better explains the evidence, the philosophy of science.All of these topics are discussed clearly, simply and profoundly for both scientists and non scientists. The book is deceptively simple and actually requires probably at least more than one full reading to really understand it. After you have read it completely, a rereading will provide greater insights into the meaning of the earlier chapters. Many of us will find ourselves reading it many times for its beauty and clarity.This book is in summary a brilliant scientific classic, a survey of physics, wonderfully accessible to the general public, stemming from the collaboration of Einstein and his assistant Infield. Highly recommended. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"This is a wonderful book ultimately leading to a discussion of relativity. Even so, the style of exposition is unusually good. I suspect Professor Infield wrote the book, albeit in collaboration with Professor Einstein.

I bought this copy so I could re-read it. It was well worthwhilte.The authors have totally eliminated math from their presentation. As a result, the stickler may feel slighted, because there are no proofs in the scientific sense. However, they take you through 'thought experiments' which occur only in your head. If you take the time and make the effort, they will build in your mind a picture of how various broad ideas happen; ideas such as the complex interactions between electric and magnetic fields, and they even give you an appreciation for the four equations known as 'Maxwell's Equations', and do so without ever showing you the equations. They take on the duality of light (how it sometimes behaves as a wave and sometimes as corpuscles), and hint at a similar duality in the quantum world of sub-atomic particles.From those discussions, they go directly into special relativity.Who could ask for anything more.If you like trying to understand physical ideas, you should really like this book."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"An excellent book about physics, its history and its philosophy.

It is not the best laymans guide to physics, and that is not the fault of Einstein.reading Einstein's own writing, he was great at knowing the audience and talking to that audience in a clever way. When talking to the layperson he had a very engaging and almost playful personality. And he could boil down the most complex concept into a clever metaphor or puzzle which anyone would understand and find entertaining. ( his academic stuff is clearly not written this way, but different audience ).All of that is lost in this book, and that is Infeld's fault. Had he been a layperson conversing with Einstein and scribbing, the text would probably be more reflective of Einstein. But Infeld does a great job of muting Einsteins personality in this book. You can see it in the presentation of relativity, compare this book to Einstein's own book, and you can tell infeld really did a poor job."},{"Title":"The Evolution of Physics: The Growth of Ideas from Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta","review":"He's the best mind to lead you around the block again and again.

A notable exception is &quot;Naming Grace&quot; by Mary Catherine Hilkert. While there are certainly other high quality books on the market that deal with preaching in a general sense, &quot;Naming Grace&quot; is one of the rare gems that deal more specifically with the art of preparing and delivering a homily in a Catholic liturgical setting. With a combination of wit and serious scholarship, Dr. Hilkert urges anyone who is brave enough to enter into the risky world of homiletics to utilize skills inclusive of both sacramental and prophetic imaginations. In addition, she gives practical advice that is instructive toward avoiding what amounts to 'replacement theology' (an occasional hazard of trying to harmonize the Old and New Testaments). I found Dr. Hilkert's text to be highly stimulating. I therefore highly endorse &quot;Naming Grace.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naming Grace: Preaching and the Sacramental Imagination","review":"I say read with caution due to the nature of this book. In the act of naming grace, Hilkert makes one major mistake; she neglects to actually name grace. Trapped within her Thomistic and Kantian structures, Hilkert fails to grasp that grace has a name rather than existence as a disembodied, ethereal noun. Grace is the Word made flesh-Jesus Christ. Thus, from the outset, her system and thoughts on preaching are flawed due to a limited understanding of what he Word is that is proclaimed as well as its relationship to the sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist. While there are glimmers of beneficial material, overall one should take this book with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"The Charles Fillmore Concordance","review":"Charles Fillmore is one of the great metaphysical thinkers and writers of our time, writer of some dozen classic works.

But, then she mentioned him in the second chapter. Hmmm...Still withholding blanket approval, I plugged along through this book, which came to me accidentally at a yard sale. Food history, celery, chocolate, lemon meringue pie, rye - yeah, yeah - interesting, but nothing outstanding. Then, a wonderful description of a dessert I'd never heard of - Mangoes and Sticky Rice - simple, truly authentic, something I want to make as soon as possible - oddly she suggests substituting strawberries for mangoes - which I think would ruin this dish (which I have not yet tried! - terribly opinionated, I know.) Having lived in the tropics most of my life, I know that the only possible substitute for mangoes might be fresh in-season, tree-ripened peaches - perhaps home-frozen. I was more interested now, but still not a fan.But, my skeptical nature was finally won with the chapter on toast. Simple toast - my favorite food, though I've been an experimental cook for 40 years. Moving on to Hot Pepper Masochism and using ultra-clear imagery to compare eating jalape&ntilde;o peppers to jumping off a bridge with a bungee cord, and then telling me that a common kitchen ingredient contains the chemical compounds zingerone, cineol, borneol, geraniol, linalool and farmasene - and the last one, gingeral, which gives away the spice. I loved those chemical names - (and the rest of the chapter on ginger's historic and etymological contributions). I also learned how to tell when a medlar blets and then raced through a further wide range of topics from breatharians to butterfat and satiety vs. nimiety. It was a real page-turner - (for certain types - maybe the type that reads Simple Cooking?) But, this book has both food nerd and general appeal - I finished it up on an airplane with my husband avidly reading over my shoulder. Together we read about \\"Round Food with a Hole in the Middle\\", Cotton Candy, Eating Contests, Ketchup, and Forbidden Fruit.John Thorne commented in an email that if a man had conceived this title, it would be called \\"Eat My Words\\"- more etymology with social overtones - (ah, men with their testosterone and machismo) - But, before even finishing this book, I found myself in a bookstore seeking more by Eve Johnson - oddly, she was not there - instead was yet another book called Eating My Words - this one by the prolific food critic, Mimi Sheraton and subtitled \\"An Appetite for Life\\". I bought it and proceeded to spend over $300 more on books in this genre - to add to my already five-foot long bookshelf of food commentary begun 30 years ago with Raymond Sokolov's Fading Feast. I first found Outlaw Cook in a used book bin about 25 years ago - now, at least one of the new books I've just bought says that this genre is the \\"fastest growing\\" in literature. Great news as long as the quality control is stringent. I won't read just anything!Now, since there are two books called Eating My Words, I wonder if John will do us the favor of writing Eat My Words - though it does sound a bit aggressive, I think! Eve Johnson's book deserves to be reviewed in Simple Cooking. Fair is fair and she did mention him in her second chapter. She paints a real picture with words and while looking for a word to describe that, a crossword puzzle gave me LIMN - \\"a description that illuminates\\"- exactly the right word. Enjoy this book.

His argument has been presented before, with greater vigor by Foucault and Co., but the sophistry is the same: psychoanalysis is a medium of social control, conferring an internalized control structure in place of an external, analysis is not exact, medical science (what happened to cultural science?), so it's necessarily a screen for social interests, and, anyway, science isn't that hot to begin with. Foucault finally pops up on the last page to confer his blessing on the whole knowledge/power argument. Readers would do well to consult some older, better books like Russell Jacoby's Social Amnesia, Juliet Mitchell's Psychoanalysis and Feminism (strong defenses of the socially revolutionary implications of analysis) and Susan Vaughn's The Talking Cure (a neuro-linguistic vindication of same)."},{"Title":"D.B.

Its focus is a question basic to liturgical reflection, what it means to present scripture as the word of God. Power asks that we consider the complex relationship of texts to one another in their liturgical use, not only in the tradition but in the complexity of contemporary experience. The work engages interpretive issues usually dealt with through theoretical reflection. This accessible work is less abstract. It distills the author's specialized knowledge, taking as its starting point specific texts and concrete situations.The work is clearly organized into two sections with helpful introductions and summaries. The first dwells on the way in which texts are heard in liturgical services and the second analyzes scriptures, prayers and root metaphors. These reflections are rooted in the Roman Catholic tradition but reflect considerable knowledge of the Protestant faith, so that Lutherans and Episcopalians should find much to consider here. Power argues convincingly that the meaning of the scriptures is not fixed for all time. He insists that contemporary readers need to study the way in which texts have been used in the past and suggests criteria for validating interpretations. Yet he also provides rich examples of the questions hearers bring to the text today, born of diverse influences such as awareness of the brokenness of our world, the impact of gender, race, geography and economics. Mindful of the importance of the reader's experience he nonetheless argues for an understanding that the Word must yet still surprise and challenge the hearer.While clearly written and organized, The Word of the Lord is a demanding book that asks the reader to interact with the author and reflect on texts, their interaction with one another, their social settings past and present, here and in remote environments. Just as Bible groups have studied texts in the past, study groups might find it helpful to discuss some of texts Power proposes in their liturgical inter relatedness, their history and contemporary meaning."},{"Title":"The Word of the Lord: Liturgy's Use of Scripture","review":"The book's strength is in dealing with the history of the scriptures in the liturgy, and in the extra-liturgical uses of scripture. It's also good when dealing with comparative uses of the scriptures in churches around the world (the picture of the Mass in pps. 78 and 79 is a beautiful snapshot of the church is a particular community, far removed from that of most of us).The weakness I see lies in several areas. First, the writer seems to try too hard to present a \\"relevant\\" take on contemporary problems such as AIDS, which -- only 5 years after it was published! -- has a dated feel. Secondly, the writer tries to survey non-Roman (specifically Lutheran and Anglican, and to a lesser degree, Reformed) liturgical use of the scriptures, and these attempts don't seem to have a lot of depth.All in all, the book is weak at the beginning, but improves toward the end.I also must warn that the author uses a turn of phrase that I cannot find warranted by history or theology. On p. 105, the author refers to Christ as a \\"Theotokos.\\" Traditionally, this term, meaning \\"bearer of God,\\" is used in reference to the Virgin Mary. I have NEVER heard of this term referring to Christ, who does not \\"bear\\" God (a phrase that sounds adoptionist, at least at first hearing) but IS God. I'm not sure what the author is meaning by the term, or if it was simply a mistake, but I would encourage readers to be wary of the author's theology."},{"Title":"When I Am Weak: From the Womb of the Morning Comes a Word from God","review":"It is comforting to know that God has a special plan for all of us.

One could go on and on - writing hundreds of pages in essay form - about the indignities and injustices of prison life, but this goes toward saying it much better than any ivory tower intellectual argument ever could. Wilde, winner of the infamous Newdigate Prize For Poetry at Oxford University, had long been an immaculate poet - an a born writer - but he practically anandoned the form after his marriage and the start of his career as a playwright in the early 1890's (aside from that strange amalgram of a poem, The Sphinx.) And yet, this is almost exclusively the only thing Wilde wrote after his release before his untimely death in 1900. Thankfully, the great artist went out with a bang. The Ballad fuses some of the best and clearest writing I have ever read in the English language with a poetic sensibility and a true and tragic sense of real suffering, thereby creating one of the great poems of all-time.Many anthologies of Wilde's writings are available, and perhaps buying a book that simply includes this lone poem is questionable. I definitely suggest that you go for a Complete Works if you are new to the author; however, if you'd like a travel-worthy copy of certain smaller works - such as this poem - then editions such as this will serve you well. Besides, this edition has as well those beautiful paintings to go along with it - something I'm sure Oscar himself would've loved."},{"Title":"The ballad of Reading Gaol,","review":"As a student of Wilde's life and works, I find this is essential reading. Who needs Shakespeare to outline tradgey? Wilde was imprisoned after a second trial (the first was a no decision).

Bellow is so good at describing everyday people and things while subtly showing the bigger picture simultaneously..."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"&quot;A Theft&quot; is kind of a throwaway in Bellow's mighty cannon. Just over one hundred pages long, the book drops you into the High Society world of Clara, who has married four times and is still fond of her first love, who gave her an emerald ring. She gets her strength from this ring, which she loses once, but then recovers, only to have it stolen. Unfortunately, it takes 60 pages to get to the theft, and that first section is little more than monotonous pining over how bad life is for Clara, whom you never feel much for, anyway. But the theft introduces you further to the nanny, Gina, who is a brilliant character. Whenever Bellow concentrates on her deep and interesting problems, the book picks up pace. The final confrontation between Gina and Clara, (Clara believes that Gina's boyfriend, Frederic stole the ring) is so good it makes you wonder just what Bellow could have done if he'd applied this kind of passion to the rest of the book. Not bad, but really for Bellow-collectors only"},{"Title":"Theft","review":"Born near Montreal in 1915, Bellow is thought of as a Chicago writer who wrote about life in urban America. His novels feature smooth flowing prose and he won a Nobel Prize in 1976. He hit his peak as a writer between \\"Augie March\\" in 1953 and the Pulitzer novel \\"Humbolt's Gift\\" in 1973. He wrote from the early 1940s through to 2000. I read 12 of his 13 novels, plus short stories plus this 109 page novella.When he taught in 1938, he used a reading list which included: Lawrence, Dostoevsky, Dreiser, Joyce, and Flaubert. They were pioneers in realism. Realism became a feature of his novels, and that includes the way in which he treats subjects such as sex, life, death, and the search for self.All of that is missing here and if anyone thinks this weak 109 page novella from 1989 is a good introduction to the master and Nobel Prize winner they are dead wrong. This is a slow starting novel. Overall it is a weak effort with not much of a finish after 109 pages. At best one is left scratching their head: what is it about? What was the point here? Did I miss something? I went back and read the last 10 pages twice. No you missed nothing. There is not much there.As a point of reference compare it to The Actual, a similar novella by Bellow. The Actual, which itself is a weaker effort by Bellow, is at least twice as good as A Theft, i.e: it has a good story, interesting characters, some human emotion, etc.No, this is not Bellow's best nor is it a good introduction to Bellow. It is weak, very, very weak. This book is not to be confused with the best of Saul Bellow or even his average works that he did decades earlier. For example, read Bellow's Herzog written 30 years before and be blown away by excellent writing, the time shifting, the overlays of plots, the multi-layered plot, the stunning prose, and innovation in literature, etc. There is no comparison.The readers have given an average review rating here of only three stars, somewhat shocking for Bellow, and that pretty well is on the mark compared to his body of work. Neutral to negative recommendation: 3 stars.For those new to Bellow try these: Humboldt's Gift (Penguin Classics) 1975 Pulitzer Prize, or Herzog (complicated), 1964 National Book Prize, or Ravelstein,for something written when he was older, or the novella The Actual, or his Collected Stories."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"I came across this old book on the shelves of my local public library \\"Books for Sale\\" area. From the moment I saw it, it was a novella that I wanted to read, since I have not read Saul Bellow's books for a while. What a pleasant suprise this book has been. Main character is middle aged Clara in her forties, executive in the NYC fashion magazine, woman in her fourth marriage that produced three daughters. It seems that Clara's successful professional life is in complete contrast with her personal life. All of her past husbands were either boring or self indulgent and the man she wanted most in her life is out of reach. Her only connection to him is the emerald ring he gave her 20 years ago in her forced attempt to get engaged to him; their enduring long distance friendship (he lives in Washington, DC while she is in NYC) and her sessions shared between a female friend confidante and a psychotherapist. As we observe Clara, we realize that she is detached from her reality -- we barely learn about her work; we know nothing about her relationship with her daughters since they are conveniently taken care of by the nannies and other house help. Clara's musings on her life dwell on her past and herself and she projects all of her intense feelings on the object of her desire -- the emerald ring. In the course of the novella this object gets lost twice. Each time, the object is found. In every one of these instances, Clara learns a little bit about herself that neither her long time friends, nor her psychiatrist manage to discover in the years that she has been sharing her intimate feelings with them. This is a multi-layered novella and the beauty of it is that in she short 100 pages, Bellow has managed to put so much in. The book will keep you thinking for a long, long time. Great read about one's relfection, alientation and meaning of life."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"The negative reviews here are a surprise, given that \\"A Theft\\", one of Mr. Bellow's later short books, is a very fine portrait of contemporary NYC, viewed from an a much married Lady Fashion Mag Exec mother of 3 daughters, who has recently hired an Austrian Au Pair. The young Viennese becomes almost a fourth daughter until the title \\"Theft\\" leaves many questions for many of the characters to answer. Simply put, a beautifully done, realistic tale without some of the author's often overdone intellectualizing and denseness. So if you're new to Saul Bellow, this may be as good a place as any to start."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"This 1989 work is a good introduction to the style of writing that Saul Bellow became famous for. It is a light-hearted story of intrigue mixed with heart-warming characters who are so vividly portrayed. For the uninitiated this is a good beginning for those who would dare to read more by Bellow. If you like this you will love Herzog and Humbolt's Gift. If not, it is my guess that neither of these works would be a satisfying read and even difficult to finish."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"This is the second novel I've read by Saul Bellow, a Nobel Prize-winning author. The first, Seize the Day, is very good, about a destructive American obsession with success. A Theft is a little trickier. It's about a woman, Clara Velde, with a successful career life, though a failed love life. What makes this novel so troublesome is that it's not very clear what the reader is supposed to make of Clara. Is she supposed to be a highly flawed heroine, or a fount of love and wisdom? Bellow exercises his powers of subtlety a little too well in this novella, to the point that reading it becomes a chore.I admit it has the elements in place to be a fascinating read, but the execution is off. Bellow is, perhaps, a little too subtle. To the point it's not very clear what he's trying to get at. The narrator has a limited third-person perspective and seems more or less partial to Clara. We learn much from Clara's dialogues with Laura Wong, Teddy, and her psychiatrist, though she does most of the talking. It's hard to say what these people think of Clara. The psychiatrist is paid to listen to her, and even Laura has a professional connection with her. Teddy seems to genuinely like her, though not enough to marry her. What we do know is what she thinks of herself, which is that she's of a superior caste of people. The problem is, the novel seems to endorse this view of her. I can't tell what Bellow's aims were; it seems he's playing things with a little too much subtlety. He provides too much contradictory evidence for the reader to develop a thoughtful opinion of her.This is not very enjoyable. At 110 pages it felt at least twice its length. I reread passages again and again to try and figure them out, only to move on in frustration. I have my mind made up about Clara, but I don't know if the conclusion I've drawn is the one Bellow intends. If you were thinking about getting into Saul Bellow's works, I wouldn't start here."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"This book tells a fine story, but HOW it tells it is unsatisfying.Some of the principal characters are unconvincing. Clara, the protagonist, was supposed to have a bit of country rube in her, but I never saw it come through. Ithiel, Clara's great love, was supposed to be the greatest political analyst of the century, which I also never saw come through.What's more, the rest of the principal characters have no real presence. As the story unfolds, Clara's admirable au pair, Gina, gets caught up with an unsavory Harlemite, Frederic. Fred never speaks a line, and Clara speaks few lines of consequence until the last few pages. And thus the problem: the story, as told, gives us little reason to admire Gina and no reason to suspect Frederic of the titular Theft, except that Fred is poor and Haitian. (On the night of the theft, a number of crackheads whom Clara could never track down are also in the house, but, conveniently, the one person with a link to Clara and the one person Clara actually suspects turns out to have stolen the ring.)All this weak characterization cripples the second half of the book, which consists mainly of Clara fretting over Gina's fate. Gina, you see, has taken up with Frederic in Harlem. It's never clear what makes it so special that a newcomer to NYC ends up in a run-down apartment in a poor neighborhood. The easy answer is that Gina is special *to Clara*, who is exceptionally devoted to her friends, but Clara's friendship with Gina is sketched so lightly that, beyond it being hard to believe in, there is nothing to believe. By the end, the happy outcome of Gina's slum romp seems to be that she has become a proper brusque New Yorker.-The interesting thing about this book is that all the apparent weakness makes sense stylistically. Clara talks at people constantly; she is hugely disconnected from her child, husband, love, and friend. Much of the content of the book is Clara talking at her friend and at her psychologist, neither of whom say anything of substance in return. Clara tells herself how much she values her child Lucy, but Lucy never enters the action directly and never says anything. The book is written from Clara's perspective, and Clara's perspective is largely disconnected from those nominally \\"close\\" to her.In this sense, the unsatisfying style of the book is fitting. When Gina derides Frederic as \\"lewd\\", an insult for which the reader has witnessed no evidence, it is not so much weak storytelling (explaining instead of showing) as the habit of a powerful, aged woman to object to what the young people are doing these days. Most of the apparently baseless feelings of Clara can be put down to the intuition of a character (like any other) with a subjective worldview.I should also add that the book has a few points of brilliance. It treats identity and communication very insightfully. It delivers a useful criticism of psychotherapy, at least as the practice existed back then. Bellow's words flow beautifully, and he keeps us just as aware as we should be of time slipping back and forth in Clara's mind. Ultimately the book reminded me ofThe Club of Queer Tradesby GK Chesterton, because both books are superficially unsatisfying as a result of their deep stylistic commitments. Unfortunately, with 'A Theft', the weak parts of the book become plausible in light of Clara's perspective, but they don't become compelling. In this book, many moments of drama caught me off guard, because I didn't realize I had been given anything to care about. I would recommend the book to other readers only if they want to read the story of a woman who can't tell the story of herself because she's stopped noticing it. If it makes sense to speak of a well told untold story, this is one."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"I enjoyed this novella and found it to be the easiest to read of Bellow's works. I loved the moral dilemma the protagonist faces at the end of the book when the stolen ring is less than \\"stolen\\". Some of the other people who wrote reviews said it was slow going, but in some way it's just a slow buildup of the elements and tension in a whodunit where you really have to get a good idea of what the people in the story are like before you can fully appreciate what the event really means in the characters' lives.It reads very quickly and leaves you amused at the antics of these sophisticated (but maybe not so very sophisticated) Gothamites."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"Having read some of the other reviews, I have gathered that this was not the best book to introduce the reader to Saul Bellow. Unfortunately, this is my first attempt at reading Bellow. At the very beginning, I was very impressed with his vivid description of people and their situations. However, some 20-30 pages into the book I began to wonder when the descriptions would end and some kind of story would begin. Perhaps I am just not used to Bellow's style of narrative, but I found this one very hard to get through, despite its very short length. Somewhere down the line I may attempt to read more by Bellow, but at this point it's not real high on my list of priorities."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"It's hard to imagine Saul Bellow writing a book that has so little content, thought or activity. This novella is kind of like Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland: \\"There's no there there.\\"The protagonist of the novella (Clara) is a highly successful career woman in NYC. She moved to New York after a top-notch education, but she retained the sensibility of a hick town in Indiana. That grounded Indiana sensitivity allegedly helped Clara to carve out great success in publishing while going through four husbands and an untold number of affairs. The one true love of her life is a high-powered Washington, DC, political operative and consultant, but she's trapped in a loveless marriage with a ne'er do well husband. She has three young daughters on whom she dotes...when her many professional obligations leave her time.The action in the book centers around Clara's loss, twice of a valuable emerald ring that the love of her life gave her as an engagement ring, though they never married. Her world is thrown off-kilter when the ring is lost, especially the second time, when she blames her au pair and the au pair's Haitian boyfriend. Clara is already in contact with her former lover, but the ring brings those thoughts to the surface, and she has to confront the reality they they will never be together, except as deepest friends.The problem is that Clara isn't sympathetic in any way. She's smart, talented, and rich, but all of that seems like a facade. Only the lover Teddy seems to really appreciate it. None of the four husbands seemed to notice.On the other hand, Clara isn't a comic character, either. It's clear that Bellow wants her to be taken seriously, not laughed at. Yet, her situation is so cliched that it feels as if it should be laughed at.Anyway, Clara's epiphany comes through a late conversation with the au pair whom was accused of accidentally facilating the theft. How the au pair became so thoughtful and smart is a mystery to Clara and to the reader. But somehow, the reader is told to think that the 15-minute talk they have over drinks on the night the au pair is flying back home to Vienna is the emotional breakthrough that Clara needs. Just not convincing in any way."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"Unfortunately, I chose this book as an introduction to Saul Bellow's writing. I can see from other reviews, by people who have read other Saul Bellow books, that I made a mistake. I thought the characters were 2 dimensional at best, and annoying at worst. I am not a fan of short stories, and maybe novellas fall into that category, too. I can, however, see that Mr. Bellow's insights and language are interesting and creative, and I will try to read him again, but this time I'll choose a full length novel, one that I've actually heard of, for example."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"There was a time when I thought no one wrote self-indulgent pap as well as Bellow, but in light of A Theft, I may change my mind. The other reviewers seem to agree on the absence of plot; I suggest that this novella receive goose eggs in the character development and dramatic tension categories as well. Considering how beautifully Bellow can write when he's making the effort, this book is particularly offensive. Note to Bellow newcomers -- don't give up without reading Mr. Sammler's Planet."},{"Title":"Theft","review":"The first work I've read by the 1976 Nobel Laureate, and quite disappointing. Characters are self-absorbed and psuedo-intellectual, Bellow spends all his time describing people through conversation rather than through their actions, and nothing much seems to happen: sort of &quot;My Dinner With Clara,&quot; except with bad food. The book ultimately is a character study of boring, unsympathetic characters, and a chore for the reader. I'll have to read Bellow's Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; before passing judgment on him as an author, but he's lucky that this work is currently out of print."},{"Title":"The Florians (Daedalus Mission, Book 1)","review":"By the way, the six titles in the Daedalus Mission series are: The Florians, Critical Threshold, Wildeblood's Empire, The City of the Sun, Balance of Power, The Paradox of the Sets."},{"Title":"The Florians (Daedalus Mission, Book 1)","review":"It is a shame that the British sci-fi writer Brian Stableford is not better known in the U.S. &quot;The Florians&quot; is the first in an outstanding six-part series known as &quot;The Daedelus Mission&quot;, which I would rank as the best science fiction series I have ever read.The plot of the series is rather &quot;Star Trek&quot; like - a mission to visit remote planets and check up on previous colonization attempts. But the intricate plots and scientific detail go far beyond anything in &quot;Star Trek.&quot; Each planet visited has a unique ecosystem and evolutionary history which Stableford (a biologist himself) describes in detail. The speculation about alternative results of evolution is fascinating, and the problems encountered make for exciting stories. If you can find this or any of the other five in the series, grab them."},{"Title":"The Adventures of Otto the Otter","review":"The Adventures of Otto the Otter is written in the same vein as Wombat Goes Walkabout and Come Along Daisy. If Otto were human, he'd be about 8 years old. Upbeat story of separation at sea and emerging self reliance, with many adventures and animal characters.

But the book itself is lousy for two main reasons.1. The authors have pretended to remove the casenotes around each case, but have instead added footnotes to include the material that would ordinarily go in casenotes. This means that important material is interjected into the middle of a case, interrupting the flow of the opinion. It's also in tiny print, making it very hard to read and to underline. I personally think that the use of footnotes in text reflects the inability to write clearly, to determine what is important (and thus should be included in the text) and what is not important (and thus should be left out entirely). Having second-class material reflects poor editing skills and is very difficult for the reader. In this book, however, the footnoted material is very important, which is even more frustrating, because it can't even be skipped. This is even worse writing, and should be corrected.2. The book itself is very hard to use. It's incredibly heavy, and so hard to carry around. The cover is floppy, so in order to read it you have to be sitting at a desk. It's really not possible to read it anywhere else, like in an arm chair, on a bus, etc. The pages are shiny making it hard to read in certain lighting.

In this book, parenthetically titled (The Manly Man in the Age of Sissification), he lampoons the Men's Movement. The two main treatises, Fire in the Belly and Iron John, are here eviscerated, mocked, and otherwise brutalized.An enlightened man like me felt really hurt, and shamed by Mr. Gingold's easy manner and brutish denial of his inner-most feelings. He ridicules the notion that erectile dysfunction may be caused by a disconnection to my, or one's, inner Warrior.Still, if I allowed myself to let go of my shame and fear, and embraced my inner Trickster, the book might actually be funny.

It provides a description of a primary battle in Lenape county between two bosses, one in New Boynton and the other in Port Alby. The book follows Tom McDonough in his daily life telling what a political boss does. Tom's father kept a saloon with rental apartments, Tom has a riches to more riches story as an important political lawyer. The description of McDonough's daily activities explains the functions of a political boss: to make connections, to do favors, to make things happen, and to profit from these experiences. The political boss must balance and trade-off the various and conflicting demands from groups of people. This may be one reason why so many lawyers are in politics. The other reason is knowing the laws so as not to get caught, and using \\"client confidentiality\\" to avoid testifying.If you have political parties you'll need leaders to run things. Good leadership costs, it reflects the drive, the knowledge, and their strengths (p.79). [Just as in any business.] Political bosses manage human resources. Reformers may bray about \\"pay to play\\", but they will do the same when they gain power. The system works, just like in Feudal days. Political bosses stay in power by delivering the votes. The attempt to reconcile differences fails, and there will be a bitter Primary fight (Chapter 7). Tom and Carmela visit various taverns and meet varied people; this provides a background to this story. Chapter 13 explains how county-owned land is sold to the highest bidder, via insider knowledge. Nobody goes into business of politics for pleasure; self-interest is paramount (p.128). But due to human nature, somebody talked and this secret deal will be revealed as a political scandal.The occupational hazard for a politician is ongoing success; the longer he is in office, the more enemies he will make (p.181). The party organization is based on patronage and the favor system. Class and sectional differences make politics, and so do personal ambitions and rivalries. The competition for public office is supposed to give power to the voters so they can choose what is best for them. Politicians may be regarded as dishonest because like advertisers and used car dealers they are believed to promise more than they deliver (p.224). One of the richest men in the state comes to McDonough to get him to end the feud; the wealthy class feels it can rely on the Democrats more (p.262).Is the absence of pain a blessing or a curse (p.303)? Was the War of Independence followed by the creation of public schools (p.313)? Can a discipline problem in high school affect an election (p.331)? The meeting at McDonough's house goes will until Matt and Lena's treachery is exposed (Chapter 39). People's problems and scandals are revealed to finish this story. Can spreading rumors, or lies, win an election (Chapter 46)? This story has a wide range of personalities and emotions. You wonder what reality was disguised for this fiction. Chapter 54 describes the aftermath of McDonough's primary win. There is a meeting to create a peace treaty, sort of like government laws, with its give and take. Chapter 55 gives a short history on picking candidates (p.489). You should vote in primaries. McDonough wins the primary, but suffers a great personal loss.As a long-time resident of \\"Lenape\\" county I recognized the reality behind this novel. I wonder if \\"Francis T.

The humor is mostly of the sort where the protagonist makes many blunders and you (the reader) are glad that you, at least, aren't *that* clumsy. I found a lot of the people and conversations were so exaggerated as to not be realistic at all. While it's true that exaggeration can be a part of humor, it was just not believable to me at all that one person would make so many silly mistakes, and yet have such a perfect happy ending. There were some good things that the main character learned, which were more poignant due to the awkward circumstances she found herself in, though these insights are often talked about too much and demonstrated too little.

A former Unitarian as well as more than a few Chritian denominations, Ms. Ross covers the 3 branches with very readable prose. When the subject of miracles comes up, she's objective and does not impose on the reader to believe them. As you might expect, she compares Buddhism with western religions throughout. It's obvious I enjoyed the book but for another reason as well. I sense that Ross is herself a compassionate one who treats her readers with respect for their intellect and was inspired by that. Myself,a former conservative Christian (I just couldn't &quot;get it&quot; for some reason), I appreciated her unbiased and objective writing. As Leonard Da Vinci stated (roughly): An investment in knowledge about a subject is an increase in love for the subject. In this case, the subject is love in a broad sense - a love to help people find happiness by seeing this great religious tradition from its roots as well as current thought. Great book!

Published in 1980 and later dedicated to Richard Dudley Baker, this book is &quot;...a primer for those who know nothing about Buddhism. Yet those who are already students and practitioners...&quot; - Beginning with the historic Buddha's life story and basic teachings, Ross leads into an introduction to general teachings and practice before the major three specific approaches to Buddhism. Mainly Theravada, Tibetan, &amp; Zen are covered. An over emphasis, and well warrented one, is laid on paragraphs from other fine read Buddhist titles which keeps the book alive. Perspectives from the likes of Dr. H. Saddhatissa, Lama Anagarika Govinda, and Shunryu Suzuki keep a modern touch while reading about legends such as King Mongkut, Emperor Ashoka, Wu-ti, and Shotoku Taishi. Much of this book speaks of the historic and cultural impact of Buddhism but still stays fairly informative to the basic teachings &amp; practices of the traditions. - Ross, an open-minded Christian, includes many photographs, paintings, a glossary, and quite some vocabulary!"},{"Title":"Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought","review":"Nancy Ross' book is highly recommended to anyone wishing a concise, clearly written introduction to Buddhism.

If you ever wondered how Buddhism could be a ritualized religion, a humanistic philosophy, a deterministic psychology, and a social activist movement ... all without contradiction and sometimes simultaneously ... then sit and read this book."},{"Title":"Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought","review":"I am a super novice with the Buddhist culture. I did really enjoy this read though. Parts of it were a little challenging to understand, but for the most part it was very interesting and an eye-opening experience! I am currently reading another book on Buddhism which is called Entering The Stream. It is very informative as well and more of that book is easier to comprehend. Learning more about this religion and culture has really changed the way I look at life now. And I must admit, it is a change for the better :) I hope others enjoy the read as well!"},{"Title":"Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought","review":"Nancy Wilson Ross has written a clear, concise introductory book on Buddhism. She compares the three approaches: Theravada, Tibetan and Zen Buddhism. Along with the history of each approach, Nancy provides insight and practical exercises from them all. This is a very well balanced book, like the goal we should all attain in our lives. Buddha opposed authoritarianism and stressed right effort and livelihood. Although Buddha did admit to miracles and parapsychological powers, these are just stepping stones in our spiritual attainment. All in all, this is an excellent book to read. I enjoyed immensely."},{"Title":"Buddhism: A Way of Life and Thought","review":"If you are reading about Buddhism for the first time you may get a little lost in this book."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I have almost every Bathroom Reader book out there and this is ANOTHER Home Run! Since I love history I found the book just perfect except one flaw, I could never go to sleep. I would want to read just one more article. If you love having useless knowledge like I do, you will love this book!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I love how they always bring the information to life. You won't realize how long you have been reading it, until someone knocks on the door :o)"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"These books are great! We get one every year and have enjoyed all of them. Got this one for a friend who loves trivia and unusual anecdotes. He loves it! Thanks, Uncle John!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"Anyone who plunges into this book will enjoy the odd facts and interesting history tidbits. The only problem is from time to time they get a few facts wrong. So don't refence it when you write a paper for school and you should be fine."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"At this point I think I have all of their books...great for trivia buffs; folks who want to read for a bit, put it down, and read later without following a storyline/plot; history fans, etc.And as the titles say, they are great for those \\"Moments of Solitude\\" on the throne!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"This book is exactly what I wanted. I gave it to my dad as a gift and he loves it! The information is so interesting!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I'm a teenager who loves to read the BRI books while I am on the pot. I have like 5 and read through all of them (I just started this one). Right off the bat I realized that the arch thingy (where the book bends) Doesn't bend as much as the opther ones, which makes it harder to read."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"This book is quite an eye-opener! Not only is it entertaining (and sometimes hilarious) it is amazingly educational. There is no question that the greatest history buff will get something out of this book, and the presentation is priceless!The history starts B.C. and moves into modern times, teaching you stuff you never heard from your history teachers. The History of Underwear is one of my particular favorites.This is a fabulous, fun read!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I love reading the Bathroom Reader Books and have been wanting a Kindle version of the books for a while. After buying this one though I think I'll stick to the actual books. I liked the fact that the stories were all together so that you did not need to go flipping through pages, but had problems trying to skip the pages of stories I did not want to read. Another reason I did not like it on kindle was because at least one of the articles did not have the whole article, it just ended. At first I thought I just needed to flip the page, but when I got to the next page there was a new article. Better off just getting the actual hard copy of the book."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"Great Reading!

It was hard to put this book down..."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"Fun and interesting reading that gives bits of history presented in a much more enjoyable fashion than high school history (though it may not be as accurate). This covers so many topics and gives interesting tidbits that have actually spurred me to find out more about some of the events written about. Great way to while away a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I found it not quite as unbiased as I prefer my history books but it was entertaining none the less."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I love this book.

We are not disappointed and will purchase other issues as well."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"This ,in my humble opinion, is one of Uncle John's best Bathroom Readers yet;and I've read most of them.Although you gotta admit,when you take History as a subject,there's a lot to work with.At 490 pages,it is massive.With so much to choose from,it must have been humongous task for the Project Team to decide what ,and to what extent, different topics of history to include.The other thing that amazed me was that they made each and every topic precise and interesting.I have long been interested in history,and it is difficult to pick and choose and to find out what is fact,fiction or plain wrong.Here,you are going to find things you never heard about at all,things that will amaze you about things you thought you knew;and all presented so well.Any one of the topics addressed,be it The Hundred Year's War,The Crusades,The last words of famous people,the fact that until 1946,there was no such thing as a \\"Canadian citizen\\",.just \\"British subjects\\".Did you know that in 1892,Annie Moore from Ireland was the first immigrant processed at Ellis Island? If quotations are your thing,you'll find many:\\"History is a pack of lies about events that never happened told by people who weren't there.\\"--George Santayana;or from Historians,Will and Ariel Durant--\\"History is mostly guessing;the rest is prejudice\\".There are lots of Epitaphs here for you such as on Alexander the Great\\"s; \\"A tomb now suffices for him ,For whom the world was not enough\\".Then there's the final words of the famous:\\"I'm bored with it all\\"--Winston Churchill.And what a way to sum it all up,with a Gravestone with these words inscribed upon;Been there:Now gone:Had a good time.An excellent Reader in all respects,and why wouldn't it be;it's from Uncle John's!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I received the first Uncle John's Bathroom Reader as a gift nearly fifteen years ago, and I have enjoyed every one of its many successors. &quot;Uncle John's Bathroom Reader Plunges Into History&quot; is the first of the readers to focus on a specific subject matter, but it is every bit as enjoyable as its more generic brethren.Whether you read this book in the bathroom or in the living room, you'll really get a kick out of it. Each article is short, interesting and can generally be read in one sitting (so to speak). Although some of the material was new to me, the book seemed to have its facts straight about the stories with which I was familiar. Despite the witty and breezy style, the authors have usually done enough homework to master the basics. To top it off, the &quot;factoids&quot; on the bottom of each page are pretty interesting in their own right!If you enjoy history lite--featuring short articles that can be read quickly in a series of short sittings--check out &quot;The Bathroom Historian,&quot; my ongoing list of books in this genre. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"Each selection is two to three pages, thus lends itself well to situations where you have less than ten minutes. Found myself reading these to my newborn to get her to go to sleep. Sure beats reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. Half the time I find my wife listening in. The historical trivia are interesting and written in a humorous way that will keep you coming back for more."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I'm not, by nature, overly impressed with trivia books. I enjoy them at times, but I rarely consider them \\"page-turners\\", which is why they are often considered great choices for bathroom reading material. This collection is a welcome exception! History is a fascinating field, something more people need to realize but few can grasp after years of stale high school history lessons. This book has a lot of fascinating material in it, and offers the reader a wealth of hilarious and/or startling trivia. This book is well worth the cost!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"I picked up this book about a month ago, and haven't been able to put it down since. I have learned more tidbits of trivia from this book than I did in High School. The articles are written in a way that makes history fun, and for many people, that's not easy! Being someone who enjoys history, this book is a real gem!"},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"This book is an excellent piece of work from the Bathroom Readers' Institute, devoted entirely to history. Same style as regular Bathroom Reader books, with the same variety of topics as regular volumes, but all historic.

I wished I had a book like this one when I was teaching.It would have helped me give my students interesting stories that they would have enjoyed."},{"Title":"Uncle John's Bathroom Reader: Plunges into History","review":"This book is part of a series of bathroom readers. The authors have written articles, one to four pages long, meant to be read in, uh, an appropriate length of time.This book's articles concern history. Given the purpose of the book, you might expect low quality - - but I was consistently impressed. They got their history right, given the, uh, brief length of the articles. Of course they choose entertaining historical trivia such as Mad King Ludwig, sex scandals, disasters and mistakes, and other such things.I don't normally give such things five stars but I can't imagine producing a better example of the genre. It fully succeeds at what it wants to do despite its rather, uh, constricted ambitions."},{"Title":"Message Hadrian","review":"I have long been a fan of Geoffrey Trease's historical novels, but this is - to my mind - one of the best he's ever written. (My personal list of favorites includes *Cue for Treason* and *Victory at Valmy* too.) This is the story of Paul, the son of a Roman legionnaire in Britain, who sets out on a journey to Rome, avoiding gangsters along the way, to take a message to the Emperor, and try to save an innocent man's life. It has everything: adventure, humor, and a lover's description of Rome. This book should not be out of print!"},{"Title":"Message Hadrian","review":"I read this book in High School and later bought the book from the Library. It is a good introduction to life in the Roman world during the so-called &quot;Silver Age&quot; when the Empire was at it's greatest extent. It is an action packed adventure stretching from Northern Britain to the Eternal City itself.It is a shame that all this author's work is out of print."},{"Title":"Message Hadrian","review":"I read this book in High School and later bought the book from the Library.

The orientation went against all of my training as a radiology and ct tech, since the image orientation was not consistent.(the right should ALWAYS be the right, doncha know?) I do not recommend it to imaging professionals, as there are better books out there, but it might be ok for medical students or the like. Overall, I began to despise this book to the point that I gave it away as soon as class was over, and I found myself using other texts and online resources to study, because the book was just too confusing!!"},{"Title":"The State of world population, 1991","review":"This 2 volume set is horrible! The diagrams in the Applications book are vague and confusioning. The way that the Concepts book is written is just terrible it is jumbled and runs together. It is impossible to besure that you are labeling or even answering most of the questions correctly, let alone all of them. Diagrams in the workbook that are totally different then the ones in the Concepts book and you are suppose to label them? correctly? There has got to be something better out there. I can not wait until I am done with this class, I will see if everyone wants to come over to my book burning party!"},{"Title":"The State of world population, 1991","review":"There is alot of information. It is a good review for anatomy but, the diagrams are very confusing. I read other consumer reviews before I had to purchase for a class and thought \\" oh, it cant be that bad.\\" Well, it is. If you have any say in what books to choose from, try to find something else."},{"Title":"The State of world population, 1991","review":"(Not sure how \\"new kaki fan\\" got there. hmmm).The negative reviews written previously are a fairly good assessement of this book. I took this course in prep for MRI and even the teacher admitted that she's tried a variety of texts and none are perfect. I think she picked this book because it comes with workbook and at first glance, appears to be geared toward students trying to memorize as little as possible in a short time. Thankfully, she recorded her lectures, complete with slideshow, which students could review on the web. She wanted us to largely pay attention to her lecture. The text in this book isn't bad - there are alot of good things, but then there are some problems. Probably was bothered me the most was the drawings as there is a destinct lack of consistancy from one drawing to the next. I just accepted it as being impossible to draw anatomy with more consistancy as everyone is a little different. Let's face it, cross-sectional isn't easy. When you find yourself guessing where the portable vein is after studying it thoroughly, you realize that a book can only provide so much. In the end, we didn't use the book at all. I spent more time studying the larger atlases at my school library. Those were great, especially the one by Dr. Frank Netter."},{"Title":"The State of world population, 1991","review":"This book is very thorough and will be a great reference material later on. The Concepts text contains mutliple anatomical diagrams and cross sectional images for labeling to enable the reader to apply what they have learned in the Applications text. There are also several review questions through out the chapters as well as a chapter review and chapter recall test. It is a very good book for a course that I am currently taking as well as a good reference to use when preparing for the ARRT registry exam in CT."},{"Title":"The State of world population, 1991","review":"This book doesn't give you any more information than what you can find on Google. I am not a fan of the lack of organization."},{"Title":"The State of world population, 1991","review":"Someone else said they received half the other too... So did I!

It is an outstanding work and will fascinate and astound, not only those familiar with the German Templers, but all who will wish to learn of the hardships and suffering of this incredible group of dedicated people."},{"Title":"If Russia strikes","review":"Major Elliot's informed analysis is just as valid in 2004 as it was in 1949. The Russian's relentless pursuit of nuclear arsenals and world hegemony is a true threat to world peace, and in particular, Major Elliot makes a strong case for protecting Norway from the high probability of Russian Attack (p. 141). The Soviet, er, Russian High Command will be anxious to get hold of Norwegian ports for the use of their submarines. And in the Middle East we must also be vigilant lest Russian columns strike from Transcaucasia in to Abadan and Kuweit. As Major Eliot writes, a burden of responsibility to protect the benefits of freedom and share its benefits with mankind has been laid on the shoulders of America as has no other country in history.Actually, that last part probably actually still IS true today.I miss the Cold War. The moral relativism that infects the heart of the West and America is a hard thing to deal with, and it may be our own apathy and over-acceptance of other cultures that will ultimately lose the current war of ideas and cultures."},{"Title":"The Copper Peacock and Other Stories (Eagle Large Print)","review":"Don't expect simple murder and mayhem, or neat storybook endings.\\"The Copper Peacock\\" is both a 'vulgar' bookmark and a vain young man who wouldn't have it as a gift. Bernard, young but successful biographer of obscure literary lights, has great (good?) luck in his friends. Before leaving for a US publicity tour, fellow author Peter loans Bernard his flat as a kid-free workspace. The flat even comes with cleaning service, Judy, a young woman who keeps it neat as Bernard's mother's place, quietly feeding him lunch (as his wife has no time to do) as he writes about literary men dazzling their working-class mistresses. But though considering himself an artist, Bernard doesn't look at the world around him - sometimes deliberately, refusing to think of life when his wife returns to her job in the spring, and sometimes not, when Judy turns up bruised from 'accidents'.\\"Dying Happy\\" The nameless narrator listens to a dying friend unburdening himself about the love of his life - Susanna, with whom he cheated on his wife Miriam twenty years ago. Over time, he ceased openly comparing Miriam unfavourably to Susanna, and his marriage somewhat recovered. But upon her husband's recent request to see Susanna again, Miriam exploded, complete with death threats if Susanna (whom she'd never met) turned up. Funny how things work out...\\"The Fish-Sitter\\", Cyril (viewpoint character), works for Malvina's Aquarium at a seaside resort, locking up and feeding the fish in the evenings (but not cleaning the tanks, a specialist job). When Cyril gives a crab dinner to a girl working in the same complex, Malvina accuses him of using one of her exhibits.\\"Long Live the Queen\\" begins with a death, as Anna runs over a cat-lover's most treasured companion. Anna soon regrets leaving a note for the owner, who by turns calls Anna a murderer and demands 800 pounds in compensation (everything spent on the 'queen' throughout her life). Creepy.Charlotte, more dedicated to her career than her husband, accepts Nell as a \\"Mother's Help\\" for car-loving three-year-old Daniel. Trouble brewing right off, as Ivan takes time off \\"to be with Daniel\\". Nell as the viewpoint character is besotted with Ivan, but nevertheless manages to lull Charlotte's suspicions with talk of an imaginary boyfriend. Charlotte appears more concerned with Daniel's late talking (and fondness for his nanny) than with a husband whose main objection to divorce seems financial. Some women have poor pattern-recognition skills - but which woman?\\"A Pair of Yellow Lilies\\" embroidered on a jacket she can't afford distracts Bridget as her bag is stolen (ironically, while researching a motivational speaker), together with cash from her well-off aunt. But the theft gives as well as takes away; a helpful librarian befriends her, and a good-looking stranger returns some of the bag's discarded contents. Nice character study.The nameless narrator, abandoned to the care of her loveless grandparents at birth, is fascinated by her grandmother's secret \\"Paperwork\\". The grandmother has no friends locally, but keeps up scrapbooks and a large correspondence that she locks away in her \\"sewing-room\\". Nice touches, not calling things by their right names (a study that isn't a study, a granddaughter called \\"it\\"), the fact that only basenjis are accepted as pets (dogs that never learn to bark unless raised with other breeds).The author of a suicide note refers to herself as \\"An Unwanted Woman\\", but is it so? Events begin well before the police case as Hilary, a friend of Jenny Burden, asks for help with Sophie, her teenage daughter who has turned against Hilary's new husband despite their careful courtship. Hilary's ex-husband is years gone; Sophie has taken refuge with Ann Waterton, a grandmotherly lonely neighbour, and refuses to go home until Hilary's husband is gone. But the most the law can do is take Sophie into care. This can't go on...A garden open to the public offers a standing challenge to find \\"Weeds\\" - one pound per weed, when the entry fee is only two pounds. Jeremy, having been dragged in to humour one of his publisher's biggest authors, wanders into the wrong secluded area, and runs across a much livelier scenario than even the unhappily married owner bullying his staff..."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Making Movies is a concise, conversational and insightful account of a masterful director's own technique. It is mercifully free of gossip, but instead focuses on Lumet's approach to many of his most important films. It's pitched at a general reader who may have little experience of the film industry, but even an experienced director can gain a lot by reading about how he approaches a script creatively, runs his rehearsal room, designs his coverage and deals with his cast and crew. If you're a director yourself it's one to keep handy."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"I can only say how greatful I am to Mr. Sidney Lumet for taking the time to share his vast experience while gaining the tools to take a story and keep it flowing regardless to time, fears and woes. It is good to hear from a man that did the wiz and brought out the talents in actors that would other wise never reached the levels they are at today. I wish he would come out with another one and go on fro mthe latest works of his. God bless Mr. Sidney Lumet you are a god of the movie screen."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"Sure Lumet has been making large Hollywood movies for decades but the morals of his stories are just as important for any serious low-budget director. Most readers of this book may never have to deal with an actor demanding millions to be cast in their movie but once they're on the set, Lumet's theories for dealing with that actor still applies to the local guy you hired off Craigslist. In between the facts are a slew of insights from Lumet on his thoughts that go behind the film to make you realize how he coinciously turns a good film idea into a great film on screen. And if Lumet doesn't make a great film? He isn't afraid to admit it and explain how he does the best he can with what he has."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"As a filmmaker, I've read several books on writing, directing, and production, but this by far has been my favorite. I devoured it in a few days. What makes it so great is the way Lumet straightforwardly carries you through the entire filmmaking process, highlighting the roles of the many key players and aspects involved, and colors it with his own priceless anecdotes.The only thing that would make this book a better read would be being familiar with all of Lumet's great films so that every reference means that much more. I have seen most of his classics (12 Angry Men, Network, Dog Day Afternoon), but there are a few that are now in my Netflix queue.Incredible book.If you're an aspiring director, definitely read this.If you're a cinefile who's just curious about the filmmaking process, this will be a joy for you as well."},{"Title":"Making Movies","review":"As has been abundantly stated by other reviewers, this is an interesting book for both movie lovers & movie makers. It is eminently readable, in a flowing, non-technical style that is surprisingly effective at delivering practical information about Lumet's filmmaking choices & philosophy through the decades of a legendary career.Many how-to manuals seem to put the cart before the horse. Refreshingly, rather than providing instruction in equipment-driven decision making [here's how you use this particular lens, camera, fill light, etc.], Lumet talks about his story-telling goals then how he worked with his team to identify the proper technology to achieve them, resulting in such stylistically varied successes as the hyper-real video & dialog quality of \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" & the Rembrandt-esque look of \\"The Verdict\\".This book has a fly-on-the-wall quality that almost makes you feel like you are participating in a long dinner conversation where the filmmaker discusses his day, reliving his experiences, revisiting his ideas & choices, evaluating whether they worked or not, even racking on the unprofessional Teamster who made him late to rehearsal, then pillaged the craft services cart.Something that hasn't been stated by other reviewers is how remarkably humble the author comes off. Far from validating the \\"auteur\\" status that many would grant him, Lumet appears to have a sincere appreciation for the complex team effort that results in a major motion picture, rather than an inflated perception of the supremacy of the director's role. He is extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of the filmmaking process & manages to share that knowledge clearly & concisely. He has profound respect for the contributions of the players who typically get nothing but abuse: the studio execs, writers, post-production, the stars.Lumet even seems honestly enraptured by the emergent qualities that blossom from a group effort where \\"everyone is making the same movie\\", & he takes his responsibilities for vision, coordination & budgeting very seriously.This guy just comes off as the consummate professional & his book is a joy to read."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],j={key:0},J={key:1};function x(s,e,n,m,r,i){const c=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(t(!0),a(f,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(t(),b(c,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",J,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",j,"See more"))],8,E)):p("",!0)])}const q=u(B,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-e4694ada"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/4.md","filePath":"quotes/4.md"}'),C={name:"quotes/4.md"},N=Object.assign(C,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(q)]))}});export{H as __pageData,N as default};
