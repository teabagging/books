The book is out of print, and finding copies are difficult, so if you find one, grab it.The story is of Morag, a fifteen-year-old girl who is, as the book puts it, \\"retarded by circumstance\\". She's sullen, angry, and rendered so by her early experiences of a delinquent mother, a succession of foster homes, and the cruelty of a world that seems to have no place for her. The story is of Morag's flight from her latest foster home to live in the hills and forests of Scotland, a dream she has been coaxing into reality for some time. The going is at first predictably rough: she has difficulty building a fire, finding shelter, providing herself with food. But as weeks turn into months, she becomes a part of the forest, and wonderful things happen: she finds a cave to make into her home, adopts two goats that provide her with milk (and frustrating lessons of butter and cheese making), and discovers a natural supply of salt at the nearby ocean.The self-discoveries she makes are the truly important ones, however, and her self-imposed isolation makes it possible for her to slow down her thinking, her responses, her emotions. In a large sense she regains the sanity that she never felt was in her grasp before. She also makes discoveries about her own sexuality, which opens the story to turn off into two other avenues: one, worship towards a skeleton she finds one day in the woods, and the second, saving the life of an injured rock climber that turns into much more than either of them had bargained for.I've always thought this would make an excellent movie: more of an Indie film, shot in Scotland, of course, with an extraordinary girl in the role of Morag. She would have to be an extraordinary actress indeed, because Morag is so multi-faceted a person. It would never be a mainstream film, because there are few people in it, a huge shortage of dialogue, and the pathos that exist are almost entirely of a psychological nature.This book is just so marvelous."},{"Title":"A wild thing (Bantam Pathfinder Editions)","review":"As a troubled 14-year-old, locked away in a Louisiana reform school, I discovered this masterpiece of empathy and the cycle of life and death on a lower shelf, covered with dust and unread (according to the yellowed card) for more than 12 years. I can unreservedly claim that &quot;A Wild Thing&quot; is the underlying reason that I never returned to that horrid place and learned to make my own way. A sullen, selfish girl is lost in a wilderness she claims as her hermetic home where she discovers the strength and beauty within herself and the power that comes from self-reliance and acceptance. No happy endings, no sap, and definitely NO male hero needed to come to the rescue. Just a powerful adventure that is a vehicle for a profound, life-changing message. A rare and wonderful jewel of a book, if you can find it."},{"Title":"A wild thing (Bantam Pathfinder Editions)","review":"This is a haunting, disturbing story that caught my attention as a deeply unhappy girl and has never left my consciousness. Morag's story is gritty and real, harsh and unforgiving, and still very beautiful. It reached my own \\"heart of darkness\\" when I wanted nothing so much as to be alone to reclaim my own sense of purpose, self-sufficiency, and sanity in a crazy and unsupportive world. It fed my fantasies of running away and being truly alone at the same time that it served as a cautionary tale of what true isolation from human society means. This book has something special in it--an authenticity to the core experience of being estranged from other people and struggling to make sense of one's identity and relevance. Not a \\"high school misfit\\" sort of book but one that speaks to deep alienation and crosses an enormous gap between \\"normal\\" experience and that of many of us for whom childhood and young adulthood were not at all the stuff of TV dramas."},{"Title":"The law and the word","review":"The Law and the Word is a excellent outline of just what the tittle states. Troward being one of the forefathers of New Thought gives a very insightful and scientific outline of the power of our thought and spoken word and how the Law works. If you have not read some of his earlier writings like \\"The Creative Process in the Individual\\" and become familiar of his way of teaching and writing it may be hard to grasp. I have been fortunate enough to been exposed to some excellent teachers in New Thought and once I \\"got\\" how Troward writes it opened new doors of thought and perspective. In all honesty Troward was the forefather of Qauntum Physics from a intuitive level. So I suggest when you read him have a open mind and open heart and let his words speak to you and the glimmers will shine through. If you would like to get a sample of one of the next great teachers of this generation visit [...]"},{"Title":"The law and the word","review":"Mr Troward thinks deeply and seeks to bring the reader into an understanding of basically, \\"cause and effect\\". He paints a broad picture of how things start and the law or principle by which they originate and translate into their intended purposes. He uses science frequently to show that all things that we have been able to use for our advantage we have discovered certain laws by which they work. Once we find the laws we have been able to unfold a myriad of uses and applications of the laws for a vast number of things. The \\"Law and the Word\\" is his premise for the explanation of how things originate and produce their effects. He starts with God and creation. God spoke (his thoughts) and things emerged and took shape and form. Man being an expression of God made in his image accomplishes the things he does in the same manner by his word (thoughts) and the law translates them into reality. These realities may come into existance by various means including his own efforts in cooperating with the law of his being. Troward says that it is always the law and the word, but the word comes first and the law brings it to pass. Although Mr Troward ventures into some areas of thought that are quite challenging to get a hold of, he often returns to a scriptural basis for most of his insights. Of all the new thought writers Thomas Troward is perhaps the most scriptually focused in all of his writings. There is a reverence and a respect for the bible and he constantly uses biblical texts to help support his conclusions. He certainly uses terms like \\"we may reason\\" or the word \\"speculate\\" in stating some postulations but he unwaveringly uses biblical quotes with a firmness of faith and affirms his obvious recognition of the authority of Christ and the meaning of redemption. The last chapter is full of scripture and he states clearly his belief in \\"the atonement\\" and reconciliation with God that allows the higher dimensions of man's ability to use the Law and the Word in unlimited ways.

If memory serves it was the Lancer edition of \\"Robots Have No Tails\\" the collected stores of Galloway Gallagher. In the first published story, \\"The Time Locker\\" the character was Galloway. Kuttner forgot and renamed him Gallagher in the next story. He corrected the mistake re-christening him \\"Galloway Gallagher.\\" Over the years I have re-read with pleasures these politically incorrect stories of the drunken genius. Eventually, my copy decayed to dust. It's great to see an old friend get a new lease on life. The stories are dated and the writing slightly off - but Kuttner was a pulp writer of his time. These are not the polished gems he wrote with his wife, Moore, but written in a lighter vein. This work represents the fun side of the golden era of science fiction."},{"Title":"Robots Have No Tails","review":"I read this in high school and was an idiot and didn't save the paperback. The premise has already been described in other reviews so I'll save you from that. I just wanted to make note that this new edition isn't in standard paperback format.

He'd start with a twist of wire and an odd notion or two, and come up with something never before known - something like a robot that thought that the most beautiful thing in the world was its own innards. Or a machine that ate dirt and sang bawdy songs. The trouble was, Gallegher's genius worked only when he was drunk. Once sober again, he could never figure out just what it was his gadgets were supposed to do; whether it was opening a can of beer - or saving the world.\\"\\"Henry Kuttner & C.L.Moore formed the most popular writing team in science fiction for twenty years, until Kuttner's untimely death at the age of 43.\\"---------------------------------------This is a great book. Unusual, funny, I have reread it dozens of times since discovering it eigth grade. Critics say it uses adolescent humor. Most definitely but adult sci fi readers love it too. Critics say it glorifies alcohol abuse. Possibly - Gallegher has to drink to invent but sober, he has massive hangovers and can't remember what problem he was working on, why, who paid him etc. This leads to his adventures and misadventures. A tribute to alcohol abuse? If the alcohol was so great, his memory wouldn't be so bad and his resulting situations would not be so hysterical.A classic for sci fi fans."},{"Title":"Robots Have No Tails","review":"I first encountered Galloway Gallegher decades ago when I was a teenager, and fell in love with the stories. What an odd hero - his scientific genius manifests itself through his subconscious, and the only thing that releases his subconscious is stupendous amounts of alcohol, all kinds of alcohol (though beer is his drink of choice). Like the previous reviewer, I don't agree with the charges that the five stories contained in this book glamorized alcohol consumption. Gallegher definitely pays a price for his drinking, in terms of hangovers, memory loss, and trying to deal with the complicated situations caused by his alter-ego subconscious, which has an eccentric, off-the-wall sense of humor. If you're looking for the stories and can't find a copy of \\"Robots Have No Tails\\", try \\"The Proud Robot\\", which was released in paperback a number of years ago. They both contain the same stories. Also, look for the books under the names Lewis Padgett and Henry Kuttner -- they were the same person."},{"Title":"Robots Have No Tails","review":"I originally read this set of related short stories in a paperback edition decades ago. It is still the only book I ever read that when I finished it, I read it immediately all over again! Mr. Kuttner, writing in his humorous-story pen name of Lewis Padgett, wrote some of the funniest short stories in sci-fi and fantasy ever done (there is a lot more to read for anyone who likes this book, though unfortunately no more stories about Mr. Gallagher, the inventor). The sci-fi stories all \\"nail it\\" in many ways concerning predicting the future, particularly in the best story \\"The Proud Robot\\". Considering the stories in this book were all written in 1941, Mr. Kuttner had an amazing ability to predict what would happen if certain types of technology were created and, after mixing this with a fantastic grasp of human nature and a writing style that is different from, but as good as, Terry Pratchett, you get stories you never forget and get at least a smile whenever you remember them. This is true classic sci-fi at its very best. Very highly recommended!Nathan Okun"},{"Title":"Robots Have No Tails","review":"Henry Kuttner's stories starring the whimsical and often tipsy inventor with a poor memory, Gallagher, and his creation, the vain Robot, are among the most sweetly remembered of my adolescence. They hold up wonderfully well. The plots are scrambled mysteries of economic intrigue, and the characters are memorable and a delight to visit with--at any age.The only other character in science fiction for whom I have a similar, sweet fondness is Pohl Anderson's intergallactice trader and sly Santa Clause of a devilish detective, Nicholas Van Riijn.I recommend ROBOTS HAVE NO TALES as highly as possible. This edition included an early, short, memoir by Kuttner's wife and colleague author, C.L. Moore. Note that this edition of the book is published in soft, magazie format.

Some of the descriptions of the future reminded me of Blade Runner; at least in the sense of merely being backdrop, not story.There are hints of philosophy in the tales too, if you take more than a fleeting look.For all that, its a fun read, which is most important of all.

Pure escapist science fiction at its best! These little known gems should be in every true science fiction fan's library. Please, do yourself a favor and buy this book, believe me you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Robots Have No Tails","review":"Originally released in 1952 by the early sci-fi/fantasy publisher Gnome Press, the meaninglessly titled \\"Robots Have No Tails\\" collects the five stories that Henry Kuttner wrote featuring the drunken inventor Galloway Gallegher. (As to that title, in the book's original introduction by Kuttner's equally celebrated wife, C.L. Moore, she tells us that her husband was at a loss for an appropriate name for this collection, and so told the publisher, \\"I can't think of one. Call it anything you like. Call it 'Robots Have No Tails' if you want to.\\") The stories here all originally appeared in the most celebrated sci-fi magazine of the era, John W. Campbell's \\"Astounding Science-Fiction,\\" and despite the fact that most of Kuttner and Moore's output after their 1940 marriage was written in collaboration, Moore reveals that these Gallegher stories--four from 1943 and one from 1948--were written by Kuttner alone, under one of the team's many pen names, Lewis Padgett. Combining hard sci-fi with a large dose of slapstick, anarchic humor, these Gallegher tales have proven to be some of Kuttner's most enduring and popular creations. In each of them, the sodden scientist invents some kind of miraculous gadget while he is swizzled, and upon sobering up, cannot for the life of him remember what the device is good for. And this leads to all kinds of outrageous situations with the customers for whom the devices were commissioned in the first place!The collection kicks off with what is probably the least of the tales, \\"Time Locker\\" (from the Jan. '43 \\"ASF\\"). In this one, Gallegher's latest gizmo--a storage cabinet that tucks objects away a few million years in the future--is used by a crooked lawyer to cache some purloined bonds. But things get a little out of hand, in this short but decidedly loopy story, and capped by one mindblower of a finale. In \\"The World Is Mine\\" (June '43 \\"ASF\\"), Gallegher's new time machine accidentally brings to Earth the Lybblas: small, furry, button-nosed, milk-and-cookie-scarfing creatures from Mars' future who want to conquer the Earth! And if this isn't enough to keep Gallegher busy, he must also contend here with a steady stream of Gallegher corpses from the future, whom the authorities promptly charge him with murdering! This is easily the zaniest story of the bunch; crazy and witty as can be, it also introduces us to Gallegher's Grandpa, a hilarious old coot who is almost as big a tippler as Gallegher himself. \\"The Proud Robot\\" (Oct. '43 \\"ASF\\") presents the reader with the character of Joe for the first time; a narcissistic, obnoxious mechanical \\"man\\" who spends most of \\"his\\" time admiring itself before a mirror and being generally unhelpful. In this tale, Gallegher is hired by a movie studio whose main source of income--what is, in essence, cable television--is being threatened by the \\"bootleg\\" movie palaces of its competitor. Probably the most oft anthologized of all the Gallegher stories, this hilarious tale presciently foresees the movie vs. television rivalry of a good decade hence. In what is perhaps the most complexly plotted story of the five, \\"Gallegher Plus\\" (Nov. '43 \\"ASF\\"), Gallegher learns, after a particularly intensive bender, that he has apparently created a dirt-guzzling contraption that also sings \\"St. James Infirmary\\"! But why he created this contraption, and what it's good for, and for which of his three increasingly irate current customers, the hungover Gallegher has no clue. This tale features some tense moments for the alcoholic genius and a narrow escape from a gang of nasty thugs...as well as an alphabetical drinking contest! Remember that old episode of \\"The Prisoner,\\" the one called \\"The Girl Who Was Death,\\" in which Number 6, to purge himself after drinking poison, orders a brandy, followed by \\"Whiskey. Vodka. Drambuie. Tia Maria. Quatro. Grand Marnier\\"? Well, that's nothing compared to what Gallegher does here, trying to keep up with a crooked alderman who is boozing alphabetically: absinthe, brandy, Cointreau, daiquiri, etc., all the way to the letter \\"Y.\\" Who else but Gallegher could possibly keep up? The collection ends with a tale called \\"Ex Machina\\" (April '48 \\"ASF\\"), in which Gallegher, Grandpa and Joe all return one more time for another way-out adventure. In this one, Gallegher sobers up again, only to find an invisible speed drinker in his house, as well as a metallic gizmo with blue eyes staring at him. (This orbed object may bring to mind the blue-eyed doorknob from Kuttner and Moore's extremely psychedelic novella \\"The Fairy Chessmen,\\" from 1946.) Here, Gallegher is commissioned by a safari expedition company to come up with a way of minimizing the inherent danger to its customers. The story finds Joe discovering philosophy for the first time, has Gallegher once again accused of murder by the dim-witted authorities, and provides another wacky explanation for all the preceding mishegas.Unfailingly inventive and often laugh-out-loud funny, the Gallegher stories might be considered some kind of perfect entertainment. Kuttner seemed to improve every year that he wrote (starting with 1936's \\"The Graveyard Rats\\"), and his work here, hastily written as it was, remains most impressive. He flubs on occasion--such as when he tells us that the uncertainty principle was Planck's, rather than Heisenberg's, and when he suggests in one tale that Gallegher is living in the early 21st century, and in another mentions that musician Larry Adler lived \\"hundreds of years ago,\\" making it more like the 22nd century--but most readers will be having too much of a good time to notice. And really, how can any book with a line like \\"Grandpa, a wizened little man with a brown face like a bad-tempered nutcracker\\" be anything BUT amusing? Fans of Golden Age sci-fi and vintage screwball comedies will most likely read these stories hungrily and with great enjoyment...just like Joe with one of his philosophy books...."},{"Title":"Robots Have No Tails","review":"Hi-larious science fiction from the golden age.A group of stories (mostly from the 40's) about an inventor who can only invent when inebriated, then must attempt to figure out what he invented (and what it is used for) after he sobers up.

The date in the title of this book is a reference to the end point of the forecast period.I had first read the book near the time when it came out. I decided to reread it now because I was interested in examining how accurate the forecasts turned out, and then to study how the correct forecasts had been developed. Content analysis has long been a Naisbitt forte, and I wanted to see another test of its strengths and potential weaknesses.I was pleasantly surprised at how well the themes had held up. These include:(1) a global economic boom prompted by the information economy, freer trade, and a government bias towards economic expansion over political ideology.(2) a rapid growth in participation in the fine and finer arts.(3) the emergence of free markets in socialist economies. Here the progress has even been more rapid than most would have expected.(4) increasing similarities in global lifestyles with increased cultural nationalism.(5) privatization of the welfare state in the western democracies.(6) economic and cultural influence of Pacific Rim countries and California greatly expand.(7) women become much more important in leadership roles.(8) biotechnology makes great progress and raises major ethical issues, while biology becomes a more common metaphor.(9) religious revival led by fundamentalism and the desire for deep, personal experience.(10) triumph of the individual in becoming free of institutional constraints to become more in charge of one's own destiny. &quot;The new responsibility of society is to reward the initiatives of the individual.&quot;The conclusion talks about the importance of overcoming the scourges of disease (such as AIDS) and global poverty.As a result, I would have to give this book five stars for forecasting . . . realizing how chancy that business is by nature.On the other hand, I found the book to be long and tedious to read. I gave it three stars for the quality and clarity of explanation of the key points. In many cases, examples drone on and on, but relatively few points were made or supported directly. Perhaps it is just my perspective, but the chapter on women in leadership seemed particularly weak from this point of view.Equally of interest were the things that were not forecast: that communism would fall except in a revised form in China and Cuba; that the United States would become a more dominant economic and political power; that Japan would have a terrible decade; and that government power in the world would be curtailed at such a rapid rate. But few got these factors right, and they used different methods from Naisbitt and Aburdene. I suspect that is because content analysis should be slow to pick up on these kinds of changes, but power analysis works well as demonstrated by James Dale Davidson and Lord Rees-Moog in their excellent books using this method.Where will we be in 2010? A continuation of these trends is likely, but what will be the new ones? You'll have to think about that for yourself.After you have finished enjoying this book and thinking about what it means for your future, I suggest that you consider how you can expand your own individual potential. As the Army likes to say, &quot;Be all that you can be.&quot;Use the irresistible trends to your advantage for breakthrough gains!"},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten new directions for the 1990's","review":"In contrast to the first Megatrends book that came out in 1984, this book is way off the mark. His economic analysis is always interesting, but this time, for the most part, his trends have not panned out. I found this book to be a much slower read than the first Megatrends. Even so, I still plan to look for Megatrends 2010 when it comes out."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten new directions for the 1990's","review":"Having been so impressed with the original &quot;Megatrends,&quot; I was very much looking forward to this edition. Unfortunately,the authors' crystal ball failed too often this time around to inspire much confidence. One major flaw, I think, is that there is much less content analysis used in tracking these trends and far too much fluff in the way of interviews and anecdotes. Too, in &quot;Megatrends,&quot; statistics were used to back up forecasts derived from content analysis. Here statistics and surveys seem to be the sole basis for the forecasts. Perhaps the authors' thought the original work was too dry, or perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on a winner with a quick and dirty follow-up.

When I first read this book in 1996, I was quite impressed by it, and believed that all the trends would come true. Hindisight ten years later shows that the book was actually quite prescient on many points. For example, the book correctly predicts the resurgence of nationalism in various parts of the world as the Cold War ended and the USSR broke up. Another predicted trend is the privatization of many social services in the US and other countries.Other predictions, like the Asian takeover of the world economy, has not occurred. Specifically, the financial crises of the last half of the 1990s essentially eliminated fifteen years of profit, property price increases, and economic growth in Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. But all in all, still a good book, and a good reference source for economic data for the late 1980s and early 1990s. As futurist books come, this is one of the better ones to come out in the past several decades as the author uses a wealth of statistical information from numerous fields and sources to justify his claims."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten new directions for the 1990's","review":"I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with a good many of the reviews written on here about this book. I first read this book in the mid 90's and am in the process of re-reading it today, and to a great degree many of the chapters are indeed still relevant. The strongest chapter in the book has to do with the rise of women in leadership positions. This was very forward looking in 1990 when it was written. At that particular time, there was only one female U.S. senator (Nancy Kassebaum), today there are 13 (including two each in California and Maine).Admittedly, there are some areas where the authors got it somewhat wrong. For example, the renaissence in the arts has not occurred at the expense of sports to the degree that the authors had thought it would. And the age of Nanotechnology has not been as progressive as they predicted. However, these are trivial points in an otherwise fine collection."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten new directions for the 1990's","review":"The authors missed the point of the book, which should have been to forecast the future socio-economic trends, and not their personal desire. They barely mentioned the way technology started to shape the new century, and they were so focused on Europe being at peace for almost 50 years that totally forgot there were other countries with enough forces to create worldwire conflict (terrorism, oil interests, territorial struggle, ethnical issues, etc).My most honest advice is: don't bother, and don't waste your time, unless you simply want to see how much they failed at what they intended to do. The writing is too simplistic and barely factual, and there's no serious authoring or editing effort behind this &quot;book&quot;."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten new directions for the 1990's","review":"Guess what word does not appear in this book?

One trend missed apparently: the rise of terrorism. This goes hand in hand with the fall of communism, because now there's a new bad kid on the block: move over communism, center stage Jihadists. The reprise of fundamentalism was noted in the book, and the turn to the political right, and the concurrent diminution of the &quot;welfare state.&quot; Naisbitt et al. wrote about &quot;no more wars.&quot; They should have read Lorenz, &quot;On Aggression,&quot; before saying all that. War may be inevitable, if aggression is instinctual, but war doesn't have to be always destructive: extreme sports, war games, ritual matches (presidents playing chess?) could do it.

FANTASTIC book!"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Flatpicker's Guide to Jamming","review":"Carl Yaffey, of Columbus, Ohio, has been playing guitar, mandolin, banjo, and bass since the 1960s. His old-time and bluegrass bands have included One Riot One Ranger, Five Guys Named Moe, Timbre Wolves, Pit Bull String Band, and Turkey in the Straw. Three books in his player's guides to jamming cover guitar, banjo and mandolin.The 23-page flatpicker's guide claims to show you what you need to know to sit in on a hot jam session. Well, it doesn't really go that far. What the beginner gets from this book is really some very basic information about which chords to play and when. The accompanying CD contains nine tunes performed at a typical jam session. The songs are Hot Corn, Cold Corn, Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms, Nine Pound Hammer, John Henry, Two Little Boys, Columbus Stockade Blues, Down the Road, Little Maggie, John Hardy. The music is on the left channel with dialog about the tunes such as the name, the key, and the chord progression on the right.We are seeing some very basic instructional material produced for the bluegrass music newcomer since the late-2000 release of the movie \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" There's apparently a market for such items since bluegrass has a very participatory community and fan base. When compared with the general population, bluegrass consumers were found to be more than twice as likely to play an instrument. So Yaffey's series would certainly be helpful to someone with an instrument just getting acquainted with the genre and wanting to jam along. I was happy to see Yaffey cover some essential information about how jam sessions work (some rules for jamming) and how to act in a session (jam etiquette). He also offers some tips for playing and practicing chords.

TomBrakefield's photographs are beautiful, capturing the awesome beauty of various tigers. One especially nice thing about the book is the photos are back-to-back and the calendar pages are back-to-back so you can write in your appointments, dates, etc without damaging the picture.I'd recommend this highly for those folks out there that like tigers and want a great desk calendar."},{"Title":"Raincoast Chronicles Fourth Five (No. IV)","review":"Raincoast Chronicles Fourth Five, Collector's Edition IV is a hardcover compilation of issues sixteen to twenty of \\"Raincoast Chronicles\\", a magazine begun in 1972 with the publishers' express intent \\"to put BC character on the record\\". Stories, poems, articles, drawings and black-and-white photographs of British Columbia daily life, livelihoods and culture, as well as recounting moments from history. Raincoast Chronicles Fourth Five allows the reader to feel the hardships and triumphs of BC men and women from the pioneer era to the modern day, and resonates with a tenacity of character and human spirit. Also highly recommended are the compilations of previous issues: Raincoast Chronicles First Five, Raincost Chronicles Six/Ten, and Raincoast Chronicles Eleven Up."},{"Title":"The Arab Balance of Power (Contemporary Issues in the Middle East)","review":"I recently read this book for a paper i had to write for a class dealing with the Middle East. Alan R. Taylor goes into great depth about the history of power in the Middle East. The book with the origins of the Arab system and ends with the dilemma of the Arabs fighting over land and natural boundaries. The book is a little outdated but still has a lot of great information about the early shifting of power in the Middle East. I'd would recommend this book to anyone interested in the government and politics aspect of the Middle East."},{"Title":"Richelieu (A Studio book)","review":"To understand the motivation for a highly regarded New York attorney, and a successful novelist, to contribute this volume to the Richelieu lore, you have to know the author. He is as comfortable reading and writing in French as he is his native English. His research for this book would have been based on the original French language documents, and that research would have been an act of love. His deep affection for France, and for the man who is most responsible for the creation of the French nation, is apparent throughout the book. Nowhere, however is it as clearly stated as in his description of the all-or-nothing showdown which Richelieu has with King Louis XIII's wife and queen, Marie de Medici. Known as \\"The Day of Dupes,\\" this confrontation between Richelieu and Marie preserved the foundations of what became the modern nation-state of France. On the side of Marie was the inertia of centuries of feudalism, personified by the rebellious nobles and the clergy, with Marie's full support. On the other side, was one man. Auchincloss writes, \\"Behind the weeping cardinal, on the other hand, was simply France, France as we conceive of her to this day, ordered, disciplined, beautiful - the nation where pleasure is an art and glory a duty.\\" These are the words of a man with the most profound respect and affection for a country not his own. It is this affection that inspired the author to create this excellent book about the man who, despite the disadvantages of birth, ill health, and a weak sovereign as his sponsor, gave France its heart and soul.It is a lavishly illustrated book, and the reader will henceforth always recognize Cardinal Richelieu at any chance encounter. And we will also recognize King Louis XIII, Marie de Medici, and their key contemporaries who alternately assisted or retarded France's unsteady march toward modernity.But it was Pope Urban VIII who had the last word, \\"If there is a God, the Cardinal de Richelieu will have much to answer for; if not...well, he had a successful life.\\""},{"Title":"Richelieu (A Studio book)","review":"This was the first book I read on Richelieu, and these days I look through it and think \\"hmm, it's got 'novelist' written all over it\\". It is really not much more than a coffee table book, not to be compared with serious works by the likes of Tapie or Church. It was published in 1972, and unlike some books on the Cardinal, has dated rather badly. (The most annoying part for me is its homophobic undertones when writing about Louis XIII). The best part of the book is the lavish illustrations, some of which are engravings rarely reproduced. They are the main reason to buy it. (But again, take note: Charles, comte de Soissons, pictured as \\"one of Richelieu's persistent enemies\\" in fact died in 1612, long before Richelieu played any role in government. This is the sort of error which lowers the book's value.) As I said, not a serious book, and not one to form your opinions from, but the pictures are interesting... if you ignore the captions."},{"Title":"Shadowed Stranger","review":"This is the romance novel that I can credit with starting my love for the genre. I probably read this when I was 10 or 11, and while I now know that the story is cliched, I wanted to move to England and marry my own &quot;Shadowed Stranger.&quot; Rick Howarth suddenly moved into Robyn Castle's neighborhood and they were thrown together in every possible way. Of course, we all know that Rick and Robyn will get together (simply because Harlequin does not make sad novels), however the story of how they get together is very sweet. I would have to say that my favorite scenes occured after Rick's little accident. There is always something very sweet about a heroine nursing the hero back to health or good spirits. I always love Harlequin because they include little extras such as the British spelling of certain words. One of the things that I liked best about this novel was the extra tidbits that were included about the history of the bicycle."},{"Title":"Muffins, Scones & Coffeecakes","review":"For anyone who wants to try baking that delicious chocolate cake from scratch without having to resort to Duncan Hines cake mixes, this book is ideal.

This book shows how to make them EXACTLY THE SAME I tasted them up there!!! And every recipe is clearly explained and easy and fast (very important for me, a working woman with two children!). I've got a new oven and my husband said that with this book he has to be jealous, because I spend all my time in my new kitchen! But I simply can't stop! Try page 26! Very tasty!! Thanks Mrs Wilson!

Like other books in this series, it is an easy read of clear, practical discussion, which is based on natural interpretation of Scripture. This book also communicates a strong understanding of the original, historical audience and setting.I used this book as part of a set of four primary references as I spent almost a year teaching through the Book of Acts. I used a Bible outline (Wilkenson/Boa) for maps and dates, a \\"handbook\\" to Acts (Couch) for notes regarding background elements, an expository commentary (Gaebelein) and this book (Acts by Ger) to help understand the content as I worked through the Book at a pace of about of chapter a week. For me, used in conjuction with the others, this reference was very helpful - not so much for providing unique material, but in a comfortable and useful way which kept me picking it up each week.Why 4 stars instead of 5?The book lacks two key elements. First, there is not a single map in the book. While everyone has maps for the journeys of Paul, etc. This book would have benefited enormously by including small in-line maps throughout the commentary at appropriate places.Secondly - I think the author missed a great opportunity to highlight the times and places of the orignal authorships of the Pauline epistles. This could have been a simple table at the end, or could be in the form of call-out notes in each appropriate chapter. This is not to say that the author excludes this topic, he just doesn't address it independantly from his general commentary. Based on the fact that the Book of Acts IS the historic context for these epistles, this is a shortcoming.Overall, this is a great commentary on Acts!"},{"Title":"The Book of Acts: Witnesses to the World (21st Century Biblical Commentary Series)","review":"This is the third in the Twenty-First Century Biblical Commentary series that I have purchased.Just like the other two (Romans and 1 Corinthians), this is a great book.

Ger, a Jewish Christian, brings some insights into Jewish tradition and lifestyle of which I was previously unfamiliar.

For example, he lets us know what happened to the high priest that gave the Apostle Paul such a difficult time."},{"Title":"Wax and Gold Tradition and Innovation in Ethiopian Culture","review":"Its stunning to me that someone would comment that this book is academic and that it is not useful because it is 32 years old. I guess we should throw out all literature from before the year 2000. Kant, Simmel, Marx, Kierkagard, Plato, the Constitution, Tolstoy, useless I suppose. Friend, if you are looking for a trashy novel you are in the wrong section of the bookstore.

The strategy is so good and basic, it works too well. It makes you take all the emotion out of gambling and stick to the numbers. I failed so many times, because I would start with the strategy and then I would start drinking or I would reach the goal too soon and would keep gambling and lose everything. I would kick myself for not sticking to the plan. Over the last few years, I have worked to keep focus. I have read both positive and negative reviews about this book. The fact of the matter is that blackjack is one of the best odds in Vegas second only to craps. In blackjack, if you play by the basic betting strategy and have a betting plan, you can do well.

The strategy charts in \\"Hidden Secrets\\" are all based on Atlantic City, whereas \\"Quick Guide\\" contains separate charts for Vegas and Northern NV as well, since rules differ slightly in all three places. Also, despite Pappadopoulos' claim to be based on mathematical formulas, he still relies on alot of old gambler superstitions, like spotting a \\"hot\\" table, and placing bets according to whether or not you are on a \\"winning streak\\". I find his advice on how much to place risky as well. I've been practicing using this method, but limiting my bets to no more than four times the minimum (Cardoza's advice), and in 100 games I am up 104%.Pass on \\"Blackjack's Hidden Secrets\\" (both I and II), invest in a few Cardoza books instead."},{"Title":"Blackjack's Hidden Secrets, Win Without Counting (New & Expanded Edition)","review":"I have played blackjack many times before reading this book.

That's hard. This book shows any easy way to win with money management. That's easy.\\"People, you can NOT win with money management. One of the reasons Blackjack is hard to figure out is that you can NOT learn from experience how to play. You would have to play millions and millions of hands, and record the results of every single hand, before you could figure out the correct plays.This game has already been figured out with mathematical proofs and huge computer simulations. I quickly perused this book in the book store (took about 15 seconds, because it's about 12 pages long (exaggerating just a bit)), and it's got plenty of errors, while the basic strategy tables are found in ANY book, folks! Don't waste your time. If you really want to win, you have to eithera) find a game with such good rules (almost always a single deck game) that you have an advantage even playing basic strategy. Good luck finding such a game.b) count cards, or at least pay attention to the cards.For the easiest approach (and a very good explanation of basic strategy), try Cardoza's book WINNING CASINO BLACKJACKFOR THE NON-COUNTER. Even here, you must find a single deck game with good rules, that gets you close to even with basic strategy, and then watch for a lot of low cards coming out early, and then betting higher. Otherwise, you have to count. For an easy counting system that is mathematically proven, try Knockout Blackjack.Folks, if you want to believe you can win by some betting progression or money management system, please do. The casinos will stay open with your business. Just because you won does not mean you have an advantage. You are still playing a losing game. Blackjack has HUGE variations in winnings, so your experience PROVES NOTHING. Great players can lose in the short term, and lousy players can win in the short term. \\"Short term\\" means less than about 10,000 hands, or about 1,000 hours of playing (that's playing for 4 hours a day, 5 days a week for about a year.)

You've had a \\"losing\\" session when you've lost 100% of your stake. Therefore you can end up with a higher percentage of winning sessions than losing sessions, and still end up in the hole. George doesn't say he sees a consistent 78% monetary return on all his blackjack investments, just that he sees a 78% \\"win average.\\" Plus, no betting system can gain or lose you money. How does one hand know what was wagered on the last hand?However, I rate this book highly because of the many positive lessons it teaches about gambling in general. Although George's system cannot guarantee you will win money, it is still a system which requires discipline, proper playing technique, and a strict betting and money management formula. He emphasizes fundamentals that are paramount to having a successful ride at any gaming table: do not drink, don't bet hunches or feelings, bring only a certain amount (depending on table limits) to each table, walk when you win or lose a certain amount. If you can follow all George's disciplines, you will definitely increase your chances of winning. Hopefully you will have a good time as well and not walk away broke, having spent five times as much as you intended in half an hour.George is an Everyman, and his short book is a good read. From reading his books and hearing him on talk shows, I think he has a great personality, and very much speaks to the average or casual gambler like you and me. He is a good writer for someone who is not a professional writer. The handy strategy cards can be simply torn out and taken to the blackjack table with you. If you're planning a trip to Vegas or Atlantic City, it can be a fun system to try. Who knows, you may get lucky!"},{"Title":"Blackjack's Hidden Secrets, Win Without Counting (New & Expanded Edition)","review":"I've only read the sample pages on amazon but I have recently ordered it. The sample pages that mention money management is actually what I have been practicing before discovering this book. When playing blackjack I usually start out with twenty $5.00 chips($100). On an average session I can gain 10 chips (10 X $5 = $50). On a good session I can gain 20 chips(20 X $5 = $100). Going beyond that is pretty hard and I start losing or going up and down. On a really bad session I can gain only 4 chips (4 X $5 = $20). Usually on bad sessions I go negative before I can make it all back and get ahead by a little. But I usually do get ahead eventually. After seeing this pattern I figured the only way I can make more money is to start betting larger chips regularly such $25 chips. So my usual $50 gains become $250 and my miniscule $20 gains become $100. I go to the casino once or twice a week and make a couple of hundred dollars within the first half hour inside the casino. Then I leave. If I stay any longer I end up losing my gains and getting stressed out. I'm not breaking the casino or getting filthy rich. However, I've turned the casino into my own modest free ATM machine on a weekly basis."},{"Title":"Blackjack's Hidden Secrets, Win Without Counting (New & Expanded Edition)","review":"I met George at a conference and only picked up his book to be polite.

I was considering learning to card count but after reading this book I am relieved that I found an alternative. I've only used the system in simulation but it does make sense and seems to be a sound progressive betting system.

One quick warning: when you buy this book follow the system EXACTLY. Do not freelance and try and do stuff on your own.

It appears on at least one list of \\"classics\\", but I suppose that might be because it's so typical of a genre of best-sellers that continues to this day. Even the prose has the flat, descriptive tone of the sort of popular writing that has to tell you exactly what the characters are thinking: \\"It was an anguish she did not know how to endure... what was more important right then than anything else was to find out whether her suspicions were true or false...\\" etc. This being published in 1946, there's no actual sex, like there undoubtedly would be now -- we have to content ourselves with our heroine being carried, trembling, in the brawny arms of her neighbor, etc. There's literally a bodice ripped at one point, although with much more anger than lust. (The other difference is that such a story nowadays would be very unlikely to be frank about the racial relations on the plantation. There's no glossing over attitudes or censorship of language. The author obviously thinks that the black characters, in the words of the modern cousin, \\"have certain fundamental rights\\", but his depiction of them is just as clich&eacute;ed as everything else here, and necessarily racist.) The theme of the decline and fall of old power in the south is a familiar one too. However, it may well have originated tropes that now seem very familiar. That still doesn't make it a good book."},{"Title":"The process of cultural competence in the delivery of healthcare services: A culturally competent model of care","review":"Book was in great shape.Great info on author and her cultural competence.

Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman.

I totally agree with a previous review that says the numerous errors will make you question everything. It is an interesting read, but it is just unforgiveable that even obvious things like plot points in films, casting, etc. are wrong. I noticed a few and let them go, thinking that I must be the one that was wrong. As it went on I thought wait a minute and started checking things out only to find that, in fact, they were wrong! Bad enough that the writer is irresponsible, but wasn't there a fact checker around?! As the other poster stated, when facts that are obvious and easily checked are wrong, it kind of ruins the readers experience and does have you wonder what else might be false. Inexcuseable."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"The factual errors are inexcusable (though common in publishing these days) and the writing is too impersonal, but this is easily the best journalistic book I've read on the films I care about since Spike, Mike, Slackers and Dykes. This isn't simply a work of gossip and juicy anecdotes--it's a penetrating look into how these personal, edgy, and strange films emerged from an increasingly corporate, profit-driven Hollywood. Waxman's book is a testament to creativity, but it's also troubling that these great films were apparently made in spite of the system--not because of it. The book raises the question, Has Hollywood learned to recognize and nurture this talent, or has it decided such filmmakers need to be resisted and then taken steps to stifle them?We're always hearing what actors and directors have to say in the press, but I was almost more grateful to get the studio executives' points of view here, just to better understand the origin of these films. The book is inspiring and troubling and helps to explain why so much Hollywood filmmaking seems tamed since that watershed year of 1999."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"a little too much gossip, not enough real info.great stories about the behind-the-scenes, of getting these films made, of the struggles of the directors.but too much about parents, girlfriends, small stuff.so 2 1/2 stars actually, for the interesting stories."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"I have to reiterate the comments of some other readers who have reviewed this book. The backstories of these directors and the films they made are incredibly interesting, especially if you're a fan of independent film. But the book is so sloppy in places, it's incredibly distracting and it seriously affects Waxman's credibility.Aside from glaring factual errors, the narrative jumps around so much that it can be hard to follow. On a large scale, the story jumps from one production to another, and then back again. Theoretically this is because it's organized in chronological order, but within each section about a particular film she is just as likely to backtrack to a producer's childhood, or jump ahead a few years to the audience reaction when the film is screened at Cannes. If you're going to do that, why not just stick with one film and tell the story all the way through? On a smaller scale, many paragraphs seem to be written in a stream-of-consciousness style so that it's impossible to tell if each sentence has anything to do with the one before or after it.It definitely seems like the book wasn't well copyedited when you read a paragraph about \\"Being John Malkovich\\" that begins with the sentence, \\"Without even reading the script, New Line's De Luca made the deal, though it took weeks to make things final\\" and two sentences later says, \\"De Luca felt he couldn't take on 'Malkovich,' too, though he loved the script.\\" So... did he read the script or not?She explains how David O. Russell never wanted George Clooney to star in \\"Three Kings,\\" and mentions that Clooney sent him a note saying that he understood how his work in Batman and E.R. might not make him seem like the best candidate, but he had recently done Soderbergh's \\"Out of Sight\\" (which he clearly hoped would be his indi-film calling card). This didn't seem to help his case any, but Waxman doesn't bother to explain (until much, much later in the book) that Russell and Soderbergh already had a long-standing feud at that point. This seems like an important and relevant detail.Later, on the subject of this feud, she says \\"The Clooney matter had much broader repercussions, and not just for the director and the movie star...\\" These \\"broader repercussions\\" amount to:1. Spike Jonze was offended that Russell wasn't invited to join Soderbergh's filmmaker's club (though Jonze himself was).2. Mark Wahlberg was caused discomfort.Seems like a pretty dramatic statement that isn't backed up at all.These may seem like nitpicky things, but the cumulative effect of such lazy storytelling is that the reader starts to question how trustworthy some of the accounts are. Clearly there are contradictory points of view in some of the conflicts described in the book. And, in several cases, I'm not sure I trust that Waxman got the \\"real story.\\" Read it if you're a fan of these 6 filmmakers and their work, but take it with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"This book has interesting tidbits. nothing that really surprises-of course there are some directors who become (...) when they hit it big (Tarentino), of course some remain loyal to the people that understood and helped them when they were 'nothing' (Soderbergh), and some who are just, let's see how shall i put this, eccentric. but it is interesting to read. Choppy, however, and skips from director to director. It annoyed me that once i was really getting into the story of one person, she would rip me away and focus on someone else-mid story.

These are still some of the most influential directors working today and it's good to get some background on how they got their first big movies made. If you're interested in the movie business, don't hesitate. Good book to read to learn about dealmaking and how crucial scripts still are in the Hollywood/indie pipeline.

All fought the Hollywood machine. A machine that retreats from creativity, controversy and originality, always seeking the middle ground and, ultimately (all they really care about), profit. I was by no means an admirer of all the films here, but so fascinating are the accounts of their journey from idea to screen that I watched the films again in order to view them in a new light. This is an exhaustively researched and entertaining book. It's also full of juicy anecdotes and gossip (probably scurrilous). I think anyone interested in films and their tortuous journey to the cinema will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"I found myself unable to put \\"Rebels...\\" down due to both the interesting biographies of the featured directors - and the fun tidbits surrounding their movies (Warren Beatty wanted the Dirk Diggler role in 'Boogie Nights'? Who'd thunk it?)But the one thing that was most captivating was the bratty, backstabbing and often egomaniacal behavior of the featured people.The description of Tarantino's opportunistic, social climbing ascent to fame and stardom was delicious. However, considering his movies' oeuvre - not all that surprising. Both P.T. Anderson and David Russell came across as tyrannical bullies and considering their movies seem prone to creative and intellectual masturbation. Fincher seems clueless to why Fight Club might seem 'intense'. Soderbergh comes across as a director who has settled in bourgeoisie respectability. And Jonze makes one wonder if he is a stunted man-child who will never get pass his adolescence.I think Waxman was trying to state that its these flaws that make them fantastic filmmakers. However, I left the book feeling that these men were fantastic filmmakers *despite* their often despicable qualities (i.e., Russell's behavior towards George Clooney during the making of \\"Three Kings\\" seems utterly reprehensible and mean-spirited).This is a fun glimpse into the 'new' Hollywood system - but is ultimately another Hollywood fluff piece. My lasting impressions of these guys were that many of them were opportunistic jerks who developed a staggering sense of entitlement as their fame grew. Waxman could have done a more thorough job in being an unbiased reporter."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"REBELS ON THE BACKLOT is a loose history of 1990s cinema, told by following the careers of six directors. Quite a bit of the eraly part of the book is devoted to the PULP FICTION-created cult of Quentin Tarantino, and QT lovers (or haters) will find some information that I didn't know about regarding Tarantino's upbringing - not as white trash as has been supposed. Waxman makes a pretty good case that Tarantino's greatest gift is as a synthesizer of other people's ideas, not a creator - and that Roger Avary deserves some credit for PULP FICTION.The other directors are Soderbergh, David O. Russell, Spike Jonze, David Fincher, and Paul Thomas Anderson. Although Waxman clearly admires all of them, she also reports unflinchingly on their egos, bad personal relationships, on set battles, and conflicts w/ studio execs, who are almost unanimously depicted as Luddites.The biggest flaw in the book is the overhyping of David Fincher and FIGHT CLUB. Waxman almost goes into convulsions trying to find profundity in this nonsense, in which young men beat each other up and commit acts of terror for no reason. There's nothing in Fincher's other work to suggest he deserves this kind of company. (Alexander Payne, for one, has achieved much greater artistic heights in the same number of films.)I recommend this book for movie fans whose subscription to PREMIERE just isnt enough...."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"This book is a must for every movie lover,buy it now before it's too late;A."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"If you felt a little let down by Peter Biskind's recent look at 90's indie film, \\"Down & Dirty Pictures,\\" this juicier but also more personal book might be closer to what you were hoping to find there.Instead of focusing primarily on Sundance and Miramax, Waxman focuses on the six men responsible for some of the biggest movies of the past decade: Quentin Tarantino (\\"Pulp Fiction\\"), P.T. Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights,\\" \\"Magnolia\\"), Spike Jonze (\\"Being John Malkovich\\"), David O. Russell (\\"Three Kings\\"), David Fincher (\\"Fight Club\\") and Steven Soderbergh (\\"Traffic\\").They're a mixed bag of personalities and Waxman tells their stories with detail and relish, and also touches on other interesting filmmakers such as Wes Anderson, Roger Avary, Charlie Kaufman, Alexander Payne and others (though some are conspicuously absent -- Spike Lee and especially Richard Linklater, who isn't even mentioned).It's hard to miss with a collection of stories like this: Tarantino's rise to power; Hackman cursing Wes Anderson on the set of \\"Tenenbaums\\"; Avary's attempts to buy a famous French film studio; Russell headbutting George Clooney on the set of \\"Kings\\" and P.T. Anderson admitting that \\"Magnolia\\" was probably too long.\\"Rebels\\" (very deliberately) rises to the same sordid, \\"print the legend\\" heights as Biskind's \\"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls.\\" But it also suffers from some of the same weaknesses - occasionally questionable accounts; some poor copy editing and more than a few awkward sentences that feel like they were written the Sunday night before the term paper was due: \\"Traffic\\" screenwriter Stephen Gaghan's high school drug problems are introduced twice in three pages; Wes Anderson's debut was \\"Bottle Rocket\\" not \\"Rushmore\\"; and what can one say about lines such as, \\"Soderbergh questioned his own questioning\\" and \\"The director kept the obituary about his father printed in the local paper framed in his office in Los Angeles\\" ? Waxman also has a strange storytelling habit of explaining the results of a situation, then backtracking once or twice to tell the circumstances that led to the results.Nevertheless, it is absolutely impossible to deny the appeal of this book, and it was equally impossible for me to put the damn thing down for the past week."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"This book is a very quick read, but unfortunately shows all the signs of having been an equally quick write. I have never before stopped in the middle of reading a book to pull out a pen and write down all the glaring factual errors and omissions that I saw, but Rebels on the Backlot forced me to do just that. I see that many of the most egregious errors have already been noted by others, but here is some of what I wrote down as I read:On page 231: \\"Texas preppie-geek Wes Anderson had made his first movie, Rushmore, based on his experience in prep school, with an utter unknown in the lead, Jason Schwartzman.\\" Wes Anderson's first film, of course, was Bottle Rocket, not Rushmore. And, yes, Jason Schwartzman had no previous film acting experience before Rushmore, but was hardly an \\"utter unknown\\" to the film world- his family (both the Schwartzmans and the Coppolas) had done a little bit of film work in their past, both in front of and behind the cameras. Even Waxman might have recognized the mother of this \\"utter unknown\\" from all of the Rocky movies.Traffic star Erika Christensen is identified on page 321 as \\"Erika Christenssen\\" and, most howlingly, on page 101 as \\"Julia Stiles.\\" Yes, the two actresses do look alike, but that's just absurd.On page 266, describing the marketing of Fight Club, Waxman writes that \\"Fincher insisted the studio hire a cutting-edge advertising firm, Weiden + Kennedy, based in Seattle.\\" Weiden + Kennedy are based in Portland, home of Nike, their biggest client. They have offices in Portland, New York, Amsterdam, London, Tokyo and Shanghai, but not in Seattle.On page 194, Waxman describes the profound influence of Aimee Mann's music in the creation of Magnolia, both at the script level, and in the soundtrack. On the very next page, she describes how writer/director PT Anderson got the idea for the film's rain of frogs, as well as its historical prologue, from \\"musician and friend Michael Penn, Sean's brother.\\" Perhaps Waxman is the only person left in the film or music worlds who doesn't know that, besides being Sean's brother, Michael Penn is also Aimee Mann's husband.This is a sloppy, poorly researched, poorly written, and incredibly poorly edited book. Reading it, one can easily imagine Waxman's interview subjects seeing how little she knew about her subject, and simply making up absurd lies just to see if she would ever catch them. Spike Jonze tells her that location scouting was conducted to find an actual half-floor building for Being John Malkovich, and she repeats this claim on page 205. I'm sure Jonze is enjoying a good laugh over that.If you are looking for well-written book on this subject matter, I'd stick with Peter Biskind."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"I tore through this book, enjoying it thoroughly. It's a quick entertaining read, and seems to reveal a lot about the craziness of trying to manage a directing career.However, there's also a really shoddy first-draft feel to the book. The irony is Waxman is a New York Times writer, and the book is filled with passages that would embarrass the paper. Example- \\"The question of Tarantino's ability to write without the support of a partner became a real question over the years.\\" Oy vey!The factual errors also make me wonder how much of these stories I can take at face value. She briefly mentions Wes Anderson's first film, Bottle Rocket, early in the book and then later calls Rushmore his first film. She misidentifies Erika Christensen as Julia Stiles in Traffic. She reports that David Russell used a real corpse for a shot of a bullet entering a body in Three Kings when it's been reported widely that this story was a misunderstanding of a joke that Russell had made and a dummy was actually used. These are just the ones that I (not a film industry person) caught.That said, I recommend it to wannabe film directors as a fun set of stories that may inspire you or may revulse you to the business altogether."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"Ahhh the 90's...Going to the movies became a whole other experience. Just as directors of the 70's and 80's left their mark as groundbreaking filmmakers with new and innovative techniques, so these rebels of the 90's gave us new experiences on the big screen to awe us to delight. Although there were many that could be talked about for decades to come, \\"Rebels On The Backlot\\" by Sharon Waxman tells us the story of six of the most rebellious of the bunch. Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, David O. Russell, David Fincher, and Spike Jonze. What a group!The subtitle of this book, 'Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered Hollywood Studio System' is the focus of this book, and the story is not always pretty. Waxman goes into some depth into the making of such films as \\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Traffic\\", \\"Three Kings\\", \\"Fight Club\\", and \\"Being John Malkovich\\" among some others by these now famous, but once struggling filmmakers. They were not always likable lads, often more like spoiled and thoughtless prima donnas alienating many around them, but one thing is for sure, they were geniuses with great visions, visions they wanted done their own way not chopped and edited or rewritten by those who thought they knew better. The big studios often scoffed at their ideas, saying audiences just couldn't handle the films these artists envisioned, the independents caught on but couldn't always afford the high price it would take to create their masterpieces. So these six were often left to deal with the big studios, which was often like a war.Waxman begins at the beginning. Each director's life from childhood and the effects it had on their filmmaking is delved into. Their early beginnings in the industry,trying to get a script noticed, attending the film festivals, the fights on and off the set(Russsell and George Clooney actually duked it out on the set of Three Kings),the frustration of not being understood,the long road to seeing their visions completed(often asking for things in their contracts that the biggest of the big didn't even get, like final cut), their rise to fame and reactions from both the critics and the filmgoers. She leaves no stone unturned, often revealing some very personal information, all very well researched and with the cooperation of the directors themselves, and including lots of great quotes as well.It's a well written, extremely detailed, and enthralling read for fans. Told in chronological order so that each chapter records the progress of each film. Also included is a picture section, a P.S. section with insights, interviews and even letters written to Russell by George Clooney, and a nice time line. Although there were a couple of times where I felt the Author injected her own very opinionated points - and not always agreeing, it kind of put me off at first - I still found this book to be a fascinating page-turner and a must read for fans and aspiring filmmakers alike. One that gives a truly up close, behind the scenes, and very personal look at some of our favorites that moved filmmaking into the 21st century.4.5 stars for making me want to view these films all over again(and again)...enjoy the read...Lauriealso recommended:Kieslowski on KieslowskiHitchcock's Notebooks: An Authorized And Illustrated Look Inside The Creative Mind Of Alfred Hitchcock"},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"I was going to write exactly what reviewer Howard Lamp has already commented on, so I encourage anyone planning on reading this book to consider Lamp's comments.

Overall, what makes this book fascinating are the delicious details of personal lives and the on-the-set antics. However, what fail to shine is the actual writing. Waxman labors the half-baked introduction with lists of the directors' biographical landmarks that fail to make a point. The conclusion also feels rushed and bases her views of success on merely financial results (She dismisses \\"Punch-Drunk Love\\" as a failure for P.T. Anderson. He won Best Director for the film at both Cannes and Toronto Film Festivals.)I would still contest that this is a great read for those who have been captivated by these \\"rebels\\" and their extraordinary films, but if one is looking for any depth of analysis or crafted prose, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"Waxman's book makes one wonder if she really writes for the New York Times. Any amateur film geek who's actually seen the films she writes about will find multiple errors, strange, unsupported statements, poorly written and edited sentences, and could probably write a better book themselves in short order.That said, Waxman's interviews do give her a point of view on her six main subjects which is interesting, and some of the gossip is compelling. Waxman badly needs an editor. She thanks one in the acknowledgments, so apparently someone held the title, but no one much seems to have performed the function. Had a good editor got hold of this manuscript, it might seem less like it was written in crayon in a big hurry. Which is a shame, because it does have its moments, a few revelations, and a driving narrative. But too much takes away from these strengths to recommend the book highly."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"The 1970's are now considered to be a Golden Age for American cinema, a time when directors, screenwriters and other creative personal called the shots on how studio films were made, a time when films challenged audiences, acutely reflected the darkness of modern culture. Hollywood's \\"auteur-era\\" imploded at the tail end of the decade, with its rebels - Scorsese, Coppola, Altman et al - lost in a black hole of cocaine synapse-burn, egoism and uncontrolled expenditure, a disastrous event-horizon that peaked with the 1980 release of *Heaven's Gate*, Michael Cimino's wildly over-budgeted mess that nearly bankrupted United Artists. This, along with the advent of the summer blockbuster as epitomized by *Jaws* and *Star Wars*, signaled a bottom-line-oriented revolution in the studio system. Number-crunching executives emerged to regain the mantel of power, dictating the method of the entertainment business as profit-margin first, artistic expression a distant second. The calculated blockbusters of the 1980's reflect this transition, the emphasis on big stars, big explosions, feel-good vibes and/or tear-jerking manipulation dominating nearly all of the flagship titles of the decade.Eventually this profit-margin formula became stale, toothless in its demographic estimations; and beneath the stagnant scum-crust of the \\"mainstream\\" there began to thrive a new, angry generation of filmmakers, auteur-initiates pushing the envelope. These films reveled in violence, sex, drugs and other taboo subjects; they criticized the mentality of capitalist America, exposing the contradictions and deep hypocrisies fueling its consumer-ethic. Typically, the same studio executives responsible for propagating the 80's attitudes instantly sought to benefit from this disruptive new voice of cinema, making superstars of the auteur, capturing their caustic visions on celluloid while keeping the keys of ~carte blanche~ firmly above reach: the lessons of the 1970's had not been forgotten.Susan Waxman's chronicles this turbulent era in *Rebels on the Backlot,* a tale of six maverick directors gleefully subverting the Hollywood paradigm, of the suits struggling to maintain the blockbuster status-quo, and of the resultant art that came about, by hook or by crook. In tone and style this book resembles Peter Biskind's classic deconstruction of 70's cinema, *Easy Riders, Raging Bulls*, consisting of equal part in-depth examination and tabloid-level gossip.The directors:TARANTINO: Pop-culture synthesist, blatant plagiarist, hygienically challenged: cinema autodidact Quentin Tarantino kick-started the new renaissance with his 1994 neo-noir masterpiece *Pulp Fiction.* A man-child motor-mouth and television addict, Tarantino combined his instincts for drama - and his serial theft of other people's work - to shape the gunshot heard around the world, muffled (barely) between Biblical quotes and McDonalds musings. Quick to drop his old collaborators for the star-shine of Hollywood, Tarantino then regressed into a pot-hazed period of unproductive ambivalence, secretly tormented by his inability to come up with a single original idea.SODERBERGH: The Yin to Tarantino's Yang, Steven Soderbergh exploded with 1989's *sex, lies and videotape*, then spent many years afterward on a downward trajectory, yearning for the free-wheeling spirit of the independent sphere, making a host of obtuse 'personal' films before successfully combining his independent streak with the mainstream in 1999's drug war epic *Traffic*. Soderbergh's story is that of the truly gifted auteur trapped in a cycle of self-sabotage, emerging victorious only after a long, bitter fight.PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON: Porn-lover PTA put his heart (and everything else) on the screen with his San Fernando Valley epics *Boogie Nights* and *Magnolia.* Evoking comparisons to Scorsese and Altman, Anderson certainly had something to say - the fact that he took so long to say it, and did so in such a bombastic way, had New Line executives tearing out their hair trying to make his message palatable to a wide audience. No luck so far...O'RUSSEL: Idiosyncratic and controlling, David O'Russel mined darkly comical material from the trauma of his wealthy east-coast childhood, and eventually came to make Hollywood's first critical take on the Gulf War with *Three Kings.* Tensions flared between the director and George Clooney, climaxing with fisticuffs in the Arizona desert and a long-standing feud after the film's release. Waxman obviously thinks highly of O'Russel's talent (more than I do, certainly), and a large part of the book is devoted to this socially-inept director.FINCHER: The heart of darkness over at Fox Studios, David Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk's *Fight Club* and, for once in a blue moon, managed to make a film superior to the source text. A biting satire of consumerism/fascism, *Fight Club* was despised by Fox's suits and marketers and infuriated conservative honcho Rupert Murdoch; the press, just as clueless as to the film's intentions, savaged it upon release. And yet *Fight Club* is now one of the great DVD successes, having found its audience among the young and restless whom identify with Tyler Durden, or at least with what he had to say...JONZE: A self-taught upstart from MTV, Spike Jonze slipped through the cracks to make one of Hollywood's strangest marquee flicks: the brilliant *Being John Malcovitz*, a film that would have never seen the light of day if not for the perseverance of Jonze and a studio hand-over.As in *Easy Riders, Raging Bulls*, Waxman ends her thesis with a recount of \\"where are they now\\" - a conclusion marred by the fact that this book is only five years down the road from the peak-year of 1999. In fact, *Rebels on the Backlot* is basically a much slighter version of that chronicle: for though it is written and sequenced in the same way, the narrow focus hardly paints an adequate picture of 90's cinema. Spike Lee, Richard Linkleter and Peter Jackson are hardly mentioned; Gus Van Zant is totally missing; the Wachoski Bros, Wes Anderson, David Aronofsky, Sam Mendes and Alexander Payne and are given sketchy-at-best accounts. Several of the above listed created far more influential and brain-bending films, IMO, than O'Russel or PTA. Still, for an amusing, gossipy, and occasionally insightful glimpse into the better cinema of mid-to-late 90's, *Rebels on the Backlot* serves its purpose."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"Like several of the other reviewers I initially enjoyed the book and felt comfortable that the stories were coming from a credible reliable source. Unfortunately the further I got into the book the more errors and implausible scenrios that came up the more I felt like I might be reading something that was 50% fiction. What a shame - once the book lost its credability I quickly lost interest and skim read a lot of pages. If I want to read made up stories about directors I'll just do it myself. As a New Zealander the worst offense for me was when she said that Peter Jackson is an AUSTRALIAN! Thats about the same as me saying that Speilberg is Canadian - hey, the countries are right next to each other so who cares. The book then stated that somebody landed at Auckland airport and promptly hired a car to drive 800 miles to Wellington to talk to Peter Jackson...thats very dramatic but very odd - most people would have walked the 5 minutes to the domestic terminal and flown to Wellington which takes about an hour.This book rates about the same as an E-Hollywood true story which is all the more shameful if the author really did do as much research as she claims."},{"Title":"Rebels on the Backlot : Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Hollywood Studio System","review":"I find it intriguing that New York Times reporter Sharon Waxman has pulled together a book on six film directors who seem to have little in common save for the fact that they were able to break through the hermetically sealed Hollywood studio system in the nineties to forge identities as visionary filmmakers. I suppose that's reason enough to group them together, though when one thinks of their predecessors in the seventies - Spielberg, Coppola, Scorsese - this new brethren hardly seems to be at the same level of creative invention or business savvy, nor does one sense the professional bonding that propelled this former group toward critical and popular success. And unfortunately, Waxman chooses to bypass the current crop of minority filmmakers who have emerged in the past decade, such as Spike Lee, John Singleton, Robert Rodriguez and Alfonso Cuaron, whom one can argue have made as significant an impact as these six auteurs have had.The six filmmakers under Waxman's microscope are Quentin Tarantino (\\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Kill Bill - Parts 1 and 2\\"), Paul Thomas Anderson (\\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Magnolia\\"), David Fincher (\\"Fight Club\\"), David O. Russell (\\"Flirting With Disaster\\", \\"Three Kings\\"), Spike Jonze (\\"Being John Malkovich\\", \\"Adaptation\\") and Steven Soderbergh (\\"Traffic\\", \\"Erin Brockovich\\"). Waxman takes an investigative reporter's scalpel to provide a sometimes scathing expose of the directors' intersecting private and professional lives, but it's saved from total tabloid fodder by providing an incisive and rather disheartening look at Hollywood movie deal-making replete with cleverly maneuvered betrayals. What emerges are six men who, despite their obvious talent, come out as ego-driven, socially inept mercenaries, all willing to compromise their integrity and even their families to secure the deal that will make them the center of the independent film scene. Top of the heap despite his spotty box office track record is Tarantino, a one-time video-rental clerk who parlayed his in-depth film trivia knowledge of film into highly stylized films, the most successful being 1994's \\"Pulp Fiction\\", probably the touchstone for all other independent films that followed its over $100 million domestic take. But the others, despite critical acclaim and awards, have fared less well financially, proving that these men are not really the rebels who have conquered Hollywood, just survivors of a system that will always view artistic statement as a lower priority than profitability, a major accomplishment in itself if you are to believe the author. If you have any doubts about Hollywood's preoccupation for the bottom line, I suggest you read James Stewart's just released \\"Disney War\\" to get validation of the points Waxman raises here.To her credit, she gives highly detailed, often compelling accounts of how some of their major films were made, in particular, \\"Boogie Nights\\", \\"Three Kings\\", \\"Being John Malkovich,\\" and most interestingly, \\"Fight Club\\", a movie so desultory to the studio heads that it brought down Fox's Bill Mechanic, who green lighted the film in spite of performing the same task with a little film called \\"Titanic\\". In addition to interviews with the six, who are understandably wary of Waxman's book, she has spoken with plenty of colleagues and relations to paint an awfully bleak portrait of the current Hollywood scene. One is left to wonder if the business will allow them any sort of longevity comparable to their predecessors despite their talent."},{"Title":"The Unknown Chekhov: Stories and Other Writings","review":"Tchekov's unknown works are no more hidden.Astonishing although non-regular..."},{"Title":"Journal of Roman Archeology, 1994","review":"These books are published and edited by John H.

Characters aware of the narrator, unicorns that despisevirgins and walking plants inhabit a universe that redifines the entire art ofwriting fantasy. Simon Hawke's Reluctant Sorcerer is a must read book for anyonewho loves fantasy and still finds room for a sense of humor."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Sorcerer","review":"What happens when a genius invents a time machine? Well, if the genius is Dr. Marvin Brewster, he goes on a trip through time, space, and alternate universes, to end up in a world that looks suspiciously like a fantasy novel. Of course, he is a genius, and so he doesn't recognize this at first. But his time machine was smashed, and he needs to get back. To do this, he needs to find the other time machine he built and sent off, the one that accidentally didn't come back. Along the way he meets a leprechaun and a bunch of greedy bandits, accidentally convinces them he's a wizard, and proceeds to introduce the concept of modern manufacturing to the sleepy little village of Brigand's Roost.The book is short, but a heck of a lot of fun. It is most definitely not a story that takes itself seriously. In fact, that's an understatement; The Reluctant Sorcerer is just plain good comedy and a good parody of fantasy novels in general. Hawke doesn't try for subtle humor or dry wit. Everything is written for maximum guffaws. And, shockingly, it works. Oh, there are some missed shots here and there, but they're surprisingly rare.Everything is overdone, brought to the extreme limits in the name of comedy. Brewster is the most absent-minded professor ever to walk the planet. His fianc&eacute;e is drop-dead gorgeous. The villain... well, readers don't see much of him in this volume; the story here is concerned mostly with getting Brewster established in the setting, and the setting established in the readers' minds. That way there will be a train available for Hawke to gleefully derail later on, and something for the good guys to protect. But the bad guy is fairly well demonstrated to be a very powerful sorcerer, indeed. And, meanwhile, nearly everybody has personality quirks that distinguish them and make them memorable, usually in a humorous fashion.What makes all this excess a good thing, rather than something trite and tried, is the excellent explanations Hawke adds. They make it clear just how absent-minded Doc is, for example, by giving ludicrous examples of him forgetting to dress himself or buy groceries, and describing him as half little boy and half rumpled bed. And, trust me, Hawke puts it much better than I just did. The villain is so powerful that in his few scenes he can hear the narrator, which makes for some very unique narration.The last great thing is that the author breaks the fourth wall with gleeful abandon. In the opening scene he has to pause for breath after describing just how beautiful Doc's fianc&eacute;e is, and there are many other times when the text addresses the reader directly. This is, to say the least, uncommon, and it gets even odder when we find that the villain is so powerful that in his few scenes he can hear the narrator, which irks them both to no end. It makes for some very unique narration, to say the least.This is a fast-paced book, but it's very short. It's good for a few hours of brain candy, nothing more. But the most important question of any comedy is, \\"Is it actually funny?\\" And The Reluctant Sorcerer most definitely passes that test. With flying colors, fireworks, and a marching band, to boot."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Sorcerer","review":"There is no indication that this is only half a novel, but that's what it is. Usually a series of novels has a large story with each book being it's own standalone story. This book is not a standalone. It ends abruptly with a cliffhanger, there is no attempt at closure, there is only an attempt to get you to buy the next book. I wouldn't mind if they made that clear up front, so I wouldn't have wasted my money.Also having the narrator interacting with the story is a bit tacky, but that's just me, maybe some people like that."},{"Title":"The Reluctant Sorcerer","review":"The book is one of the best i have ever read..

Especially revealing about ship breaking, an activity about which I was totally ignorant until I read this book. But after all, what is there to do with ships that have reached the end of their useful life?"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Curious about the real world of the sea and what can happen when you lose sight of land? This fabulous book explains it all and more. Currently the most dangerous sea lanes appear to be in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, but Mr.Langewiesche describes the dangers of the South China Sea and the Java Sea as well. It's not just the sea faring pirates that cause the misery and heart break, those corporate ones sitting behind oaken desks cause just as much or more grief.As always, greed kills and absolute greed kills even more; from abused registries, and bogus inspections to the cost cutting methods of recycling mamouth tankers, it's a corrupt and evil world of business and government run amuck and William Langewiesche gets to the bottom of it. It's a great and fascinating read."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The Outlaw Sea is about the immensity of the sea and the essential lawlessness of commercial shipping. There is far more ocean than there is land. \\"International Waters\\" are just that - not part of any country.The book consists of four main sections. The first is about freighters in general, the law of the sea and the story of the Kristal, a 550-ft all-purpose tanker, registered in Malta, owned in Italy and crewed by Croatians, Pakistanis and Spaniards. The ship had grown decrepit, but the owners kept on sailing it. It broke into two sections off the coast of Spain, dumping a cargo of molasses and drowning a third of its crew.The second is about pirates who captured a freighter. It shows how dangerous the shipping lanes are even today, and how hard it is to catch the criminals.The third part is about the loss of a huge Estonian car ferry, in the Baltic on its way to Sweden. Storm waves broke open the car deck. Passengers played in the bars until the ship began to sag to starboard. There are stories of death and survival. A lot of it is about the investigation of the loss, and international politics.The last part is about ship-breaking, focusing on a beach in India. The author watched a ship deliberately driven onto the beach, then cut to pieces by low-paid workers. The author describes the work of Greenpeace and others to promote skip-breaking that is not so bad for the environment, or so unhealthy for the workers.The book is well-written throughout. There's plenty of detail, but it never gets boring."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Wm. Langewiesche is a favorite author of mine, having produced several previous delicious reading experiences for me, most recently his book about the Sahara. He is a skillful wordsmith and travel raconteur with an eye for detail almost as keen as Paul Theroux's. So I leapt at the chance to read The Outlaw Sea, thinking it would help explain the piracy issue in great detail. (How is it the world's strongest navies can't stop a few Somalis in outboards from highjacking yachts in 2008?) Instead, while devoting a chapter on South China sea pirates, he devotes two very lengthy chapters on the Baltic Sea ferry disaster that was so regrettable but presented by the author in such detail one leaves the book thinking he has seen every rivet and chain link of the Estonia, the ship that sunk--this book. I'll continue to seek out Mr. Langewiesche's work, but with skepticism and a little less enthusiasm."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The sea covers most of the world's surface area. Most people have a passing knowledge of the sea's history, of pirates and hidden treasure. Langewiesche's book brings up the modern issues the sea presents to the world and the different countries that border it.The overarching theme of the book is that no matter what humans do, the sea cannot be tamed. Langewiesche's book is divided into different vignettes that inform the reader of the many different issues of the sea. All are impeccably researched and written. The most interesting to me was the final section on shipbreaking. I had no idea of the work and loss of human life involved in reducing a ship to scrap.This is a great book to give to anyone who wants to know more about how the sea figures into our modern existence."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Sea stories have long been among my favorite subjects.

After reading this, I do not see myself riding any cruise boats. I'm going by airplane!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"As other have noted, it is a little disjointed as it is a compilation of some previously published material. However, as someone with little knowledge about how the economics of ocean transport works, I found it insightful, infuriating and interesting.The blurbs on the cover make you think it is about \\"corporate malfeasance\\" and while the author does seem to want more control over the oceans, it is a bit more nuanced than that. He does recognize the impossibility of regulating such a vast expanse. Even on the environmental issue of how to control the business of scrapping ships (which is done these days on heavily polluted beaches in India) he is not willing to make the scrappers the villains. Rather, he notes that while the work is dangerous and not environmentally friendly, to simply outlaw the practice would increase insurance fraud and put a large number of poor people out of work.Langewiesche does not provide much in the way of answers, but the book is a good place perhaps to start the conversation."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"As others have said, basically a number of more or less independent articles pasted together with the running theme of the law-free ocean and the global marketplace.

Nothing super-spectacular, but a great way to pass the time looking through a window into a world most of us are quite unfamiliar with."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The Outlaw Sea is a great read. Langewiesche takes the reader on a tour of the perils afflicting modern maritime shipping and attempts to trace the origins of those perils through the attempts of nations to establish some kind of regulatory control over the seas. While I'm sure Langewiesche meant his book to be, at least in part, a cautionary tale about the Wild West nature of much of the world's oceans (underscored by his caveats regarding how easy it would be for terrorists to sail explosives into the US aboard a cargo ship), the book better serves the reader as an introduction to the world of maritime shipping and its laws (or lack thereof). Langewiesche doesn't try to make his work exhaustive - it's actually too brief, I think, owing in part to its readability and the fascinating nature of the source material - but rather he tackles three episodes in modern shipping history and describes them within his greater framework. I gave the book four stars because I found the subject interesting enough that I wanted more details, more stories - The Outlaw Sea was, to be frank, just too damned little of a good thing."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The Outlaw Sea is a short book with a wide-scope, including the history of international regulatory efforts, the problem of piracy, the practical effects of international regulations, terrorism, the sinking and investigation of the Estonia ferry accident in 1994, and the global \`ship-breaking' industry and its malcontents. William Langewiesche is a talented writer and his description of what it was like to be on the sinking Estonia is breath-taking. Here is an excerpt:\\"Survival that night was a very tight race, and savagely simple. People who started out early and moved fast had some chance of winning. People who started late or hesitated for any reason had no chance at all. Action paid. Contemplation did not. The mere act of getting dressed was enough to condemn people to death, and although many who escaped to the water succumbed to the cold, most of the winners endured the ordeal simply naked or in their underwear. In any event, the survivors all seem to have grasped the nature of this race, the first stage of which involved getting to the Deck 7 promenade without delay. There was no God to turn to for mercy. There was no government to provide order. Civilization was ancient history. Europe was a faint and faraway place. Inside the ship, as the heel (angle) increased, even the most primitive social organization, the human chain, crumbled apart. Love only slowed people down. A pitiless clock was running. The ocean was completely in control.\\"\`Love only slowed people down...' This is one powerful sentence. One reads about ferry accidents from time-to-time in the paper, and then moves quickly to the sports section. The name of the ship and country fades quickly from memory. But after reading Langewiesche's chapter on the Estonia, you will have a new appreciation of how hellish these accidents are for passenger and crew.The book bogs down in places - in particular, in the detailed forensic analysis on the investigation of the Estonia disaster and some other places. Langewiesche heroically describes the detective work but it would have been useful to include a few photographs - or even some drawings - to help people without a nautical background understand various parts of the ship. The chapters are self-contained, and overall the book has the feel of several unrelated long articles put together for a book. There should have been an afterword to bring the disparate topics all together.At the end of the book, Langewiesche offers up another excellent chapter on the beaches in Southeast Asia (India in particular) where ships go to die, and be scrapped. The danger, slave-wages, and ecological catastrophes are brought to life in a very visual, compelling way. This chapter, and the minute-by-minute account of the Estonia disaster, spotlight the author's talent at bringing extraordinary scenes to your mind's eye."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book is a compilation of previously published materials that lack a unifying theme.

Each section examines a different concern, from vessels that should never be sent out to sea because of age and their decrepit condition to modern day pirates; Langewiesche brings each problem to the forefront but merely scratches the surface of each. Rather than focus on a particular type of maritime calamity, Langewiesche decides to give the reader a cursory examination of the many problems that are out on the oceans. The final section, an examination of the shipbreaking industry on the beach at Alang, India gives the reader a taste of what could have been. A fascinating look at a little known and dangerous venture which Langewiesche handles with compassion and aplomb that makes you realize that any one of these concerns would have been a valid problem to examine in greater detail. As it stands THE OUTLAW SEA serves merely as brief glance at many serious problems, but not giving any one problem the investigation it deserves. Couple this with the occasional example of purple prose:\\"There was no God to turn to for mercy. There was no government to provide order....Love only slowed people down. A pitiless clock was running. The ocean was completely in control.\\"And you end up with a book that was a great idea but lacks the intensity of research to make it anything more than a curiosity."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"An exceptional investigation written with great descriptive detail and empathy."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Description of this book did not live up to the actual writing. not very memorable"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"the writer knows how to write but one and one half short story(maybe for esquire?) for an expensive book, means short-changing the readerhalf this mini- book is exciting, but the other half reads like a boring report from some boring committee"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The author is a good writer, BUT, where in this piece of nonfiction are the index, bibliography, and footnotes.

But freedom at sea can lead to such manifestations as piracy, and not just in the swashbuckling days of yore; it could also lead to corporate irresponsibility and malfeasance. William Langewiesche's _The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime_ (North Point Press) collects and expands upon his previous magazine articles on this theme. All of us are dependent upon international trade, and few of us understand how it works or in what ways it is working badly or dangerously, unless we hear about a capsizing or an oil spill. There are a lot more of those than we hear about, and a lot more crime on the sea than even governments acknowledge. Langewiesche's book is a fine way for lubbers to get to know how traditional maritime freedom is endangering them.Before World War II, ships were customarily built in a country, were registered in that country, flew the flag of that country, and sailed for the profit of businessmen in that country. Ironically, the United States began the current anarchical system in a pretense of neutrality during the pre-Pearl Harbor war, registering in Panama ships bringing needed supplies to Britain. The practice became widespread in the succeeding decades, with many ships now sailing under &quot;flags of convenience.&quot; They might be registered in countries that have no navy and even no coastline, and the countries involved can get relatively small fees, which are actually almost pure profit. The countries don't pursue administrative niceties like taxes, labor laws, safety inspections, and so on, and the corporations which own the ships don't mind avoiding such things, either. Among the cases described here are a too-old ship (with full inspection documents) broken in half by stormy seas. Pirates can take advantage of the lax laws by making a ship disappear; capture, repaint, rename, and reflag the vessel, and it vanishes from the seas. Seas are big, ships leave no tracks, and patrol ships and aircraft can see only a tiny percentage of any hunting ground. Policing the oceans from such attacks is not now possible.The longest episode in the book tells of the _Estonia_, a giant luxury ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994, with a loss of 852 of 989 passengers and crew. A victim of faulty design, poor maintenance, or even a bomb (none of the extensive investigations afterwards has satisfied everyone), the narrative here of well-chosen characters trying to escape from the swiftly-sinking ship is fast and terrifying. The book ends with a part of the maritime business that few people ever consider: what happens to the worn-out ships? Salvaging used to be a thriving business in our country and others; reclaiming the metal and reusing it was good for profits and good for the environment. However, showing the same pattern of lack of regulation and reduction of the job to the cheapest source available, shipwrecking has gone to places like India, where poorly equipped and poorly paid workers are glad of the job, even if it means almost constant danger from the unplanned movement of heavy objects or the inhalation of poisons. The shipping industry, Langewiesche writes, is &quot;not exactly a criminal industry, but it is an amoral and stubbornly anarchic one.&quot; This is a deeply disturbing book, written with cool detachment. Technology and international organizations have not made improvements in the way the vital global trade is conducted. Profits are more important than anything, the sea promises the freest of trading, no one seems to be learning from the lessons described here, and no one should expect these dangerous situations to be changed anytime soon."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"William Langewiesche is an excellent journalist, and his writing is hard-hitting and unvarnished. This book is a great read, but its scope is quite narrow. Unusually, I would have enjoyed it more had it been twice as long. Readers are treated to in depth profiles of a few incidents that support the book's thesis, but the separate threads are not satisfactorily tied together. The stories he does tell, however, are gripping and frightening. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I picked up William Langewiesche's The Outlaw Sea after having read his compelling series of articles for the Atlantic Monthly that make the bulk of this book. The tale of modern-day piracy he explored in the Atlantic was amazing and something I had never thought possible before. In this book, Langewiesche expands on his thesis: that the sea is immune to the laws of man.With the probing, empathic narrative of an investigative journalist, Langewiesche shows how modern shipping is almost completely unregulated, run by shadowy figures, and accountable to no one. The result is piracy on the open seas, official corruption, and environmental havoc. For instance, he explains how when megaships reach the end of their lives, they are rammed onto the coast of India where workers take apart the polluted hulls for scrap. Langewiesche notes the devastation to beach and the unsafe conditions the workers face. But he also points out that workers are far better off for having these jobs than they otherwise would be working at best in subsistence agriculture. He also poignantly recounts the stories of the Kristal and the Estonia, victims of legal unaccountability and the cold viciousness of the sea.Langewiesche outlines the bureaucratic impotence, and sometimes obstructionism, of the international system regulating the oceans, but he offers no recommendations or solutions. It seems he doesn't think there is a solution, and he is sadly convincing in this pessimistic outlook.If you read Langewiesche's Atlantic articles, you have already read much of this book, but it might be still worth getting it if only for the final chapter on India. Otherwise, this book is wonderfully written and very interesting."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I came to this book as a person who spent over a dozen years in the ocean shipping industry. For me, William Langewische's The Outlaw Sea is a fascinating look at a subject with which I am intimately familiar.Langewiesche's gloomy, albeit accurate, portrayal of life at sea for the \`low-end' portion of the ocean shipping industry is marked by excellent research and even better writing. The book has some of the hallmarks of the best fiction. It unfolds dramatically and keeps the reader's attention. Langewiesche's portrayal of the passenger ferry Estonia is heartbreaking. The author pulls no punches. At one point, Langewiesche discusses the horror of the loss of 852 lives on the Estonia, notes the worldwide outpouring of grief (particularly in Northern Europe) but then pauses to mention that ferry accidents such as this are a routine way of life in the third world (in Asia and Africa in particular) and yet these accidents barely attract our attention. The terse, matter-of-fact fashion in which Langewiesche imparts this information has a greater impact than it would have if set out in a dogmatic fashion.Last, Langewiesche turns his eye to the ship breaking business in India. Vessels that have reached the end of their useful life (and as set out in the book a ship owner's definition of useful life is far longer than may be prudent for safe operation) are run onto beaches in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan where they are dismantled in a manner that endangers everyone involved. Life for these ship breakers is nasty, brutal and short. Langewiesche's portrayal is so well written that one can almost smell the befouled air that lingers over the work area. The author also sets out the political confrontation between the ship breakers and Greenpeace. It is an excellent overview of the conflict that arises between first-world political activists and third world throngs struggling to make a life for their families.I only take two minor issues with the author. First, in discussing the sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain, I think the author did not pay sufficient attention to the horrible decision of the Spanish government to deny safe harbor to the damaged vessel. It is mentioned in passing. The decision to force the Prestige out to sea, before she was damaged beyond repair and before there was a major loss of oil, into stormy and unsafe seas was as much, if not more, to blame for the environmental disaster that followed as the general condition of the vessel before the accident. The actions of the Spanish government in this regard were reprehensible. Second, Langewiesche makes much (rightfully) of the negative impact on foreign flag registration, specifically flags of convenience, in terms of vessel safety, poorly trained seamen, etc. However, it would have been useful to point out as a counterbalance the fact that the Exxon Valdez, the vessel responsible for one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history, was a U.S. flag vessel, built to U.S. flag standards, fully accountable to all U.S. maritime laws and regulations with U.S. officers and crew.This book is well written, informative, and interesting, whether or not one happens to be in this business. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in first rate, well researched and written non fiction."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This is one scary book. Pirates, murders, breakups at sea, the loss of the huge ferry Estonia with many innocent passengers and so on. It is well written, but it is sort of like if somebody wrote a book about all the people who had been horribly murdered in public restrooms. I don't know how many of those there have been in the last 100 years, but let's say there were fifty and suppose I were to gruesomely describe ten of those. After reading that book you'd never be able to walk into the men's (or ladies) room again without getting the shudders. You'd likely be buying adult Huggies to avoid the whole possiblity of having to take the chance.Well, that's the way this book is. It's scary, and after you read it you will have to think twice about getting within a hundred miles of any large body of water. That's you, of course. Now I live on an island, so what the hell am I supposed to do."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The book as a whole provides a detailed and engaging sense of the lawlessness and disorder that takes place on the ocean and near its coasts. The stories are based on current events and add a great deal of drama to his investigative writing. Its the kind of book I was eager to discuss with my friends and family after reading each chapter. As an ocean lover, but not a frequent sailor, its a great find and gives a rarely told perspective on what actually takes place with the world's ships. The threats of terrorism, piracy, the difficulties of scrapping ships, and the contrast of the way governments try to regulate the ocean with the practical realities of the ocean are thought provoking and fascinating. What a pleasure this book was!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I come from a commercial fishing background and I'm always looking for a good sea story. This one happens to be true, terrifyingly so. It inspired the plot for my first thriller, Blindfold Game."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"\\"The Outlaw Sea\\" is a real page-turner about a wild, lawless frontier that affects all of us. With so much of the raw materials of civilization shipped by freighter -- machinery, vehicles, food, oil -- you'd think shipping would be more closely regulated and better protected. But the author shows us how it's in the best interests of those who own the shipping lanes for there NOT to be much regulation. Ships, crews, and cargos are all, ultimately, expendable. It's more profitable to lose a ship here and there than for the navies and marine authorities of the world to get serious about policing the waves. Hence, we learn that inspections, even in ports where the authorities are relatively uncorrupt (which is rare) mean very little, and piracy is surprisingly common in the 21st century. You also get a look at the lives of mercantile sailors, which are not at all romantic or glamorous, but dirty, dangerous, grueling, and underpaid.You'll be particularly appalled at how easily a ship can be taken, and the possibilities for terrorism are chilling as well...This isn't really a single book, though, or at least it doesn't read like one. It's a collection of several different marine-related themes. First, Langewiesche talks about the law of the sea, or rather, the lack thereof. He covers regulation, naval enforcement, the shadowy, mutable world of ship owners and registries, and why the world depends on shipping and why shipping remains \\"a world of freedom, chaos, and crime.\\"Then he spends a huge chunk of the book talking about a single disaster, the sinking of the ferry Estonia. This is practically a minute-by-minute account, complete with descriptions of crew and passengers, survivors and non-survivors, and plenty of after-the-fact analysis of exactly what went wrong and the legal and political ramifications.Finally, Langewiesche describes the ship-breaking yards in India, \\"hell on Earth,\\" where the poorest of the poor break apart condemned vessels for low pay, crawling over shards of metal and puddles of toxic waste.This book started out as several different essays, but each one holds up on its own, and the complete work is an eye-opening expose of both life on the high seas and the people who work to keep the world's shipping afloat."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I enjoyed this book. I'm fascinated by the subject, and the writing is terrific. I was a bit disappointed with it, though, for reasons shared by many other reviewers.Of the 240 pages in the book, the first hundred pages move along well. So do the last forty. From page 100-200, though, the book bogs down in the story of the sinking of the Estonia. While it is a gripping story, it should have been limited to 50 pages-- the book's title is not \\"The Sinking of the Estonia\\". Issues like piracy and shipping finance could have healthily stretched the book to 300 pages total.Overall, though, I would recommend it-- with the proviso that it is not a full treatment of it's subject."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Langewiesche is a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and has written several books that combine hard reportage with the more ephemeral qualities of a travel writer. In this case, Langewiesche's goal is to illustrate with bold examples the ungovernability of the sea. For him, this is a law of nature, but it is also a consequence of the inability of the laws of men to deal with sea's expanses. His case studies, if you will, are many, but he spends the most time on a few memorable stories: the modern day pirate attack on the Alondra Rainbow in 1999; the post-apocalyptic landscape of the world's most heavily trafficked ship graveyard, the beaches of Alang, India; and the wreck of the ferry Estonia on which at least 852 people died when it went down in a storm in the Baltic Sea in 1994. The subtext in all of these stories is that the tragedies contained within are, at least partly, a result of the inability of modern societies to govern the seas. The greater implication, as Langewiesche makes clear, is that such lawlessness and statelessness make the sea fertile for the operations of lawless, stateless terrorists. The sea is everywhere, but it is nowhere in the eyes of the law. These timely concerns, and Langewiesche's sturdy prose elevate a book of riveting tales of disasters at sea to a book of more weighty importance."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"How do you pronounce this man's name? He has a wonderful way with words and I think I am going to subscribe to the Atlantic Monthly just so I can read more of his writing. This book was really scary at times and I couldn't put it down. What I like most about the author is that he doesn't try to force his opinions on the readers. Or if he does, it isn't obtrusive. His description at the end of the shipbreaking yards in India are incredible and I would love to see pictures of them."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I could not put this book down. Some other reviewers' complaints (too many digressions, no central theme) are precisely what I like about it. Great stuff!Best of all, Langewiesche is a great writer. It was a joy to read poetic sentences that were not poetic for their own sake. Langewiesche is a good writer who does not write good sentences merely to dazzle but to actually tell us something.If this book is any indication, I'm ordering all of his others and look forward to reading them."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Some of the reviewers here have detailed some of the books short comings and I do not think they are being unfair. My review is going to be focus only on the positive, because I not only like this author, but I found the book extremely enjoyable. The author talks to us about some different aspects of the current state of ocean shipping across the world. He covers areas from recent ship wreaks to pirate encounters. He even takes the reader into the world of ship breaking where these massive structures are reduced to bite sized bits of steel. The book is fast paced and very interesting.Sure, over half of the book focuses on one car ferry sinking in the mid 90's, but unless you are familiar with the story, it is interesting. I kept wondering how he got so much detail. He covers the sinking in his somewhat off center style. If you read his other book about the World Trade Center then you can appreciate it. He just looks at the world with a bit of sly humor and an odd angle that makes his story telling that much more interesting.Overall I thought the book was great. The stories were interesting and somewhat unique. He injected just the right amount of drama and detail to make the reader hurry to the next page. Could he have spent more time on any one section of the book, probably, but he is writing as much for the readers enjoyment as to tell a story. You may want this or that changed with the book, but at the end of the day it is an interesting, and at times exciting, book that is well written."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The author is a journalist, and journalists are taught to keep the reader's attention by emphasizing individual stories and human interest over statistics, which are supposedly boring. Consequently, this book is a collection of stories. We get to spend time with both pirates and their victims in the Indian Ocean, with the crews of sinking, leaky oil tankers, with the investigators of the sinking of an Estonian ferry, and with shipbreakers on India's Alang beach.The stories are great, but they only paint details and leave the reader hungry for the broad picture. There are few figures. We read, for example, that there are over 40,000 large ships on the ocean, but there is no indication of where this estimate comes from. If the ocean is chaos, how do we know how many ships are on it? Also, what does \\"large\\" mean? I would have been interested in a table of number of ships by size category, with the source of the data and the author's assessment of their accuracy. We also hear that most ships sail under flags of convenience. Here also, a table of how many ships fly each flag would have given some perspective.The same pattern is repeated throughout the book. All the issues are presented through anecdotes, without quantification. For example, we know there is piracy, but not how prevalent it is. At the end of the book, we don't know whether the stories are examples of trends with broad significance or are simply random isolated cases.The book is also lacking in cross-referencing information. There is only a table of contents with cryptic titles like \\"The wave makers\\" and no index. The only maps are in the lining of the cover, and there are no photographs, which leaves too much to the imagination."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book is on several different aspects of the merchant shipping industry. As a former radio officer on U.S. merchant tankers from 1986 to 1995, I can say that lawlessness, choas and crime does not apply much to U.S. vessels. For other vessels that are flags of convenience the story is a lot different. I think this author is a gifted writer. The story about the hijacking of the Alondra Rainbow in the Malacca Straits is very interesting and suspenseful. There can't be a better read about the sinking of the Ro/Ro vessel Estonia than this book offers. It is worth the price of purchase just for this narrative alone. The end of the book about the shipbreaking operations in India is also interesting. The author seems to get into a bit of the \\"save the environment\\" mentality though, and since I think this guy lives in Seattle he may be a bit of an environmental nut. But that doesn't come out much in the book except a little towards the end. His overall theme is the damage that is caused to merchant vessels (and the people riding them) due to the carlessness or fraud of owners, governments, ship's agents, maritime authorities, etc.A very good book about merchant ships disasters (from both natural and human causes) is Disasters at Sea by Richard Cahill.The merchant shipping industry is not quite as outlaw as the author might suggest. The only way any nation could put a nuke on a merchant vessel and light it off in one of our ports would be to do it in complete secrecy. I believe it would have to be done by a state government. Having a more in depth knowledge of how the merchant shipping industry works, I don't think a bunch of terrorist could pull this off. The author does not go into this possible scenario, but given the theme of the book it does perhaps lead people to draw their own conclusions about that.Very good work by the author on this book though. I highly recommend it. His research is excellent and his style of writing is also excellent. That combination makes for a very good read IMHO."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"William Langewiesche's excellent book could be seen on one level as just a collection of harrowing, if wonderfully told, sea stories. His writing, though vivid, is understated, and can carry as much freight, so to speak, in one or two sentences as some writers pack into entire chapter. Even on this very superficial level, this title is both riveting and educational reading.But the deeper you look into this book, the more there is to uncover. I read it during a news cycle when the threat of seaborne terrorism was once again in the headlines, and it was certainly sobering to see how easily how ships in what one reviewer called &quot;the low end of the shipping industry&quot; can disappear almost at will from the world's seas, reappearing in a new port under a new name, with a new flag, and even a markedly different appearance.Langewiesche's key point is that the world's oceans are an outlaw place -- in the original, literal definition of the word as outside the protection, or even beyond the reach, of law. On the high seas, each ship is to one or another degree, its own absolute monarchy. When crimes occur, where can they be prosecuted -- by whom, and under what authority? (The author's recounting of one memorable case where modern-day pirates were tried in India vividly proves his point.)Law and order tend to break down at sea in another way too, as the sinking of the ferry Estonia made clear. As the ferry began to go under, Langewiesche tells how civilization fell apart under the simple and inescapable need for survival. Thieves even began stealing jewelry right off the bodies of their fellow passengers -- before themselves going to their deaths, appropriately enough. Disaster at sea provides horrible proof for how thin the veneer of civilized society really is.All this makes for disturbing, as well as fascinating, reading. The ocean is a world where few humans feel at home, and fewer would be able to survive for any length of time if their comfortable ships or planes were taken away from them. William Langewiesche's understated but revealing book illuminates this world in a way that should replace romantic visions with a very sobering understanding of reality."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book reads like 4 or 5 magazine articles that have been strung together. Each article focuses on some sort of disaster involving the seas - ship wreck due to poor maintenance, oil spills, piracy, loss of life in a ferry disaster, and the tear down of old ships in India. There is a loose connection between the articles involving chaos on the seas (mostly man-made but also natural) but not enough to make a coherent book. There are times when I wondered what the point of the book was besides passing on some interesting stories. In the introduction he tried to link the \\"outlaw sea\\" to terrorism but that idea was never reintroduced or significantly supported.Read the book if you're interested in maritime disasters. Skip the chapters that don't interest you because none are essential. (The Estonia ferry disaster drags on for over a hundred pages and I was never quite sure what the point was.)"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"With the news exploding about pirates off the Somali coast, it diverts the public's attention from the more threatening area of piracy in the Straits of Malacca and other nearby waters of southern Asia.Thankfully, this book exposes that nefarious world to us but it doesn't just stop there. The focus is on how our oceans are the last frontier where rules really have no effect at all. Issues such as shipbreaking (mainly seen by the Western world as something which happens exclusively in a certain part of India yet is exists all over the map), ship safety relating to inspections, safety standards and how the pressure to deliver cargoes in less than seaworthy ships leads to disasters also are brought to light.The only strange thing was the choice to devote close to 200 pages on the passenger ferry sinking of the Estonia in the Baltic Sea. After I read the one chapter, I thought the author wrapped up the topic well but he went on for another chapter which I eventually gave up on as I felt it was too much detail on ground already covered."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I acquired Mr. Langewiesche's book based, I believe, on a flattering review in The Economist and that by itself shows that the book has to be good. It is definitely and it provides an enjoyable read. Mr. Langewiesche's mastery of his subject is obvious. He has done a lot of research and commendably interviewed lots of people before writing an authoritative and serious book, yet without pomposity or any pretense to save the world.His premise is most enjoyable: the more you regulate the High Seas - through international organizations or otherwise - the more messy and ungovernable they become ! Quite interesting indeed and probably required reading for bureaucrats, particularly those in Brussels purporting to regulate the minutiae of Europeans' lives.....The chapter on piracy is great, but the book was published in 2004 so the information is out of date as it could not include the new \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" environment in Somalia. Too bad because I am sure Mr. Langewiesche would have written some most enjoyable pages on that topic.This being said, the chapters devoted to the story of the Estonia - a ferry that sank in the Baltic in 1994 with considerable loss of life - are too long in my view. A horrible tragedy it was, for sure, and the characters trying to turn it into a conspiracy by the CIA and the like - some of them real crackpots - are amusing but after a while one understands the reasons for the ship's demise and the rest of the minutiae of the story loses interest.On the other hand, the final chapter dealing with the shipwrecking in industry in Gujarat is required reading for anyone with an interest in what actually happens to modern ships when they become so old that they cannot carry even the safest cargo, such as sugar molasses - the stuff will simply melt away in the sea if the pile of floating rust the ship has become just breaks up and sinks and who cares about the crew anyway....- and frankly the tale is quite frightening.A nice and interesting book it is. Do read it but remember that it was written some years ago and perhaps some of the details of the Erika story can be skipped."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I think a lot of people graded this low, not based on the books itself, but because they thought it would be something else. Either they thought it would be a story about pirates, etc, or they didn't agree with the authors more liberal ideas. One person even gave it 2 stars because it had no pictures! Can you believe that?Other than that, this book is excellent. I was shocked to read about many things that we never hear about, things that happen daily beyond any jurisdiction. It isn't very long, it doesn't go into a lot of detail on each subject. It is more of a broad introductory book into the world of shipping."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Despite complaints by certain other reviewers, I was overall quite completely satisfied by Langewiesche's treatment of the topic of global commericial shipping. No single author can write a work that will satisfy all readers. Among the questions he must ask as he composes: Where shall I focus? In how much detail? Shall I be dry and matter-of-fact, or zoom in on the human drama and tragedy?To me, Langewiesche strikes just the right balance. In this slim, compact book he covers the major bases: dilapidated freighters transporting hazardous cargoes, slipshod maintenance, the desperate lives/careers of their crews, nefarious \\"shell corporations\\" that exploit 'globalism' in the further fattening of their Swiss bank accounts, smuggling, piracy, and terrorism. A frightening and otherwise-uncommented fact stated in the book is that Osama Bin Laden himself controls (or did at time of publication) a \\"ghost fleet\\" of some 20+ freighters for the transport of jihadists and arms. Couple this with Langewiesche's portrayal of the inherent lawlessness of the global ocean and you have the makings of our next 9/11.The middle portion of the book (the two chapters \\"On a Captive Sea\\" pg. 101 to \\"The Ocean's Way\\" ends on page 195) chronicle the Estonia ferry disaster. Think \\"Titanic\\" meets \\"Poseiden Adventure\\". Langewiesche's shocking portrayal of the Estonia's passengers climbing for their lives in a capsizing ship is like nothing to be found anywhere else. He knows just how to zoom in on dire individual plights, then pan out to the political in-fighting of the investigation boards comprised of Estonian, Finnish, and Swedish officialdom. Add to this the incindiary workings of the third-party conspirationalists (namely one Jutta Rabe). Then throw in the German shipbuilder Meyer Werft -- desperate to defend their technical reputation -- making their own investigation in order to sully the offical one and thus shift blame to the Estonians and Swedes. This narrative ranks with the Challenger and Chernobyl episodes in terms of technical-versus-political drama.In his last chapter \\"On the Beach\\" Langewiesche exposes the reality of the commercial shipbreaking business, centered on India's Alang region. Certainly it will come as a revelation, as it did to me, to learn that each year some 700 commercial tankkers and freighters, each massing some 10,000 plus tons each, are cut up for scrap on this forlorn island of desperate third-world poverty. The author brings out the catastrophic environmental and human toll this \\"business\\" brings. As said by one Indian in the book (unnamed), \\"Would you rather die first of starvation or by pollution?\\" Some choice.All in all, one will either like or dislike this book as a matter of ideology. The reader can either view it as an indictment of our global capitalistic materialistic hedonistic \\"free-trade\\" society (as if), or as a paramount example of \\"creative destruction\\" and opportunistic exploitation of the underdeveloped world's cheap labor and throwaway material resources. I choose the former."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"In William Langewiesche's \\"The Outlaw Sea\\", we learn about the politics, or lack there of, in the oceans that dominate our world. This is not a book that looks at the mysteries of the ocean like giant squids, tidal waves, perfect storms, etc. This is a book about how big, usally unnamed and European, capitalist squeeze out every dime of profit they can from the tanker trade.Once his theme is established the books then braches off into three main problems of sea trafficking, the surprisly high number of still sinking vessels, modern pirates, and the enviromental problems associated with dismantling ships.It's a fasinating report, all be it a tad dry at times, condensed into a brief 239 pages."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Disappointed. Title is great, but content is lacking. Mostly an excruciating recap of some notable maritime tragedies rather than a discussion of the issues associated with governance of the seas, UNCLOS, inability of coastal states to manage their coastlines, flags of convenience, etc."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"I cant wait for the great wars of the sea. This book was a great read about the current state of the sea. Can't help but make me think its the place for me. Sound like a fun game of cat and mouse. I wounder what its like to be a repo man of the sea."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Considering that the subject matter of this book is shipwrecks, smuggling, castaways, piracy, and a host of other lurid ocean-related themes, I was surprised to find it on the tedious side.Langewiesche's basic strategy is to discuss shipwreck after shipwreck, and then investigate the seamy underworld of the shipping companies lurking behind the disasters, and the laws that have helped to engender the situation.But the book is poorly organized and Langewiesche gets distracted easily: for example, after going on and on about the wreck of the Estonia, he continues for a couple of dozen pages about the various conspiracy theories surrounding its sinking. Digressions like this are common.The book also has no logical beginning or ending, and I can't see why Langewiesche even divides the work into chapters. A glimpse at the titles of the chapters (e.g., \\"To the Ramparts,\\" \\"On a Captive Sea,\\" \\"The Ocean's Way\\") is enough to suggest that there is no progression of thought being realized in the book, and other than a general lament on the rough and shady nature of international shipping, the book ends up having little to offer.Certainly not in the way of entertainment!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The book should have been named \\" the Tragedy of Estonia\\".Langwiesche is an excellent contributor to the Atlantic monthly, unfortunately he seems to be under the impression that a book is simply a compilation of several articles strung together.You will hardly learn anything new from this book.Although he is an excellent writer he should really just sick to periodicals.See other 2 and 3 star reviews for more detail, they hit the nail on the head."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Hi , I can't review this book because I never received it ! All attempts to try to contact amazon failed .This sucks!"},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"While the cover blurbs on the book promise another \\"Prefect Storm\\" quality reading experience, it's a fine read, but it's not quite that good. The book is broken up into 3 sections, a pirate hijacking in the Asian seas, the Estonia ferry sinking in heavy seas, and the ship breaking beach at Alang, India. The pirate section is great. The ferry sinking less so because in explaining the political fallout, he goes over the same information multiple times. (Though I was shocked at the statistic he threw out that supposedly 20% of all Germans believe that the 9/11 World Trade Center attack was actually done by the United States against its own people.) The 3rd section about the ship breaking industry was the reason I'd picked up the book, but it spends most its space on the Greenpeace efforts to shut down Alang. The author admires Greenpeace more than I do. When during an interview with Greenpeace, he keeps asking what I think is a very interesting question and the Greenpeace representative keeps refusing to answer it, the author says that it's really his fault for asking the wrong question. And since the ship breaking section of the book is over 10 years old (even 5 years old when the book was published in 2004), it leaves the question unanswered about what happened with the whole Greenpeace movement to shut down Alang because I believe ships are still being broken down there, that they have not shut down."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This book covers a wide range of subjects related to shipping and explains that many aspects of life at sea are unregulated, or regulated only on a voluntary or theoretical level, and that consequently, maritime life is just as dangerous as it has ever been. The book discusses flags of convenience, negligence in maintenance and inspections, piracy, and shipbreaking. Most of these topics stand alone as decent essays. However, Langewiesche tries to tie them together with vague lines in each chapter about the uncontrollable quality of the sea and anything having to do with it, a device that looks like a last-minute, unconvincing way of binding a collection of essays into a book. The longest essay is the excessive, 94-page treatment (out of a total of 239 pages) of the 1994 wreck of the Baltic ferry Estonia. Much of this section concerns media vampires and conspiracy theorists drawn to the tragedy. In this section, it is easy to forget that one is reading a book about the sea."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This is not the book I was expecting. Normally it would only have gotten three stars, for recycling three articles, only one of which was really of interest to me (on piracy), but the author is gifted, and his articulation of detail lifts the book to four stars and caused me to appreciate his final story on the poisonous deadly exportation of ship \\"break-up\\" by hand. It is a double-spaced book, stretched a bit, and not a research book per se.Two high points for came early on.

For me, William Langewische's The Outlaw Sea is a fascinating look at a subject with which I am intimately familiar.Langewiesche's gloomy, albeit accurate, portrayal of life at sea for the \`low-end' portion of the ocean shipping industry is marked by excellent research and even better writing. The book has some of the hallmarks of the best fiction. It unfolds dramatically and keeps the reader's attention. Langewiesche's portrayal of the passenger ferry Estonia is heartbreaking. The author pulls no punches. At one point, Langewiesche discusses the horror of the loss of 852 lives on the Estonia, notes the worldwide outpouring of grief (particularly in Northern Europe) but then pauses to mention that ferry accidents such as this are a routine way of life in the third world (in Asia and Africa in particular) and yet these accidents barely attract our attention. The terse, matter-of-fact fashion in which Langewiesche imparts this information has a greater impact than it would have if set out in a dogmatic fashion.Last, Langewiesche turns his eye to the ship breaking business in India. Vessels that have reached the end of their useful life (and as set out in the book a ship owner's definition of useful life is far longer than may be prudent for safe operation) are run onto beaches in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan where they are dismantled in a manner that endangers everyone involved. Life for these ship breakers is nasty, brutal and short. Langewiesche's portrayal is so well written that one can almost smell the befouled air that lingers over the work area. The author also sets out the political confrontation between the ship breakers and Greenpeace. It is an excellent overview of the conflict that arises between first-world political activists and third world throngs struggling to make a life for their families.I only take two minor issues with the author. First, in discussing the sinking of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Spain, I think the author did not pay sufficient attention to the horrible decision of the Spanish government to deny safe harbor to the damaged vessel. It is mentioned in passing. The decision to force the Prestige out to sea, before she was damaged beyond repair and before there was a major loss of oil, into stormy and unsafe seas was as much, if not more, to blame for the environmental disaster that followed as the general condition of the vessel before the accident. The actions of the Spanish government in this regard were reprehensible. Second, Langewiesche makes much (rightfully) of the negative impact on foreign flag registration, specifically flags of convenience, in terms of vessel safety, poorly trained seamen, etc. However, it would have been useful to point out as a counterbalance the fact that the Exxon Valdez, the vessel responsible for one of the largest oil spills in U.S. history, was a U.S. flag vessel, built to U.S. flag standards, fully accountable to all U.S. maritime laws and regulations with U.S. officers and crew.This book is well written, informative, and interesting, whether or not one happens to be in this business. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in first rate, well researched and written non fiction."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"This is not the book I was expecting.

The six chapters function as semi-independent essays (bits of which appeared in The Atlantic), within an overall thesis that the world's oceans are essentially places of anarchy, and civilization exists only tenuously (at best) aboard seagoing vessels.Chapter One introduces the reader to this anarchic world of flags of convenience, shadow ownership, holding companies, the cheapest crews money can buy, and unsafe, decrepit ships. This is done via the case of the Kristal, a 27-year-old tanker carrying molasses and a Croatian, Spanish, and Pakistani crew when it split in two and sank in off the coast of Spain in February 2001. The disaster is reconstructed from the testimony of the few survivors, and concludes with furtive settlements to them and an utter inability to determine who actually owned the ship. Through this, Langewiesche describes how most shipping is regulated by the International Marine Organization (a UN agency), and, rather depressingly, how -- despite all kinds of conventions, agreements, regulations, and inspections -- ships are constantly sinking at sea and lives are being lost.Chapter Two is about security, both of ports and of ships. The vast majority of modern commercial piracy takes place near the Straights of Malacca, and Langewiesche takes the reader through one such case -- the October 1999 hijacking of the $10 million Japanese cargo ship Alondra Rainbow and its $10 million cargo of aluminum. Again, Langewiesche reconstructs the event through individual testimony and court records: from the Indonesian pirate leader's planning via cell phone with a Chinese boss, to the storming of the ship by multinational gang of Malays, Thais, Chinese, and others, to the ship's disappearance, and the pirates' eventual capture and prosecution by India. The disappearance is especially fascinating in this era of GPS and satellite imaging, and an important digression is made on the impossibility of tracking, never mind identifying all the ships at sea (some 30 million by one U.S. Coast Guard estimate). Anyone concerned about terrorists using boats or ports to deliver WMDs to the doorstep of the U.S. will probably not want to read this section, as it is rather chilling stuff.The very brief third chapter provides a little more background on how international regulations work in practice, here in the case of oil spills. This first grew into a major concern following a series of incidents in the mid-1970s, and blossomed into a full political issue after the Exxon Valdez crash. Langewiesche shows how American and European bureaucracies have responded over the last several decades, and how ineffectual these new rules regulations have been.Chapters four and five (totaling around 100 pages) deal with the September 1994 sinking of the ferry Estonia in rough Baltic waters, killing more than 850 people. And if you thought \\"The Perfect Storm\\" was heartbreaking, wait until you read this. The reconstruction (again, from survivors and the massive legal record) makes for terrifying reading, and no one who reads it will ever take a ride on a Baltic ferry. It's brilliant writing, tackling both the furious legal and technical debate about the cause of the disaster, and the harrowing human side, as people literally claw and climb over each other to survive. At times, the reconstruction gets a little too colorful as the attempts to show how most of the people become Darwinian animals get a bit much, but it's still nightmare-inducing stuff. It's an incredibly convoluted and contested tale, but one that does a very effective job of showing how the ocean can quickly reduce order to chaos and how the failure of regulation can lead to large tragedy.The final chapter is somewhat tangential to the book's main thrust, as it deals with what happens to ships at the end of their lives rather than the chaos that rules the high seas. Here, Langewiesche covers the shipbreaking beach at Alang, India. Here, ships come to die, driven ashore and then manually broken down in scrap metal and salvageable parts by poorly paid crews who live in squalid work camps and are exposed to all manner of toxins from the dead ships. Various activist campaigns have brought world attention to the plight of these workers, but Langewiesche points out that shipbreaking is a booming field and even more wretched facilities exist elsewhere in South Asia. What the responsibility of shipbuilding nations is becomes a very murky matter and there are no easy answers.This is a very good book, and each chapter stands on its own as an accessible introduction to one or two maritime topics which could easily merit entire books. Langewiesche is very good at blending travel reportage, investigative interviews, and archival research to create very compelling stories. Throughout, even though the topics can be rather abstract legally or technically arcane, he always writes with great compassion and clarity about the people who are affected."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"\\"The Outlaw Sea\\" is as good an introduction as one can find to the marvel and mystique of the ocean world-a frontier were states, businesses, pirates, crewmen, and scavengers vie for freedom, livelihood, and control. It is a world that is as exciting as it is dangerous-a perennial clash between the desire to place under control and the reality that the open seas are simply too vast to be governed.William Langewiesche, writer for the Atlantic, looks at the various aspects of the shipping industry and chronicles its main characteristics and hazards. He writes about old ships that pass lax inspections and end up in accidents that damage the environment or kill people; he narrates the hazards of traversing though waters mired with pirates; and he even discusses the end-point of many ships, as they sold for scrap, usually in South Asia.Throughout this story comes the dialectic between the chaos of the sea and the attempts by governments to bring the whole edifice under control. Characteristically, he tells of the various efforts and fears of the US Coast Guard about the potential of a terrorist attack carried out through a merchant ship-a likelihood that is much feared but almost impossible to protect against.In the end comes a balanced account of the realities of the sea. Save one narrative that is slightly overdrawn, the story is poised and well-focused, though at times it could have used more background and analysis instead of storytelling. But the underlying theme-that the chaos of the sea is unlikely to managed, comes across as powerfully as it could."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The book begins strongly, colorfully describing the byzantine world of ship registry, possible terrorism, and modern-day pirates. But when it turns to maritime disasters, the author chooses a selection of ship sinkings which take entirely too much of the book. His exhaustive description of the wreck and great loss of life of the auto ferry Estonia in 1994 takes up almost an entire third of the book and exhausts the reader. And somehow he misses the point of the book. The book ends on stronger ground with his coverage of the largely unregulated salvage of hundreds of commercial vessels each year, raising important ecological and social issues, though the book kind of dribbles to a close as if the author needed to complete the book by page 239.I liked the book for all that. The author's coverage is a bit shallow (pun intended) of a vastly important and interesting subject. He would do well with a follow-up, picking up where this one leaves off."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Control of the world's oceans was once considered a primal goal of the foreign policy of many nations. The advent and spread of air, then jet travel has reduced the importance of the sea, especially in terms of human transportation. But the sea is still the medium by which most of our goods are shipped, and as world trade increases, more and more produce is shipped over the ocean every day. This dichotomy then leads to an interesting situation. As people increasingly move about by air, the importance, and danger of sea travel recedes from public attention and the political limelight. But as more and more of the goods we use everyday are brought to us from places oceans away, the importance of oceanic commerce grows. Hence the growth in the shipping and shipbuilding industries and piracy. This then is the subject of this book, industry, crime, chaos and anarchy on the world's oceans.The book focuses on several parts of man's current relation with the sea. One chapter is devoted to shipbreaking, or the destruction of old ships. This environmentally hazardous and dangerous job often gets relegated to third world countries such as India. Another chapter examines piracy, and shows how some of the world's most traveled waters are often some of the most dangerous. Case in point are the waters between Malaysia and Indonesia. A third chapter examines the international shipping industry, and shows how shipping companies often sail under flags of multiple nations to help the bottom line and avoid government inspections.All told, this book shows how the world's oceans are a world apart from the land-based countries we are all used to. Rules that apply on land often do not on the high seas, and greed is often the determining factor in what goes and what does not. This book is especially relevant given the current war on terror."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"The title is the premise.The premise is interesting. The writing journalistic and a bit pedantic (though highly acclaimed on the books back cover).It's interesting in parts, like the \\"recycling\\" that goes onin India and the fact that almost all carriers fly flags ofconvenience, the real owners often hidden behinddouble blind dummy corporations. It is a real warning note on the dangers inherent in the lack of regulation in shipping.I was surprised to find that large scale piracy of freightersexists today (on the order of roughly 1-2 ships a week, world-wide).The book is essentially a collection of 4 or so articles.While interesting, I think it lacked overall cohesion."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"Exploring the edges of order in the modern age, Langewiesche again demonstrates that the world is getting larger, not smaller.In a recurring theme (compare the 'pencil whipping' ValuJet employees certifying the payload of flight 592), The Outlaw Sea highlights the contrast between the bureaucratic fictions of the regulators (in this case, the IMO) and the sobering vastness of the world's oceans and the consequent intrinsic unruliness of their traffic.With crisp, distilled, yet lyrical prose, and examples ranging from Spanish sailors to supranational pirates, from devastatingly impoverished shipbreakers of South Asia to paternalistic European environmentalists, Langewiesche uses the sea as a lens through which to focus on the unbridgeable gaps in perspective between rich and poor, East and West, order and chaos."},{"Title":"The Outlaw Sea: A World of Freedom, Chaos, and Crime","review":"If the attacks on the World Trade Center towers made you nervous, then this book will load you with solid reasons to be fully frightened about the potential for even more destructive terrorist attacks.&quot;The challenge is daunting. The United States has ninety-five thousand miles of coastline and more than a hundred seaports capable of handling large ships. It is the most active sea-trading nation on earth, accounting for a large percentage of long-distance maritime traffic worldwide and annually accomodating more than sixty-thousand port calls by oceangoing ships, the great majority of which are foreign flagged, owned by offshore companies, and crewed by anonymous sailors -- almost all of whom come from troubled parts of the world where America is resented, corruption is rife, and authentic documentation can easily be bought,&quot; Langewiesche explains.The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, focused attention on aircraft smashing into buildings. Ships are mostly ignored, except for &quot;big bang&quot; fantasies generated by Sept. 11, 2001. However, an equal or worse disruption of trade is possible simply by running a large oil tanker onto shore in a vulerable region -- think Exxon Valdez, and the impact of a larger spill on San Francisco, or Seattle, or Boston, or any other of those hundred US seaports.Can terrorists get a ship? Pirates already seize dozens of ships every year, and it often takes weeks before the ship is recovered. Al Qaeda already owns 20 ocean-going ships. Tankers have inflicted billions of dollars of damage on coastal regions for decades; now, think of this being done deliberately. The federal building in Oklahoma City was demolished by fertilizer and fuel oil -- in 1917, a French munitions ship blew up in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in a blast so massive that it briefly bared the bottom of the harbour.Despite an impressive bureaucratic and paper facade, ocean shipping is virtually unregulated. The total chaos of trade is an open invitation to the greedy, the pirates, the terrorists and anyone else with modest means and massive hatreds. Ships are the world's best cargo carriers, they are the essence of globalization and low prices in the US; in the hands of the world's world terrorists, they are also awesome weapons.In brief, it leaves Americans and the industrial world with a choice: either live with the &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; of ocean-bound terrorism, or develop a system equivalent to NORAD that was created to provide aerial security during the Cold War.This book is awesome. Read it, and you'll weep with rage at the $200 billion War on Iraq while leaving the &quot;cargo door entrance&quot; to America as an open, unprotected and deadly invitation to each and every terrorist."},{"Title":"The Communicator's Handbook: Tools, Techniques and Technology","review":"This volume breaks down the art of communications into 27 logical chapters.

When we were promoted to the Jr High level (7-8) we were not placed in the advanced class with the white kids and had it not been for the efforts of our parents we would have been stuck in regular classes, never to reach our potential. Some of us never did! The book explodes with fact after fact about the very real concept of Genocide and how the Educational system is being manipulated to discourage our boys to dropout, focus on sports, lose intrest in education all together, and seek alternative means of survival (i.e.a life of crime and violence.) As repulsive as the concept of Genocide is the book also inspires me to action and not to sit idly by and not try to improve the plight of our young defenseless brothers. The suggestions to counter the Conspiracy are practical and relevent and holds each and every African American responsible for the saving of our children and assuring that our future in America will be one of prosperity and justice. The book suggest alternatives to the status quo, and it will take unity, courage, and resouces to turn this thing around.Thank you,"},{"Title":"Countering the Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys, Vol. 4","review":"This is a very informative and helpful book.

Yes, one can find all the words in the unabridged Liddell & ScottA Greek-English Lexicon, Ninth Edition with a Revised Supplement, but the latter volume is not very portable, and it has far more information than a reader of the LXX will need.A more important difference, though, is that the present volume addresses many matters of lexical meaning that are peculiar to the LXX. Many senses given are followed by verse references. An exceptionally helpful feature, and one which I am sure took much time to develop, is the inclusion of hypotheses about how certain odd-looking translations in Greek may have been derived from the Hebrew text. This may be due to a different assumed voweling, a slightly different consonantal text or a simple misunderstanding by the Greek translators.Words unique to the LXX and literature based on it are marked, as are words found in the NT. Corrections to Rahlf'sSeptuaginta, to which this is a companion volume, are also indicated.While my overall impression of this volume is very good, there are a few desiderata I have for a subsequent edition:1. Many of the translations are rather old-fashioned, and some are positively obsolete. I burst out laughing when I found \\"conjure\\" as the translation of *exorkizo*, which means 'to put under oath'. The fact that this gloss is found in Liddell & Scott suggests that the authors depended too much on its quaint 19th-century and earlier vocabulary, rather than giving modern English equivalents in all cases.2. Occasionally an additional gloss is needed. For example, *elegcw* (elenkho) needs the gloss 'to prove to be' for Wisdom 2:11.3. This lexicon has extremely few cross-references for unexpected or irregular forms. A few more would be highly desirable as an aid to students. Among them are *arnos* referring to *amnos* 'lamb, sheep' and *qhmwnia* (themonia) referring to *qimwnia* (thimonia) 'heap'."},{"Title":"A Greek-English Lexicon of the Septuagint: Volume I: Alpha-Iota","review":"I do not regularly read the Septuagint, but there are times when a passage from it is helpful for work in the New Testament. At such times the last thing one wants is to encounter an unfamiliar vocable or a vocable that has a twist in meaning different from the usual New Testament meaning. Such words are not likely to be found in other Greek lexicons. For such times this work is very helpful. It is not exactly a concordance to the Septuagint, but does give several passages where the word is used, sometimes indicating the list is complete for all occurences. It is spendy, but a very good resource.

Ms. Goodman has the talented ability to describe the beauty as well as the dirt that was a part of San Francisco at that time period. In this first section, Lydia Chadwick meets and is courted by two gentlemen: Nathan Hunter and Brigham Moore. The secrets and deceptions of these two men, and Lydia's reactions are quite entertaining.The mid-section of the book takes place en route to Australia. This involves about six weeks aboard a ship crossing the Pacific. Very HOT!The 3rd and final section of the book takes place in Australia. This is where we meet, get to know and come to like some of the natives and learn a little about that country down-under. There is plenty of excitement, intrigue and a growing true love between Lydia and Nathan . . . not to mention some more very hot love scenes.SWEET FIRE was a very entertaining story that is sure to please any fan of Jo Goodman.

When my daughter decided to rearrange things, \\"Sweet Fire\\" was brought to my attention, and I decided to give it a go. So glad I did. I give the book 4 stars because the storyline was good, but I felt there was something in the way the plot was revealed that seemed choppy to me. It just needed some slight rewording to make it \\"sing.\\" BUT what I thought was missing in the plot, was AMAZINGLY delivered in the love scenes between Nathan and Lydia. I'm mean, WOW. So many authors give abbreviated descriptions of the intimacy between their characters that the reader has to use a lot of imagination to fill in the blanks. But Jo Goodman has a GIFT for writing vivid, engrossing, emotional, sexually charged scenes which heighten the reader's experience because what's describes is so REAL. I wish all love scenes (and, admit it--they are the guiltiest of pleasures in reading romance novels!) were written in such a manner.I highly recommend this book to those who want a heightened reading experience.

So it was with some suspicion that the shy, sweet San Francisco heiress woke one morning with a tall, dark, dangerously handsome husband she couldn't recall marrying. Lydia had lost her memory, and was desperate to discover if there was truly a love to remember. For as she looked at Nathan Hunter's lean, muscular frame, she longed to abandon herself to the sensual stranger, and believe--if only for a little while--that the possessive passion in his smoky gray eyes was really for her.HE ACHED TO HAVE HERBusiness and pleasure weren't supposed to mix, but in this case Nathan Hunter was willing to make an exception. After all, it was in his best interests to keep his new bride's mind off the secrets of her past. Making sure she didn't remember her hatred for him turned out to be the easy part, as he initiated the innocent Lydia to womanhood. Not so easy was keeping sight of his own goals as Lydia's sweet surrender wove a seductive spell around Nathan's heart, arousing emotions he had thought forever buried...."},{"Title":"Sweet Fire (Lovegram)","review":"It's a shame this book has so few reviews. What an AMAZING romance. This book has a very interesting and well-developed plot. I love the settings of this book... starting in 19th Century San Francisco with a young gold heiress Lydia. Her tale is a fascinating one- torn between two best friends who have less-than-honorable intentions. Goodman writes a beautiful love story, however, and takes us on an adventure from the newly developing San Francisco streets to an erotic island journey and finally to the outback. I really can't say how believable and enchanting the love between the tortured hero, Nathan, and the intelligent down-to-earth Lydia is.

Especially useful is the in-depth descriptions and hints on playing Melnibonean characters (which is probably a staple fantasy of any Moorcock fan). The famous personalities of Melnibone are also discussed in more detail than the small sample in the main Elric! rulebook. In the last section of the book are three excellent short adventures to introduce the players to Melnibone. The first of the three, 'The Suffer Glass', captures the tone of Moorcock's novels especially well and is better than most of the gaming books published as individual adventures.The writers have done a fine job of expanding seamlessly on the brief paragraphs describing Melnibone of Michael Moorcock's Elric books. This books provide an entertaining read for fans of the Elric series even if you don't actually rolegame since the book is light on game rules and heavy on descriptions. The only (minor) issues are the lack of detailed maps of the Dreaming City of Imrryr and some of the illustrations are not particularly inspired."},{"Title":"Melnibone: Dragon Isle and Dreaming City (An Elric Supplement)","review":"This is a very good suppliment for (Officially) the Elric!

Both are out of print (The license is now held by Mongoose Publishing) as an aside, but copies of either RPG can still be had for fairly reasonable prices. The reason why I say it works for 5th Edition Stormbringer is that the stats are best I can tell exactly the same, thus any book written for Elric! can be used with little or no need for conversion with 5th Edition Stormbringer.If you're worried about redundant information, the only thing I found are stats for major NPC's in the game. Said stats in this book are repeated in the main 5th Edition Stormbringer book.Included in this book is a large amount of background information about the Melnibonean people, the current state of the Island/Empire (such that it is) of Melnibone, ideas on how to roleplay one, a good number of random encounters and three adventures that I feel were well written.I don't know how compatable this book would be with earlier editions and/or with the current one published by Mongoose (Chaosium had the license until sometime after the publication of 5th edition) but if nothing else the details about the Melnibonean people and the Empire would be of use I'm sure."},{"Title":"Pre-Columbian Man Finds Central America: The Archaeological Bridge","review":"Although it is a classic overview of the archaeology ofnon-Maya Central America, a topic on which references are few and far between, this book is now hopelessly out of date.Readers are advised to look for more recent literature,or to at least be advised that most of the information inthis book has been revised as a result of new research."},{"Title":"Dictionary of African Names Vol.1: Meanings, Pronunciations and Origin","review":"i think this book is very cultural.i like reading and learning new things every day now i know african names.From your daughter oyin"},{"Title":"The Crises of the Christ","review":"This classic book by G.

It comes after MEIN KAMPF (1923-1925) and the then-unpublished HITLER'S SECOND BOOK (1928), but before HITLER'S TABLE TALK.Rauschning elaborates on Hitler's attitudes towards Poland. It becomes obvious that the Fuhrer never saw the 1934 Polish-German Nonaggression Pact as anything more than a temporary expedient, and that he never seriously considered accepting Poland as an ally against the Soviet Union (p. 119). This adds refutation against the claim that WWII had been triggered, in part, by \\"Polish intransigence\\".A common Nazi anti-Semitic theme is the one about Jews being vermin (presumably fit for nothing other than extermination). Interestingly, Nazis also thought that way of Poles. Albert Forster, the Gauleiter of Danzig (Gdansk), referred to Poles as lice (p. 110). (So did Joseph Goebbels, in his diaries).Rauschning elaborates on Hitler's obsession with Jews. He believed that it was driven in part by Hitler's fear of his partial Jewish ancestry (p. 235).In his MEIN KAMPF and SECOND BOOK, Hitler had vilified the Jews, and presented Slavic lands as ones to be conquered for lebensraum purposes and filled with German settlers. But what exactly was to be done with the Jews and the Slavs was left to the imagination of the listener. Not so here! Hitler makes direct threats against both Jews and Slavs as biological entities. He speaks of using both Jewish property and Jewish lives as hostages in response to the anti-German actions of other nations (pp. 88-89). (This foreshadows his infamous January 1939 statement, in which he said that, if \\"international Jewry\\" caused another war, he would destroy Europe's Jews in response.) He first speaks of resettling Czechs in Siberia (p. 38) and then, repeatedly complaining about the great fecundity of the Slavic peoples (p. 33, 137), proposes to solve this problem through such measures as keeping men and women separated for years (p. 137). He quips: \\"There are many ways, systematical and comparatively painless, or at any rate bloodless, of causing undesirable races to die out.\\" (p. 138). (In time, the Nazis did implement both active and passive genocidal techniques against the conquered Slavs, as discussed by Raphael Lemkin. The Nazis also worked to develop mass-sterilization methods, preferably ones that could be used covertly against the intended victims).In this book, Hitler develops his anti-Christian themes, but not as strongly as in the later HITLER'S TABLE TALK. In this work, Hitler refers to Christianity as an effeminate, Jewish invention (p. 49, 235). He trusts that the dogma of the Vicarious Suffering of Christ will give way to acceptance of the new Leader-legislator, who will liberate the faithful from the burden of free will (p. 225). Hitler also clearly exhibits the views of a moral relativist: \\"There is no such thing as truth, either in the moral or in the scientific sense.\\" (p. 223).Nazism is often misrepresented as a form of extreme nationalism. In fact, Hitler believed that the concept of the nation was a political expedient of democracy and Liberalism (p. 232), and was just as outdated as the concept of the dynastic feudal state that it had replaced. He wanted the concept of the nation replaced by \\"purely biological values\\". (p. 233).Nazism is also commonly misrepresented as a form of capitalism. In actuality, Hitler scorned both Communism and capitalism, just as he had done earlier in MEIN KAMPF and the SECOND BOOK. In the present work, he commented: \\"The classless society of the Marxists, he [Hitler] contended, was madness. Order always meant class order. But the democratic notion of a class order based on the moneybag was equally mad. A genuine aristocracy was not born out of the accidentally successful speculations of bright businessmen.\\" (p. 39)."},{"Title":"Hitler speaks: A series of political conversations with Adolf Hitler on his real aims","review":"Dr. Hermann Rauschning was indeed a minor official in the Danzig NSDAP, who fell out with the party and escaped - eventually to the United States - on the eve of World War II. With a collaborator, he published this book (\\"The Voice of Destruction\\" or \\"Hitler Speaks\\") and became a celebrity (he was a speaker at my alma mater, Wartburg College, Waverly, Iowa, in 1943). His book was cited by biographers of Hitler and historians of the era, such as William Shirer(Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, 1962), Alan Bullock (Hitler, a Study in Tyranny, 1952), Joachim Fest (Hitler, 1973) and Robert Payne (Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, 1973). These books are all still in print and their citation of Rauschning gives an impression of truth. His book is not truth. It is fraudulent.A Swiss-German schoolteacher, Wolfgang Haenel, proved this beyond a shadow of a doubt in the early 1980's. Anyone with the objectivity and curiosity of a scholar can determine this for himself simply by contacting the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel in Hamburg and obtaining a reprint of the article, by Spiegel editor Wolfgang Malanowski, \\"Zitat, Zitat, Zitat, und nichts weiter,\\" pp. 92-99, Vol. 37, 1985. Mr. Haenel not only demonstrated that Dr. Rauschning had no private conversations with Hitler, but also discovered the sources of these fanciful stories (e.g., Nietzsche, de Maupassant's The Horla).Sadly, this revelation came too late for Dr. Richard Pipes's volume, \\"Russian Under the Bolshevik Regime\\" (1993), where in the fifth chapter he draws very legitimate parallels between Bolshevism and National Socialism, but unfortunately cites Rauschning's worthless book as proof. The damage that Rauschning inflicted on the life work of such true historians as Dr. Pipes and on the credibility of the students at that little Lutheran school in Iowa cannot be easily effaced.Hermann Rauschning died in Portland, Oregon, in 1982 (his obituary is in Vol. 7 of Der Speigel for that year). Before he died, he was made aware that Wolfgang Haenel was researching his book. His response was that \\"Herr Haenel will mich entlarven!\\" (Mr. Haenel wants to expose me, literally \\"unmask me\\") - this response again mentioned in the Spiegel article of 1985.Works written in the last few years no longer cite Rauschning - only the older books do. And that's positive, because the truth is always what we really want, even if it destroys a cartoon."},{"Title":"Hitler speaks: A series of political conversations with Adolf Hitler on his real aims","review":"This is a review of HITLER SPEAKS: A SERIES OF POLITICAL CONVERSATIONS WITH ADOLF HITLER ON HIS REAL AIMS by Hermann Rauschning. This book was originally published in 1939 by Thornton Butterworth, Ltd., of London. Mine is a 1940 impression which lacks an index, bibliography or annotations.Rauschning was a wealthy agriculturalist from Danzig who achieved a degree of political prominence criticizing the Poles for their expulsions of ethnic Germans from territories ceded to the new Polish government by the Versailles Treaty. Rauschning described their treatment as brutal and complained about Polish internment of ethnic Germans in such places as Szczypiorno where he said 8,000 men, women and children including 24 Lutheran clergymen, were kept for months under harsh conditions without any access to medical care. Gustav Stresemann complained bitterly to the League of Nations in Lugano about this and other incidents on December 15, 1928.Rauschning became President of the Farmer's Association and came to believe that the National Socialists (Nazis) were Germany's only real hope. He began to advocate the incorporation of the Free City (of Danzig) into Germany and became President of the Danzig Teachers' Association in 1932, the year before the Nazis won control of the government in Germany and Danzig's city government. This put Rauschning in charge of the Free City as he became President of Danzig's Senate.It was in this capacity that he met Adolf Hitler. How many times he met Hitler and how well he knew him are the subjects of controversy today. Rauschning claimed over 100 meetings with the Fuhrer and affirmed that he was in a position to knew his views firsthand. Critics like Mark Weber of the Institute for Historical Review, however, promote conclusions from a Swiss researcher named Wolfgang Haenel, that Rauschning only met Hitler four times and then only briefly and never alone. Furthermore, Haenel claims that Rauschning plagiarized some of his dialogues from Hitler from other sources.It should noted, however, that Mark Weber and the Institute for Historical Review are notorious for their efforts to deny the historical accuracy of the Holocaust and the \\"conference\\" at which Herr Haenel made his revelations was devoted to this kind of \\"revision.\\" Weber's main concern with Rauschning's book seems to be that its critical of Hitler and makes him look bad.Historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, however, states that Rauschning's prewar observations coincide closely enough with Hitler's subsequent statements and actions to confirm their general accuracy and validity. Historian Eberhard Jaeckel reached a similar conclusion that HITLER SPEAKS is a reliable guide to Hitler's view of the world although it may not be a perfect verbatim record. Historian David Redles, it should be noted, was critical of Haenel's method which seemed to consist of looking for similarities in wording from other books and then concluding that Rausching was copying them if there was any resemblance whatsoever. Nobody seems to know what Herr Haenel's qualifications are either, a further cause for concern when Alan Bullock, Joachim Fest and Robert Payne find Rauschning to be reliable enough to consult.Written from exile, Rauschning's book is quite critical of Hitler. When the Nazis began arresting Catholic piests and depriving German Jews in the Free City of their citizenship rights Rauschning stepped up his support of constitutionalism and his criticism of Nazi policies. In 1936, he was forced to flee for his life. After passing through Switzerland, France and the United Kingdom, he purchased a farm near Portland, Oregon and remained there until his death in 1982.The tone of HITLER SPEAKS is quite critical. Rauschning writes that \\"Hitler and his movment are the apocalyptic riders of world annihilation.\\" Pretty strong stuff for 1939, but right on the mark as WW II and the Holocaust demonstrated. Hitler appears in Rauschning's eyes as a \\"coward\\", a \\"racist\\" and a borderline hysteric who sees race as the basis of everything even nations and great religions.Despite the controversy about Hermann Rauschning, he writes well and he leaves no doubt in the reader's mind what kind of Fuhrer Hitler became. I liked HITLER SPEAKS and gave it five stars. If you're interested in this period of history, the Holocaust, WW II, National Socialism, Germany, Weimar Republic, or the Fuhrer himself, you'll find this book interesting and useful. Don't be deterred by the IHR's attempted hatchet job, which makes up much of the Wikipedia article on Rauschning, by the way. If you can find a copy of HITLER SPEAKS in good condition, buy it.You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Hitler speaks: A series of political conversations with Adolf Hitler on his real aims","review":"I have only just bought the book so am commenting on the reviews indirectly. The tragedy of the Jewish position was less brought about by the old order jews whom collaborator Stern was treacherous (\\"We have no interest in the fate of the old order\\" (Jews) he said yet pointed the finger at them)than the US/UK power-broker financiers and their insistant conspiracies.Stern however capitalised on it all as did US financier Jews.Israel was formed in 1933-4 by German activity and Germany transferred acquiescent Jews and zionists there by the thousands,later built its first bank and traded with it through WW11.For Britain to get \\"Nazi favoring\\" American help more than the broken promises and aged weaponry. manoeuvered Britain into a desperate begging which required a compliance as the essence of such agreement. That essence, that compliance was as in WW1 agrement to the Jewish powerbrokers demand that Britain was to hand Palestine over as a Jewish state. That was absolute condition. America in the wars had little to do with caring about the allies.FDR was under Jewish financier domination and on the demand of the US Jewish hierarchy was sending refugee Jews back to their fate. The reason, and this is the essence of the word holocaust...(blood sacrifice by jews, not Goys) was self seeking and zionist New Order driven.In this situation the Jewish reasoning was stated as \\"we will gain far more by their suffering\\". Greenbaum added \\"One cow in Palestine is worth all the Jews in Poland\\" and further \\"\\"If I am asked, \\"Could you give from the UJA moneys to rescue Jews, 'I say, NO! and I say again NO!\\"Izaak Greenbaum -- head of Jewish Agency Rescue Committee February 18, 1943...addressed to the Zionist Executive Council.You could escape to Palestine only, nowhere else.A comparatively small number found their way into Hollywood as history tells.Hitler is not looking like the only funnel web spider in the garden.... yes?Americans and American companies were heavy investors in the German military materiel but that changed overnight, was outlawed, when Palestine was condemned to be invaded by Khazar Jews and zionists.Khazars even in the most fertile imagination have never had any inhabitation of Palestine other than as expats...nor were they ever Hebrews, these Georgians and their descendants took on a form of Judaism around 680 ad for political gain and financial profits.Their claims are a fraud and a farce but that wasn't Hitler's concern.Out of sight out of mind, yet still \\"contributing\\".Well before \\"nacht krystal\\" Jews, organised world wide, had declared and enacted a sometimes violent boycott on German people goods and services, which lasted for years to which Germany replied with one night of retaliation.This is well reported after FOI compliance.The Times reported in 1934 \\"Jews declare war on Germany\\" and certainly it was the the stage 1 sequel to WW1,which had been initiated by a freemasonic assassin (they since 1774-6 being the property of de Rothschild, the great grand father of the current, never audited, owners in chief of all Central Banks (>(57%)).Hitler was not in the absolute control of Germany in 1933, however he was well aware of the Jewish fianacier-Industrialist plans for world domination which are currently landing on the runway after their G.F.C. was so successful.Hitler, a fan of jews as a younger man, turned on them particularly over their pressing for WW11,step 2 in their war plans and because of their financial plots...There was another major issue however. Russia, overloaded with Jewish Bureauocracy since Alex 11 favored them with enforced education whilst non Jewish Russians generally had since 1917 been ruled by Jewish despots.The non Jews could no longer avail themselves or get a place nor were they forced to get education as were the Jews.Alex 111 knew the pre-1905 history and that of Alex 11 and it was Alex 111 who dealt with the surge of educated power with huge disparity between Jews and other Russians,and the Tsar's fall out with de Rothschild.Zionist symbols were on the walls of the Tsars ghastly execution cellar and some Talmudic verse.This gave deRothschild who financed the revolution through Jacob Schiff of Loebs to the tune of $47M, the Russian banking system which it has to this day...controlling cumutively the politics and affairs of Russia USA Europe and Britain from 1917 onwards.Hitler was vastly more intelligent than the US President and let him know it when castigated by him over Poland as well as scorning the hypocrisy he was given. To 1939 the Russian despots were executing Ukranians at the rate of 10,000 each week and the Ukranians well knew this was a genocide of them by the ruling Jews who had, incidentally. changed their names prior to the 1917 massacres.One might ruminate over the fact that that both National Socialism and Communism were separate inventions of two Jews. Was the conspiracy to murder the Jews actually fomented by American Jews of the NWO Banker-Industrialist conspiracy?...or simply capitalised on later? is something to ponder. Certainly Stern and his \\"New Order\\" turned over thousands of escapee Jews to the Gestapo and the IDF committed war crimes in like manner in 1967.In a few vicious sentences people and \\"history\\" condemn Hitler as paranoic,evil personified,that his focus was obsessively anti-Jew but in fact he was right on the ball politically. His major concern was that Russia would expand and take over Europe and he was not going to stand for it.As Hilter worked into power however crazy you think he was, he was well aware his efforts, unless rapidly enacted (Blitzkreig) would ultimately stand or fall on Jewish finance as did Germany throughout WW1.Jewish financier reparations from WW1 had been crippling yet the financiers funded the actions of Germany in preparing for war...To offset the inevitable withdrawl of finance as WW11 was just a stepping stone to the abominations and atrocities of today he decided to make his own arrangements with the Jews...at first to buy their assets for a song and later to simply strip them of their assets. A deal was made where they could recover some of their own money in trade with Germany, thus the first Israel bank being built in Palestine by Germany to facilitate the transactions.Later deRothschild , Mayer Lansky and other criminals like him laundered money into Israel and the practice is still common. deRothschild spent for him peanuts for us a fortune in money on public buildings there and there is notable Masonic creed architecture in public buildings as well as a huge street monument to freemasonry.No one later so \\"horrified and outraged\\" was anything but well aware as governments of the situation yet did nothing to prevent the Shoa and there's a whole other story there. What ultimately happened was that the USA imported German science and scientists and war criminals for its own evil ends (see MK Ultra and Operation Paperclip\\" for examples), which are still being enacted.Britain in 1948 handed over title to the zionists for 56% of Israel,the zionists already owning 3%.Palestine was not to be 100% stolen from Palestinians and given to the Khazar descendants at that stage.This drove the Palestinians to reactive grief and the Israeli collaborator-terrorists to vicious terrorism and retaliation against Britain attacks which abandoned even the slightest principle of decency,Stern and his zionist terrorists had initiated and conspired with the German military to route Britain in the ME during WW11.The Zionist Israelis now commenced a reign of terror against the British and any Jew standing near them deserved to die, Stern made that point of Jews who were murdered in the Hotel David bombing.In 1948 Israel commenced the brutal Palestinian genocide, the Nakbar, but assassinations of Palestinians had already been done...ben Gurion made it clear all Palestine would fall and that has been the process ever since...millions of Arabs have been murdered and huge numbers dispossessed.\\"Ben-Gurion\\" was a faked name as with most Israeli PM's including Netenyahu..ben Gurion was was actually David Gruen as was the perhaps Psychotic Shimmon Peres actually Shimmon Persky, Netenyahu is Mylekowski, and so on and on... )Against the US Veto the UN has no power even if it wished to enforce the numerous resolutions against Israel's relentless crimes against humanity. A thorough reading of the \\"USS Liberty\\" travesty and the gestapo style murder of 1000 Egyptian prisoners might come as a rude awakening to stalwart zionist apologists.Reading Ostrovsky's \\"By Way of Deception\\" and companion book will expose a conspiract oif vast proportions in the myopic viewing of the evil deeds and intentions of Israel, Mossad and the US Presidency (as opposed to the USA)...and the naiivety and stupidity of the CIA in dealings with MossadThere's a lot more western conspiracy than my little pitter patter here...and I don't applaud Hitler or approve of his methods though Blitzkreig could have been more humane (to some!!) than a dragged out war, The USA has used it in Iraq in particular and failed miserably as usual but has murdered, through sanctions and actions, some 2 million Iraqis since 1991. Now it plans to predominently use their improved V-1's called \\"drones\\" to massacre dissenters of the \\"axis of evil\\"...the countries who's banking systems were not owned by the Central Bankers.Three remain in the ME, Syria, Iran and Saudi.Elsewhere is Nth. Korea and China.Though not supporting Hitler nor condemning \\"Jews\\" there were undeniably zionist conspirators manoeuvering Hitler and the allies into war.The war was disgusting and Hitler should have had more humanity, however communism was his enemy,he wished to recapture German might and lost lands (and their benefits)and at the same time the powerbroker financiers wanted war and so....war began.The propaganda obfuscating the facts of the 20's 30's and 40's is stifling from so many sources the truth is well hidden, Since then doctrinaire propaganda groups including the ADL, CFR, B'nai Brith and numerous other doctrinaire zionist propaganda units financed by the USA and other even less savory 'western' sources have done their job of deceiving mankind,well.So much so was Hitler demonised beyond rationality that I began research.You might do also and comprehend better that WW11 was always going to happen.It was a corporate conspiracy for world domintion initiated by Mayer Amschel Bauer, son of a terrorist who'd settled in the Frankfort ghetto and hung the identifying red shield and six pointed star outside his shop.From that came \\"de Roths-child\\" (Red-Shield)and de Rothschild's plot with the 12 most influential Jewish bankers of Europe in 1770.The Gestapo found that Hitler was probably descnded from a profligate deRothschild for whom his grandmother, Maria Schikelgruber, worked...Quote:\\"At that time she was employed as a servant in the home of Baron Rothschild. As soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back to her home in Spital where Alois was born. If it is true that one of the Rothschilds is the real father of Alois Hitler, it would make Adolf a quarter Jew\\"\\"it gets curiouser and curiuoser\\" ,said Alice, looking at her shoes.Hitler was the chosen one, having dedicated his life to the service of the German people after he made a late WW1 \\"pact with god\\", as he put it, that if his sight was restored he wouldfulfill that dedication.He was pitted against the illuminati, the ultra powerful Jewish worshippers of Lucifer which had created the Central banking Empire.This is still carried on as is Freemasonic powerbroking through the US Presidents who must be also satisfactory to the Bilderbergers and Israel.Was he madder or more foul than them? or those who created the Iraq invasion after 911 knowing they had no reason other than it was planned before \\"911\\" and just neeeded the people's support for their lies? and numerous other crimes of the US Israeli alliance?Was his real threat his sincerity, foresight in recreating the Empire, his genius, tenacity and organisational skills that are passed-over to not inhibit his demonisation? I say let him rise or fall on truth and now, research and the demanding of hidden documentation...Hopefully \\"Hitler Speaks\\" will not have been doctored by the publishers for government ends.That's something to ponder more than simply come up with trite knee-jerk abuse and vacuuous and derogatory slurs such as \\"anti-semite\\" to obstruct research and expose people to sanctions.The freemasonic judiciary and the commercial paranoia of zionist powerbroker organisms throughout the west..and the world has perverted truth and backed that with legal sanction. I can't wait to get also a copy of Table-Talk also to learn more of the enigmatic Hitler..but those I have seen are ludicrously expensive.

Gold is, to put it bluntly, not a particularly skilled wordsmith. His limitations are obvious from the first page. Nevertheless this novel/memoir makes for fascinating reading. The book consists of a series of loosely connected vignettes from the life of a child growing up in the Lower East Side at the turn of the century. Gold wants to capture the sights and smells and sensations of that world, and while his prose is not quite up to the task, the reader still comes away powerfully moved.What seems to be unique about Gold's account is his political bent. Rather than softening or sentimentalizing his experiences, he picks at scabs and pulls back the curtain to reveal horrors to his readers. As a devoted socialist, he wants to expose the evils of unrestrained capitalism. What that means for him is, rather than denying anti-Semitic stereotypes, he revels in them. Gold he wants the reader to understand that they are the result, not of Jewish culture, but of the effects of American ghetto poverty upon the Jews of his neighborhood. Povery, he aruges, turns potential into corruption. His is a world in which people will do anything for a few pennies, often all that stands between them and starvation. On the other hand, his world is also populated by characters who remain strong despite their suffering: his mother, who would rather go hungry than see a stranger starve; the foolish store-owner, who loses her livelihood because she cannot stand to turn away the poor. There are also desperate prostitutes, rapacious pawn brokers, crooked businessmen, and dreamers and schemers of all sorts.This book lacks the literary ambition of Henry Roth's &quot;Call it Sleep&quot; or the narrative power of Abraham Cahan's &quot;Rise of David Levinsky&quot; (in my opinion, the finest novel ever about the Jewish immigrant experience). This is a political tract, and sometimes its dogma is rather irritating, even offensive. Nevertheless, it is a significant and important document of early 20th-century Jewish culture, and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"Jews without money,","review":"The only thing marring this important work is the introduction by Alfred Kazin which maligns the novel and Michael Gold and leaves the reader wondering if the publisher is really trying to promote the book.

Although his writing style is not quite intricate, the delivery is both addicting and satisfying: You won't be able to put this one down. The autobiographical type of narration works well, and the tales of Michael and his family are sure to smear your mind with many images of the hard life they lived and how important it was to get by. I am reading this for a course at my university, but I would recommend this book to anyone, even casual readers. The book does not mean to be informative, but it puts you back in the time and Gold makes you feel as if you are experiencing event after event in his life. Enjoy this one, it was good!

In addition, his distaste for Christians, while honest and honestly come by (the Catholics in this book are reprehensible characters) comes out in spades.While it paints a vivid picture of the squallor of NYC at the turn of the last century, after a while all the badness gets tiring to read."},{"Title":"Jews without money,","review":"great pricegood transactiondelivery slower than competitionbut acceptableThank you"},{"Title":"Continuations (Currents in Canadian Literature)","review":"Continuations by co-authors Douglas Barbour (Professor Emeritus at the University Of Alberta) and poet Sheila E.

More than that, it contains a good deal of information that's useful even to those of us who have designed and worked with radars for many years.The common faults of written material on radar are either to focus too narrowly on one aspect of the topic, or to omit material on the assumption that it must be classified when in fact it is not. Edde's book avoids both pitfalls. He gives thorough, comprehensive information on all sorts of radars, past and present, designed for various uses, and leaves the conscientious reader prepared to think clearly about where to start when confronted with a request for something new and different.Suppose you were asked to sketch out an initial design for a radar whose purpose is to track bird migration on the Atlantic flyway. Where would you start? What criteria would you strive to meet? To what extent could you hope to distinguish between types of migrating birds? What help might you hope to provide for keeping track of individual flocks during migration? What design techniques might be useful? How much of what kind of signal processing would you expect to need?I don't know about you, but left to my own devices I could stumble around for quite a while contemplating such questions. To avoid wasting time this way, I would sit down and rapidly skim Edde's book again, cover to cover, taking notes on what might be useful ideas and starting points.If you are professionally concerned with radar, you need this book."},{"Title":"Radar: Principles, Technology, Applications","review":"A good book to explain the Radar to people with singal process / electronics background.

The reader traverses the terrain of the physical and the ethereal, the dark and the light, the unknown and the known, the beautiful and the terrifying. Blocks of wonderful color photos interlace with thestructured sections of Brown's journey account, the journal excerpts of early explorer, Fridtjol Nansen, (unbelievable!) and the conversations Brown records with fellow travelers, scientists, and naturalists.

Those are about the only facts of this case that can be definitely confirmed. Everything else is circumstantial and subject to conjecture.Alice Crimmins, the divorced mother of the two children, would seize scandalous headlines for the next twelve years in one of the most sensational murder cases of the 1960's. Kenneth Gross' meticulously researched story of the case clearly throws more than a shadow of a doubt on Alice Crimmins' guilty verdicts in 1968 and 1971. While he does not come out and say positively that Alice Crimmins was innocent, he does show that her promiscuous lifestyle worked against her in politically conservative 1968. He also throws into question the memories of detectives and prosecution witnesses who claim they saw Alice doing something as well as the claim that she acted alone in the abduction and murder.With all the lurid headlines we now see on TV and in the papers, abduction and murder almost seem commonplace. Yet, in 1965, this case was sensational and shocking. This is a gripping, remarkable book that you will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"THE ALICE CRIMMINS CASE","review":"The story of a shameful miscarriage of justice. Alice Crimmins' children disappeared one hot summer night in 1965. The daughter was found dead the next day, the son was found a week later, badly decomposed, in a place where the police had already searched. Alice was a \\"wanton woman\\" sleeping around with lots of different men. This hardly raises an eyebrow nowadays, but in Queens, NY in 1965 it was scandalous. The investigation was sloppy, and detectives immediately decided Alice had done it just because she was wearing heavy makeup (as was her habit) and the all-male, mostly Catholic investigative team formed a bad impression of her. The detectives ignored other possibilities such as: The children might have climbed out the window (they had done it before) and gotten picked up by some wandering psycho. Alice's husband Edmund was acting peculiar - he had been spying on Alice while she had sex with other men, he told a strange story about exposing himself to children at a public park, his alibi for the night of the disappearances did not hold up. But instead of following the evidence and trying to find the killer, the detectives set out to prove Alice's guilt and ignored any leads that did not support their theory. The author of this book makes it clear that Alice was condemned because she was slutty, not because she actually murdered her children.Kenneth Gross describes the web of political connections within the police force and the judicial system to show how such a sham investigation was conducted and how Alice was railroaded in court - she was found guilty twice without a shred of solid evidence against her. The thought that such a travesty was possible - and still is today - is very sobering. The message: Stay out of trouble, because justice is a myth.At the end of the book, the case is unresolved. Nobody knows who really killed the kids. It might have been Alice, but that seems unlikely and is unprovable. I read a 1975 hardcover edition which does not include the information that Alice was paroled and married Tony Grace in 1977. The 1977 paperback might have this as an endnote; I'm not sure. They disappeared into obscurity after that and the case has been mostly forgotten.I would have given this book another star, but Mr. Gross's writing style is jumpy and disconnected at times (once I had to flip back and forth for a few minutes because I thought I had skipped a page) which makes the story harder to follow than it could have been. Still, it's a pretty good true-crime novel. A real page turner."},{"Title":"THE ALICE CRIMMINS CASE","review":"Kenneth Gross' book made an enormous impact in its day, and it is strange to think that one of the absolute classics of true crime is out of print.There are probably few young people who have even heard of Alice Crimmins, but when I was a boy, she was a notorious figure and the crimes of which she was accused were so terrible that people grew silent when she came by. A cocktail waitress, Alice was a pretty young woman who used tons of cosmetics to make herself stylish and sexy--she looked downright dangerous, like Ronnie Spector or one of the Shangri-Las. People in the little housing project near Fresh Meadows were divided about her, but many said she couldn't be as bad as she painted herself. She had separated from her husband, Edmund, a few months before, and took care of her two kids, Eddie Jr and Missy, pretty much on her own. But she was a party girl and the neighbors would never forget the day the kids were found playing in the yard after sundown, because they were locked out of the apartment and, when this negligence was investigated, they found that Alice had gone on a date in which the party she was with shanghaied her and took her on a Caribbean cruise. At least she could have called somebody!The murders of her two children however--could she really have committed this horrible act? She claimed that she had put them to bed one night, and somebody must have put a ladder up to their bedroom window and spirited them away. Their bodies were found weeks later, miles away--poor little things. The DA's office theorized that either Alice or an accomplice had killed the kids in order to improve her chances of marrying the rich contractor with whom she was having an illicit affair. She was convicted after one of the most ludicrously one-sided trials ever recorded, Ken Gross' book makes it clear that Alice was primarily convicted because of her sexuality, and thanks to his reporting and to the indignation of the nascent feminist movement, she was released shortly after the book came out. She has disappeared, but her story, and that of her two beautiful children, will always be remembered by anyone who was around during that long ago summer of 1965."},{"Title":"THE ALICE CRIMMINS CASE","review":"Alice Burke Crimmins was a woman ahead of her time. She was divorced and seeking an independence from her husband. Sadly, her children were snatched in the middle of the night much like Jon Benet Ramsey.Of course, the police believed immediately suspected the mother because she didn't grieve or pass their superficial tests of innocence. Whether you believe this \\"gay\\" divorcee had anything to do with her children's abduction and murder is not for me to decide.I was born after this all happened. But from my perspective, the author is very descriptive and knowledgeable of the facts around this highly popular case. This book is an excellent read but it's sad because there really is no solid conclusion.The children's bedroom weren't sealed off properly. People like neighbors and friends and relatives came in and out of the apartment. Of course, now we'll never know who did it. But it is ironic that Missy's body shows up in a different location than her brother. And what about the other boy's story of a possible abduction? That can't be ignored.We'll never really know what happened because the police and press decided immediately what happened. A case like that happened in my town and they still believe it was the mother even though it's been 15 years and it's like beating a dead horse.Sometimes, I think people have to realize that this was a case of a stranger abduction and murder but it was too late for the police to collect proper evidence. I'm sure Alice has her own problems but I wouldn't think she was a killer. Sophie E. was a discredited later on in the second trial."},{"Title":"THE ALICE CRIMMINS CASE","review":"the biggest problem with this book is the author.

The saga of the beautiful Catherine and her beloved Arnaud played out over 6 or 7 big books, Catherine emerging from each trial more beautiful than ever. They are rich in detail and sometimes very moving.I enjoyed them thoroughly."},{"Title":"Belle Catherine","review":"2.5 starsI was more than a little disappointed with this book. There was some stuff I liked about it, but a lot more that irritated me and made me seriously wonder just what the hype is all about. I'm sad about that, because I really wanted to like it. Maybe the rest of the series is better. At least I'm hoping so.An extended prologue sets the scene for Catherine's future of adventure and (I'm assuming) bedroom quandaries. She falls in love with the wrong guy and the whole chaste affair naturally ends in tragedy. This part was a bit slow-moving at times, but there was great tension and build-up to the tragedy that the gawky, freckled Catherine suffers (which ends up dictating all of her future actions, foolish as they are). While not much nitty-gritty detail was given to the rivalry between the Duke of Burgundy and the royal family, there was enough to make the strife within the streets seem real and dangerous. This, I liked.Her troubled childhood dispensed with, Catherine enters Chapter 1 as a feisty, freckle-free and beautiful young woman who spends a lot of time on hair and clothes and is a spoiled little bourgeois maiden. I was hoping that this was when the book would really get cooking, but so many scenes tended to ramble in the stews and bourgeois circles of Paris with much of it seeming like the busy work of extras in a Franco Zeffirelli production. It was evocative of the times, but I often wondered if there was any point. There was usually a kernel of plot in there, but too much else swamped it. I've read enough books like that to know that I don't like it when authors futz around with distractions. Get to the damn point. Or at least make the detours interesting.It's an obvious \\"first in a series,\\" but not in the current trend of dumping a bunch of characters on the reader and/or spending 1/3rd of the book setting up the next installment. Instead, we are treated to a meandering bit of story with an intense focus on a main character who, by the end, hasn't really evolved at all and meets the final page on a cliffhanger of the DUN DUN DUN variety. Albeit a cheap thrill out of good ol' melodramas, it would have been more satisfying if Catherine had become a character I really wanted to read about. As it is, she is more immature at twenty-one than she was at twelve (when the prologue occurs). She does stupid things, says stupid things, and is in general a self-centered, impulsive idiot. She really has got to smarten up by the time the series ends - there's no place to go but up, anyway. So this book had the feel of a character trying to find herself - or rather an author trying to find her character.The \\"romance\\" was really lacking here and I was flummoxed by Catherine's attachment to Arnaud after only a few short, sweet hours together - no, not what you're thinking, since she's as much a virgin on the last page as she is on the first despite being married, chased by the Duke Burgundy and groomed as his mistress, and getting groped and pawed by Arnaud for about 15 seconds. Her desperate love for Arnaud is based on his physical likeness to her first love who was his brother. That's pretty much it - perhaps there was more to it, but it really wasn't explored at all, and so surface appearances win by default. I couldn't get behind the romance with such little interaction and foundation for it, so Catherine really came off as a pathetic, clingy fool. Not to mention immoral, since she is determined to go to very drastic ends to be free and pure for Arnaud, even though he hates her. (And since the object of her plot was the only character I really liked and who also happened to be the best-characterized of the bunch, she gets an extra black mark for that. The mature, one-eyed, tempted - and therefore tormented - Garin de Brazey rocks.)At least that little plot didn't turn out so well and she realized just how far she was willing to go - imperiling her immortal soul - for the elusive Arnaud, but she still continues in her quest to get him. Some wise Arabic doctor refers to Arnaud's undying desire for her (despite all outward appearances), so I guess it's one of those fate-y, destiny-y kinds of loves. I can dig that if there's stuff to back it up, but I wasn't feeling the stars dictating the wo-mance like I have in other books, like Forever My Love.The climax was a showy set piece between the two men who torment Catherine - one by his lechery and the other by his angry rejection - but since both of them were often physically absent from the story (yes, Arnaud is seen only twice in the whole book), the bulk of my interest and engagement was supposed to rest on Catherine, and as I think I've made clear, she didn't do anything for me as a heroine. It was during this part where lame clich&eacute;s really brought the story down. Since it was nearly the last page, it left a sour taste in my mouth.Still, I have the rest of the series and will continue with it, if only to see how Catherine and Arnaud finally get together, because this book had them driven apart using those aforementioned lamest of romance clich&eacute;s at both their first separation and the last (paraphrased) SEPARATION 1: CATHERINE: \\"Yes, my cousins killed your brother, but--\\" ARNAUD: \\"No, don't tell me anymore! I don't want to hear it!\\" CATHERINE: \\"Fine!\\" *storms off* SEPARATION 2: ARNAUD: \\"I've caught you in the bed of my enemy! Your earlier caresses were obviously a plot to entrap me! Off with you, wicked and vile temptress! I curse your name and hope you rot!\\" CATHERINE: \\"I love you. Arnaud! I love you! It's not what it looks like, but I don't care what you think of me, I love you! I love you!\\" ARNAUD: *leaves* CATHERINE: *pines*. Blech.So what I'm hoping for in the next book is that Catherine is actually given something to do, rather than constantly getting threatened with dishonor (which never got carried out by always the barest escapes/contrived means), changing clothes a lot with lots of description about every freakin' fabric and furbelow under the sun, trading a few snarky asides with unworthy wenches (she's so clever, you see), and mooning about a guy she's only seen for a few hours in her entire life yet plans her whole life and compromises her soul around.It can only get better, right?"},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright's Living Space: Architecture's Fourth Dimension","review":"Although &quot;unique&quot;--as one professional reviewer put it--that doesn't necessarily mean a brilliantly conceived book will be enjoyable. I started, but didn't get very far, so far. The style is opaque with trendy deconstructionist jargon that must first be deciphered into plain English (this is serious sociology, after all). Understanding Wright's own words can be difficult, true, but fun. This is not, so far. (Contrast the fresh air quality of the opening Wright passage with Satler's ponderous text.) Although the book title speaks of &quot;Living Space,&quot; note that this book focuses on Wright's early WORK spaces (Larkin and Unity Temple) rather than his houses. Nor are the tiny B/W pictures of those buildings either plentiful or good. I hope to come back to this book after enjoying some others (e.g., G. Hildebrand's The Wright Space [Univ. Washington], or Susan Bandes' Affordable Dreams: The Goetsch-Winckler House [Kresge Art Museum, Michigan State Univ])."},{"Title":"Frank Lloyd Wright's Living Space: Architecture's Fourth Dimension","review":"I am pleased to say that this book's form does follow it's function. It is such a pleasure to read a book ,that really jumps out at the reader, and one feels as if they are walking through a tour of one of Wright's structures. The author seems like she really knows what she is talking about, unlike some authors who just research a subject and throw it together and there is a book. Gail Satler is a phenominal author and I'm, sure she is a great person to know. I look forward to reading more of her work in the near future.

Klinkowitz was a director of the real-life Waterloo, Iowa team in the MWL, a franchise that's the topic of a non-fiction book titled \\"Waterloo Diamonds\\" that's also an excellent read for different reasons, so Klinkowitz is writing largely from his own up-close experiences and observations.\\"Short Season\\" is a collection of intertwined short stories about the Mason City (IA) Royals of Midcontinent League. Although the characters and settings are fictional, the stories are very realistic regarding what it was like to be a player, manager, coach or fan of a team at that level of pro ball in the 1980's, when the book was written. Minor league baseball was only starting to catch on with the general public, so the book's setting is still at a grass-roots level but during a transitional period for that level of the game. The Mason City Royals could've been about any real MWL franchise.Although the stories are self-contained, they follow a thread throughout the season as you can view the MC Royals through the eyes of its characters on the field or in the stands. It's an easy read, and is written in a style that bridges the gap between younger fans (I'd say a 10-year-old could probably handle it) and older fans with some insider's knowledge of what minor league ball is like. That's not easy to do as a writer, but Klinkowitz generally makes it work.I'm giving this one four stars because there are some minor flaws in the storyline (in my opinion) and the ending is somewhat unrealistic over the last two chapters, but the stories are well-written, the characters likeable and the overall feel of the book is both realistic and accessible."},{"Title":"Pieper bar review: New York civil practice and procedure, and New York substantive law","review":"One of the true gems of baseball literature.

The latter point to pagan intellectuals in the past and secular ones today and compare them unfavorably to those with a childlike faith who walk with the Lord. On the other hand, those Christians who favor the life of the mind will point out that intellectual curiousity need not contradict a childlike faith. They can list any number of great minds in Church history and note how God has used men like St. John Chrysostom, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and others to our current day in witnessing to the truth of the Christian faith through the disciplined use of the mind. The intellect, like any tool, is to be judged by how it is used for God's service.In The Life of the Mind, Clifford Williams considers the compatibility of a strong Christian faith with a powerful intellectual curiosity and makes the case for a positive outcome. Those hoping for a passioned vindication might, however, be disappointed as Williams makes a calm and thoroughly reasoned examination and is not dismissive of the concerns of those who might approach academic considerations with trepidation. He understands that Christians who take up intellectual pursuits might fall into arrogance but this no more such pursuits a vice than those with the gift of natural beauty and are prideful make beauty itself an evil.Williams effectively makes the case that a properly guided intellectual curiosity is a means to see the work of God in His creation and is a good in itself. While not everyone might not be inclined toward intellectual endeavors as a high priority (just as not everyone may be naturally inclined towards art or music), the complete neglect of the life of the mind (as in other areas) impoverishes one's life and closes oneself off to appreciating a facet of God's working in our lives. As a reasoned apologia for the role of intellectual pursuits in the life of the Christian, The Life of the Mind, Williams calmly and clearly answers the objections of well-meaning but short-sighted brethren."},{"Title":"Life of the Mind, The: A Christian Perspective (RenewedMinds)","review":"Thinking and faith:De Bono, Rhodes scholar, founder of the International Creative Forum, originator of the concept of \\"lateral thinking,\\" was my logical choice for books about thinking. Since I was brought up in Alexandria where salvation is by Grace through knowledge, thinking was never stood in the way of faith. Some of the greatest Church thinkers; Origen, Athanasius, and Cyril utilized their faculty in defending Orthodoxy, after developing Saccha's Christianity compatable Neo-Platonism.Renewing the Mind:Jim Sire describes Intellectual Life As a Christian Calling, while John Cobb, Jr. challenging all Christians to think, in obedience of Christ. And while Cobb asks Christians to reclaim their gift of thinking, and redeem thinking about God from theologians, Williams defines the life of the mind as a Christian perspective.In a A Review of The Life of the Mind, Learning to Think Like a Christian is the reviewer T. Moore's qualifying subtitle, he underlines with John Stott that, 'Your Mind Matters', reminds us that, 'disciplined development of the mind must be an important part of every Christian's spiritual life.'Thinking, life of the Mind:Dr. Clifford Williams, a veteran professor of philosophy, at Trinity College offers an examination of the life of the mind, as a Christian perspective, in seven chapters that constitute his brief, but informing book. Christians who develop their mind's life observe, think, and engage in dialogue. They are interested in the exploration of mundane knowledge (science and philosophy) and spiritual knowledge that enhances their faith.Williams believes that people of faith has to be thinkers, and sets in a concise and systematic way the case for his theme. While it is normal to think, developing and utilizing our mental faculties, consistently and coherency, is a matter of discipline, very much like the desert fathers toil with the Noia (thought). While Williams argues that thinking is sought for its own merits, he argues that our minds will try their ways around issues until they can achieve solutions, and acquiring good thinking habits will motivate thinking processes and make them enjoyable. He cites the Scriptures to support his argument, of not wasting what the Lord intended in His intelligent design. He claims that knowledge on its own merits is a way of loving God (John 17:3). The more earnestly we know Him, the deeper will be our love for Him, since, in the biblical sense knowledge is love. Hosea gives the consequences of rejecting thinking, and lack of knowledge;\\"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,because you have rejected knowledge,I reject you from being a priest to me.

Also check out &quot;The Federalist&quot;, number 51.Now then, Bagehot, like Madison, describes the operation of a modern liberal regime. The trick for founders of liberal government is to produce a government that permits the people civil liberties, but does not permit the people to abuse those liberties, or in the words of Madison, to create a government that is &quot;democratic yet decent&quot;. Madison and the American Founders accomplish this end by so constructing the institutions of government that mens' selfish natures will be turned against each other (&quot;ambition is made to check ambition&quot;), rather than united in tyrannical concert.Bagehot too describes the operation of a system of government that rules by the consent of the governed, yet which does so by restraining the vices of those who ought not to rule. Bagehot argues that the English government is moderate and decent because of a division of government into the &quot;dignified&quot; and the &quot;efficient&quot; parts, and a &quot;noble lie&quot; about the relationship between the two. It is this noble lie that permits the government to operate without the interference of those who would turn it away from the public good.

The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"I applaud Brice for having the courage to tell her story..and others that are stepping forward to reveal the truth and horrors of mind control. A few million people in the U.S. alone had been stripped of their spirit and souls, many unaware that experimentation had been undertaken on them- but tortured and broken, and feeling 'something isn't quite right'. The dissociative personality sufferers can still function adeptly in society, can perform on cue and have photographic memories as we see in many celebrities today. But at the terrible cost of inner turmoil, broken relationships, substance abuse caused at the hands of evil, unconscionable people who are their 'handlers'. Many of these people are in the echelons of high government and the entertainment/music industry, who also follow occult/satanic practices. Some, tragically paid the cost of attempting to break away and reclaim their souls that were bought and sold.I do believe that good does triumph over evil, and that we are in a new age where human consciousness is being raised. Truth will reveal itself as more people such as Brice are stepping forward to free their minds of their bondage, and in turn help and inspire others that were nothing but innocent victims and used as puppets to do the same. We all fantasized, and wanted to believe when we were younger, that despite our experiences, that Disneyland is a fantasy paradise, the yellow brick road leads us to the magic wizard over the rainbow-and as we become older-we realize their is an evil side of life, too- but our mind goes into denial and wants to shield us from that ugly, unimaginable side of life- the same as countless people refused to believe the holocaust existed after WWII.The mind and soul is a precious commodity, that was stolen and stripped from many. To those it was taken from, I pray for you all, that God helps to nurture and heal that broken inner child. No-one ever owns you- you have the power to rise up and free yourself, to be your own person, speak your own truth, and claim your soul back. Believe in the power of yourself, and of God the saviour, and that truth prevails in the end, and will set you free."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free!

The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"Brice Taylor's actual name is Sue Ford, a Beverly Hills debutant, and victim of incest and perhaps Multiple Personality Disorder, now named Dissociative Identity Disorder in DSM-IV. Ford got her degree in psychology before she \\"recovered\\" her memories, and perhaps was falsely influenced by reading other people's life stories. According to Cathy O'Brien and Mark Phillips, in their 2004 book \\"Access Denied for Reasons of National Security\\", Ford stole the fictionalized novel from her \\"ex-roommate\\" and its ghost writer, Rod Robinson (also a victim of incest and perhaps DID/MPD. Robinson told O'Brien, \\"I am an author writing a FICTIONAL book on mind control that incorporates much of the information Sue was able to obtain THROUGH HER THERAPIST,\\" (NOT from Sue herself). This book was never about Sue Ford, aka \\"Brice Taylor\\". It is more based on the life of Cathy O'Brien, who collaborated on the facts of her deprogramming for which Robinson's novel is loosely based. Ford paid Phillips $500/month rent in return for living with him and O'Brien and Phillip's brain-damaged mother, but Ford claims to have paid Phillips $75,000. After reading Ford's so-called notes of her memories, Phillips wrote, \\"she either is deliberately perpetrating fraud or is indeed the victim of false memories from her therapists.\\" O'Brien's daughter is also named Kelly, who was kidnapped into a Satanic cult run by the state of Tennessee, and a Nazi electroshock hospital run by Vanderbilt University, and scheduled for a court-ordered \\"exorcism by Satanists\\" (oxymoron). \\"Laws do not apply for reasons of national security\\", according to Judge Andrew Shookhoff, ignoring the Tennessee legislature's new law in O'Brien's daughter's name. When Robinson said he was almost finished writing his novel, Ford replied, \\"Since my experience was only incest, I guess I have nothing to contribute.... I want my name on the cover.\\" Robinson replied, \\"If you'll do the legwork on getting the book printed and pay half the printing cost, you can add your name to the cover.\\" \\"Really? My name can be on the cover of STARSHINE?\\", she asked. Robinson replied, \\"Right after mine. You've got the manuscript right there. When you solidify the deal the deal to have it printed, I'll wire you half the money.\\" O'Brien asked her why she wanted to use an alias on the book, wondering why a person with DID would want a new identity. \\"For legal reasons,\\" Ford replied. \\"It never occurred to me, Mark or Rod that Sue would eventually remove Rod's name from his book entirely, ironically change the title to \\"Thanks for the Memories\\", and keep all the sales profits,\\" O'Brien wrote. \\"She plans to release Rod's fiction book as her reality, so she can use mind control as a defense to any crime. We asked her to leave immediately.\\" So \\"Brice Taylor's\\" book is useful, at least for general background on CIA' MKULTRA, and background on O'Brien's first book, \\"Trance Formation of America\\". producer@PirateNews.org"},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ...

The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"For 10 years I have had as patients dozens of victims of government mind-control experimentation (Projects Bluebird, Artichoke, Paperclip, Monarch). Brice Taylor outlines in detail some of the methods used to &quot;split&quot; the mind into dissociated parts in order to program the parts to perform a function for the perpetrators without the victim's conscious mind aware of what is happening. This book is for all the skeptics out there who don't believe this is possible. Mind control is about power and greed; control someone's mind and you've got an unpaid labor force for anything you want to do--there are big bucks to be made in child and adult pornography, blackmail, drug and arms running, and controlling information and misinformation to and from powerful people. Manipulating the human mind is easy to do if you have enough knowledge about human physiology and psychology. That information is easy to obtain if you can learn it through experimentation without informed consent or worry about ethical, humane treatment. &quot;Classified in the interest of National Security&quot; is all that is needed to make sure the public doesn't ever know about the terrible human rights abuses perpetrated in this country with tax dollars. This book is shocking because Brice Taylor names big names, and we as a culture are terrified of admitting that many of our leaders and people we hold in high regard are corrupt.

The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"The other day I went to have a medical procedure done where I needed to be sedated - basically a routine colonoscopy. The drug I was given (most likely Midazolam a.k.a. Versed) allowed me to remain concious, but sedated, and then gave me total amnesia of everything that occurred during the procedure. Midazolam is commonly used as an interrogation drug because of its ability to alter conciousness and repress memory.The last thing that I remember was being injected with this drug and asking the doctor \\"What exactly am I going to forget?\\" - he said \\"Everything from this point on.\\" In other words, everything that happened while the drug was \\"in charge\\".I was told that I was awake during the procedure, that I asked questions, that I was told what to do and did so. I have absolutely no memory of any of this.Many of us have seen TV hypnotists who could easily take audience members and have them thinking and acting as if they were giraffes, clowns, or Elvis.Given the fact that these types of mind manipulations happen in everyday life, why is it so far fetched to some people that this could occur on a massive and organized basis by the super rich sociopaths in charge of our lives and country? As for rich socioipaths, just read any of Eustace Mullins' or Antony Sutton's books to see what I'm talking about. Don't believe in mind control? Didn't you know that Congress has had hearings on MK Ultra (MK being cryptic for mind control). It's in the Congressional Record - all you need to do is look it up and get yourself educated - and by the way - get a couple of books on HAARP while you're at it. After you're through with that, get a copy of \\"The Franklin Coverup\\". Did you know that Paul Bonacci, a victim of mind control, was able to successfully sue his abusers for $1 million? In my opinion, he should have gotten a lot more. Why Johnny Can't Come Home, by Noreen Gosch should be required reading as well as David McGowan's Programmed to Kill and Maury Terry's The Ultimate Evil.DID (multiple personality) used to be a fairly rare condition, which has grown to much greater proportions in the general population. Is this due to an organized effort by \\"people in the know\\" to create dissassociated, robotic, yet super talented pawns? Would \\"Disney-created\\" Britney Spears be one? Tiger Woods another? Read how his dad trained him and you might think twice - what cinched it for me was seeing a tape of Tiger as a toddler being presented as a golf prodigy on the old Mike Douglas show by none other than BOB HOPE!I recently thumbed through \\"Telling Without Talking - Art as a Window into the World of Multiple Personality\\", and the types of experiences people are recalling as victims of DID is chilling. It certainly gives credence to books like Ms. Taylor's and also Cathy O'Brien's.Some new age \\"channelers\\" and people involved in \\"remote viewing\\" are mentioned as being mind controlled pawns as well - this coincides with what I've read in William Lyne's book \\"Pentagon Aliens\\". His contention is the government has covered up home grown free energy technology with stories about \\"aliens\\" and has planted a number of CIA controlled \\"alien contactee\\" freaks in and around places like Sedona. Not that I don't believe in life in other galaxies - but you have to wonder if what people are seeing here is a small part of an organized hoax. When \\"Ramtha\\" starts referring to the super elite who run the world as \\"Greys\\" (Last Waltz of the Tyrants) and David Icke calls them \\"Reptilians\\" you have to wonder just who is pulling their strings.Alaska Airlines flight 261 crashed nose down in the Pacific due to \\"mechanical malfunction\\" near Point Mugu Naval Station off California. Ms. Taylor mentions Point Mugu as a place she was taken for mind control \\"sessions\\". The crash may be coincidental, but the creepy part was the memorial service for the victims held at Mugu, which involved the release of hundreds of Monarch butterflies. Is this just another coincidence, or a sick reference to Project Monarch? Did the plane crash on its own, or with help? Skeptics accuse conspiracy theorists of seeing a bogey man in every corner, but sometimes you have to admit that the coincidences are a bit too close for comfort.This book is too detailed and rings too true to be a fabrication. I have always wondered why Bob Hope became such a huge success in spite of being, in my opinion, extremely unfunny. This explains it beautifully. It also explains a little of why Michael Jackson (who has some rather large flower \\"butterflies\\" and a flower clock on his lawn near the entrance of his estate, creepily named \\"Neverland\\") and the Jackson family appears to be such a mess.And it also brings up other questions about others in entertainment and politics who appear to be under some kind of spell - Liza Minelli for one comes to mind. Is David Guest her handler? Are celebrity drug addicts who spend time in \\"rehab\\" really in drug rehab, or are they there for further \\"programming\\", being kept on drugs because they're more controllable that way? What about Lindsay Lohan's stay at a rehab center called \\"Wonderland\\"? Why is she in so many movies where she is either a twin, plays 2 people or switches personalities (Parent Trap, Freaky Friday, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and I Know Who Killed Me)? Is there a reason so many actors are Scientologists? (A fact which was lampooned in the movie \\"Bowfinger\\")Strange \\"riders\\" in entertainers' contracts (for example, a much publicized one specifying that a bowl of M&M;'s for the snacks in the green room have all the brown ones taken out) may be less due to eccentricity and more due to the need to have certain mind control triggers in a convenient place for the entertainer's handlers.What gets to be slightly annoying about this book and others like it (Trance:formation) is that the highest level perps behind the curtain are given a spooky, scary persona, and remain in the shadows, unidentified. Try IAmTheWitness, KayGriggs or the HugeQuestions sites to get grounded. They are the only sites, IMHO that aren't loaded with disinformation, but I'll leave that up to you to decide.It obviously took Ms. Taylor a great deal of courage to write this book - I applaud her for it."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ...

Taylor has a Masters in psychology and after healing and writing her books, for a time she ran a clinic with a naturopath to assist other MKULTRA survivors to reintegrate and heal but the CIA burned her clinic to the ground, and just to make sure she realized it wasn't an accident, they put 2 bags full of the ashes on the front porch of her home. They have broken into her home and left &quot;calling cards&quot; to let her know she's under surveillance.

The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"The curious cover art suggests the publisher doesn't this book seriously. To be sure, the story is bizarre: a convoluted tale of criminal conspiracy, coverups, and weird sexual excapades with unlikely public figures. On superficial inspection it looks like it might be parody akin to \\"The Book of the SubGenius The Sacred Teachings of J.R. 'Bob' Dobbs\\"... comedy in the vein of \\"let's all laugh at the crazy people\\". Ten years ago, that's how I would have regarded it. Now, I'm not so sure. For one thing, the book goes way beyond the limits of even them most daring parody. Author Brice Taylor makes very specific criminal allegations including physical abuse, statutory rape, and/or trafficking in persons at the hands of her parents, Bob Hope, Henry Kissinger, and others. It is striking how similar the events in this book are to those in The Franklin Cover-Up Child Abuse Satanism and Murder in Nebraska -a decidedly non-fiction, non-comedy whose contents have been largely substantiated in the criminal trials and reporting which followed that book.SummaryThe premise is that high-level government and corporate officers wishing to procure the services of prostitutes cannot do so without risk of blackmail or spies (witness Eliot Spitzer). To provide these executives with the sexual services they desire, an exclusive black market of \\"secure\\" sex workers has evolved. Security is ensured by recruiting very young girls into a rigorous, years-long program of grooming to ensure loyalty and discression. The training includes intimidation and destruction of the victim's self-esteem through shocking acts of physical and sexual abuse. In a side note that unfortunately won't surprise many of us, Taylor also describes her participation in child beauty pagents, like the ones made infamous by Jon Benet Ramsey, and explains the function of these pagents in the sex trade. As in underdeveloped nations, there appear to be American parents out there willing to sell their daughters into such a life. Taylor claims she was sold in this manner, and subsequently spent almost twenty years in the service of various elites.Sorting it outThat's a lot of very alien information to take in all at once. It isn't parody, but is it true? Maybe Ms Taylor is lying. Or maybe she's mentally ill. Maybe these stories are part of some counterintellegence program (COINTELPRO), spreading exaggerated and untrue information to discredit these ideas (to make all of this look ridiculous), but in the process hiding or covering up a lone kernel of truth. ...Or there is an outside chance that most, or maybe even all of this book occured exactly as stated.If the contents are not true, I would be interested in knowing why the author has not been sued for libel by her parents, the Rockefeller family, Henry Kissinger, Bob Hope's estate, or Niel Diamond. It doesn't prove anything that she hasn't been sued, but it does seem odd. Ms Taylor's allegations of blatently criminal activity are very specific about the times, the activities, and the persons involved. The book has been in print for over ten years now, so there has certainly been enough time to assemble a lawsuit.Honestly, I 'm not sure what to believe, but I'm not satisfied just passing it off like a big joke; I wouldn't put anything past Kissinger or the Rockefellers."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ...

I could not give it 5 stars because the Biblical quotes were a bit too much. I admire Brice's courage in telling her story.

The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"Sue Ford ('alias' Brice Taylor, as she helpfully reveals) comes out of the mind-control closet with the mother-of-all exposes, Thanks for the Memories. Conspiracy buffs have long known about the CIA's brainwashing programs (MK-ULTRA et al.), but only Sue Taylor Brice Ford has the guts to name names. And when I say names, I mean names, and plenty of them. Here is a PARTIAL list of high-profile evildoers who have sexually exploited Sue Brice Taylor Ford. Ready? Henry Kissinger, Alan Greenspan, Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Gerald Ford (no relation), \\"Uncle\\" Frank Sinatra, James Taylor, Prince Charles, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton (there goes 2008!), Sylvester Stallone, Ed McMahon, Johnny Carson, Neil Diamond, Sammy Davis Jr., Dean Martin, Bob Hope, and, it goes without saying, Don Ho. Busy beaver, eh? The mind-control sex-slavery game has finally met its Zelig, and her name is Taylor Sue Brice Ford!Skeptical? Wait until you read the incredibly detailed accounts of her encounters with these various rogues. Now, granted, we have to expect some sketchy recollections from a woman who was brainwashed by the likes of Mister Kissinger. It happens. But some of the dialogue relayed by B.T.S. Ford sounds particularly weird, even for this burgeoning genre. Tommy Lasorda dictating which players will do well on a given night? (\\"Steve, you're gonna hit a home run. Ron, you're gonna bunt, because you're a runt.\\") Then there's James Taylor proclaiming that his mid-concert assignation with T.B.S. Ford will help him \\"perform the second half with gusto!\\" (He's a football player now?) Last but not least, we have the notion of Sly Stallone fondly reminiscing about \\"dolphin porn\\" (natch) and concluding an evening of child abuse with the timeless line \\"Y'all get back now, ya hear!\\" On second thought, that actually rings true. My bad.But wait, there's more! Not only do we get blow-by-blow accounts of Suebrice's hookups with her tormentors (Hot Reagan Action!), we also learn of other high-profile victims! Victims like Barbara Streisand (explains the stage fright), Elvis Presley (explains the film career), and the L.A. Dodgers (explains the postseason flops). The book came out in the 90s, so we're left to wonder which of today's struggling celebrities are in on the mind-control racket, be they exploiters or exploitees. We need a revised edition pronto, Ms. Ford. Get Kissinger on the phone and find out the post-hypnotic trigger for \\"Sequel.\\""},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"I don't know what to make out of this book. It is either: 1) deliberate disinformation written by a government agent designed to undermine serious attempts by people like Alex Constantine to expose CIA experiments (including their publically admitted MK-Ultra program) by creating the impression that proponents of such theories are insane, 2) written a woman who is truly a victim of such a program BUT who has been set up to create a book full of easily discreditable fantasy in a disservice to herself and others like her, or 3) a deliberate piece of satire. The book has been clearly marketed as fact, so I lean towards scenario #1 or 2 as the most likely origin of the book.The possibility that this book falls under scenario 1 or 2 prevents me from reviewing it as a comedic satire. And given the possiblity of scenario #3, I am reluctant to ridicule the author who may, indeed, be a victim.Even if it is disinformation (deliberate or not), this book says something interesting about the agencies behind it and the gullible readers who choose to believe this drivel. Imagine, what is basically little more than a hardcore porn novel filled with little else than graphic scenes of rape and humiliation (involving orgies with celebrities and politicians) written in the style of a deliberately erotic novel being embraced by the self-same Christian soldiers who campaign tirelessly against all pornography, including that of a less unhealthy and consensual nature! Because that is what this book is, however you interpret its origins: one hard-core sex scene following another depecting an (oft-times) underaged girl being forced into sex acts against her will. It is as if some readers are willing to deceive themselves into believing the utterly ridiculous (and, yes, almost comedic) events depicted in the novel because it is the only means by which they can justify buying this pornography. (&quot;We're not buying it for the sex, we're buying it because it illustrates an American Tragedy!&quot;) What nonsense!! If the readers want to embrace someone for crusading against thought control by the government, then they should be embracing the Alex Constantines of the world.I do not like any of the politicians or celebrities slandered by this book (there are far more well-documented facts that may be used to condemn or criticize each of them), so I enjoy seeing them slagged on some level. But this is not the way.This book, however you look at it, is nothing more than disgusting exploitation."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"When I read this book I found myself getting paranoid and having bad dreams, which I had happen when I was researching UFO phenomena and getting into some of the weirder stuff. When I get paranoid I stop reading, and take that as a sign that something isn't right with the material. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fraidy cat, I can read most anything and deal with it. But when I start feeling crazy myself, I think I've bought into something that isn't true. I have no doubt the author believes this is all true, but I believe she has been manipulated into believing something this outlandish to discredit her. Look! It worked! Somebody or something implanted absolutely absurd and horrific information in her mind, and (mistake) she believed it. Believing and pursuing this information broke up her family and, I think, broke her. The same thing happens to people who get too involved in UFO's the occult, demonology and religion. It ruins them if they start believing everything they see and hear. Let this be a litmus test as you are trying on some new framework for reality, such as the author presents in this book: Does this information make me feel better, more sane (truth) or worse and less sane (untruth). Good luck, readers!"},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free!

She names all these famous singers, actors, and politicians, and knows that she was sent in to all these highly sensitive areas (such as the Pentagon), but didn't name ONE piece of material she was made to memorize. If she really risked her life to name all these people (as she claims)why not tell all? Sorry to say, but it sounds like a weird story constructed out of pure fantasy by someone who really is crazy."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"Brice Taylor's story is not unusual in the context of its subject (mind-control experiments and their human survivors). What makes it unusual is the specific set of claims she makes and the complete lack of records that would have to exist for even a fraction of them to be true. As an example, she claims to have attended many high-level political meetings at the side of Henry Kissinger, among others, meetings for which photo documentation often exists and in which Brice does not appear.If there were only one such claim, it might be plausible, but the sheer number of her claims make this highly unlikely. Without revealing details of her story, it is safe to say that the chances of this being any meaningful biography are extraordinarily slim. Over and over again the author claims to have been spirited away by government agents for nefarious purposes via helicopter, to have had private and personal relations with virtually every well-known political figure of the last 30 years even while in grade school, and to have lived most of her life brainwashed to not remember any of it. In fact, she relates two accidents as the triggers which caused her to regain her repressed memories. What is more likely, from both a scientific and logical perspective, is that the accidents induced such memories. Even the author admits in the disclaimer that some or all of her narrative may well be untrue!In fact, certain things the author mentions in the book as being triggers sent out to her specifically to invoke her programming are things like the names of streets she drove past on her way home or to work. Popular songs, movies, and such things also, according to her, were set up to contain triggers meant for her specifically.All these things, when taken with her other claims, point less to the idea of the aftereffects of mind control experimentation and more to something like schizophrenia. Linking and finding meaning between two unrelated bits of data, as the author does more than once, is one of the important indicators of schizophrenia, particular paranoid schizophrenia.This story is indeed the tragic autobiography of a vicitm, but not of mind control. Rather, it seems to be the story of the ravages of mental illness and how some forms can leave a person apparently functional in many ways, but revealed by a penetrating analysis.None of this is to say I did not enjoy the book. Indeed, I did. However, it is better as an insight into the mind of a schizophrenic than that of a mind-control survivor. Unless appropriate documentation can be produced in support of her story, the author's treatise is best not to be relied on as a serious resource for investigators."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"I don't have words to describe what I got out of this book. It's...bizarre! I cannot for the life of me figure out why anyone would count this as anything but an obviously very disturbed individual's \\"memoirs\\". Save yourself the money on buying this unless you are researching mental illness, and just go right to the conspiracy websites to get the crazy-nuggets this Brice Taylor claims she experienced- from sado-masochistic sex orgies involving EVERY president from JFK to Reagan(!)who she claims used an electric cattle prod on her. Insert celebrity name here, and she claims she's been forced to engage in sex with them- not just sex, but sado-masochist sex! Oh- and all movie stars are \\"mind control MX ultra slaves\\". What was Taylor's job in all this? To relay \\"high level\\" private messages back and forth and report on VIPs to none other than Henry Kissinger! So, basically, she lives out her fantasy of sado masochistic sex with every household name on the planet: Kings, princes, Hollywood celebrities. Somehow this mish mash all adds up to some sinister \\"dark underworld\\" she played a MAJOR part in. But wait-she was an \\"MKULTRA slave\\" during all this. Everyone's an MK ULTRA slave, according to her! Back in 2000, our local Los Angeles channel 13 did a story on her. Get this:Brice Taylor wrote about her alleged life as a CIA sex slave invivid detail in a new book out called Thanks for the Memories.According to Darwin, Taylor's story received a record rating for KCOP's newsprogram, reaching more than 250,000 households.The program's executive producer, Kristin Lang, says it should have beenobvious to viewers that Taylor was mentally disturbed. \\"I think it waspresented as a medical mystery. I don't think it was presented as anythingmore than that,\\" she says. She disagrees when asked if the station withheldkey information about Taylor, Gunderson, and Monday in order to makeTaylor's claims about mind control seem more legitimate. Lang says the piecewas about Taylor's mental illness, not her alleged career as a sex slave.The whole program was a special on MENTAL ILLNESS- not \\"sex slavery\\" yet some people I assume that tuned in a bit late in the program assumed it was a factual account of a large high level conspiracy. It's baffling anyone took it for anything other than the subject of mental illness. Ms Taylor took it and RAN- those that believed this fantasy only uplifted Taylor's delusions, cementing her unfortunate hallucinations with confirmation and encouragement.How can anyone in their right mind buy this story of hers- oh.. wait.. not all of us ARE in our \\"right minds\\"...take a web search and look for images of this Ms Taylor's face. See the \\"crazy eyes\\"?Sure, there are some very unbelievable things going on in high places (the Franklin scandal, anyone? 9-11, the Iraq war, etc), some downright EVIL things- but this story is just something else altogether. It's nothing more than the rantings of a crazy person on paper.Some of the reviews claim this book is a deliberate \\"disinfo\\". They take this obviously schizophrenic-delusion of grandeur sufferer a bit too seriously."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"As much as I would like to rate this book higher the best I can do would be one and a half stars. Since that rating does not exist I don't think the book deserves two stars so we are back to one. The reason that this book does not deserve higher is that it exaggerates, and names well-known people as active agents in the mind-control program rather than as responsible leaders who did practically nothing to stop ruling body sanctioned mind-control and find just compensation for the victims.The book needs to be labeled as fictional. In my following comments I will stick to what I know as fact and give the book the benefit of the doubt. At best, and not mentioned by the author, she may have been traumatized to a conditional point such that she had what I had, a form of conditioned prosopagnosia.Starting with the acknowledgements, the statement, \\"thanks for telling me the truth was within, when others told me to forget the past and live in the present\\" was right on. On page vi it is noted even President Clinton's 1997 efforts via \\"Strengthened Protections for Human Subjects of Classified Research\\" have had little effect.Page xv, where military bases are listed as past mind-control sites, based on my own experience, I would add White Sands Missile Range, Pensacola Naval Air Station, Eglin Air Force Base, Port Hueneme, and Naval Station Newport in Rhode Island. No doubt as mentioned on page xxi flashing lights, drugs, sound variations, electroshock, and microwave emitters where utilized at most of these sites.The author's run in with those from the medical field that would discount her experiences are similar to mine. The often-mentioned white lab coats are a common theme for us. No doubt there were controlled experiments carried on by the various colored coats.Several places in the book, like on page 27, where the author talks about what I call the construction of artificial barriers in the mind, she mentions being told to kill herself if she starts to remember the abuse. These types of barriers are powerful control mechanisms. The comment on page 35 concerning \\"acting\\" normal and copying behavior have a truthful ring.The big black car introduced on page 38 also showed up several times in my experience. These along with the later mentioned large white vans are a common theme in both our experiences. On page 43 the concept of being humiliated and shamed and often put in double-bind control internal trauma based transactions modes is absolutely the truth. The mind-controllers used National Security as the excuse to cover their pedophile behavior.On page 65, the idea that one can function as an image while feeling isolated, alone and in a daze like they don't exist is well stated. No doubt the mind-control specialists use manipulating the human subject's children to control the subject.It is unfortunate that Senator Ted Kennedy had some of the source mind-control facilitators on the plank and then let them go. Perhaps he did this to protect his own interest. The mind-control personnel would do anything to further their actions regardless of the degree of violation of human rights. The controllers would do anything to manipulate a person including the subject's own sacred beliefs. Preprogrammed process ending statements are common themes used by controllers and taught to subjects.On page 188 the comment that, due to mind control the author was not able to consciously think about any of what was happening in front of her is supported by my own experience. Project Paperclip had a numbing effect on many.In some of the author's depiction of famous people I am surprised that she did not get sued for defamation of character. Those types of depictions are also interspersed with realism like how as parents her and her husband were paralyzed by the controllers to even defend their own children. The controller's dehumanization of the subjects is a common theme throughout the book.On page 230, the following statement is absolutely true relative to my own experience. Due to prior programming all the subjects \\" have to do is hear the word combinations, tones, frequency, etc., and they can all be commanded with a very short time to carry out their programmed instructions.\\"Being trapped to keep secrets, another common theme, even holds for the controllers. I have yet to meet anyone of the controllers that will divulge what goes on in these shadow secret filled nebulae. The en-slavers are bound in their own way just as the enslaved.I don't recommend this book. I think it does more damage to what actually happened regarding ruling body mind controllers. It took me seemingly forever to finish. There are some good books on ruling body mind control. This is not one of them. Still, the author deserves credit for giving it a good try."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free!

Other than that its alot of sex recollection that is too detailed for a story of this type (it does nothing to substantiate only throw people off course) For just an idea of what you have to look forward to: Disneyland rides, airline pilots, JFK in limos and public restroom, LBJ in hotel room,\\"super duper\\" joyride, menstruating....Bob Hope and a few older men, a dark-haired executive, Nixon, Reagan passivity, california businessmen (suits suits and more suits), (america = pleasure, so diplomatic relations go smoother), Bob Hope (show me your tail feathers), Pete Wilson's 'Pete', Ted Kennedy's Fireplace and rough pain...and thats not even 1/3 through the book.Personally, there was nothing of value in this story because common sense discredits portions, which in turn discredits the whole thing. If anyone was damaged even half as badly as this it does make sense there would be false memories but this makes truth and fantasy indistinguishable.

I am so glad i finally purchased it. What a miracle that she has been enabled to tell her story and speak out for those who haven't been able to heal as she has, and tell their experiences within mind control. The people she speaks of (Neil Diamond, Bob Hope, Barbara Streisand, James Taylor, Sylverster Stallone, Nixon et al) are familiar to me from growing up in the 70's and 80's and also from the pages of legend (John Kennedy). We really cannot judge from the public persona and it is sad and shocking to learn who/what these people really were. The same applies for children we may cross paths with or see at parks, schools and churches. As Sue Ford relates what her childhood consisted of perhaps there are children we may know who are experiences such horrors as her yet we just see there outward lives and never know what goes on behind closed doors. The fact that the level of mind control spoken of in this book (the use of harmonics, light, motion, drugs, genetic manipulation) was going on in the 70's it beggars belief to think what developments in the instigators technology and the number of people produced that exist today, 2012. Highly recommended if you are interested in mind control, Conspiracies (I will not add the word theories as there is too much information to make this information a theory), the secret lives of the (supposed) elected leaders of America (and other countries to boot), the incredible ability of the human mind/soul to survive and much much more, then this book is a compulsive page turning.

I had listened to Ms.Jones over many years and had always found her level-headed and pragmatic in her approach to life. I do not believe that she had this rich fantasy life to manufacture such 'wild' claims.Mr. Daniels, on the radio, seemed so, well, embarrassed to tell such a story - a feeling a 'normal' person would have if he felt that he must relate such a story to strangers and knew how they might judge him for that would have been his attitude in their stead.No, I do truly believe MsTaylor and the shame goes to the government officials who allow this to continue.Some of the scenerios are repeated ad infinatum with differing persons and the book really could be shortened a bit just for the sake of better readability.My fervent prayers go for MsTaylor and all of those who are innocent victims of the crueler operatives of the once great US government.It is, indeed, ironic to hear the media debating on whether we should torture those who we capture in battle; while knowing that this is the very way in which we treat some of our own citizens."},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ... The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"The people who dismiss this book and thus the premise it's based on with only one star may very well be intellectually dishonest, conceptual \\"flat earthers\\" who are completely ignorant of (1) modern-day techniques which have been well developed to deliberately create dissociative personalities, and (2) the willigness of certain people to actually engage in this kind of highly sophisticated cruelty and psychological terror.This is not to say that one should go to the opposite extreme and accept at face value every one of Brice Taylor/Susan Ford's claims. Many of them are quite outrageous and completely without any sort of documentation and, understandably for many people, this combination is a fatal flaw which makes the whole story seem worthy of nothing more than summary dismissal. On the other hand, the very nature of ritualized psychological torture a.k.a. \\"mind control\\" makes documentation or \\"proof\\" of the details experienced by individual victims essentially impossible to obtain. Nevertheless there is excellent and very solid documentation for mind control practices scattered about in written literature, all of which can be obtained without reading anything in the genre of \\"sensational conspiracy theories\\". Although the book clearly falls into this category, it is still well worth reading in the context of the more substantial documentation that we know exists regarding mind control practices.One interesting thing I discovered as a result of reading this book: There was a biography written by Arthur Marx called \\"The Secret Life of Bob Hope\\" which describes the man in rather unflattering terms that are completely at odds with public perception. In a nutshell, the book says that Bob Hope's sleazy character traits were very well known within Hollywood inner circles but that this knowledge never made it past the PR front men. Of course this doesn't prove anything that Brice Taylor/Susan Ford has claimed, but if you believe her, it certainly makes it easier to \\"connect the dots\\".The Secret Life of Bob Hope/an Unauthorized Biography"},{"Title":"Thanks For The Memories ...

Finally, the truth has come out about how our country is run and how those in power get there and what they do to people to stay there.

The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"This book is the most disturbing work I've ever read for many reasons. For those of you who know about Bohemian Grove, high level Freemasonry, SRA, and MK Ultra techniques, this book on the Illuminati will connect the dots. I will wager a guess that most other people will characterize this work as that of an individual seeking fame or fortune of the type we are sick of seeing in reality TV shows, or someone with a severe psychiatric problem. However, to assume either would be a severe mistake, in my judgement. I say this because the techniques described in this book used to split mind alters match exactly with detailed mind control methods described by others, and if you take the time to research some of the claims about specific indivuals, a clear pattern begins to develop. Yes, the scope of the allegations is difficult to comprehend, but I do firmly believe the author is telling the truth. The depth of the evil perpetrated on the author as a child is mind-numbing, but those of you familiar with SRA will get that same nauseating sense that yes, there are sick, depraved, profoundly evil people in this world that will do anything to anybody to get what they want. The author's descriptions of seeing and interacting with angels during particularly horrific abuses (to split more alters) brought tears to my eyes- the extreme evil byproduct of free will is not more powerful than God's love. And ultimately, this is a journey of hope that we can all appreciate, no matter what our background.

Be prepared to confront everything you have ever believed about known politicians and celebrities, especially those who are held in high honor in our society. The newspaper clippings in the appendix give concrete evidence of relationships that while reading, you may not believe to be true. Although Ms. Ford gives a startling and concise account of her life as a slave, be prepared for the minimization of Ford's sexual abuse and rape by President John F. Kennedy starting at age TEN!

The Truth Has Set Me Free! The Memoirs of Bob Hope's and Henry Kissinger's Mind-Controlled Slave","review":"I stumbled upon this book about two years ago and it blew my mind and shocked me but I felt what I was reading was absolutely true. It not only rang true but these important new facts and insights to the history of the goings on in the United States and abroad, helped me at least, make so much more sense of what is really going on in this country and elsewhere in the echelons of power. The information in this book started a cascade of connections to other ideas, events, additional survivors stories and experiences, and things I had already knew or wondered about to finally make a much more complete understanding of what is going on than ever before. I really think this book is essential to understanding how our country has gotten to the very low place it is now. Every American should take the time to read this book. It is way overdue for the truth of these secret activities and atrocities that inevitably affect us all to be brought to the light and the outed criminals that we have been convinced to revere by the main stream media and schools as honorable and American heroes should be instead seen for who they really are and what they have really been up to. This book exposes so much and gives some amazing insights into the lives of some of the most powerful, influential and wealthy people in America as well as abroad. Henry Kissinger for one needs to be tried in a court of law and if found guilty of the many crimes this book alone alleges, should then be locked up for good if not executed for treason and much much more. I can not believe he is still manipulating things so masterfully and actively as he has been lately still pushing and pushing for and working hard to make real his New World Order fantasy our new nightmarish reality. All this with out being scrutinized more thoroughly by the media but because he seems to be protected by the media he does not facing more of an outcry. Yes it appears that his hands are very bloody indeed and his intellect through time has proven to be that of a criminal genius only offering the world more human tragedy as he hides behind the facade of being a harmless intellectual who really cares. I admire the courage of the victim of this drama and so grateful she survived it and has lived to not only escape it but even more important to expose it! I encourage everyone who care at all to know what is really going on in this country to read this book. With out this information we would truly be in the dark. This book has transformed the way I see what has and what is going on in the United States of America at the highest levels of power and money.

You have to be in a philosophical mood to read a book like this, which I am regularly. I was taken by the use of scriptures from the world's religions, so that the 12 spiritual laws really have the air of being the truth behind the truth, the essential principles behind all principles. Fascinating new spins on old ideas like karma and spiritual tests, and illustrated by the author's experiences.

The subtitle however, \\"the twelve laws that govern our universe\\"; puts this book in a category, for me at least, of \\"thoughtful, or thought-provoking\\". And Dr. Frederick Swarts not only delivers in that regard, he educates. As an authority of sorts in both scientific and religious fields his perspective on these twelve cardinal success laws is most penetrating. From the chapter on the law of intention I was struck by this nugget: \\"Negative thoughts and doubts not only fail to be harmonious with the universe, but mobilize countervailing forces opposing the goal's fulfillment. This law relates to the centrality of energy in the cosmos.\\"This is Dale Carnegie meets Stephen Hawking and more. Definitely a workbook; no tripe or feel-good-candy-for-the-soul here.My one criticism of this book though, is that there are not more personal anecdotes(there are some good ones, however) and/or vivid illustrations of how these laws apply or exist in the more everyday realities of life.Overall, however, much food for thought; a helpful guidebook for self-realization and analysis that I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"The Spiritual Code : The 12 Invisible Laws That Govern Our Universe","review":"Upon reading through the 12 Spiritual Laws presented in the Spiritual Code, the sudden recognition of each was brought back to my rememberance.I attribute this to the plain writing style of the author, counter balanced with scriptural references from the religious text of the world's great religions, as well as the testimonies of how The Spiritiual Code was revealed in the author's life.The cardinal resolutions after each chapter provides codified guidance for ones life to help reinforce the Spiritual Code.

There's a story where she must interview a significant world leader...does her homework...finds out what he is REALLY interested in...which happens to be growing tomatoes in his garden. She spends her time talking to him about HIS interests, then goes for the typical interview. The lessons apply for making friends, working in any situation, communicating effectively. Ironically 35 years later I was applying this same strategy while interviewing a celebrity myself. Instead of talking about the NFL, we talked about the birth of his child.

I had just moved halfway across the country, a move I actually welcomed because I was willing to get a fresh start with a new school and new friends, if that might be possible. Nevertheless in my new environment, I was still the same shy, nerdy person I had always been - always more eager to avoid people than engage with them. At the heart of my dilemma were the twin worrisome questions: \\"What should I SAY?\\" and \\"Why did I say THAT?\\"I took the lessons of the book to heart, adopting the attitude that a good conversationalist doesn't have to say anything, but rather can ask almost anything. It helped me survive my teen years, moved me away from low self-esteem towards self-confidence, prepared me for a college degree in mass communications and is responsible in large part for making me someone that others enjoy being with."},{"Title":"How to Talk with Practically Anybody About Practically Anything","review":"Whenever I observe Barbara Walters on television she has shown calm and composure consistently.

This was the first Susan Howatch novel I've read, but it certainly won't be the last. The scope and cast of characters is simply huge, and yet is handled in a manner that you're never confused as to what is happening. The way that the author changes narrators five times during the course of the book is fabulous! Just as fabulous is the way that the plot and characters mimic true English history during the 12th to 13th centuries, with some tinkering and creative license, of course! Mark mimics Henry II, Janna mimics Eleanor of Acquitaine, Philip mimics Richard the Lionheart, ect. Overall, the story is a very human struggle where nothing is black and white, life isn't always fair, and the past mistakes of others can have massive ramifications on future generations. This is not the type of novel that can be read in a single sitting, but if you're looking for a passionate and intelligent story that will make you think, I highly recommend Penmarric."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"I also read this first when I was a young teenager and was deeply moved and involved. I went on to read her other novels thru the mid-80s, until she changed styles and settings dramatically. This year, after 5 other trips to England, I finally traveled to the actual places in Cornwall that she fictionalized in her brilliant and engaging writing. I purchased a new copy of Penmarric at a small bookshop in St Ives, and took a very sentimental tour of the Cornish landscape - windswept cemeteries, old churchyards and sprawling mansions that I first visited as a child through her eyes. It was haunting, thrilling and quite sentimental to finally be there on my 40th birthday. This book is superb, enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Penmarric was the third Howatch novel I read, and the one that got me hooked on her. The first was &quot;Sins of the Fathers&quot;, which I liked very much and so, a few years later, I read its prequel, the Rich are Different, which I also enjoyed. But it was only after coming across Penmarric - completely by accident - that I woke up and took notice. Since reading this book I have gone on to read every single one of her following novels - thirteen in all, in succession!From the first page I was engrossed in the characters. The story begins with Mark, a rather dour man, who falls in love with Janna, a woman several years his senior. These are the two central figures of the novel, which later moves on to the next generation. Howatch proves herself to be a master storyteller with the ability to get under the skin of her characters in such a way that the reader can identify with them completely - a very rare talent. Her multi-character first-person structure enables us to see the unfolding story through the eyes of five characters in turn, and it is quite amazing how a character whom one has disliked when he or she was seen through the eyes of previous narrator suddenly takes on completely new dimensions when he/she comes on central stage. I know of no writer who does this as well as Howatch.The story is set in Cornwall and begins in 1890 and goes on to span the intervening years till WWII. It is a rich and multifaceted novel, well worth reading many times to discover all its layers, and a great novel for a group discussion.

In this case King Henry (Mark), Queen Eleanor (Janna), Richard (Philip) and John Lackland (Jan-Yves) to name just the major characters. However, this technique does not distract from the great story-telling. I truly recommend this book and all of Ms. Howatch's writings."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"This is a book that I bought years ago when I was looking for something trashy and escapist. I think it was the cover art on the edition I bought that led me to believe it would be a typical historical bodice ripper, or something of that sort.Instead, it was a book I kept going back to again and again because of the character development, the writing and the plot. I really connected with the characters and the story.The author separates the book into sections, changes viewpoints from one character to the next, and explores things like \\"Virtue\\" and \\"Justice\\" through the eyes of whichever character is focused on that issue. Throughout the book, though, the main character is clearly Janna, the family matriarch, and each of the characters rotates around her and her life over the course of decades.The switch in character viewpoint is not distracting at all, in fact, it increased my sympathy for everyone in the book. I had my favorite (the neglected and unloved child Jan-Yves - the one focused on \\"justice\\" - who grew up to be funny and delightful), while other people I know who read the book had theirs.It's an easy enough read to work well on the beach, but it isn't a throw-away book at all. And it certainly isn't trashy. It's absorbing throughout, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"This was Howatch's first major novel and despite similar titles that she wrote later - cashelmara and wheel of fortune etc - it still remains her best. Fans of Howatch will know that her trademark is the first-person narrator as well as having several different characters narrate in a book. Her gift as a storyteller lies in the reader identifying with each narrator. Just as you feel disappointed that one character's narration has ended, you find that the next character's narration is just as good. Basically you can identify with several disparate characters with various motivations. Another trademark is the parallels between the lives of her characters and famous historical personages - specifically British royalty. To those who have yet to discover Susan Howatch - I envy you!"},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"I first read this book in the early 70's when I was just twelve or thirteen. I was deeply affected by the story. I connected and sympathized with Phillip and his mother (Janna). Over the years I have read this book several more times, usually every 2-3 years. Each time I read it from cover to cover and enjoy as much as the first time. Also, each time I read the book, I find that as I have grown so has my ability to understand and sympathize with other characters in the book. This is a book with characters you will enjoy and remember."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"As an avid fan of both historical fiction and English history, I was leery about reading a period-novel set at the turn of the 20th Century shaped on the actual saga of Eleanor of Aquitaine & Henry II of England & the dynasty they created. I am so glad I finally opened the pages of this book - it is a fantastic story in its own right! This is the best of Susan Howatch's sagas.Mark Castallack sucks you right in as he recounts his odd upbringing with a cold mother obsessed by the fact that her father bequeathed her family home on the Cornish Tin Coast, Penmarric, to her cousin and not to her - thanks to the unfortunate fact of her sex. As Mark comes of age, his mother makes a final maneuver for Penmarric as her cousin is dying, and the family fortunes change. Simultaneously, Mark is besotted with a local woman 11 years his senior, and together they have a brood of children - but fidelity is not Mark's strong point. Subsequently, sordid family secrets unfold, children compete for love and fortune, and family turmoil reigns for 80 years on the Cornish coast.Penmarric is a great companion to invoke late nights of endless page-turning until you reach its end. Anglophiles will love Howatch's ability to retell the birth of the Plantagenet dynasty. Readers who couldn't care less about history will simply enjoy a great story, and may find they become curious to learn more about the incredible events of the late 1100's that are the basis of this story."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"As a senior this year, we have to do a book review project. I have never been very excited about reading for school projects. I picked the book only because I would get more points for having a long book. At first, I was going to find different summaries for the projects, while reading only parts of the book. However, as I began to read, I found the story to be dull, but anxious to read on and find out more about the main characters.As I read, I found myself going back and reading pages over and over, learning more than I knew or understood before. Susan Howatch has done a wonderful job with developing her characters. She uses her characters to develop the plot. The author explores issues like \\"Honor and Dishonor\\" through her characters which symbolize the issues themselves. Through out the story, the characters are embroiled in their family problems of love and heat with Penmarric at the center of everyone's actions. The book is separated into different sections by changing family characters and using their viewpoints. The switch in characters doesn't distract you but adds a continuous flow and a constant beat to the storyline.Another intriguing aspect is the series of references used to compare characters, like Mark Castallack and Janna Roslyn, with famous historical people like Henry II and Eleanor of Acquitaine. One of their sons', Philip, mimics Richard the Lionhearted. The author also does an excellent job of comparing and contrasting the wealthy and poor. Mark is from a wealthy working-class family in Cornwall and Jana is the daughter of a fisherman from St. Ives. The character I had the most sympathy for was Jan-Yves.She writes the story in a multi-character first-person structure sets it in Cornwall. The storyline begins in 1890 and goes on to span the intervening years till WWII. The story spans three generations beginning with Mark's childhood, and ends with his youngest child's adulthood. The story is set in various parts of England and begins in 1890 and spans the years until World War II. It highlights many life lessons, human struggles, and family problems where nothing is black or white, life isn't always fair, and past mistakes can have cause problems on future generations. The Boston Globe review states: \\"Penmarric is filled with life-long hatreds, secret love-affairs, and stolen inheritances.\\"Many people believe Susan Howatch wrote this book as a religious aspect. However, I find that hard to believe since she didn't come from a religious background. In my opinion Susan Howatch wrote Penmarric to tell her own family saga. I recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"One of Susan Howatch's earlier historical novels, this uses the same template found in later works such as Cashelmara and The Wheel of Fortune. A set of historical figures (in this case, English King Henry II, his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine, Henry's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Richard the Lionhearted, and King John) are transposed into more recent times (1890-1945).Set in Cornwall, the plot closely parallels the story of Henry II (although there is no Becket). For most of the novel, this works well: the Cornish setting is beautifully described, the characters are sharply drawn, and Howatch's first-rate prose keeps the narrative flowing.Unfortunately, the story begins to run out of steam towards the end. Part of the problem may be that Howatch is trying to trace the pattern of historical events too closely, limiting the plot. But the tension between the characters dissipates and the final chapter is more a series of events than a plot, lacking suspense and becoming excessively talky.As with The Wheel of Fortune (which I read first), the focus is on relationships, and historical events have little impact on the characters. World War I has the largest effect, as certain characters do not survive, but World War II is almost an afterthought. More importantly, the immense changes in English life between 1890 and 1945 are glancingly referred to, but play little part in the story. So as a historical novel, it doesn't really bring the period to life.The novel is at its best in the first three parts, and slows down after that. I actually skimmed the last 30 pages just to find out what happened; but for a 735-page book, that's faint criticism. This is a good one to read if you're more interested in characterization and relationships than historical events."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"I first read this book over 30 years ago.Since then I have read countless books, in many book clubs, Man Booker Prize books, Orange Prize books, Pullitzer Prize books, many excellent books but every 5 years or so I always come back to Penmarric.What is it about Penmarric that I love so much?The 5 different narrators telling the same overlapping story is a stroke of genius. The author ellicits sympathy from the reader for each of the characters who often turn out to be enemies. The historical parallel with King John is fascinating. The Cornish setting is enchanting and romantic.The story is fast-paced and exciting, the change of narrator bringing fresh interest. But best of all is the characterisation which is simply superb.Penmarric survives the test of time. It is a book I grew up with, starting as a teenager and then a wife and mother. Each time I read it I get a fresh take on it. Each time I simply love it."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Penmarric is a novel that is mostly based upon the Plantagenets--specifically, Henry II, Eleanor, and their children. This novel takes the Penmar/Castellack/Parrish families from 1890 up through the end of WWII. Penmarric is the family estate (loosely correlating to the English throne); and the story is told from the POV of five of them: Mark Castellack (i.e., Henry), his wife Janna (Eleanor), Adrian (Henry's illegitimate son Geoffrey), Philip (Richard) and Jan Ives (John).The story follows that of the Plantagenets closely. If you're familiar with the story of Henry and his family, you might think you know what will happen here--but Susan Howatch adds quite a new dimension to the story of the Castellacks and their family home. I love multi-generational stories of families and old houses, and this one was no exception. I loved watching these characters grow and mature over the course of more than fifty years. Each of the narrators is unique, and tells their side of the story from a different vantage point. They are all very realistic and make mistakes, but that makes them all the more relatable. Janna/Eleanor disappears after she's said her piece, but what can you reasonably expect when Eleanor spent a good portion of her life imprisoned?I was a little disappointed in this book in one way, however; the conflict between Mark and his sons wasn't quite as pronounced as Henry's was with his. Still, there's an incredible amount of tension, and I enjoyed watching things play out. I never really knew what was going to happen. I loved the authors descriptions of Cornwall, too--this is the kind of book that makes a reader want to visit the place described in it! While not \\"great\\" historical fiction, this is the kind of engrossing novel that I read in great big chunks at a time. I can't wait to read some of the other books by Susan Howatch that I've got on the TBR list--this book is my first by her and definitely not the last! Definitely recommended if you enjoy big, sprawling family sagas."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Penmarric begins as Mark Castallack and his mother Maud, cheated out of their inheritance by a scheming relative, wage a years long court battle to regain possession of the lands of Penmar and the great house that sits upon it, Penmarric. After twelve years and almost losing hope, fate takes a turn as the wastrel son of the current owner dies and a very young Mark is named heir to all of it. Mark marries Janna, who is ten years older, and has a bit of a surprise in store for him from a past relationship - but then Mark has one or two surprises for Janna as well. Building their family dynasty as the new owners of Penmarric, Janna and Mark slowly drift apart until an accidental meeting forever changes their lives, although a new one also begins as a result of that violent night.Told in five \\"books\\", each one in the first person POV of Mark, Janna, and three of Mark's sons, the family's story takes the reader from Cornwall of the late 19C into the 20C through WWII as the next generation of Castallacks battle for ownership of the Penmar estate and the power that comes with it. The middle of the book was bit slow at times, although I _loved_ the last two books telling Phillip's and Jan's stories and the always volatile relationship between the two brothers and their constant battle to be named heir.If you like those big fat family sagas set in the past with feuding back-biting siblings I'd definitely give this one a whirl - although this one has quite a twist that you don't normally see in a book - the Castallack family and their story parallels that of Henry II, Eleanor, Richard I (the Lionheart) and the always delightfully evil King John. Ultimately, that is half the fun of this book for those reasonably familiar with Henry and his devil's brood - can you pick out which of Mark's sons are young Hal, Geoffrey, Richard and John? Henry's fate after the ultimate betrayal by his sons? Spot Rosamund Clifford, the illegitimate sons Geoffrey and William Longspee? And best of all is how the author resolves the mystery that still haunts us to this day - the ultimate fate of young Arthur, John's rival claimant to the throne of England.All in all a pretty darn good read, and I plan on trying a few more from this author. Apparently she continues her \\"Plantagenet\\" saga with two more books, Cashelmara and Wheel of Fortune dealing with the three Edwards. I understand John of Gaunt is in the latter and I very much hope she throws Katherine Swynford in there as well. I'm sorely torn between four and five stars so I'll call it 4.5 rounded up to 5."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"This is the first historical I read by Susan Howatch many years ago. She&#8217;s my favorite author and I loved rereading it on my Kindle.Penmarric tells the story of the Plantagenets, Henry II through John I, but set in the tin mining country of Cornwall. Penmarric is the manor house that represents England and the Castallack family history mirrors that of the Plantagenets.Being a history buff, I enjoy seeing how Howatch handles the various historical events in a fictional setting. It&#8217;s interesting that she implies that (using the real names) Geoffrey was not Henry II&#8217;s biological father. The only place I&#8217;ve ever read that was in The Conquering Family by Thomas B. Costain. (Just noticed Costain&#8217;s books have been kindleized but they are very, very pricey.)Even knowing the history as I do, Howatch&#8217;s writing is so powerful that the story seems fresh and new and I feel like I&#8217;m floating through the Middle Ages.If you haven&#8217;t read Howatch before, Penmarric is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Read it many years ago and enjoyed it very much again!

I love it!"},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Great saga. I loved this book, I grew up in England and I love to revisit the past - so to speak."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Penmarricis the name of a family estate in England that Mark Castallack vows to own one day at all costs. The story starts in the late 1800's and ends after World War II. Mark Castellack is a young boy who is most of the time in trouble and as an adult becomes quite ruthless in his love life. He fathers a large family and the book tells his story and the story of his heirs.Susan Howatch is a master story teller. The story is told in different sections, starting with Mark Castallack, and then sections are told by his wife Janna Roslyn and then his sons. The story takes place in Cornwall, England and the descriptions of the bleak country side and the lives of the Castellack family are told so beautifully that you feel you have entered that time and place.This is the second book by Howatch that I have read and Penmarric is well worth reading especially if you like historical family sagas. Everything is here - love, lust, greed, tragedy and forgiveness. A solid 5 star read."},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Before she got absorbed with her interminable Church of England series, Howatch wrote two books that had their basis in English History. \\"Penmarric\\" is about a family in the late 19th/early 20th century. Their lives follow the lives of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. The story is told from the perspective of each of the main characters, one following the other in chronological order. At the beginning of each narrative, Howatch inserts quotes relating the event in actual history, then proceeds to tell a spell binding story. The character of Mark Castellack is based on Henry II . Janna is the Eleanor character. Stephen is Richard the Lion heart. Jan Yves is Bad King John.It's a fascinating book for anyone who likes period pieces, but if you're an English history buff, Penmarric and her next book, Cashelmara, are must reads! The story flows effortlessly and you will not want to put it down!"},{"Title":"Penmarric","review":"Once you read the first chapter you are hooked , I could not put this down and read it on the bus, in the bath and at bedtime and had to ration the chapters.

I have to admit I read and reread the hardcover edition until the binding fell apart. It is delicious! I do remember trying to read Cashelmara, but can't remember why I didn't finish.

They don't, however, proselitize, and this is much to their credit. In fact, they go to some lengths to inform the reader that an active pro-drugs &quot;for the sake of drugs&quot; mindset is fraught with peril, and do so in a way that is both impartial and learned.They're at their best, however, in their extraordinary recounting of the psychedelic experiences they conducted themselves as guides. There are so many instances where the subject, usually a person with a very intense psychological or emotional problem, arrived at a life-changing breakthrough, that it lingers long in the mind.But the book is most of all a primer for their very lucid theory of the psychedelic experience and its various stages or levels. It is, in fact, so well thought out and explained, that this reviewer wonders why it had so little impact on the great body of psychedelic research, even after all these years.

The book covers the myriad aspects of &quot;the trip&quot; from perceptions of the human body to the deep religious experience.The book is somewhat more scholarly than the works of someone like Timothy Leary but this is what is needed if this movement is to ever regain its legitimacy in the eyes of the general public. While it does not condone the illegal use of the drugs, it decries their suppression and the utter halt of legitimate research into these fascinating and important substances. Read it with an open mind, but remember that the drugs are illegal and therefore also potentially dangerous. That aside, the book will almost certainly spark your curiousity."},{"Title":"The varieties of psychedelic experience,","review":"Very well written.

They don't, however, proselitize, and this is much to their credit. In fact, they go to some lengths to inform the reader that an active pro-drugs &quot;for the sake of drugs&quot; mindset is fraught with peril, and do so in a way that is both impartial and learned.They're at their best, however, in their extraordinary recounting of the psychedelic experiences they conducted themselves as guides. There are so many instances where the subject, usually a person with a very intense psychological or emotional problem, arrived at a life-changing breakthrough, that it lingers long in the mind.But the book is most of all a primer for their very lucid theory of the psychedelic experience and its various stages or levels. It is, in fact, so well thought out and explained, that this reviewer wonders why it had so little impact on the great body of psychedelic research, even after all these years.

Some of the hallmarks are charming, some exasperating, some hilarious. (See Hallmark #12, \\"Grace\\" - depicting oblivious cat strolling along mantelpiece as bric-a-brac tumbles behind her... Well, OK, maybe that one's hilarious when it's somebody else's bric-a-brac.)It would have been nice if there were more strips included in the book, but it's still a charming, funny collection that I consider a must-have for the cat-humor section of the bookshelf.

Also, the two color (black and a kind of pinkish) halftone (with rather large dots) detracts from the enjoyment of the book somewhat. Still, these are minor gripes, and some may prefer the glossy paper and unorthodox reproduction. In any case Hallmarks of Felinity is funny stuff, and well worth reading.

As I did with Murray Ball's Footrot Flats, I marvel at the amount of effort McEldowney puts into every panel...including, recently in 9 Chickweed Lane, the occasional use of airbrushed highlights. His characters are real, his angles cinematic (sometimes experimentally so), his line remarkably fluid (reminding me of Norman McLaren's landmark short film PAX DE DEUS, for the National Film Board of Canada), his knowledge of music a bonus joy, and most important of all, he's funny. He's also a genuine romantic, a true rarity in comics.While 9 Chickweed Lane (and Pibgorn) collections are long overdue (are you listening, Andrews & McNeel?), in the interim we must make do with Hallmarks of Felinity.

It accomplishes its objective by inviting its reader to go back over the same biblical narratives numerous times, viewing the text through a different lens on each visit. One is trained to seek out each story's hero, a concept that is linked to the notion of quest (the effort to solve a problem). Fokkelman believes that the distance separating us from the biblical stories is not to be feared, since a well-written story will 'come into its own' when it meets an attentive reader. The book places the concepts and nomenclature of narratology in the hands of the Bible reader, whose subjectivity is not to be lamented. Rather, it is the sphere in which he encounters the text's art. Meaning is conferred in the interplay of the reader who bestows it and the text which in some sense 'has' it.A skilful narrator uses both 'narrative' and 'narrated' time. That narrator is a pose, an attitude, omniscient and anonymous, indeed a veritable ringmaster, a master over characters whose truth may or may not be that of the narrator himself, a puppeteer manipulating his characters and his readers 'who hardly knows when to stop'. In this narratalogical world, even God is a character who answers to the narrator's sovereign whim. It is our responsibility to ferret out the storyteller's ideology by means of the way he intervenes in his stories to provide information and description.Fokkelman returns time and again to the genius of a good narrator, who by selecting elements of action and passion constructs a plot that enables us to detect its hero and that hero's quest. The way he structures a narrative-astutely employing time and space, entrances and exits-allows him to conceal his values where the well-trained (and structuralist?) reader will find the treasure. The narrator himself is a veteran of 'extensive training' in exploiting multiple forms of repetition, with their varying degrees of similarity and contrast.The narrator also controls the flow of knowledge, manipulating the points of view his characters are permitted to disclose and thus shaping the menu of perspectives which his readers might choose to assume. Usually he is stingy with his own viewpoint and values, which may or may not match those of God, as the narrator perceives them. The narrator's work may be complemented at the level of act, cycle, and longer prose compositions by that of one or more editors, though Fokkelman appears to treat both of these literary actors under the rubric of the narrator. Certainly, the editor-also anonymous-is every bit as intentional about his purpose as the narrator, a feature which allows us to enjoy good books as well as good stories.Fokkelman dedicates one chapter to exploring the 'collaboration' of prose and poetry, a topic which hints at his subsequent Reading Biblical Poetry. After establishing what differentiates the two forms of discourse, Fokkelman alleges that the hybrid style of the biblical writer 'relativizes, or even mocks and annihilates the distinction'. A penultimate chapter extends the 'main questions of narratology' to the New Testament's synoptic gospels. A final chapter offers helpfully suggestive questions for a reader to ask of is text, together with suggestions for further study.Though this book is not the kind of easy read that its title might suggest, it is a worthwhile and occasionally unsettling book for the biblical critic. In the course of his descriptions, Fokkelman treats us to various masterful readings (for example, of the Gideon story, pp. 126-130). He underscores his fascination with the biblical narrator and his negative views regarding historical-critical praxis, convictions that do not escape a certain irony. For example, after rather severely limiting the space in which the text's and writer's intention may be taken into account, Fokkelman ascribes to the narrator a far more sophisticated intentionality than even those scholars whom he critiques normally allow. As for the reader, Fokkelman uses morally-charged language to refer to that person's labour (for example, his 'duty', p. 117; the need to 'perform our task correctly', p. 146; the counsel, 'Do not be tempted to speculate on \\"how it really was,\\" there and then, so far away and so long ago, in that utterly alien culture', p. 207) Indeed, his chapter on the New Testament ends with the rhetorical question, 'What exactly is the difference between disciple and reader?'There is no doubt but that the biblical narrator is the hero of Fokkelman's story. Careful reading of this book will provide fresh insight into that person's craft, quest, and product."},{"Title":"Reading Biblical Narrative: An Introductory Guide","review":"A recommended pick for religious library collections, J.P. Fokkelman's Reading Biblical Narrative provides a basic primer on how to approach the scriptures. The poetry and prose of both Old and New Testaments are detailed in examples which offer step-by step analysis to help readers understand how to analyze the passages."},{"Title":"Reading Biblical Narrative: An Introductory Guide","review":"Fokkelman believes that reading is the action of conferring meaning to a text, is only realised through the mediation of the reader and scarcely taken into account by those who seek to interpret texts as coming from a different place, in a different day and a different culture. He thinks the biblical texts deserve better. Tell them to a good listener and they will quickly come into their own. So subjectivity is \`in' and what follows is a training manual for readers with no knowledge of the original languages.After applying his principles to selection of biblical stories he suggests a further hundred on which the reader can exercise his imagination, together with ten productive questions and suggestions for further reading.The gap between Fokkelman's theory and execution will present no problems to the literary professionals but may prove a handicap to those less skilled, while the emphasis on hero, plot and winners, though helpful to beginners, may stifle more imaginative and creative approaches in others, and it is sometimes easier to see the value of his challenge to the traditional interpretations than to appreciate what is added by his alternatives.

Corman isn't just the smartest filmmaker in Hollywood -- he might just be the best."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"The funniest random comment from Roger Corman in this book related to the use of stock footage: Corman mentioned that when he was filming the Edgar Allan Poe series (Poe was popular since all of his tales were in public domain)that nobody associated with the productions ever envisioned the home video market would permit film students and others to analyze the films on a frame by frame basis! One oft used fire sequence was economically obtained when Corman paid the owner of a barn, who had obtained a burning permit to demolish the dilphidated structure, a few dollars to photograph the razing of the barn. The collapsing rafters from the flaming roof appeared in film after film.Roger Corman managed to learn enough about filmmaking to become a profitable commodity. He avoided the major studios with one exception: \\"The St. Valentine's Day Massacre.\\" This celebrated cult film was shot on the backlot of 20th Century Fox and featured just about every heavy and extra who had ever appeared on the television series \\"The Untouchables.\\" Corman was foiled in his bid to cast Orson Welles as Al Capone. Studio executives feared that Welles would wrest control of the film away from Corman and begin directing the movie. Fox contract player Jason Robards, who was to have played Bugs Moran, was quickly recast as a malnourished Scarface, and Ralph Meeker was substituted as Moran. Corman regulars, Jack Nicholson, Dick Miller and Bruce Dern can also be glimpsed in the finished film. This cult favorite was the closest that Corman ever came to the Hollywood mainstream.Corman was steadily employed as a cost conscious producer and director who got most of his projects completed on time and under budget. He was an advocate of getting every last dollar's worth of production values up on the screen. The sole exception was \\"The Intruder.\\" This civil rights message picture about a bigoted political agitator was the only Corman film to lose money in its initial release.Roger Corman's greatest legacy may well be the number of actors and directors who launched their celebrated careers in his B minus films.

Still, this book is a nice look into the world of low-budget producing. It gave me the opportunity to truly understand my disdain for Corman and AIP.Most of the book focuses on three or four of the productions Corman is most proud of. I would have preferred him spending additional time on his more obscure films. Teenage Caveman only gets a paragraph or two written about it.A documentary would have been a more appropriate format for this material than a book. It would have been much shorter that way at the very least. Then again, Corman always had a knack for dragging things out in his films. Ever seen Swamp Diamonds?The main theme of the book seems to be, \\"Yeah, Corman's films were bad, but he did pretty good for what he had.\\" That doesn't take away the fact that they're bad films. Don't watch them unless you have a high threshold of pain."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"First of all the title of this book is false, as Roger definitely states he did not only lose money on a few pictures, but even had an entire year he didn't turn a profit with his movies. But overall he has had incredible success and there's no denying that.The book does get into some decent stories on the very old pictures, and a few of the more recent ones ('recent' as to when the book was written). The thing is, many readers may remember the more recent movies more fondly and be disappointed about the lack of info. \\"Cannonball\\" from 1976 wasn't even mentioned for instance, nor was \\"Deathsport,\\" and there could have been a lot more info on \\"Death Race 2000,\\" just to name a few. And Paul Bartel was barely even mentioned at all.There are a lot of good Dick Miller stories though, and the book is sprinkled with anecdotes from people who have worked with Roger, even Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda talk about things. However, as the book progresses, Roger's liberalism starts to creep on through, and he kinda makes it sound like everyone in the south is some kind of racist (especially when shooting \\"The Intruder\\"). I wonder how he feels about the racism that so many of his fellow liberals exhibit these days.Roger also admits to being dishonest - he made it quite clear that he and his team at any given time would deliberately edit trailers to make it seem like a much different movie than what was being advertised, having people expect something else than what they were really paying to see. Sometimes he would even insert lively scenes in the trailer that were not even in the actual movie. He very clearly states that these deceits were to get people to pay for what he knew was a sub-par picture. I know business is business, but this was a turn-off.So yes this definitely is a decent read overall, but best just take it out for free from the library."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"Given the title, I was expecting more of a movie making manual type of book like \\"Make Your Own Damn Movie\\" by Lloyd Kaufman.

(Mr. Corman muses some on why he never &quot;sold out&quot; to the majors and also why the European community has accorded him more respect, but these are fortunately brief segments.)In the meantime the reader is treated to many of the adventures Corman and his ensemble braved to make his movies, some insights on how to squeeze the most out of a small budget, and a refreshingly forthright attitude about money and movies.The book could stand an update, as Mr. C has been busy in the past decade, but it's still a worthwhile read as is."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"A terrific book, loaded with great stories and anecdotes about the world of low-budget film making-- from its heyday in the 50's and 60's, to the 1980's, when the industry kind of petered out because the major studios began making the types of visceral horror, science fiction, and exploitation movies previously reserved for &quot;quickie&quot; independent producers like Mr. Corman. It was fun to read this book and rent some of the films as they were being discussed. Another plus: the book is peppered with informative and revealing guest essays by the likes of Francis Coppola, Joe Dante, Martin Scorcese, Jack Nicholson, and various other directors, actors, and producers who worked with and/or got their start with Roger Corman. Though most of the comments about Mr. Corman in these essays are predictably laudatory, we are also allowed to read the occasional critical or negative observation, which permits the reader to get a nicely balanced view of the subject. The book is rounded out by a great selection of photos from the dozens of movies covered."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"Considering the book is about Roger Corman the shallowness might be understandable.The book is a retrospective of some of his movies and a little bit of the life he spent around them. The anecdotes are interesting and for the most part the book is well written.The main problem that I had with the book is the length and the lack of detail about the movies and the making of them. In only a couple of cases does he go into any real depth. Most of the movies are limited to a few paragraphs.I think that I would have preferred a book with fewer movies being covered but greater depth of coverage.All in all a good book for those that are fans of Roger's films, as I am. However don't expect any major revelations."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"Roger Corman wrote \\"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime\\" in 1990, reflecting on a 35-year career making movies, during which he was nearly always in production. The title of the book should be taken literally. Corman tells us just how he directed or produced the low-budget independent films for which he is famous. After giving a brief account of his early life, Corman dives into his career of non-stop filmmaking, launched by \\"The Monster from the Ocean Floor\\", made for $12,000 in 1954, through directing films for American International Pictures 1955-1969, producing youth-oriented exploitation films and distributing foreign art films for his own company New World Pictures 1970-1982, and finally his focus on the home video market in the 1980s.Corman learned the business of making movies as he went along, so he takes the reader though the financing and production of many of his movies, his mistakes, his philosophy, and his legendary efficiency. The recollections of people who worked with Corman, many of whom got their start in the unofficial \\"Corman School\\", are scattered throughout the text. These add an interesting variety of perspectives. Among those who chime in with their thoughts on working with Corman are actors Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, and Vincent Price, directors Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, John Sayles, and Francis Coppola, and Corman's wife and associate producer Julie Corman.Corman's disdain for bureaucracy, his many methods of penny-pinching, his attempts to inject social relevance into exploitation films, his commitment to making films to suit the market (or even to suit the sets!), and his almost infallible instincts for what people want to see come across strongly. Corman's obsessive thrift seems almost pathological at times. He might have done better to spend a little more money here and there and to have more concern for his cast and crew's safety. But the ways in which he managed time, re-used sets and footage, and got people to do things for cheap would be helpful to anyone trying to break into the business on a low budget. Corman filmed \\"The Little Shop of Horrors\\" in 2 days on a leftover soundstage. It's one of the cheapest and most enduring films he made."},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"I'm not sure of how I happened upon this biography, but I'm glad I did. I'm not particularly a Roger Corman fan, having seen perhaps three or four of his films without really noticing that Corman had a part in their making.Corman's life is interesting. Not only was he probably the most successful independent filmaker in history, he was also mentor and first-chance for many of today's leading producers, directors, writers and stars.Remarkably down to earth and honest, Corman admits that his life has not been totally fulfilling: like many successful people, success is never enough - there's always one more challenge down the road and more than one challenge left unexplored in the past.Corman engages in some, but not deep, analysis of his films, explains his evolving political philosophy and provides snippets that from another author might be construed as name-dropping. But Corman was there and it's his interactions with these people he's talking about, so it's not in the least obnoxious.Above all, the value of Corman's book may not be to film buffs, but to business people, especially small scale entrepreneurs. Corman's management methods and his approach to filmaking were true nose-to-the-grindstone. He knew his market; he studied his market; he created his product to appeal to his market and he kept costs down to a minimum in order to reduce his risk of loss.Quite a guy and his biography is worth the couple of hours it takes to read it.Jerry"},{"Title":"How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime","review":"First, this is really a 1990 book, and all information pertains to 1988 and prior. I enjoy exploitation films and this book adds to my enjoyment. Many films today are boring and darkly filmed. Just a bunch of special effects done on a computer. It's nice to know that many of Roger Corman films are still available. Maybe not at you local Wal Mart, but they do appear on TV occasionally.

But it proved very useful to me far beyond that. I had tickets for a performance of this particular play and was taking my adult son who had never been to a Shakespeare play but wanted to please me on my birthday. We spent the dinner hour prior to the play reading the clear synopses at the top of each page which helped enormously toward the enjoyment of the night for him. I have also read through the entire book and besides being very pleased with the beautiful photographs of several versions (some in color) enjoyed imagining the outcome of the many workshop exercises for actors.

I didn't realize that it could also be a great version for adults!For many of the students in my class, this will be their first Shakespeare play *in the original language* and *unabridged*. This version makes the entire play so much more accessible. Each page has Shakespeare's text on the right side and an explanation on the left (a quick summary at the top, plus explanations of unusual phrases/words below that). In addition, many pages include photos of different versions of that very scene.Plus, the book has several color photos of various productions and includes teaching ideas. The book is so good that I already gave my copy away and have to order more for the class, so I can't refer to it right now to add additional details for the review! This book was a lovely surprise and well worth the money.I own The Riverside Shakespeare, so I didn't think I needed another edition of any of Shakespeare's plays. This book proved me wrong.

In Piers Anthony's thought provoking book, On a Pale Horse, Zane finds Fate is a lot more than just a figure of speech. Anthony paints a wonderfully realistic fantasy world that blends the benefits of advanced technology and the mystical powers of magic. The book is nothing less than a masterpiece of literature.Zane is an intellectual with very bad luck. He is described as \\"a young man of no particular stature or distinction of feature, with acne scars that neither medication nor spot-spell had been able to eradicate entirely. His hair dishwater brown and somewhat unkempt, his teeth were unfashionably irregular. He was obviously a depressive type.\\"After getting cheated out of true love by a sales manager, he decides that the world isn't worth living in anymore. As he raises a gun to his head, the Grim Reaper himself walks in the door. Zane, feeling a sudden impulse to live, shoots Death right in his skeletal ghastly face, inadvertently killing him. At that moment, Zane is reinstated as the new Death and is swept into a fast pace adventure that includes romance, divine corruption, evil monsters from Hell itself, and Death's personal transportation unit, a pale horse named Mortis who can change into a car, a speedboat, and a plane at will.There are some of you who may not understand how Death may travel about the world collecting the souls of all who die. Piers Anthony creates a novel theory of how the Grim Reaper goes about collecting souls. When people die, their souls will usually get themselves to heaven and hell without assistance. Only a small percentage needs the personal assistance of Death to collect and weigh their souls. The souls that are \\"in the balance,\\" or have an equal amount of sin and goodness, are the ones that require the presence of Death.For those of you who like romance, Zane gets himself plenty of it. Luna, the daughter of a powerful magician is forced into an evil plan, which involves her death; this will eventually allow Hell to gain easy access to all the souls of the world. Her father pushed his own sin onto Luna in order to put his soul into the balance so that he may have a meeting with Zane when he dies. Because of the weight of both her own sins and her father's, her soul is polarized to hell. Zane is called upon by her father to protect her from the forces of hell. Luna's father knows that if he can keep Luna alive long enough, she will be able to save the world from the forces of hell. As Death, Zane will offer her far more protection than any regular man. As Zane, he will redeem her soul and send her heavenward. This is just one of the many storylines that are in On a Pale Horse.On a Pale Horse is a great read for all you adventure, fantasy, and sci-fi fans, as it is a superb mixture of all three. I loved the clever splice of the three genres. Piers Anthony's fantasy world was a not-so-distant future where science and magic coincide. Ghosts and warlocks stroll causally down the street next to everyday normal people just trying to get by. It is a world full of surprises and exciting activity.Piers Anthony's defining writing style makes this story a fun and intriguing adventure that introduces interesting and original characters like the other incarnations of immortality: Fate, Time, and Nature. Even God makes a cameo appearance in one of Death's soul collecting jobs. On a Pale Horse is the first in the series of books, called \\"The Incarnations of Immortality,\\" where the other books explain more about each of these characters. However, this book is by far the best in the series.One a Pale Horse is a wonderfully complex book with many subplots and interesting theories. I would recommend it for those interested in both fantasy and science fiction. However, those of you who like strong characters and a fascinating plotline will also enjoy this book. If I were to grade this book, I would definitely give it an \\"A\\"."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the first Piers Anthony novel I have read, so I was kind of blindsided by the fantasic elements found in the book. I almost gave up on the story when Zane encountered his first flying carpet, as I am not a huge fantasy fan. But the character of Zane kept me reading, and I was intrigued by the idea of the personification of Death as a novel's protagonist. I have to say I really enjoyed the story, and liked learning, as Zane did, about the duties Death must perform. I liked the idea of someone trying to do their best and carry out Death's job with compassion and feeling. I took the story as a light fantasy, I did not try to find the deeper meanings in the story as both the author and other reviewers claim can be found in \\"On A Pale Horse\\". As a nice escape from the daily grind \\"On a Pale Horse\\" does a great job, and I am anxious to read the other \\"Incarnations of Immortality\\"."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book is an adventure from the very beginning when a man named Zane is basically cheated out of what he thought was his only chance at true love and wealth. When he decides to commit suicide he is visited by a dark figure and shoots him instead. What he doesn't realize is that he has just shot Death, and now he must take on his role of office. Basic job: Go to the people whose lives are in balance of both good and evil, collect their souls, and decide whether they should be taken to Heaven, Hell, or Purgatory. On his job he meets a lovely woman named Luna Kaftan, the daughter of the Magician Kaftan who's soul is in balance. He is sent to Purgatory. Luna and Zane (Death) fall in love until Satan comes into play. Luna is supposedly going to save the world from Satan twenty years' hence, which makes for an excellent novel of love, the Incarnations, magic, science, and the battle between Good &amp; Evil."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"\\"Death fell heavily to the floor. Zane stood aghast. He had killed Death.\\" On a Pale Horse centers around Zane, an out-of-work, out-of-luck artist who just happens to wander into a shop that sells stones that do anything, from finding love to money and even to avoid death, if you can pay the hefty price that is charged. Zane, in desperation, sells his once in a lifetime chance at love for a moneystone (which in the end, turns out to be worthless) in hopes of finding great fortune to pay off his many debts. After Zane realizes he threw away his chance at love and, ironically enough, riches, he falls into despair, and as all true unstable artist, attempts suicide. Enter Death, who shocks Zane out of his suicidal mood enough to turn the gun around in self defense. On a Pale Horse lives up to Piers Anthony's extraordinary reputation. Born in 1934, Anthony's novel Ogre, Ogre may have been the first original fantasy paperback to ever make it onto the New York Times bestsellers list and in 1985 he had 50 novels under his belt.On a Pale Horse is an excellent read. Anthony's clever wording and unique views captured my attention from the beginning and held it through the end. On a Pale Horse is much more then a science fiction/fantasy novel. It deals with religion and the classifications of good and evil in our changing society. I was particularly impressed with the presentations of the characters personalities and the changing view of Zane as he continues through the novel. Zane has become one of my favorite characters of all time because he is more real and tangible, not necessarily \`good' to begin with, and creatively designed. I enjoyed reading about a character I could relate to in imperfection and in uncertinty of what is truly right. My favorite aspect of this book has to be it's reliance on the reader's point of view and leaves it up to you to decide weather what Zane does is right or not. Thought the novel has all these wonderful qualities it is not for those who are offended by differing religious views because the ideas and situations brought forth are very controversial and morally gray but if you are not, this book offers a science fiction/fantasy novel with depth and a twist."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"As a young man I read and loved Piers Anthony books for their inventive and fantastic content. As an adult I read them with new appreciation for their complexity. I understand now the shades of meaning present in his various works and I continue to re-read books from my childhood and wonder at an author who is able to convey much wisdom in the form of light-hearted fiction.On a Pale Horse begins a series that is adventurous, surreal, imaginitive and witty. If I had to pick one Piers Anthony book that every sci-fi/fantasy fan should read, this would be the one.Definitely....a good book."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This was the first Piers Anthony book I had ever read and I read it in one night. It was absolutely amazing! The storyline itself was imaginative and entertaining and kept you interested all along. But beneath the storyline there are deep values and beliefs being explored. It makes you rethink your views of life and death, good and evil, and really makes you question what your religion and beliefs. And I can say exactly the same thing for all five Incarnations of Immmortality books (Yes, I know there are seven. I haven't read the last two yet, but am looking forward to it). Each book builds on the previous and draws on the next, for an overall effect that leaves you wishing for more at the end of each book, only because you want to read more about the adventures of each of these very original and very different characters. If you've never tried Piers Anthony, I recommend starting it off with this book. And even though everyone says the books are good on their own, they are so much more together in a series. Read them in order from Death to Nature (and Satan and God too) to get the full effect Piers Anthony intended."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I am NOT a Piers Anthony fan. The vast majority of his work is drivel aimed straight at teenagers who haven't had the time to develop a decent sense of taste. This story, however, is a spectacular exception to the rule. The world, the plot, and the ideas involved are all extremely creative. Alas, the remainer of the Incarnation series (which I slogged through on the hope that he would be able to re-capture the quality of this first story) is a grand disappointment. By all means, do read this but don't be fooled into thinking that Piers Anthony's other stories are worth the trouble of reading."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I thought going into the book that it was a series that I would throughly enjoy...not so. From the description I was excited and I couldn't wait to read it. I am not sorry I read it, but after reading it I didn't want to go out and get the rest of the series. There was a little more irony involved than I usually enjoy, so if you like books like The Color of Magic, or The Big Over Easy, it is probably more your style."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"What if death, time, fate, war, nature, evil and good were not mere concepts but offices held by actual people, like any other occupation?In this first book in Anthony's Incarnations of Immortality series, a young man, Zane, is despondent over the abysmal state of his life and the poor choices he's made, and decides to kill himself. Just as he's about to pull the trigger, however, he sees the image of Death enter the room, having come for him. Instinctively, Zane shoots the intruder instead, discovering afterward that Death is an office, and that he who kills Death becomes Death. The story follows Zane has he begins to learn the ropes, collecting the souls of those who are destined to die. His new job is always interesting, if not always easy, and he receives help and advice from Mortis, Death's pale horse.I initially enjoyed this series in high school and just recently decided to give them another try to see how well they hold up 15 years later. The overall premise is just as fascinating today, but the writing feels a little stiff, especially dialogue."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I read this book based on a recommendation and am well pleased with it.The mere fact that Anthony chooses to make death the hero of the story sets it apart as unique from others right off the bat. Who ever heard of the grim reaper being the GOOD GUY? Well, that's the case with this story.Zane, the protagonist, is overwhelmed with grief at the prospect of having thrown away a virtually guaranteed romance that an enchanted gem stone has predicted would come to pass for him, trading off the woman of his dreams for a worthless junkstone that would supposedly deliver immense wealth to him. It never delivered on the promise, and so racked with despair at being swindled, Zane is about to commit suicide. Without the money he needs he will be out on the streets and the junkstone seems a painful reminder of his failure to choose a fate that might have been more kind. Just as he is about to pull the trigger, he sees the grim reaper, but instead of putting the bullet in his own brain, he turns the gun and assasinates death.Zane later finds out that the other incarnates have all arranged for this through a powerful magician that had been destined for hell... but thanks to his daughter baring the brunt of her father's sin, his soul is placed back into equilibrium and thus, he is destined for purgatory rather than hell. The trouble is that this additional burden of evil that his daughter now bares has set her soul more into a balance with evil and onto a destiny with hell.Zane is now forced to deal with the dilema of taking on the role of death, for it is the assasins responsibility to assume the role. He is incarnate now, essentially immortal from the likes of man, so long as he dons his protective cape, but he is still susceptible if he is exposed without the cape. It is his job to collect souls that are in equilibrium where there is a chance that the soul might go to either hell or heaven. Zane begins making waves in his position, trying to save people from early or undeserving deaths and trying to convince others that he saves to go on and do good in the world that their souls might be redeemed for acts of righteousness that they might ascend to heaven... but then, his conviction to do such things is a large part of the reason why the incarnate of fate, a woman who weaves a web determining what will be, has chosen him for the position.There is a problem with the magician's daughter though. (Ahh, those tricky women, the weakness of so many a hero). Death falls in love with her, but Satan is now attempting to kill her because she is destined in twenty years to defeat a political opponent that is to further Satan's agenda. But the various incarnates such as those of fate, nature and time have converged and picked Zane to assume this role because of his convictions and know that he will not just accept the status quo; that he will use his powers to fight Satan. Cool, a battle between death and Satan.All in all, a really uniquely spun story and I'm looking forward to the sequel."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Finally on Kindle!

Thankfully this is rare in this book."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Take a minute to imagine that you are suddenly responsible for death in the world. How would you feel?Piers Anthony takes an insecure, depressed character Zane and thrusts him into a role that most people would run away from. He becomes death - the office holder and the incarnation - and in this role he must not only justify his newfound purpose, but gain confidence in his abilities and intelligence so that he is able to protect a woman that he comes to love from the schemes of the devil himself.The story itself is of epic proportions, but the way that Piers Anthony develops his main character is phenomenal. I have read this book many times, and when I reach the point where Zane finally - perhaps subconsciously - realizes his full potential, I often catch myself holding my breath thinking \\"ahhh so awesome!\\"A measure of warning:This book is not in the very least appropriate for children - an older teenager perhaps - but definitely not children.The book starts slow - and has a few moments that drag on - but stick through it and you will likely be satisfied with the conclusion.Some individuals believe that Piers Anthony's portrayal of women can be disrespectful and limited. I have never personally noted this as a problem - it's a book and he is writing from the perspective of the main character. I can see, however, where his writing in this book and other books often portray women in the role of the seductress - not in a negative way - simply the way the main characters - who are often men - view the moment.Overall I very much enjoy this book, and recommend it to anyone interested in hearing a new perspective of the role of death in the world, or simply someone looking for a good read to relax to after a hard day of work."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is a fantastic series, which I highly enjoyed.

I read the whole series in three months, which is a miracle for me. On a pale horse is the book that got me into reading. If not for my friend handing me this book I probably would never have enjoyed books so much."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On A Pale Horse is a great start to a wonderful exploration of &quot;possibilities.&quot; Easily one of the &quot;strongest&quot;, if not the strongest book in the series. Although I'm not usually drawn to fantasy, some friends felt I would appreciate this series because of the concept of the &quot;offices of immortality.&quot; They were right!! The different methods of attaining the various offices was consistent with the characteristics of the characters. Particularly intriguing was how each new office holder had to struggle to determine his or her strengths, limitations, and purpose--something we must all do every day. I found Thanatos and Satan to be very compelling characters. The treatment of these two by the author is decidedly different from what we've come to believe of such nefarious personifications. Although not all the books in this series maintain the same level of anticipatory immersion by the reader as this one; and some seem to wander endlessly while trying to explore some thought-provoking concepts, this series will get you involved and make you &quot;think.&quot; I found I couldn't wait for the next installment. A wonderful experience!!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"The Incarnations of Immortality books made me cancel my 74 channel cable habit. I read On a Pale Horse in a bout two weeks. It took me a few months to pick up the second book (Bearing an Hourglass) But within two days after finishing it, I had gone to my local book store and completed my collection of the series. It only took about a month then to finish the remaining 5 books. Thank You for reassuring us that there are things out there better than T.V."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I love sci-fi, but I hate fantasy. This book has a lot of each. That's good. Piers Anthony took an oddball concept and made it into a very good book. He casts death in a hilarious light, and, with the addition of some cool gadgets, makes a sort of twisted James Bond tale, with the hero really having a licence to kill. Zane (Death) Is one of the most interesting characters I've ever read, and Satan is amusingly like a typical lawyer. However, my main point about this book, and what stops it from being one of my favorites, is that around chapter eight it starts taking itself to seriously. Up until the eighth chapter, this book deserves five sars. After that, it sort of sinks. The tour in hell and the final confrontation aboard the Satanic Sattilite do a lot to restore the appeal that made the first half of the book so entertaining. I look forward to reading the other Incarnations of Immortality books, and I hope they're at least as good as this was. READ IT. Or at least the first half."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Set in a &quot;modern&quot; world where science is in perpetual conflict with magic, this is the tale of Zane, a mixed-up Everyman, destined to play Death after he accidentally kills the former visage of the Grim Reaper. Fascinating and amusing look into the life of an &quot;incarnation of immortality&quot; (as indicated by the series' title). If you ever wonder how Death manages to gather souls in such little time and whether or not he/she has a love life, read this book. Fabulous fantasy from the equally fabulous Piers Anthony."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is a wild, stunningly surreal story, that plays with archetypical ideas of life, death, heaven and hell. Piers Anthony mixes fantasy with everyday situations in such a unrestricted manner, that it just keeps surprising you. It has a perfect balance of humor (from the absurdity of certain concepts) and suspense (for he makes you love the characters). As long as you do accept the weirdness of Piers's universe, you're gonna have a great time reading this thoughtful novel."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I first read this book when i was 14 in 8th grade i guess.I beceme an instant fan of PIERS ANTHONY.the whole incarnations series is exceelent.i just re-read on ON A PALE HORSE it was even better this time,maybe because i've matured or i just caught more of it. this series will make you think"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"So many times, an author's earlier works are the best...and we have here a wonderful example of such. This isn't typical of what you're likely to find nowadays from a Piers Anthony novel. Not only highly entertaining, but extremely thought-provoking. You will contemplate your own beliefs about good and evil, life and death...."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It deals with DEATH in a humerous, but human way. On the surface, this book is simply a fantasy book about a man who has to assume the job of death and his problems in dealing with that task. I especially like the mixture of science and magic that appears in this book. If you are very religious do not read this book, it can be extremely thought provoking regarding religion. I especially like the phrase &quot;God created the world, but the Devil evolved it.&quot; I also recommend the other books in this series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This one is played straight. The premise being that being an Incarnation is a career, and your average people get to do it. The book is surprisingly good, as it delves into the theme. This, of course, is Death, (with a capital D) for those not familiar with the quotation the title alludes to.Cloak, grim reaper, scythe, that sort of thing."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"The Incarnations of Immortality is one of Piers Anthony's best series. He's associated so much with the widely read, widely popular Xanth -- but this book, and the 6 following it, are highly superior.First of all, the main character is a bit different from Piers' norm. Almost all male Anthony leads are the same -- naive, oversexed, and only redeemable by the virtue of having a high sense of integrity. Zane, Pale Horse's hero, isn't quite like that. He is, actually damned in the eyes of God. He killed his mother...something Bink or Dor or Darius or any other Anthony hero wouldn't consider. He's suicidal -- not uncommon in the author's works, but uncommon at this level in males. He even acts like an adult. He's more interesting than any of Anthony's other males, and I actually -liked- him.This book itself deals with death, Heaven and Hell, and God and Satan. The setting is the near future, with magic complementing technology. People fly around on magic carpets, advertised on billboards in big cities. Zane is a young man down on his luck, who is about to become the next Incarnation of Death -- the Grim Reaper, who flies around his pale horse to collect the souls of the recently deceased.This novel deals with more complex ideas than normal -- it is not fluff. It shows God as inactive, and Satan actively campaigning for the cause of Hell. It questions how souls should be decided, for placement in Heaven and Hell. And it shows death as -not- being evil. This is a book you'll read quickly, and not forget.Very much recommended."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"this book is good in so many ways especially how it combines and intertwines with the other books in the series i thought it would be stupid when my friend told me to read it and once i started i couldn't stop i stayed up all night and most the next day and read through the first three books which he had then went to the library and got the rest of them to read a must read book for anyone it covers so many aspects of life, death, love, hate, deception, you name it this book has it"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony honestly defines how men and women would react when given proof of the supernatural.

Piers Anthony is a fantastic author with many great ideas that he manages to put on paper. If you or I had that skill we'd be rich. I am a sk8er, or for you older folks that's skateboarder, and I don't read or write much at all. This book captivated me and I couldn't put it down. I had to read the entire series after that. it was good enough that I asked my girlfriend to read it. She's enjoying the series and is on the second book. She said that it really makes her think.

There are a total of seven volumes in the Incarnations of Immortality series: On A Pale Horse, Bearing An Hourglass, Wielding A Red Sword, With A Tangled Skein, Being A Green Mother, For Love Of Evil and ...And Eternity. Anthony's sequels are as good as the first book of &quot;Incarnations&quot;. I couldn't put them down.

For instance death is this compationate softy who takes the time to chat with everyone befor collecting them and ends up saveing almost as many people as he collects. But on the other hand the storys are good reads and keep you locked in untill you finish and crave the next book. another plus is that the books do not have to be read in any order they are all pretty stand alone although they do have a slight continuity. on the whole if you want a book that gets you thinking and that has its share of sexy women then this book and this series will hold you over durring the down time between the show stoppers."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the first, and best, book in the Incarnations of Immortality series.The book does an excellent job of exploring the aspects of death, from death's point of view. The hero of the story, a down-on-his-luck man is forced to assume the office of death, and carry on in the position, while bound by the rules governing him. Death not only gains an understanding of why the rules are what they are, but begins to challange the conventions.This book is not Tolstoy or Quincy. The moral thought in the book is not overly deep. But, it does provide an entertaining glimpse into deathThis is the best book in the series, and the only one I would reccomend. The other books fail to investigate the actual role the immortals play in human affairs, and instead focus on the artificial world Anthony has created."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I loved this book, and the entire Incarnations of Immortality series, when I was a teenager. This proves a fact about which I was in complete denial at the time: I was a pretty stupid teenager. Having just re-read this book, on a lark, for the first time in over twenty years I had an experience very much like watching old re-runs of \\"The Dukes of Hazzard\\" or \\"Knight Rider\\". Mouth agape, I had to ask myself how it was even possible that I ever could have liked this garbage in the first place--even as a kid! The poor writing and atrocious dialogue aside, it became clear about halfway through the book that Anthony's entire concept of morality--the basic definition of right and wrong--is almost completely devoid of any meaningful connection to reality. He uses a lot of Christian terms without any obvious understanding of what they mean and seems to be trying to build a case against traditional Christian notions of morality by completely mis-representing what Christianity actually has to say on the subject. I'm certainly not a devout or practicing Christian and even I took offense. If there is even a part of you that takes morality and faith even a little bit seriously, avoid this book and its successors! He also rides the edge of outright misogyny in his depiction of his female characters far too closely for my comfort. In retrospect, perhaps I can understand after all why these books appealed to me as a teenager. Thank goodness I'm older and wiser now."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony has presented an interesting paradox in writing for quite some time. I still find it fascinating that one author can tackle such complex and intense metaphysical and existential issues, and yet remain so utterly simplistic as to almost suggest the whole thing was a 13-year-old's idea. Our protagonist becomes responsible for the balance of souls, discussing numerous facets of afterlife philosophy and religious issues in the process. This is serious stuff we're supposedly dealing with. And yet, Zane at first seems like a middle-school kid with a bunch of new gadgets to play with. Purgatory and Hell are sketched in with minimal detail rather than being explored and described. Women exist either to lust after the men, or fall in love with them like they're in a Disney movie. With some depth and realism this could have become a wonderful epic on a grand scale. As it is, it stands as mindless escapism - not much else."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony can surely tell a good story with imaginative and original wonders. But by the time the story should wrap-up it gets too labored.Sometimes I think the books from this series were knocked out in a few weeks."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Yet another \\"man becomes Death\\" tale, with a silly subplot about the war of Heaven vs. Hell. Lots of padding in between.I remember in high school several friends had recommended this. Who knows, I might even have liked it... 30 years ago. Reading in retrospect, it seems its target audience is young teenagers who don't have much exposure to \\"good\\" literature.The plot is shallow--and internally inconsistent/contradictory, the characters are one-dimensional, and the setting was annoying (think \\"Xanth on Earth\\"). The writing style is horridly florid, and you can make a drinking game out of how many exclamation marks are used (warning: you'll get hammered a chapter into it.) As if that wasn't bad enough, there are lengthy dialogue digressions that are probably meant to be \\"profound\\" but simply come across as superficial and intellectually pretentious.I'm tempted to give it 1 star, but I'll bump up to two as I can actually see young people liking it."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"i was looking forward to reading this series and i really tried with this book but it's just awful. great premise, terrible execution. it's very immature and clearly written by and for someone with a below average IQ. don't waste your time."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book got me hooked on the Incarnations of Immortality series, but so far I would have to say this is the best one.

If you are only going to read one book, this has got to be it, it is one of the best books I have read in a long time, and I read a lot!!!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I first read this series in the 5th grade, and highly enjoyed it. In fact, it was one of the first \\"adult\\" fantasy series I read, and started me on a life-long love affair with good genre fiction. I recently found the entire set at a garage sale, so I decided to buy it and re-read it, now that I'm an adult.I still love the premise, and find the idea of the book to be innovative. I was, however, unprepared for the intense misogyny displayed in this text. There seems to be a constant focus on women's beauty, women's bodies, women's use as sexual objects, but little on women as humans. They are portrayed as a man-hungry, appearance-obsessed, emotionally unstable species who are traded by men as if they were nothing but possessions. Any display of courage by the women in this text is sexualized and immediately undercut by a focus on their physical appearance. The \\"love\\" affair between Zane and Luna is hackneyed and cheapened by AWEFUL dialogue. To say the least, as an adult reader, I was quite disappointed.I will read the rest of the series again to see if the treatment of women improves, as the sexism in this book might just be part of Zane's character. However, I don't hold out much hope.On another note, the Author's Note at the end of the text has to be one of the most transparent exercises in literary masturbation I've ever read. Anthony's pretension and undue pride come out in full force. It's just ludicrous, which is a shame because I love reading about the author's life from their own perspective, and learning about how an author completes a text. I'd love for more authors to include in-depth author's notes, but hopefully without the condescension that emits from this one."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Summary: very little is good about this book. The writing is bad, the characters poorly drawn, the ideas are shallow and the SF/Fantasy elements are awkward and uncreative. I laughed at passages which were not intended to be funny, and rolled my eyes a lot.Despite obvious efforts to delve into shades of gray (sometimes literally), there is no depth here. The basic premise itself is interesting, but it's ruined by stilted attempts at fantasy prose and awkward, unbelievable dialogue. I often found myself thinking, \\"who talks like that?\\" This book is supposed to be set in the 20th century, but everyone sounds like they're trying to play a D&D; character. The characters don't have much personality; they all sound much like each other. Much description is superfluous and occasionally patronizing. The book reads as if it were written by an older teenager for an audience of 13 year old boys. As a science fiction/fantasy book, it fails, because the SF and fantasy elements feel dropped in the story without effectively integrating them, so it's not a believable world; it's more like 3 semi-believable worlds slapped together.The characters throughout the books make sexist comments and act in a sexist way, which the author usually tries to show are not justified. However, he doesn't do a good job of it, and so the book comes off as sexist overall anyway. Perhaps it's because male-female relations and attempts to generalize about men and women end up being a major theme in the book, and breasts seem to be a favorite focus. Some of the overt sexual elements make this a totally inappropriate book for children - not a criticism, just something to note.I've had many friends recommend this series as one of his best, and that generally speaking his series tend to start well and get worse with the sequels. If that's the case, I won't waste my time with any more of his writing."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I beleive that On a Pale Horse is good, even for young readers. It's easy to read, touching, and well written. Piers Anhtony has a way with words, and he shows them perfectly here.

The thing I like the most about this stunning novel is that it makes you think about one specific question, what if? What if all religions were wrong? What if heaven isn't really where you want to spend eternity? What if Satan is a better entity than God? All these questions and many, many more are guaranteed to pop into your ever-expanding mind if you read On A Pale Horse.

The pros would be; being able to live forever, and helping people who are dying by taking their souls to get rid of the pain. The cons would be; worrying about your successor coming to kill you, and not knowing where to send all the souls and how to get them there. Piers Anthony really makes his stories and novels very interesting. He makes you think about what's going to happen next in the story (or novel). In the book &quot;On a Pale Horse,&quot; Anthony talks about a guy that kills Death, and becomes death. He really makes you wonder about what the next thing is that Zane will have to do. So if you are looking for a really good book to read, read Piers Anthony's &quot;On a Pale Horse.&quot;"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I just finished this novel, and indeed found it really compelling. The examination of death and morality, and the incarnations are a wonderful example of the writers craft. The story only lacked one thing, and that was an accurate knowlege of the nature and existence of God. God is indeed eternal, and the essence of good. But he is also the essence of Holiness, and that is not examined carefully at all. I think many opportunities to examine the involvement of God were missed. However, the examination of the existence and work of the &quot;principalities and powers&quot; that were involved were fantastic. Anthony has really thought through the work of death, and his character of Zane is also compelling. Zane's love of Luna, and her love of the unlovely death are also compelling. By all means, buy and read this book, but don't forget the other book, the Bible to get the correct view of the one who created those principalities and powers, and who DOES get involved on the personal level. Carl."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I thought that On a Pale Horse by Piers Anthony was a very good book. It's about a man named Zane. He shot Death and has to fill the position. It follows him in his new life. I liked it because it dealt with questions that apply to today's living.I also liked it because it shows all the different ways of life. Some of which are: the unknown teen rock band, the extremely rich person who is hated and feared by almost everyone, the person who is terminally ill in the hospital kept alive only by machines.Like most books it starts out a little slow but the further you get into it the more interesting it gets.

All i did all of those two days was read. I was facinated by the character of death and it intrigued me that an author could put heaven and hell down on paper so literally and frankly. In the relm he had created everything was i guess one could say clear and sharp. In the book everyone knew they were either going to hell or heaven and it scared them. Now a days everyone is so ignorant about their fate and it was refreshing to read such and interesting and straightforward account.i recommend this to everyone who likes sci fi and read it even if you do read it if death has ever intrigued you or if you've ever asked why read it regardless if you do not like my review i found this book fantastic amazing and definitely one of my favorite books:]"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I found the concept of Death as an occupation utterly fascinating and was looking forward to reading this series.

The only reason I finished it was b/c I was on a cruise and had nothing else to read.Needless to say I won't be reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On a future/parallel Earth, where myth and magic are as ubiquitous as technology, a down-on-his-luck photographer named Zane has an appointment with Death. Death has grown careless, however, and allows Zane to get the drop on Death, shooting him. \\"Fate\\" then shows up, and decrees that since Zane has killed Death, he must become Death, taking up death mask, scythe, and pale horse. Follow Zane in his misadventures as Death in this light-hearted madcap fantasy romp.Well, not quite! See title of review.As Piers Anthony boasts/admits in his Afterword, this is not just light fantasy, as his Xanth novels were, but also an excuse for what he calls \\"serious social commentary\\". Hence, when Anthony takes time out from his story to preach nonsense - often offensive nonsense -- it is no longer possible to brush it off as a mere joke.For instance: Anthony preaches in favor of \\"murdering\\" the sick and elderly, and makes this a central theme of the story. Zane, initially, feels guilty for having \\"murdered\\" his mom, and eventually comes to realize that \\"murdering\\" his mom was okay after all, and, moreover, that a lot more inconvenient elderly people need to be \\"murdered\\". The only fictional examples of such \\"murders\\" that Anthony provides involve the removal of patients from extraordinary life support with their explicit consent. Does Anthony not realize that this is something nobody is against? That nobody calls this \\"murder\\"? Or is he not being honest about his agenda? My suspension of disbelief was completely shattered when Zane, now over his guilt, massacred an entire nursing home full of patients, by removing every single one of them from extraordinary life support with their unanimous explicit consent. It may be that Anthony is basically in line with mainstream thought,and only supports such \\"murders\\" under the narrow circumstances portrayed; but if so, methinks the man doth protest too much. More likely, he has a broader agenda, which he is not presenting honestly.Straw man attacks come up in other areas, particularly in the area of Judeo-Christian theology. For instance, it is not true that Christian churches have preached that children of incest are cursed or should be stigmatized. Nor is it true that the idea \\"ought implies can\\" is alien to traditional ethics.And on it goes. Anthony's \\"serious social commentary\\" touches on many subjects: child sex laws (unfair to children who want to have sex with adults); incest taboos (unfairly stigmatizes children of incest); male infidelity (okay because men can't help their urges); betrayed wives (selfish witches - it's really their fault); rape (men can't help themselves - nature makes them do it); dumping your pregnant girlfriend (okay because women want true love, not pity). The only saving grace is that such ideas are presented more by clumsy exposition than by direct illustration. Zane, our hero, usually behaves semi-honorably, making it possible for the inattentive reader to imagine that the author does not really mean the things he keeps hinting at.It all appears to be part of an attack on traditional ethical norms, by a man trying to convince himself that he is not really bound by any moral rules and can basically do as he wants.The spirituality of this book initially seems dualistic, but is ultimately revealed to be that of the occultist, whose ultimate ambition is to kill God and become God. Hence, it was no surprise, at the end, when Zane learns that God (like Death) is merely a mortal playing a part."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I first read this book many years ago when it hit the shelves of the book store. I have since re-visited the series several times. The Incarnations of Immortality series, of which Pale Horse is the first installment, stands as some of Piers Anthony's best work. Throughout the series (originally intended for 5 books), Anthony takes a look at concurrent events through the eyes of multiple participants. The premise is that the mythological beings - Death, Time, War, Fate, and Nature - are actually offices held by people. Each office is attained in a manner suitable to that office. Pale Horse gives us the point of view of Thanatos, the incarnation of Death. In order to assume the office of Death, one must kill the current office-holder. Zane, on the verge of suicide, gun in hand, and soul in state of equilibrium between 'good' and 'evil,' is visited by Death so that his soul might be taken to Purgatory.I found this series to be a refreshing change of pace from Anthony's much lighter Xanth series. I recommend this series to anyone who likes a more philosophical twist to their Science Fiction."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"In ON A PALE HORSE, Piers Anthony brings to life a fascinating world kept running by the five Incarnations (Death, Time, Fate, War, and Nature) and the two Eternals (Good and Evil, otherwise known as God and Satan). Magic and science coexist, Purgatory is the bureacracy of life, and ghosts sometimes walk the streets with the living.ON A PALE HORSE is the first of the 7 books in the Incarnations of Immortality series and focuses on the Incarnation of Death. Down on his luck and ready to end his life, Zane instead ends up shooting death. The Incarnation of Fate then appears to congratulate Zane: he is now the next Death! As the story continues, Zane learns to manage his new job, while at the same time pondering questions of life, death, justice, and love.One of the most interesting things to me about ON A PALE HORSE is Anthony's approach to personifying something such as death. In Anthony's world, the person playing the role of death does not stay the same through eternity, but rather changes hands as each Death stops being careful and allows himself to be killed by his sucessor. This is much different from the common idea which is that even as the Grim Reaper death simply IS, without any human characteristics. Furthermore, because of his human qualities, Death is able to make conscious decisions about whether or not it is right for him to take a soul from someone who has apparently died out of turn. The question of whether or not it is fair for someone to die before their time is truly up is one of the biggest themes throughout the story.Also interesting are the ideas presented about what sin is and what is fair judgement of a soul's sin. To me the impressive thing is that while dealing with traditionally theological ideas, ON A PALE HORSE never does sound like a religious piece of writing. Instead it is more philosophical than anything else, though not with the density of more traditional philosophical writings.The writing is superb, as is the plot structure. The story flows constantly and consistently, and it is organized so well that nothing is mentioned without reason. I highly recommend this book and can hardly believe that it took me 18+ years to find out about. Because of the maturity of some of the ideas, ON A PALE HORSE is probably best for those 14 and older."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony has done it again with th Incarnations of Immortality series. I actually read this one second. The first one I read in this series was BEARING AN HOURGLASS.The second one in the series. But I have read ON A PALE HORSE, again and again. I really enjoyed it. It made my imagination run wild. I really liked the way the Piers Anthony represented Death or shall I say the physical figure of death. This book has romance, drama,and the ongoing battle of Good vs Evil. This book will forever linger in my mind and keep me reading it again and again. Worth the Money, in this writers opinion."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I heard good things about On a Pale Horse, so I finally picked it up. I apologize to those who love this book, but it wasn't for me.I realize that it was written in 1986, and kept that in mind while reading it.-possible minor spoilers-My first issue is with the world introduction and believability of said world. I can read a book about some really strange things as long as it's introduced to me in a way where it either makes sense being there or I have slowly become accustomed the world/setting. I'm not talking baby-steps or hand holds, just ease me in a little. I felt that the introduction to this world was a bit confusing and disjointed. The main character already knew about god and satan, flying carpets and magic- I didn't. Some might say that's the fun, trying to figure out the world/setting, but that's not what I enjoy.Second, and herein lies my biggest problem- I didn't like the main character. I just could not warm up to him. I tried, I really did. For that matter, there weren't any characters I really enjoyed at all the book. Even Satan wasn't as colorful as he could be.Third, the plot wasn't anything special. Good enough to keep reading but not enough to continue on to the next bookLastly, and I know this is just being nit-picky but, there are WAY too many exclamation points! Way too many! So many! Everything seemed much more emphasized than it should be! I'd read a line and realize it ended in an exclamation, so I'd go back and re-read it with emphasis. There were just so many that didn't seem to fit, and it bothered me."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I read this series a few years ago. I loved it then. I had forgotten about it and when I was browsing the Kindle titles I can across With a Tangled Skein. I immediately wanted to buy all of the books in the series however at that time, they were not available. So it was with much delight that I discovered they are now. With that said I believe that Pale Horse, Bearing an Hour Glass and With a Tangled Skein are the best of the series. Please keep in mind that I loved every single one of these. I do tend to agree with others that the last book wasn't cohesive with the series all that much. But I will read it again anyway."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the first book in one of my favorite series. I've read it so many times the book is literally falling apart, so now I have a kindle version. No more falling apart! Seriously, this is a good series by a very talented author."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I must say I was looking for a different take on fantasy novels..and I was really blown away by this book. As much as its a fantasy novel you cant help but really think about certain things that the author portrayed in his novel. Loved the Satan and Death confrontation and was anticipating a reaction with God..but oh well. Great book nonetheless. Zane build confidence and whats more important is his faith."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Anthony created another winning series in the Incarnation of Immortality. The introductory novel, On A Pale Horse, is definitely Anthony at his best. His innovative concepts and subtle chiding are delivered with his characteristically caustic tongue-in-cheek style.Zane is a loser. He can't pay the rent, just passed up the girl of his dreams for pennies, and he can't even commit suicide without screwing it up - instead of dying, he shot Death as the Grim Reaper entered his apartment to collect his soul. In spite of the cards life has handed him, Zane is at heart a good guy, and it is his ingrained morality that guides his development into the most respected officeholder of Death in a very long time. Zane must overcome trials set by the other Incarnations, including Fate, Time, Nature, and War, while foiling Satan's evil plot to kill the woman Zane is growing to love.The premise that Death, Nature, etc are jobs held temporarily by mortals is unique and intriguing, presented with Anthony's classic wit and slightly bawdy charm. He waxes philosophical, I especially enjoy his interpretations on religion and even those who consider themselves religious are unlikely to take offence because of the way he discusses people's beliefs without denigrating them.A story that is hard to put down, and makes buying the rest of the series a no brainer."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On A Pale Horse by Piers Anthony is an excellent book. It is full of action and problem solving, like when Zane realized he was to be the new Death. Zane had many difficulties with his new job, like learning how to take and judge souls. Zane did solve this problem, however. By experimenting with Mortis and his new tools/abilities, Zane realized how he can take and judge clients. He also got help form other Incarnations, such as Fate.Zane might not get along with everyone though. For example, you could put Zane together with Mo from Cornelia DeFunke's \\"InkDeath\\". Zane is more reluctant about killing, and only does so to help the one he loves. He also killed an important person in his life to end her suffering. Mo can kill as easy as a robber in InkDeath, but would never even consider killing the same figures as Zane. They both, however, would do almost anything for loved ones, with how much they care about them. Whether it be stopping all deaths or risking their lives, they would do it. Despite their differences, they could help each other in battle, and Zane might help Mo see some sense in his ways.A jacket blurb for this book should be \\"A fantastic story that will make you laugh, gasp, and beg for more\\". While some parts will make you smile or laugh aloud, others may make you gasp. Whether that gasp is fear or surprise, it's up to you. This book is definitely a favorite among readers. Its action and descriptive scenes will make you want to keep going.I would definitely recommend this story to any reader. Its details and descriptions helped characters move through my mind as if I was watching the scenes if a movie unfold, rather than read about them. The characters each had a unique personality, and the creativity was outstanding. If you're a fantasy, romance, or supernatural lover, or just a plain reader looking for a good story, this is for you. Magic, ghosts, a bit of romance here and there, flying carpets, and mythical creatures are sure to drag you in!Some themes in this book can be applied to our own lives. One of them is solving difficult problems in different ways. You could use Mother Nature's five sticks for example: Your solution could involve moving forward, start to finish, with no alternate options. Or in a ladder formation, moving with small steps and a few errors. The next one would be a star-like shape, involving all directions. Another one would be a pentagon, involving going around over and over until you realized it. Finally you could use the -|||- form, jumping to a conclusion. All of these ways of problem-solving that Mother Nature explained could help you solve your own problems in life. Whichever path you use is up to you."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Great book! Have re-read this several times. Definitely the best in the Incarnations of Immortality series. One of Piers Anthony's best books (beyond Xanth, Phaze, & Mode series). A must-read for sci-fi or fantasy fans."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Wonderful in every essence of the word! Piers Anthony once again delivers an exciting adventure through his Incarnations of Immortality series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I recently purchased \\"ON A PALE HORSE - Incarnations of Immortality\\" and I enjoyed reading this book tremendously. I love purchasing from AMAZON because Amazon is reliable and quick! Upon ordering, you will receive your book(s) almost instantly. This is a huge convenience for me. Who could ask for anything more?"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"While the book and it's following books are entertaining, it's more escapism than anything. Some of the time-lines seem a bit hard to decipher, especially some of the later books. Its a world of magic mixed with science, each complementing the other. Good and Evil fight to become dominant, and with the help of the Incarnations on the side of Good, (except for maybe Nox?) it's an uphill battle all the way."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On a Pale Horse resembles a modern Divine Comedy. Except here Dante is not lead through hell by Virgil. Instead, Zane our protagonist is guided by the nubile ghost of Molly Malone the fishmonger, who proves as canny as Virgil. Like the Divine Comedy, elements of fantasy are fused with religion and mythology. While this fusion may put off some Christians and some fantasy fanciers, the story worked for me: Piers Anthony displays a delightful sense of humor in this well-paced and imaginative tale. There were what I felt to be loose ends to the story, yet the story line works. (Please note, the other stories in this collection do *not* work.)Zane, a mere mortal on the very verge of suicide, suddenly finds himself called upon to be Death Incarnate by The Powers That Be. His new career as the Grim Reaper brings compassion to the dying, as Zane attempts not merely to do his job efficiently but be a positive moral force in the grand scheme of the Cosmos. A kinder gentler killing machine: this paradox drives much of the book's interest and humor.Highly commended to readers of fantasy who want to get away from it all in a book."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Lost the book one day, but now I have it to pass the series on to my family! Great book series, should be a movie series!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"At 4.5 stars, this is a solid book by Mr. Anthony. I actually enjoyed the Incarnations series more than the few Xanth books I read in the past. I originally read Incarnations book 3 and 5 (5 was the first I ever read, not knowing it was part of a series) so I was a bit 'spoiled' when I decided to buy the entire set. Still, this book was a highly enjoyable read, set in a world where science and magic are mixed together. Zane is a genuinely likable character, and his story is enjoyable.A compassionate Death is a interesting thing to think about, and I enjoyed Zane's attempts to understand his office and mitigate some of the suffering that Death brought. And as with all of Mr. Anthony's books, there's always quirky bits of humor in here along with interesting nuggets of knowledge and philosophy that make for a entertaining and thought-provoking read. I highly recommend not just this book but the whole series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I listened to the Audio Book about 10 years ago and was duly impressed. I just finished listening to the book on CD again and find it eve BETTER than the first time through.Piers Anthony has a real classic series here and I recommend the audio book over the paper book. George Guidell is a wonderful story teller and Recorded Books always puts out a great production.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (even is Sci-fi is not your thing)."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"great intro to the series and i loved the book and continued in the series.it is worth the buy just like all piers anthony books."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Let me start off by saying the Xanth novels by Anthony rank as one of my favorite all time fantasy series...truly fun, creative with memorable characters! On A Pale Horse was good, but something about it, especially the dialogue, was a bit off and not up to the high standards I expected. That scene with the band and the preacher and the singer - I couldn't follow any of the dialogue and wasn't sure what era Mr. Anthony was going for. I did love the portrayl of the Devil, loved Death's horse and really enjoyed Death coming into his own by the end of the book. I'll defintely seek out Book 2...but hope the dialogue is a bit tighter.Thx!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I'm not a big Piers Anthony fan, but have read a few books in his \\"Mode\\" and \\"Xanth\\" series.This book scores some points for originality.The protagonist, Zane, is a two-time loser. He's frittered away his life, love, and fortune, and has reached the end of his downward spiral. Zane decides to end it all, but instead of becoming Dead, he becomes Death. Whoops.I was surprised that the story featured several laugh out loud moments, as well as some touching ones. Some of Zane/Death's interventions on behalf of the dying were just plain silly. On the other hand, some of Death's interactions with his clients made salient points about our society's obession with maintaining a person's life, while ignoring the QUALITY of that life.Overall, the author has produced a book that is fun and thought-provoking. Nice job!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This first book in the Incarnations of Immortality is surprisingly good, almost despite itself. There are some interesting ideas here, and the story is surprisingly compelling for something so fantastic. Unfortunately, Piers Anthony still writes like Piers Anthony. The characters are one-dimensional, the story stops for pages at a time while he introduces new gadgetry that doesn't serve any purpose, and I swear he uses the word \\"balk\\" every third sentence. In the hands of a competent writer (or even a competent editor), this book would've been a classic. As it stands, it's still surprisingly good for how bad it is."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On a Pale Horse is set in a somewhat bizarre fantasy world where science competes with magic for getting things done. Our hero becomes Death by shooting and killing the previous Death when the previous Death showed up as his suicide attempt The new Death has to complete his on the job training, solve a mystery and duel with the Devil. Fundamentally a pretty good yarn, however I did not enjoy it as much as a might have because of the fantasy, magic elements. The first in a series..."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I had just had open heart surgery, number 3, when I picked up this book. Anthony's view of death, and how it can appear, or how one approaches it, changed the way I thought of death. This book is one of my all time favorites.I will forever be grateful to Mr. Anthony for helping me get over my fear of death."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Wow this book restored my faith in literature,its a great story with real characters and fantastic imagination! Piers Anthony is a master at his craft and he's at his best in this one. All fantasy and sci-fi fans read this one. Duh! if you are you've probably already read it."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book was received very quickly, and was in perfect condition. There were no problems with this purchase, and I would buy from the seller again. As for the book itself, I have read it a million times and bought this to replace my lost version. It's a great and interesting story, I wouldrecommend to anyone"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I've read this book several times, as well as the rest of the Incarnation of Immortality series. This book is awesome. I've always admired Piers Anthony for the way he is so imaginative when it comes to his writing, and this book is no exception. I first read it when I was in High School, and the magic of the book has not left even to now, ten years later. Without giving too much away, the book is about a normal guy living on the verge of poverty who one day, has a close encounter with Death, the personification of the black hooded skeletal figure with scythe, and pale horse. Magic and science are interwoven in this world, they exist side by side. I see that other people have given this book various other kinds of reviews, but trust me, you'll like this book."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I read this series of Piers Anthony books (Incarnations of Immortality, starting with \\"On a Pale Horse\\") for the first time years ago and they all remain my favorite books. It is science fiction/fantasy writing at it's best. Some of themes introduced in these books have stayed with me and become a part of how I see the world today and the future. These are easy reading books, hard to put down. You'd like them if you enjoy stories full of imagination."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On a Pale Horse was the best book I've ever read. I'd been reading things by Anne McCaffrey and others before my father actually brought this book to my attention. He'd read it a long time ago and thought I'd like it. Anne McCaffrey and the others like her that I'd been reading were more mid-evilish and that's what I was in to. When I read this book it was more futuristic. What surprised me the most about it was that it was set LAST century! It was a great book and Zane was an ideal character showing the confusion of life as he grew into his office. The ending was really great what he did to Satan. I can't go back to reading the authors whos books I was reading. Wonderful tale with high imagination. READ IT!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This was the first book I read by this author and I loved it. It had a well defined plot and it really made me think. even if you don't like fantasy or sci fi this is an amazing book with interesting ideas."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book will keep your eyes glued to the pages. I found myself so deeply engrossed in it's pages every time I picked it up that I had to force myself to put iy down!! Even if you are not a fan of Science Fiction, this book will dazzle your intellect and expand your imagination!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I must say, very few books at amazon.com receive a 4.8 overall rating. Specially one with over 50 reviews. So I bought 'On a Pale Horse' expecting something grand. I got an OK fantasy book that's not really as creative as it sounds and dangerously trite towards the middle.The book is extremely interesting in the beginning and at the end (specially the meeting with the Father of Lies himself) but Luna, one of the most two-dimensional characters I've ever read in a book (Even for FANTASY books) almost ruins it. Zane has a formulaic passion over this girl, and I found the interaction between them by far the worst part of the book.While some of the most exciting scenes really got me up and pumping, like the few battle scenes, the quality was quickly slumped by the love story, in which Piers Anthony persisted on making it show up every 20 pages or so.Piers seems to continuously belittle DEATH throughout the book. The main character is constantly manipulated by the other incarnations, it seems that nothing's new because they already know what's going to happen. If only Zane developed a more rebellious attitude at being so obviously controlled, the character would be even better than it is already (It only loses to the Lord of Evil himself, whose arguments would make a $2000-an-hour lawyer's arguments seem like a monkey gibberish)Does this book deserve only 3 stars? No, 3.5 would be more accurate. But it's closer to 3 than it is to 4. Great concept, but the two-dimensional romance was definately the focus here in the book, and it is definately (at least, in my opinion) the weakest part of the book.Even after it's flaws, this book is still a worthy addition to an avid reader's library."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"As a self professed bookworm, I have read lots of books, and while my tastes dable in many genres, I haven't read a lot of sci-fi. This book, however, remains my favorite book of all time, in any genre. The story of a man down on his luck, things change quickly when he purchases a ruby from a shop. Once this book picks up, it never lets go, and I'd even go as far as to say it changed my outlook on life. The rest of the &quot;incarnations&quot; books interweave nicely with each other, but this book will always stand out to me as the shining gem of the series. Whether you like sci-fi or not, pick this one up."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This gives you an alternative view of death.Good story, should be made into a movie."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers knocks your socks off in this stunning series- while there are some slow spots, it rocks overall. Under a Velvet Cloak was just published last year, for PA fans."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is a great book. Zane, a down on his luck schmuck, decides to go home and kill himself. Taken by surprise by a cloaked intruder, he shoots the intruder instead. Then the fun begins. Zane has a new job that will require him to challenge current beliefs and do some (pun intended) soul-searching. Read all seven in this series; they are a fun read that will make you think."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"OK sure, the dialogue and the old-world stuff is kinda corny, and the religious stuff may insult or bore some people, but you gotta read this book. It takes place now (or rather, when the book came out, about the early 1980s)and all the technological discovery stuff is going on, as well as magic. Magic was discovered and researched the same time as science and things like dragons, magic stones and spells, and magic carpets are common in the world. It has a mix of comic book, religion (lame but it's not exactly Christian or racist, just has God and Satan), therapy, and um.... Coolness. It has the feeling of a comic book because it has the action a Grim Reaper with his weapon, the scythe, would go through and there's a ton of magical gadgets that he uses to do his job, which isn't all that bad. As you and the main character find out as the story goes on, death is a necessary part of life to actually SAVE people in a way, when you read the book you'll understand. If you're afraid of death (or Death), you won't be after you read this. I tottaly love it and I already read it twice. I reccomend this to anyone and everyone, except to kids whose moms don't want them reading stuff about nudity and the mentioning of sex stuff, it's not actually that bad. Come on moms, let the kids read it! (There's no cussing too)"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This was one of the first science fiction books my hubby then boyfriend suggested for me. Since then I was hooked on all the Incarnations of Immortality. In the whole series, this has to be by far one of my favorites.Piers Anthony introduces Zane, your average run of the mill guy who gets some &quot;life changing experiences&quot;. On the Pale Horse is the first in the series that gets you into a new perpective of the Incarnations. Truly a great series to enjoy!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"In high school, I read this book because the cutest guy in our class was reading it. Now, I don't know where that guy is, but I own all 7 books in the Incarnations series. This book, besides being a necessary foundation for the rest, is a terrific story. The book follows Zane, an ordinary man who has made some bad choices, as he makes a choice that will change his whole life (and death) and then is faced with other difficult choices -at least one that can change all of history. Like all Mr. Anthony's books, this is well written and draws you in. If you are looking for a good series to keep your interest, I recommend the Incarnations of Immortality, and please, start with this one. This series is best read in order."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I'm an avid reader...anything from Horror to Love Stories, Suspense to Biography's. &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;, I had the book for months before committing myself to reading it. Sci-Fi and Fantasy had never intrigued me. I can honestly say of the thousands of books I've read, this one stands out in it's uniqueness. It is unlike any other book. While, I can't go so far to say it's the best book ever, or even the best I've personally read, it is a wonderful and entertaining story. Assuming of course your mind is open to alternative possibilities in life, and in the case of this book, death. On the humerous side, the book is one of the very few, that made me laugh out loud. A fun story, enlightening, with a few things to really make you think tucked into it's pages. Open the book, and let your mind play. You'll enjoy."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Treating the major incarnations as an idea and following them through their journey is a brilliant idea and an amazingly creative endeavor by Anthony. Although at times I find myself cringing a little at the sexism in his novels and some of his older schools of thought I still love the ideas generated in this book and find myself re-reading it constantly."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony starts off another series with a big BANG! Like Bio of a Space Tyrant, the start of Incarnations of Immortality keeps you thinking, and makes you read about time (which is the dryest book in the series), fate, war, nature, Satan, and God. Anthony's series tests your beliefs about the afterlife and how the world really goes around."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"On a Pale Horse is one of my most favorite novels. It is a view of Death like never seen before. Piers has been one of my most favorite novelists since I was a teenager.

He truly is a gifted writer. - James Richey"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book is the opening of a series that will make you question your very beliefs about life, love, and religion. It, however, does this gently and in the most non-offensive manner that I can imagine.

You can look forward to the six titles to follow!!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book is one of the most interesting and eye opening books that I have ever read.

Piers Anthony is a Genious!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I've read this book countless times, and each time I read it again it gets better. This book makes you re-evaluate you views on everything from faith and love to life and death. Mr. Anthony takes the time to delve into his personal views of life and death, and the results are a thought provoking and an interesting look into the nature of not only death but life also. I would like to see another book in the Incarnations of Immortality series, especially another on death, but also into Time and Fate...."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I happened to stumble across this book in the store, the plot, and ideas in it were great.

I recomend this book to anyone interested in Piers Anthony and read some of his literature or is an admirer of fantasy."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I would strongly recommend reading this book if you like fantasy or science fiction. Piers Anthony melds these two themes together beautifully. Imagine a world of advanced science and magic all rolled up into one."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I think that &quot;On A Pale Horse&quot; is an excelent book, with some romance and mental insights on death (real and illusionary) that people would never think about, in real life or writing a novel.

In other words, I give it five stars for the author and the book, they both are excelent in many, many, ways."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony has taken death and put a whole new personality into it.

An intelligent read in the guise of fantasy, I highly recommend both the book and the series if you enjoy thinking while you read."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"It has been many years since I have read the Incarnations of Immportality series....On a Pale Horse is my favorite...I recommend this to everyone I know - I am not much of a science fiction fan but these books are so engrossing....you really have to pick this one up!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I had never read Piers Anthony before this book.

I can't wait to finish the remainder of the novels"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book had an interesting premise, and if I'd read the story outline and situation,I probably would have said this would make a great satirical fantasy. However, I like to read either hilarity OR satire, I find when an author tries to mix them the novel ends up only going halfway and thus only being half as good as it might be if he tried to go all-out in one of the styles. Am I making sense? This is the first book I've read by Piers Anthony, and I'd heard he was terrific, so perhaps I was expecting too much? I don't know. I guess I was expecting something as hlarious as The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy Series. I understand that this wasn't what he was trying to accomplish, but then, I didn't like what he was trying to do. I don't like his puns very much either. Puns are funny in comic strips or on Bugs Bunny cartoons, but to get bashed over the head with them over and over in a novel makes me sick after a while. But I think what really got me annoyed was the characters. They were BORING. I could barely finish the book, because I didn't care about them (I also hated their names, which always turns me off from the beginning). The situation was interesting, like I said, a good premise. But I didn't enjoy the way it was told. Though obviously somebody out there must enjoy Piers Anthony's style of writing, or he wouldn't be such a good seller, now would he? I might try another of his novels, though, one more chance couldn't hurt"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Ok, I read this book in sixth grade and loved it to death (no pun intended!) Shamefully it was a school copy and had to go for the next three years trying to remember the title. Now that I have found it.... Well that a whole nother story! I highly recomend this book, it is very good. I started to read it and couldn't put it down until I read it twice!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. The prose is sub-literate, the dialogue excruciating, the plot hackneyed, and the 'romance' trite. It could function as a parody of bad writing, I suppose . . ."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the first Piers Anthony book I ever read, and I read it for all the wrong reasons. I read it because the title intrigued me. I read it because it had a really cool cover. I was young and still judged many books on that basis. Fortunately, I hit the jackpot with this one.I give this book five stars because it earned each and every one of them. I can be stingy with my stars at times, but I wonder if five is enough for this one. On A Pale Horse is book 1 of the Incarnations of Immortality, but don't be intimidated by the prospect of buying all the others because this one's a heavyweight all by its lonesome (it's the only one I've personally read so far). The main character is Zane, who is forced to take over the position of Death when he accidentally shoots and kills the previous Death (who had the misfortune of barging in a bit prematurely during Zane's suicide attempt). This sounds a little wacky, and it is, but wonderfully so.From there, the book continues to tell the story of Zane as he learns the ropes of Reaping. The main plot involves Satan trying to lure Death into a scheme that involves him killing this girl he's come to love. The whole idea of Satan vs. Death is very cool, and is worth the price of the book alone. However, said plot, while awesome, was not my favorite part of the book because there's just so much dang cool stuf in here! For one thing, the book is hilarious, while several humorous moments in which Zane finds that Reaping isn't as easy as it looks. There's also a wonderful world Anthony has created that blends science and magic. And one thing that Anthony pulls off that few can is to, among a book filled with both laughs and adventure, weave in some deeply profound philosophical perspectives (on Death, of course).This book just had it all, and it had some very unique ideas about Death and salvation. One thing I must say, though(and I hate having to say it, but I have to because there are some really stupid people out there) is that this is a work of fiction. I am a Christian and realize that some of the ideas presented in this book are at odds with my own personal beliefs, but that doesn't mean I can't enjoy and appreciate the originality and creativity of them. In other words, for all you &quot;muggles&quot; out there, Piers isn't trying to convert anybody to his way of thinking. He just wants to give us a good book and he does. As for those of you who may disagree with me, I say this: if you are really afraid that reading things like this will actually cause you to change your deepest beliefs, it's high time you took a look inside yourself and determine just how deep your belief is in the first place. Your beliefs should come from within yourself, not the most recent thing you've read."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"\\"On A Pale Horse\\" begins the \\"Incarnations of Immortality\\" series as an immature Zane seeks to improve his dismal life in a world filled with a curious blend of magic, religion, and science. Rudimentary character growth and environmental imagery laced among stereotypical behavior of mostly chauvinistic male and scatterbrained female figures cater to the young reader with the typical vocabulary in most fast-paced Piers Anthony storyline. Regrettably an ominous intensity and the dreadful powers of Death could have created a genuinely classic novel.Zane must deal with the difficulties of a new job as he maintains a personal life. The novel introduces a gripping view of the Grim Reaper, since death can be a fearsome and at times welcome aspect in life. Death has the proverbial scythe and Deathsteed (which has a science influence as well), along with the duty of collecting souls to be possibly in part judged by him for final destination. A brief introduction to the other major Incarnations, featured in following tales of the series, include Time, Fate, War, Nature, Evil, and Good.Although the novel handles the Incarnation of Death, the eternal battle between Heaven and Hell exposes little concerning Hell and naught about Heaven to the reader. While long-winded logical conclusions govern most of the fast dialogue between characters, the author conducts the space/time continuum paradox in a masterly fashion.I recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre. However those of a highly inflexible religious background or intolerant attitude towards religion might want to avoid the selection.Thank you."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I read the first Xanth book (A Spell for Chameleon.) I picked up the second one (The Source of Magic) and got frustrated with it. The subject matter of the Xanth series only reaches so far as to cater to the 11-15 age range. Once you get beyond that, or at least for me, it becomes a little childish.This book, however, was wonderfully mind stimulating. It probably would classify as a sci-fi book, which accounts for the futuristic Earth setting, but Anthony draws on his fantasy expertise to add flavor and gusto to this novel. It really is in a league of its own. I haven't even heard of a book or series that portrays the Incarnations (Death, Fate, Time, etc.) in such a special way, let alone have them as characters. The main reason I picked this book up in the first place was because of its unusual cover portraying Death in a yellow car (which we later learn is his Death Steed named Mortis.)The story itself is riviting, drawing on many of the author's own feelings and thoughts to create an allegory (a work that can be read on two levels, in a literal way and then usually a deeper, more thought out way.) It has great action (sword fights, or actually scythe fights, damsels in destress, magicians, ect.) But what really got me was, the arch enemy of Death, the protagonist who is actually a human who assumed the post of Death after killing the previous Death, is Satan himself! What better foe could there be?On a Pale Horse is a truly uncommon and unique book. It is fast paced and extremely interesting. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony's problem is that he's very good at coming up with ideas but isn't actually a very good writer. Nowhere is it more obvious than in the Incarnations series, of which this is the first volume.In On a Pale Horse, a down-and-out loser named Zane attempts to commit suicide, but upon seeing the spectre of Death approaching kills him instead. He who kills the Incarnation of Death becomes his successor, and Zane is cast adrift into a metaphysical storm as he struggles to both learn his new responsibilities and prevent a takeover of his job by Satan, the Incarnation of Evil.This is a terrific, fascinating premise, totally let down by juvenile characterization, overreliance on sexual innuendo and lousy jokes, and Anthony's unfortunate tendency to shoehorn whatever he's currently reading into whatever he's currently working on (in this case, a theory of patterns of thought that's completely out of place).This would be survivable (just like the Adept books rose above the writing style) except for one thing. Anthony just does not understand what makes two people fall in love, and considering that this book centers around a love story it qualifies as a fatal flaw. There is no earthly reason these two characters should fall in love; they go directly from being near-strangers to being willing to die for one another.The ideas in the book are much better than their realization, and in any case it's still quite entertaining and worth the read. I'd stop here, though ... the next two books are mostly dreary with a few good parts, and the sixth book is excellent, but the rest of them are just intolerable."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"\\"On a Pale Horse\\" is the first novel in the Incarnations of Immortality series, which describes the adventures of ordinary people cast into the personified roles of death, time, fate, nature, war, evil, and good. The seven books of the series vary in quality, but the highly imaginitive fictional universe and the intricate twining of the story, with the complete plot of each book coalescing into a single overstory, make the series a stimulating read. This first book is the most self-contained, however, and can be enjoyed fully without committing to the following six.Zane is a desperate young man. Lonely, poor, and distressed, he seeks refuge from his mistakes in death. But when he tries to kill himself he ends up murdering Death instead and is forced to assume his office, collecting the souls of other mortals who die with no strong orientation to good or evil. His office - killing people and sending them to Heaven or Hell - disturbs him at first, but he begins to realize that death is a necessary part of life and that he can ease his clients' passage. In the course of his duties, he meets and falls in love with a young woman, Luna, who he learns is instrumental to foiling a plot masterminded by Satan (the incarnation of evil). To save the woman he loves - and also the world as he knows it - he must harness the full power of his office.\\"On a Pale Horse\\" is an absorbing novel, structured for easy reading and an engrossing plot. It offers a slick, smart alternative reality and an interesting (quasi-religious) perspective on ideas such as good, evil, and death. However, the book's opening chapters are far less readable and interesting than its bulk, and the shallow writing and callow protagonist are frustrating throughout. The final chapters are exciting but uninspiring; although the author is clearly capable of writing a powerful novel he has chosen to write a fun one instead; \\"On a Pale Horse\\" is not a great book, but it is a great read."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony is, in my opinion, one of the most talented authors in the sci-fi/fantasy genre that I have ever read. Simply the idea of the Incarnations of Immortality being run by mortals, and their trials and tribulations of those people make for a wonderful story that one cannot stop reading.I must give you a fair warning though: This book begins a plot that doesnt end for another six books. If you are an avid reader and can't put a book down, I would suggest you don't start reading this...as I could not force myself to stop. I found myself going from store to store buying the rest of the series and reading them all within a 3 month period.If you like this genre, you WILL like this book. I hope everyone else enjoys this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony is one of the most prolific authors of our time and he knows how to do it right every time. From the Xanth series (VERY punny), to the Apprentice Adept books to the Incarnations of Immortality series of which this is one, he continually comes up with fresh, original storylines and great characters. This book is (marginally) my favorite of all of his works, as I don't think I have ever seen the Grim Reaper portrayed more sympathetically or with more humor. What makes this book even more attractive is that it's a VERY easy read. The story just carries you along to the end and you just don't want to put it down. No big words, no extremely complex concepts to comprehend (wow! Alliteration!), just a good old-fashioned read. Most of the books that I read nowadays are very rich in prose and dialogue and plot and words that you have to look up in the dictionary. Piers doesn't inflict that on you, he just tells it like it is and with style. I like that. Makes a good break from my usual reading. I'm sure it will for you, too. Read it, it's good!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":". . .is portrayed in this book.Piers Anthony, beloved author of the tremendously popular &quot;Xanth&quot; novels, does something entirely different in this series.What if, just what if, magic was recognized and quantified as one of the forces of nature?What if, Death, Time, Fate, War, Nature, etc. could be identified as particular people set aside for (temporary) immortality to fulfull the necessary tasks the world needs to function?With these sorts of questions, this series &quot;Incarnations of Immortality&quot; begins. And this first volume &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot;, dealing with the character of Death, is arguably the best in the series.Below the surface of a brilliantly conceived fantasy novel, Anthony asks serious questions about good, evil, heaven, hell, and the role free-will plays in our lives. He does not, however, provide answers. The depiction of this fantasy universe is seemingly dualistic in nature. Will good win?Believe it or not, this novel should be required reading in seminary -- because every minister, regardless of denomination, will be faced with trying to provide reasonable answers to difficult questions. Again, while this novel (and those that follow) do NOT provide the answers, they nevertheless frame the questions in unique manners. The reader will certainly gain a new perspective.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Zane, a man down on his luck who suffers from seemingly bad choices throughout his life, accidentally kills the Incarnation of Death instead of himself and assumes his position. While he learns about his office, he realizes that the other Incarnations (war, time, nature, fate) are using him to prevent a conspiracy controlled by Satan from coming into existance."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is my first go through with the Incarnations novels, so I'm a virgin to them. However, I have read a decent chunk of Anthony's other writing: a large selection of the Xanth novels, the \\"horror\\" novel \\"Shade of the Tree\\", the adaptation of \\"Total Recall\\", and his (second) autobiography, \\"How Precious Was That While\\", so I feel marginally able to review this novel in the broader context of his work.Not all of his work \\"sounds like\\" the Xanth novels - \\"Total Recall\\" and \\"Shade of the Tree\\" were not at all Xanth-esque in their voice. That said, the style of \\"On a Pale Horse\\" is definitely similar to Anthony's Xanth work. There is sort of a twisted innocence about this style: childlike, yet definitely tainted with sexual and violent overtones; one gets the impression that Anthony could be a Freudian. There is also a great deal of the author's own personal tastes and opinions peppered through the book, which would probably be pretty clear to even a first-time reader - however, having read his autobiography, I can certainly identify his personality in the text more clearly.The character of Zane also brings Xanth to mind - he reads a lot like a corrupted Bink, from \\"A Spell for Chamelon\\". There is something bland and naive about Anthony's male characters - interestingly, his female characters tend to have more depth and color. An earlier reviews raged about the author being \\"misogynistic\\", and \\"always\\" portraying women as being sex objects and of inferior intelligence. I have to disagree totally - some of Anthony's deepest, most intelligent (and aggressive) characters are female.Certainly the character of Luna in this novel is one of them - as bright, morally conscious, and spunky as any of his female characters that I have encountered. I will allow that Anthony can seem to be an arrogant, egomaniac with some archaic and offensive ideas (and doesn't really care if people think that, by the way) - and he does indeed recognize women (and men) as sexual creatures, which is never far divorced from their intellect or other attributes. But, let's be fair - human beings are sexual creatures. One might argue that the author is over-emphasizing this, but that doesn't make it any less true, and it certainly is the author's right to exaggerate things to suit his purpose. It's also the reader's right to disagree, and not read the work - but that doesn't make it trash.In fact, I think this is a remarkable work of fiction - thoughtful in it's presentation, and very stimulating intellectually. I may not agree with Anthony the man, but he certainly uses literature as an excellent vehicle for the exploration of weighty and relevent concepts here. I strongly disagree with the same earlier reviewer, when he encourages us to keep these books from our children. I, for one, would gladly have my son read these books. Indeed, ideas are the most dangerous things in the world - yet they are also the most affirming and creative things as well; ideas are the spring from which all humanity arises. Whether I agree with an author and his creation, or not, I greatly value literature that makes me think - to avoid ideas simply because they might be dangerous is at best to invite those ideas to come back unconsidered, and unprepared for. At worst it is to court ignorance. I applaud Piers Anthony, in all his arrogant, ego-maniacal misogyny for giving me and my child something of depth and weight to think and talk about."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I loved this book in part due to Anthony's presentation of a world in which science, magic, and religion mesh together without contradiction. The plot, character buildup, setting, and very idea of Incarnations of Immortality is sheer genious. This book is wonderful. I haven't read book 2 or 5 in this series, but 3 and 4 were excellent as well. This is my favorite out of the ones I've read, though."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Let me first say that I own this book and the entire series that follows. Let me also say that I started and finished that series while I was in High School. At the time, I thought it was one of the most ingenious things I'd ever heard of. I loved the blending of science fiction and fantasy elements; the characters; and the overall premise.Now, I'm 28 and my tastes have matured somewhat. I still peruse the books occasionally, but the fact is that most of my enjoyment comes from nostalgia rather then the quality of the book.Here's the good: The premise is still magnificent. A man accidentally kills Death and, as such, is forced to take over his role in the cosmos. The idea that the Incarnation of Death (as well as Time, Fate, War, and Nature) is simply a job that is performed by a (former) mortal is intriguing to me. I like the idea of giving a human face to such abstract concepts. The adventure is fun, and I still sometimes imagine what it would be like to live in such a world.Now the bad: Basically, it's not very well written, particularly during the dialogue. Language is stilted and formal, lacking the natural flow with which a normal person speaks (think of the dialogue from the Star Wars prequels). Also, there's no individual voice. If you were given five different scraps of dialogue, taken out of context, you'd never have a clue who was speaking because everybody speaks the same way. For example, I'd never heard the word \\"bailiwick\\" until reading this book, yet everybody in this universe both knows it and uses it at every possible opportunity. There are more such examples, but that's the first that pops into my mind.I might recommend this book for younger readers as a first foray into science fiction or fantasy (though there are some pretty up front sexual moments, so, if you're a parent, you may want to decide what's too young. I was in High School and hadn't seen sex even referenced in a book before this). For older readers, who are already well-read, you may want to give this one a pass.My best recommendation would be to find somebody who loves this book and have them tell you the story. Doubtless, they'll give you the best highlights, and gloss over the lesser parts. That way you still get the benefit of the wonderful premise and plot line, but you can avoid having to read the juvenile writing."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This series has the usual Piers Anthony Wit, but is a much more &quot;serious&quot; and thought-provoking read than the Xanth series (which I enjoyed in my teens, but found got too &quot;child-like&quot; to keep my attention when I got older).This series has more the 'dark' feel of Tolkien's classic &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; series - but actually comes from a much more original angle - each book comes from a very unique perspective of a &quot;mortal man&quot; that is suddenly thrust into taking on the role of an &quot;immortal&quot; (such as Death or Fate or War), and serve certain &quot;duties&quot; in order to maintain the proper &quot;order&quot; of the world. Piers Anthony does a great job of making each &quot;immortal&quot; role convincing as well as the actions and reactions of the mortals suddenly finding themselves in these roles. Makes a person think about the balance of forces in life."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I stumbled across this book accidentally and was interested by the description of the story. I didn't know if I would like it or not and figured that I would read it for an hour and if I liked it I would continue to read it.\\\\If you can't tell from my rating, the reading went on for more than an hour. This ended up being very hard to put down and I really enjoyed the experiences of Zane as he learned the office and role of Death. Of interest was the story of Luna (Zane's love) and Death's hand in thwarting the plans of Satan over her.Also of interest was the author's view of how Death is only a part of life and not something to be feared of. It was nice to find this true message in this work of fiction.I found this to be very imaginative and original. I loved it and I look forward to the other books in this series!! I would recommend this to anybody who is looking for a book that is both different and philosophical."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I don't typically like Anthony's efforts much. Out of the eight or nine books of his I've tried to read, I've only finished four and there were only two of these that I liked.'On a Pale Horse' was one of them. Anthony's take on Death is at once thought-provoking and funny, and the world he establishes in this novel is an interesting one. The book grabbed my attention from the very beginning (where the protaganist shoots Death and must then take on his mantle) and held it to very last page.This is a worthy addition to any fantasy library."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the third time I have bought this book. I keep loaning it and not getting it back so this one I keep and no one knows I have it. Its the only sifi book I have ever liked."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book is a great mix of science fiction and fantasy used to paint an underlying picture of death that is complete in every aspect. Without ruining anything within this book, the character of death and the philosophical interpretations of death are examined as one man incidentally becomes death himself and travels through his new macabre role, gaining a deeper understanding of death and himself that you as the reader get to enjoy alongside him as you both come to your own conclusions about what death is and what it means."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"A good read and the whole Incarmations of Immortality series makes you think. Very unreal and real at the same time."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony is a master of fantasy fiction, focussed more on the younger crowd but well worth the time to read as an adult - especially an adult who read this book 20 years ago and wants a reminder of days gone by.

Anthony treats very serious issues with a light hearted look, being as simple as the human heart calls for. While this simplicity may be seen as naive, or childish, I think it's the mark of wisdom.Piers messes around with science fiction and fantasy in a very funny way, because of how outlandishly ridiculous it gets. But the thing is, he doesn't ever seem to be taking himself very seriously. I never liked the mix of sci-fi and fantasy, myself, and I wasn't aware of that in the book when I began reading it, and still I enjoyed it a lot... so, if you're skeptical about this kind of thing (as I often am), don't be.Don't intelectualize it a lot. It's just good old fun."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"One rarely considers a science fiction book to be funny but this one is humorous.

And with Zane having noidea what he was supposed to do he went out the door and down the stairs and saw a car. The lights were on so death went to it and went in it. Zane started driving and noticed that he didn't exactly need to drive. Once at his first client he had to take the soul of a woman in a car crash. Zane had to go through a lot of things, but the worst of all was that he was in a trap planned by the king of lies, satan. Satan was planning for Zane to kill LUna the woman he loved. Well.

Thantos the star of the book Zane kills death then becomes death and has to ride around the world(on his pale horse wich i would like to have you will find out why if you read the book) taking the souls of the half evil half good people write at the moment of thier death. He is also teamed up with with the other incarnations (nature,fate,war,and time.) Then he finds himslef in the trap of Saton who has arranged it were Zane himself will have to take her soul. But the only way out is for him to face the lord of evil himslef."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Out of all the Fantasy books I have read, On a Pale Horse surpases them by far. The way the book flows from begining to end, never dull or boring, just captivated me."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I have read 'On a Pale Horse' numerous times, and a little more insight into the nature of the universe is gained with each reading. Anthony has a the peculiar talent of helping people think more easily, and although this book isn't a 'work of literature' in the traditional sense, it is still immenseley enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book was a great read!!! It was beaten only by &quot;With a Tangled Skein&quot;. Zane was an interesting character in himself. Mortis (the pale horse(for those of you who haven't read the book)) is an ingenious creation by the master of Sci-Fi and Fantasy Himself,Piers Anthony! If you want to read an awesome book, read this. It is the first book in the Incarnatons of Immortality and a great one to start out with. All in all a great Book by the A man!!!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"From the first Piers Anthony book I read, I have been a total Piers fan. I read and re-read every book of his that I can find. I had read On A Pale Horse a few years before, but in August of 1992 I felt that I &quot;Had&quot; to read it again. It was as if something was compelling me to read it. I finished it on the morning of the 8th about 1/2 hour after finishing the book I had an emergancy phone call informing me that my 3 month old granddaughter had died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The next few days were very traumatic, but remembering the instance in the book where the child died and was taken to Heaven was very comforting to me. I have read the book about 4 times since then and always get a peaceful feeling when I finish."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"The balance between good and evil wrestled in the Incarnations Series of Piers Anthony's books provides an understanding of the way we sometimes look at life and immortality. This particular book invites the reader to step into the shoes of the Grimm Reaper himself. And towards the end of this journey you will feel compelled to show compassion towards this character. What I found most enjoyable about this series is the way it exposed me to a new perspective of reality"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"When the grim reaper shows up a few seconds early, Zane shoots him instead of using the gun on himself as he'd planned. Now, instead of being dead, Zane is Death. He has to take over the office, riding around the world in his convertible pale horse collecting and measuring the souls of those who've committed equal amounts of good and evil during their lives -- those who are \\"in balance.\\" In his new guise (complete with all of the accouterments: scythe, hooded cloak, skeleton face, etc), Zane sets out to change Death's image while dealing with his own personal demons.This is a fun premise and I expected Piers Anthony to do a lot with it, but unfortunately I found On a Pale Horse to be mostly illogical, trite and, worst sin of all, just plain boring. Part of the problem is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy, a love story, or a heavy philosophical treatise. It tries to do all three (it should have been possible), but it fails at all three. The comedy, as usual for Piers Anthony, consists of puns, allusions, and light black humor. For example, when Zane asks Mortis (the pale horse) something to which the answer is negative, Mortis says \\"neigh\\" (that was the only one I actually laughed at). I enjoy puns in real-life dialogue (they indicate a quick wit), but they don't often work for me in print and this is one of the reasons I don't read Piers Anthony (I gave up on the first Xanth book after 4 chapters, but I tried On a Pale Horse because it sounded mature and interesting).There were some things I did find funny -- Death lives in a house that looks like a funeral home and answers fan mail, Satan uses his publicity budget to sponsor Hellathons, group plans, and billboard advertising, a soul's balance of good and evil is computed like an income tax, and you should hear Satan argue with a female Irish fishmonger -- but mostly I found the humor and cheesy dialogue to be juvenile.The love story is juvenile, too. Zane meets and immediately falls in love with Luna, whose main attractions are that she is beautiful, well-dressed, serious, and likes the same kind of art as Zane. After only a couple of conversations which they apparently think are deep, they are in love, but the reader certainly doesn't feel it.The humor and the romance are silly, but the thing that really killed On a Pale Horse for me was that it tries to be thoughtful and enlightening as Zane attends a variety of deathbed scenarios that illustrate the unfairness, loneliness, guilt, relief, grief, and ugliness of death. In these scenes (there's a long string of them), there is a lot of repetitive introspection and pondering and some \\"lessons\\" about the selfishness of suicide, the effects of incest or rape, the tragedy of an untimely death, the positive and negative aspects of war. Sounds like it could be profound, and I know it's supposed to be profound because in the rather pompous and lengthy (one hour on audio) author's note at the end, Mr. Anthony says \\"it is a satiric look at contemporary society with some savagely pointed criticism. It's also a serious exploration of man's relation to death... an ambitious hard-hitting social commentary.\\" Except it's not. It's rather superficially processed and it's all stuff that most thinking adults have pondered many times before. There's nothing new here, even for 1984 when it was published.Just as one example, there's a long scene in which Zane (as Death) enters a medical facility where machines are keeping dying people alive against their wishes. When he shuts down the power and they all are relieved that they can now die, he thinks he has greatly sinned and that now he'll have to make up for it by doing more good deeds. Of course, we the readers recognize that his mercy is the good deed and that it's not a sin to let people die naturally, but why hasn't this occurred to him before, especially since he's had personal experience with the issue and he's been thinking about it for months? Luna tells him \\"I think sometimes you just have to sin in order to do the right thing\\" which is a profound revelation for Zane, but it makes me wonder why an adult who hasn't advanced very far through Kohlberg's stages of moral development was chosen to be Death. This sophomoric philosophizing might work better in a YA novel, but On a Pale Horse, with its succubi and other sexual references, is marketed to adults.I was beyond bored with On a Pale Horse and the only reason I managed to finish it was so that I could thoroughly review it. Unfortunately, I was listening on audio and couldn't skim. The reader, George Guidall, wonderful as he is, actually seems to slow down during the introspective scenes (I guess so that I can have time to process the heavy material?).Another reason that the attempted weightiness of the story didn't work for me is that On a Pale Horse is completely based on Christian theology. It's okay that Anthony gets some of it really wrong (purgatory is not Biblical, and neither is the idea that criminals and children of rape or incest are unacceptable to Heaven), but what's hard to overlook is that no mention is made of redemption, which is the crux of Christian belief (and a popular theme in fantasy literature). The whole point of Christianity is that Jesus paid the price for sin, so souls are not measured by the balance of good and evil deeds, but by whether or not they belong to Jesus.Of course, a savior would completely throw off Piers Anthony's entire premise, which is that man must secure a place in heaven by doing more good than evil. In order for this to work, Christ must be excluded, but in that case it seems that it would be better to not use CHRISTianity as the basis for the story because it forces the premise to fail. Mr. Anthony knows that, he knows we know it, and he wants us to just wink it away so that his story works with all of the clever Christian puns and allusions. For the most part I was able to do that, and I could have been perfectly happy doing that if On a Pale Horse didn't ask me to think. But when it asks me to seriously consider eternal issues and the nature of sin and death, good and evil, and Heaven and Hell in the context of a Christian system, then I have trouble leaving redemption out of the picture -- my thinking is restricted and I don't get very far if I have to omit key elements of the doctrine. For this reason, On a Pale Horse would have worked better as strictly a comedy."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I find it interesting that a bunch of people who read this book because they 'loved' the show 'Dead Like Me' would complain that this book isn't good. 'Dead Like Me' is terrible.This book was OK. Anthony's best effort was probably 'Shade of The Tree', but I've never really been a huge fan of his. I found the Xanth series fairly boring. I recall some of the 'Apprentice Adept' series as being good, but I read them when I was eight years old.The story is heavily in the P.A. style, and I was waiting for a young girl/old man relationship to pop up. It didn't happen in this particular book, but it shows up later in the series.This one is the better of the books in the 'Incarnations of Immortality', and may be the best. I've only read the first five, so I'm not entirely sure. It's definitely the best of that series out of the ones I've read, and really the only one I actually enjoyed.It was better than anything I've ever read by Dean Koontz. OR John Grisham, that I will say.I'd recommend it for fans of his 'Mode' series (which was almost, kind of ahead of it's time, slightly; but then again, I read those books when I was thirteen/fourteen), if they haven't already read this for some odd reason."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"After having read this book five times, I can say that it is frought with faults.On the other hand, it is the most addictive book I have ever read; also, the most inspiring; on top of all this, heart warming and meaningful.It makes you ignore the oversimpplifications and naive philosophising, and instead you develop a relation with it.In terms of enjoyment and emotion, it is five stars. After you have read it , again and again, you may find it simplistic, but also more familiar and looking forward to reading again in about a year."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Imagine this... A man takes a trip on a flying carpet to a little shop in the city selling amulets. Along the way he sees all sorts of billboards, many of them advertising the wonders of Hell itself. Cars drive on the roads below, airplanes fill the sky. And all around him are the signs of not only science, but magic as well.In the first book of the Incarnations of Immortality Piers Anthony does a wonderful job of mixing magic, science, and a fair dose of mayhem as he weaves mystery, adventure and romance together.He also gives an interesting twist to the old myths of Death, Fate, Satan, and other deities... One of my favorites."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Delightful, original and definitely a relaxing ride into the philosphies of life (and the after-life). The characters are unique and almost always smoothly introduced. Piers Anthony makes no habit of dilly dallying. He tells a tale and moves along, just the way I like my books. Reading book one has left me wanting more. However, there were times I got the impression that he bunched a chunk of discussion into one sequence. Necessary discussions, most definitely, but it was as if he wrote them in that one place just so he could get them over with. Sometimes I got the urge to skip those few paragraphs, but of course, I knew that if I gave into the temptation, I probably wouldn't understand what comes after it.All in all, I give this book a 4. It was, after all, most enjoyable."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I haven't read the Incarnations in over a decade and decided to revisit this amazing series. This series take a uniquie perspective at our existence with the 7 People that assumes the offices of their Incarnations (Death, Time, Fate, Nature, War, Satan, God).The First book visits the Incarnation of Death and how the character Zane assumed the office of the Grim Reaper as he was about to commit suicide. Unfortunately his predessesor botches the taking of Zanes soul,and Zane accidentaly kills the Incarnation of Death and assumes his job by doning he clothes and begins a very unique journey.I hope that people of Faith don't get to uppity in this read as it is merely a very clever and exiting Fiction of life. Heck, a little escape from reality is a good thing."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Zahn only THINKS he has problems, sure he is broke and he has no where to live but if all else fails he can always kill himself right?Well even that goes aye when he accidentally kills death. Ok this time Zahn's got real problems and he is drawn into a conspiracy involving God, Satan, Chronos, Mars and others.Overall-While it does have some theological plot holes big enough to drive a freaking truck threw I still like this book recommend it to all."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Zane is a suicidal young man with nothing to lose when he decides to shoot himself. As he is about to pull the trigger, he sees the Incarnation of Death (complete with grinning skull visage) coming for him. Just in time, he changes his mind, turns the gun away- and kills Death instead! This startling turn of events begins a macabre adventure, as Zane discovers he must now assume the office of Death, which he has rendered vacant. Equipped with his scythe and his pale horse, he embarks on a journey of discovery about death- and about life.The plot of this fantastical story is sometimes convoluted, never uninteresting. The setting- an alternate twentieth century Earth where magic works side by side with modern technology- provides plenty of background for some decent character development (and not a little social commentary, in places). In addition, the concepts and story development achieve a satisfying degree of complexity- a quality sometimes lacking in Anthony's light fantasy- while maintaining a reader-friendly writing style.Piers Anthony's numerous fantasy novels have won acclaim for their breadth of imagination. The Incarnations of Immortality series are excellent examples of his finer writing: the series spans seven novels, of which &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot; is the first, and possibly among the best. An easy readable style combines with an intriguing and fast-paced plot to produce a highly enjoyable book. Long-time Anthony fans will not be disappointed in this novel; for new readers, this is among his better works. High entertainment value!8.5 stars out of 10"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"The short and the sweet... If you like Sci-Fi... If you like Fantasy.... Get this series... Well written, engrossing, DIFFERENT! This is the first book in a series of 7 that puts forth a (fantastic) explination of the basic intrinsic forces that make up our universe. Death, Time, Fate, Nature, War, Evil and Good. A MUST READ!!!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I assign a five star review for the type of book that takes a hold of me and demands that I not put it down until the story has concluded. On a Pale Horse was this type of story.The story begins on an alternate earth where magic and science cooexist. As you read you'll also discover that Earth's past hasn't changed a great deal from what we know of it, Magic not being rediscovered and refined apparently until early in the 20th century. So, while alien, the reader is still able to relate to the world in most aspects.The lead character of Zane/Death is one which I found myself very much involved with. He, in time, becomes the type of character that almost anyone can identify with. As Zane matures into the office of Death, one becomes more and more drawn to his character and concerned for his character. The rest of the characters, including Luna, the eventual love interest of Zane, are treated as little more than window dressing. They exist in this particular story only to drive the plot. I see Luna as only half fleshed, but the reader comes to care for her because we realize that Zane cares for her, and we the readers have become quite fond of Zane.The climax is amazing as Death takes on the Incarnation of Evil and in the process risks the lives of his fellow lesser Incarnations (Time, Fate, War, Earth) and his love Luna as well as the future of the entire world.The story also delves into the nature of death as a necessary aspect of life. Without death would life not lose its value, it's purpose? Religion is discussed/debated as well, although the depth of such discussions aren't great. It provides intersting perspectives on such issues as sin and original sin, although they will probably anger the dogmatic."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"As a big fan of Piers Anthony's Xanth series, I have to admit, \\"On a Pale Horse\\" was not what I figured it would be (that is, full of jokes and puns), but I wasn't disappointed. The book follows a regular joe who just 'happens' to accidentally \\"kill\\" death... so he's stuck taking over the job. It's incredibly interesting to follow, with fresh ideas on what Death might be, and a look at why it's actually an important an necessary thing in life.I've read this book several more times and enjoyed it just as much on each re-read. Though I'm a huge fan of \\"Xanth\\", this book has become one of my favorites by Anthony. I probably never would have just picked it up myself, but my sister's recommendation wasn't wrong! If you're looking for a really fresh and unusual but fun read this could be it. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"While it's been awhile since i read this book i seen it in my book store and couldn't help it this is one of my favorites if not my favorite book of all time the whole incarnation of immortality series is awesome, but this is the best book followed closely by the book for love of evil, it grips you so hard you'll have a hard time putting it down, so leave yourself a day or 2 of free time before you start."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This book was my favorite of the series, though i have only read the first 3 and am halfway through the fourth. I love Anthony's take on death and what his job is. Also, Mortis is awesome. As I progressed through the series, i realized that Zane continues to be my favorite character. He is the least likely person to be considered as death yet, he makes the coolest death i have ever read about, even topping Terry Pratchet's Discworld Death. I strongly reccomend this for any anthony fan and if you have never read a piers anthony book, try this one!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Several comments have been made by customers stating that this book depicts women in a harsh way, I strongly agree with this. However, if you look past this unfortunate part of the book, you will find a lot of interesting ideas that Piers Anthony has presented in regards to death and the afterlife.I gave it three stars because I didn't exactly love the whole book. The ending became jumbled up and I felt it didn't exactly serve justice to the interesting first half of the book."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"What would you do in the office of death? Our main character Zane is confronted with this conandrum early on, ripped from the world of the living and tossed into the possition of the Immortal Incarnation of Death itself. The Grim Reaper, if you will - come to take your soul.Piers Anthony = magical worlds, unforgettable characters, and one heck of a story. You won't find this stuff from any other authors in the fantasy genre. Piers stands alone here. The whole Incarnations of Immortality Series is amazing, and this book surely gets this series off to a VERY good start.So how did you answer? Would you serve God? Satan? No one? Become unorthodox? Would you refuse to take souls? All of this and more you'll find explored in this deep, yet highly enjoyable fantasy read."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Let me say right off.. Piers Anthony is not the most elegant of writers.. His style is rather simplistic (by design I think) and he does not waste time on a lot of fluff.. The plus side of this is that rather than forcing imagery and a particular visualization of a scene on the reader, his style stimulates the imagination to create your own version of his worlds in your mind.On a Pale Horse begins one of the best fantasy/sci-fi series I have read. Despite its age, it is a series I find myself drawn back to over and over again. EVERYTHING CONNECTS in this series.. It has made me reread the books repeatedly, taking new pleasure in the realizations that come.. For example, there are events in this book that happen because of events in the 2nd, 5th and 6th books of the series.. (I don't want to give spoilers)..Creative, unique and richly thought-out.. If you enjoy a good fantasy story, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I am not much of a reader but this book took me on a journey I never imagined.

It took me a while to bring myself to read the Incantations series because they werent XANTH books, but once I got started .... boyohboy! What a brilliant series. The first book was so intriguing I just couldnt stop. The way the whole plot was put together really gave me a new outlook on life! Each book can luckily be read on its own, but it really is a great idea to read them all - not only because they are all good stories, but the plot within the plot is a nice twist! Go Piers!!!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This has got to be one of the best books I've read. PERIOD. I'm surprised this isn't a movie yet. IT IS SOOOO GOOD! A nice mix of action, romance, and the supernatural. Really cool."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the first, and best, of Piers Anthony's series Incantations of Immortality. Zane, a miserable and very poor man, inadvertenly becomes the Incarnation of Death when he kills the previous officeholder. The resulting adventure is very fun to read. He encounters Fate, Chronos, and of course (who else could it be) Satan. And, of course, the woman he falls in love with, Luna. I think this is at the level of Empire of the East; a great series second only to Lord of the Rings. I just reread it after reading it 20 years ago, and am glad I did so. Get it now!"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I highly recommend this book for all ages. Its topics are great, ranging from the philosophical argument of why death is necessary to the very entertaining way of Death to dealing with souls.*just a few spoilers*The characters in this book are exceptionally unique on its own. We got the ghost of a girl, who signals death to everyone she can perceive, the 5 incarnations of Death, Fate (three females (a young woman, a middle-aged one, and an aged woman) sharing one malleable body), Time (a male who can control all aspects of time), War (an stubborn, ancient, as in centuries old, misogynistic man) and Nature (a mysterious, riddle-speaking women, who is neither old or young), Death's horse: Mortis, a sarcastic computer, Satan and an artist who was offered by his father to the Incarnation of Death.*end spoilers*Overall, the book puts Zane in some interesting situations which continue to add to the ongoing premise of the book (A philosophical one, more than a plot based one, or so i'd like to believe ^_^), with varying results. For example, we get to see an Atheist point of view of their mainframe.Magic in the universe of the Incarnations is real but includes a psychological factor, for example, you and the person affected by it (if any) must believe (even in a subconscious level) that there is a threat or skill to be demonstrated (this is expanded upon in the sixth book of the series).To conclude, I'd like to recommend these book(s) to everyone (ranging from a considerable age (12?), since there is murder, rape, suicide and such other topics in this book)."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is one of my top 5 books of all time.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I read this book many years ago and have recommended it to many friends. I read the previous reviewer's ideas and I understand, however, I'm not sure this bunch of books should be taken very seriously. I think that On a Pale Horse is a very clever intersting take on death, love and life, and anything more than that should probably be left to more wieghtly non-fiction books.

He is able to write Zane incredibly well, and makes him real to the reader. Anthony is also able to traverse the dimentions of Purgatory and Hell without ostracising anyone.While this is a stand-alone novel, much like Anthony's other series books, I highly suggest reading this one begining to end--it will help with understanding some of the later books, as this is one series that is incredibly interwoven."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"If you enjoyed the movie \\"Meet Joe Black\\" or it's older \\"sibling\\" \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\" then you should definitely read this book.

This is one of the most entertaining, enjoyable, interesting books/series I've ever read. The series gets less and less innovative as it goes along (the other books take the same approach to discuss the different incarnations) but they take an interesting look at their respective incarnations and give a thought-provoking persepective on them.It's one of my favorite reads and I recommend it every chance I get."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"This is the first book of the Incarnations of Immortality.

The way the plots intertwine as you read from thebeginning of the series, &quot;The Pale Horse&quot;, to the end, areremarkable.

I was impressed with the ease of reading and read it in a few hours. The story flows easily and with amazing detail and color. The only gripe I have is Piers' seeming insistence that he is smarter than the reader, made obvious by his afterword. His social satire is excellent, but his insistence on explaining it and making sure the reader gets it after he initially presents it gets tiring. I will definitely read the other books."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I wonder why this book has not been made a movie yet?

I could not put it down. The way Anthony develops Zane, and how Zane is thrust into the role of Death by the Magician and Fate, was fantastic. The fact that it presents the Seven Incarnations (Death, Time, Fate, War, Mother Nature, Evil,and of course, Good) as &quot;Offices&quot; and people and not just abstract ideas, was definately something to think aboout. I say it is the best of all the seven books in the series.

Yes! Piers Anthony proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that it is not only possible but has already been done.

I thought it would suck but it was great. It made me feel better about my fear of dying. You gotta buy this book"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"It was over 10 years ago that I read this novel by Mr. Anthony. As a young man, I found much that entertained in his novels, but in having reconsidered his work, I see now that there was so much more there. This first novel provided for me a reference of how one wishes to define themselves. Limitations and obstacles can deter us from our place, but with creative thinking and a commitment to what we know is true and right, there are no limitations to what we can be. Zane is this character, unable to achieve in life what promise he had, Zane is able to become a true hero and find love by becoming Death. Anthony weaves the often conflicting worlds of magic and science easily and believably in a world where both are wielded. In Anthony's world, the powers of magic and science can be used for good or evil, but the pressing issues of the gray &quot;in-between&quot; areas in this dichotomy are exposed and pushed to their limit. This story, coupled with some serious philosophy was a journey for myself and even 10 years removed has helped me to define myself and what I wish to accomplish and the legacy I wish to leave on this earth. I highly recommend this novel for anyone who wishes to take a jouney coupled with an entertaining story and compelling characters."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"The novel, On a Pale Horse, is a fantasy by one of the masters of the field, Poul Anderson. It is the first in the intriguing \\"Incarnations of Immortality\\" series, which explores the ramifications of a world where things like Time, Fate, War, and the subject of this book, Death, were personified.This story takes place in the same fictional universe as some of Mr. Anderson's other novels. In it, Magic and Science are coexistent and codependent. This makes not only for a more interesting plot, but also a fascinating setting.Zane, the main character of this novel, has atrocious luck, and when something inside him guides him into the enchanted gem shop, this is graphically illustrated. When he holds the Deathstone, it shows him that his demise is but a few hours away. When he picks up the Lovestone, however, it shows him that his true love is just as close.Zane makes a deal. The shopkeeper may have the one true love Zane was supposed to have, in exchange for a Wealthstone rumored to bring its namesake. In short, the woman Zane was supposed to meet and fall in love with is rich beyond his wildest dreams, and the Wealthestone brings wealth, but in the form of occasional bits of lost pocket change.At home, Zane finds himself committing suicide when the door swings open and in strides Death incarnate. Zane has just enough composure to swing the gun around towards Death and pull the trigger. This is a mistake, as Zane soon learns, for the person who kills death gets to be his successor, with all of the position's responsibilities.Just as he is starting to get used to his job and try to change some of the rules for the better, he discovers that he is at the center of a conspiracy created by the other incarnations. This conspiracy will pit him against a force as great as any incarnation. It will force him to choose between his newfound love, and the well being of the Universe.Mr. Anderson's use of imagery is exemplary, and the plot, although complex at first gaze, becomes much simpler as you read. Although sensory language is rather lacking, the descriptions of the way Zane's world works more than make up for this. I found that this book had a completely unexpected ending, and the tone was surprisingly upbeat for the subject matter.This novel is an excellent read, and will pull you into its clutches as soon as you start the first page. This is another excellent fantasy from Poul Anderson, and I look forward to reading the rest of this series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Though the author seems to have some interesting philosophy behind his writing, I was not impressed with the dialogue and setting of the book. The creation of this scientific/magical future was unbelievable to me. The conversations between the characters seemed forced and badly timed. To me, the only time when the story flowed was when the writing led to the internal workings of the characters' minds."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony, On a Pale Horse (Del Rey, 1983)I tried. I really did try. Even after attempting the horror that was Xanth, and failing miserably, I still went ahead and gave Incarnations of Immortality the good old college try. I mean, the premise is irresistible-- seven novels, each based on one of the seven immortals. The plot here is a clever one, and from the outset Anthony shows that he's a very shrewd worldbuilder; when Death comes for a young man contemplating suicide, said young man instinctively shoots Death instead, and thus is called to assume the office. We see various aspects of Anthony's cleverly-constructed world through the eyes of a character who must travel all around it, looking at it through, as it were, new eyes. This is great stuff, and a moderately competent writer could turn it into pure gold.Piers Anthony, however, is not a moderately competent writer. While the florid language that made A Spell for Chameleon such unreadable dreck is toned down some here, there's still way too much of it per paragraph to make this book anything but a trial to read. As well, his characters-- most of whom, more's the pity, seem as if they're quite well-drawn-- converse as if they couldn't possibly be less interested in the world around them. This is definitely not the attitude one wants one's main character to take when said main character is learning the ropes of one of eternity's most important jobs, is it?Where abandoning Xanth was a relief, with Incarnations of Immortality, it's frustrating, because it's obvious there's more potential in any given aspect of this book's existence than there is in, say, Tom Clancy's entire corpus. Piers Anthony, however, was exactly the wrong writer to attempt to pull it off. (zero)"},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"When I first read the Incarnation series 15 years ago, I really enjoyed them. I recently saw them at the library and picked them up again. I've forced myself through the first three books and am so appalled at them that I'm returning the fourth book to the library and won't bother with the next ones in the series.I enjoy good fantasy and still read it regularly (and yes, I'm over 30 years old and have a regular, well-paying job). However, I have found the Incarnation series to be infuriating. The blatant and repetitive sexism is appalling. It's disgusting and it's on every page with every character, male or female, young or old. Women are always considered sex objects and are *always* thought of as less intelligent than men.The general concept is fascinating, and like the previous poster, I think it has incredible potential. But Anthony degrades the concept by pursuing ridiculously simplistic and uninteresting plot lines with no character development. I have literally skipped over 50 page sections of the book because they boring and irrelevant. I doubt I will ever bother reading any of Anthony's books again. (I used to enjoy the Proton/Phaze series as well, but doubt that I would find it any different.)For those of you with children and are considering purchasing this for them, please reconsider. We learn patterns of behavior from many sources, including the books we read. I, for one, would never want my children exposed to this man's misogynistic view of women."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I also picked up this book because I'd heard it had inspired the tv show \\"Dead Like Me\\". I have read some of Piers Anthony's books before (the Mode series). I always saw these books in the bookstores, and I never picked one up, so finally I decided to give it a try.I'm almost sorry I wasted my time on it, but fortunately, it was short. This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. The premise is interesting. I love mythology, and I thought that reading about the character of death would be interesting. Unfortunately, the prose is extremely wooden, the characters are very flat, and the little humor that is present is out of place (neigh!). The whole gemstone thing seems extremely contrived and patched together with the story of the office of death. The plot is extremely predictable and paced too slowly in places. Satan/Hell and God/Heaven are almost completely glossed over. At least a little more time is spent on purgatory, but not much. The roles of women are extremely flat, which bothers me more than the sexism and the frequent breast references.All in all, it reads like something written by a 13 year old. Nice effort, needs work. Interesting idea, could have been SO MUCH BETTER.Too bad. I'm definitely not wasting money on the rest of the series."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Zane, a poor man is cheated out of wealth and ends up killing death. Now Zane has to take all the responsiblities of Death."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Without revealing too much about the story or the characters for those of you that would actually like to read this series of books, I'd like to let the ladies in on something. Based on this series the author seems to be a misogynist (to put it simply - someone who strongly dislikes women). This is the only series by Piers Anthony that I have read and it is highly unlikely that I will ever read anything by this author ever again.The way he writes about women is infuriating. I didn't actually pick up on it at first. His low opinion of women just kind of sneaks in there all quiet like and slowly infects all the characters. Basically women simply exist to be sex slaves and pretty accessories to men. Women are also expected to always clean up, cook for and take care of the men as well. At one point War says that \\"women don't count\\"! Even the books written from the point of view of the female characters end up with this same view -- the women always second guessing themselves and thinking themselves unworthy of the tasks before them and the men in their lives.There were a couple of different characters (War and Evil) that had and were EXPECTED to have more than one woman or wife at a time!Fate is EXPECTED to do sexual favors for the other male incarnations simply because of the difficult lifestyle situation of the incarnations.At one point one of the women was magically turned into a man and tried to rape another woman. This brought her to the realization that it's understandable why men rape women because they have a very strong sexual drive. Thereby almost making it \\"okay\\" that rape happens since she understood it through this strange experience.Consenting sexual love is discussed thoroughly in one of the books. I agree with the basic gist of Mr. Anthony's reasoning that as long as two people are fully consenting and in love that it should be okay for them to have a physical relationship as long as they are both free of other relationships to do so. However, I think the author took it too far in that one of the characters was a young girl of 15 and the other was an older man in his mid 50's. I think that the so-called consenting people should definitely be over 18 at the very least if they are going to engage in a physical relationship. I found the whole storyline between these two characters disgusting and very difficult to read.Overall, the idea of the existence of incarnations was interesting and different. However, I was repeatedly disappointed with the ending of each of the books. Why on earth I bothered to finish the series I will never understand. I will not read another Piers Anthony book ever again."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"If it weren't Piers Anthony, this dreck would have never been published. It is frightfully bad.First of all, be very clear that this book is primarily a fable to convince you of the moral rectitude of assisted suicide. If you can't tolerate that, don't even start the book. I happen to be quite sympathetic to the idea, but that does not warm me to the book.The world starts out kind of interesting. However by the mid-point of the book, the internal logic of the world is hopelessly contradictory. The handling of Satan and God is particularly ridiculous. The context that the characters operate in becomes more and more contrived, until the plot is nothing more than a series of contrivances to say yet again how death is a mercy to the sick/aged/infirm...You might hope at this point that your interest in the characters and their development could carry you through. Maybe the author has something interesting to say about the human condition in the presence of such contrivances. Too bad... Characters in this book (especially women) are shallow and uninteresting.Don't buy or even borrow this book. If you want something from Mr. Anthony, read some of the early Xanth stuff instead."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"I picked this book up because they say it inspired Dead Like Me the tv programme on Showtime. It was against my better judgement to even finish this book.This starts out interesting enough -- main character Zane kills death, assumes his office and is now the Grim Reaper. Cool idea, definately.But after about 2 or 3 chapters, the story spirals down: the characters are one dimensional; the plot murky, predictable and lame; the dialog is as bad as a cheesy 70's porn film.I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy, I really wish I'd stopped it when it went downhill, because I might have been more forgiving that way."},{"Title":"On a Pale Horse","review":"Piers Anthony is a hack.

The story opens up in the City of Turmoil, where a group of children decide to cause mischief that day. Some time later, they see a stranger. They are fascinated by him, for they have never met someone so beautiful kind. The Wanderer is horrified and disgusted by the evil in the city. He shows five of the children and five other adults, the \`burdens' of dishonesty, deceit and many other things, that they carry. Suddenly they have heavy sacks on their backs that they can't remove.

A group of 5 children and 5 adults journey to the City of Happiness in The Land of Far Beyond so that they can rid themselves of the heavy burdens that have appeared on their backs. These burdens are the outward manifestation of their own dark deeds and cruelties. Along the way, they meet many temptations and shady characters, but they also meet many kind, loving people.

Secret 7 and Mallory Towers were prime favourites. I think I was about 7 or 8 when I stumbled upon &quot;The land of Far Beyond&quot; and initially thought it a very strange departure from the usual adventure stuff. The story is about some children who meet a stranger and then depart on a long journey, on route having to contend with certain challenges,some seemingly insurmountable. However as I read I got more absorbed into this fairly dark tale of a long ardous journey involving some lovable and some not-so loveable characters.The end I shouldn't reveal but will promise to please all. I would like to say that this story so amazingly written moves the reader either young or old between incredible depths of despair, hope and joy and at the same time giving valuable insight into our attempts to achieve moral character as we grow older. EB is a true genius - she makes the reader feel every single human emotion created,the only fault being that the book has an end.Anybody with a ounce of curiousity regarding the why and how of good vs evil should have a go at this.

He learned Irish while there. As an outsider, he was a person of great interest. He spent a lot of time talking with people, including some who knew only Irish. He took down many tales he was told. The book describes the way of life in about 1900 and relates many of these tales, as well as some poems. However, his story is weaker concerning how the Islanders made their living (but does have graphic tales of seamanship in rowing and steering a curagh through very rough weather). For an insider's view of traditional Irish island life at this time period, the books written by the Blasket Islanders are a better source. I give it a lower rating than most others based on this comparison."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"My dad was born there in the 1950's and i was named after it. not a bad place, not much to do but nice to visit. the book is informal but informative."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"People have often said to me that they find Synge's account of his time spent honing his Irish and collecting folklore on the Aran Islands to be one of the slowest and most boring reads they've ever encountered. I must heartily disagree.While the work doesn't exactly &quot;swing like the pendulum do&quot;, the rhythms of his narration are very much like that of the changing tide and the rolling of the waves to which the islanders have grown accustomed. Synge's narration-- like time on Inishmaan-- moves slowly and steadily, washing over the reader if one will let it.Remember above all that this work is essentially a series of journal entries, meant to document the people Synge met, the conversations he had, the stories he heard, etc. Perhaps the book's greatest contribution to the world is as a document of a way of life no longer in existence. This book is also a document of the the Irish Literary Renaissance, and-- for its occassional pretensions-- should be ! considered as such. This text might also help to give greater understanding to any reading of Synge's plays, as he alleged that the story for such works as &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot; were derived from tales he heard in the Arans."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"\\"The Aran Islands\\" is a delightful rendition of the experiences of J.

Live there as one of the people themselves; express a life that has never found expression.\\" Here Synge gained an insight into the Irish character which would enrich his later works.The Aran Islands are a chain of islands off the coasts of Connemara and Clare. Isolated by the sea, the Arans, like the Galapagos in the natural world, preserve the language and customs of traditional Ireland.The book is a narrative of what Synge saw and the stories he heard during his stays in the Arans, told by a master storyteller in the finest Irish tradition. The language is delightful, the stories are entertaining and the insight into the Irish soul is profound.

I have had the privilege of spending two weeks on Inish Mor, one 4 years ago and one in the summer of 2001. The difference between the two visits was enormous . . . where on the first visit I saw perhaps 5-6 cars a day on the little roads, now there are minibuses beetling along everywhere. The pony carts are strictly for the tourists. I missed the women setting up kiosks on the road, selling their beautifully made sweaters. At the same time, throughout the summer, the young people put on a nightly concert featuring traditional Irish music and dance -- and it is fantastic! So wonderful to see the beauty of the old traditions taking hold in the hearts of the young men and women.BUT ... what is quaint to the tourist translates into abject poverty for the native.

Synge's book about life on the desolate Aran Islands is a very well written look into a society that could only exist until that time, and in that place. The Aran Islands, a group of islands off the west coast of Ireland, were at the time almost completely cut off from the mainland, except via the 'hooker' and the skin covered 'curagh' that plays such a critical part both in life on the islands, and in the book. Life there was very hard and made the character of the prople very unique. The islands were, and are, one of the strongest 'Irish' speaking cultures, and the ability to find life in the midst of it all is profoundly apparent throughout the book, as is Synge's obvious appreciation of the simple life and simple beliefs found there (note the comparison he makes to the 'busy' and 'lost' world in Galway, merely across the bay). It is a book of it's time, and shound be read in the context of the beginning of the 'Irish Revival' then beginning."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"This book describes the adventures of J.

William Butler Yeats suggested that Synge visit the island in order to learn Irish and become acquainted with traditional Irish culture as it had been preserved on the islands. Synge followed his suggestion, and made four lengthy trips to the islands. In this book, he recounts his experiences on the islands, together with some of the stories and poems that were recited to him there.The book is a unique collection of travelogue, journal, and research notebook. Synge describes his relationships with individuals on the islands, as well as some of the common traits and customs observable there. He tells us about harrowing sea passages that he took from island to island in small rowed boats, and records a number of folk-tales that were shared with him by island residents. Synge was to draw on all of this material in his later writing career, making the book quite interesting for those who enjoy his plays. The book also provides informative details of what daily life was like in this remote region at the time."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"The search for authentic experiences is regarded as an important theme in postmodernism. John Millington Synge's book demonstrates that this quest for authenticity has been an important part of cultural inquiry for a long time. This wonderful book was written almost one hundred years ago, but it reads like a contemporary ethnographic inquiry. He provides vivid descriptions of daily life and wonderful presentations of the folklore of the Aran Islands. The book is primarily descriptive, but there are interesting textures and conclusions throughout Synge's writing. I would recommend reading this book and then watching Flaherty's film \\"Man of Aran.\\" Follow up that visual feast with Stoney's \\"The Making of the Myth.\\" To complete your excursion, top things off with a reading of Synge's \\"Playboy of the Western World\\" and \\"Riders to the Sea,\\" two fine plays that he set on the Aran Islands. The stories, descriptions, and textures within Synge's book will become very clear when you're finished."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"Not only does this book describe a time long past but Synge has a deeper sense of the psychology of the inhabitants of the Aran Islands and how it differs with that of \\"civilized\\" people of the time. Anyone who is interested in this topic and enjoys this book would do well to read Twenty Years A-Growing by Maurice O'Sullivan, which is a personal account by Mr. O'Sullivan of his life on Ireland's Great Blasket Island and is a wonderful, lyrical read that shows alot of humor as well as love for the natural world around him."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"This book definitely starts slowly, and initially one may be put off by a sense that Synge is trying to adopt an appropriate voice and is uncertain where he fits in with the picture. Give it time, however, and both the description of the time and place, and finally Synge's place in it, become really interesting. He was young but also something of an invalid at the time, and the perspective varies movingly and thought-provokingly, from total outsider to partial insider, thanks to huge but under-stated effort on the part of Synge, driven by both a desparate urge to amount to something in his short life, and a wistful desire to partake of a &quot;normal&quot; life that would elude him."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"...at least the far western end, if you exclude Iceland, as is generally done. The Aran Islands are a chain of islands, composed of three principal ones, which are just off the western Irish coast, from Galway bay. I learned of this book from Tim Robinson's excellent accounts of the totality of life on these islands, in hisStones of Aran: LabyrinthandStones of Aran: Pilgrimage. Robinson published his accounts in 1986, based on his life on the islands, commencing in 1972. In both of Robinson's books, he references Synge's account of life on Aran around the turn of the century (nowadays, we need to specify that is the beginning of the 20th century). I made that proverbial mental note to read Synge, which I was finally able to fulfill, stumbling on this 1993 version in a used book store in nearby Santa Fe.Synge was enjoying \\"La Belle Epoque\\" in Paris, determined to be an authority on contemporary French literature when he met William Butler Yeats, who was from Ireland's west coast, near Sligo. Yeats urged him, essentially, to \\"get back to your roots,\\" with the ultimate Gallic experience being available as far away from Britain as possible. And these islands fit that specification. At the time, Britain was directly ruling Ireland.Robinson lived on the largest island in the chain, Aranmor. Synge sought out life on the middle island, Inishmann, under the idea that life there would be less \\"corrupted\\" by modern influences. There was no \\"steamer\\" service to this lesser island; transport was by a small rowboat, called a curagh. Picturesque in calm seas, but often perilous, as Synge recounts, in the stormy Atlantic. Synge states that life on Inishmann was the most primitive in Europe, and underscores that with a startling fact: there were no wheeled vehicles on any of the islands.Synge has an ethnographer's ear for native folk tales which he faithfully records, but does not particularly analyze. One of the longest concerns the killing of giants in order to win the hand of the daughter of the King. He also relates the story about a person who promises a \\"pound of flesh\\" as a debt, but does not mention that Shakespeare incorporated this into one of his most famous plays,The Merchant of Venice. Synge also carefully describes the clothing of these \\"natives.\\" He is less strong on the economic basis of the society, but does describe the process whereby kelp is collected, and iodine extracted. He also has a memorable section concerning when the landlords, via the police, evict various residents from their hovels for non-payment of the rents. He says: \\"The land is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed the following year, so the rye-growing is carried on merely for the straw, which is used for thatching.\\"Synge anticipates Paul Goodman'sGrowing Up Absurdby 60 years: \\"It is likely that much of the intelligence and charm of these people is due to the absence of any division of labour, and to the correspondingly wide development of each individual, whose varied knowledge and skill necessitates a considerable activity of mind.\\" He also focuses on the language abilities of the residents, and even on these remote islands, English has largely penetrated. The descriptions of the natural world are sparser, but he can wax lyrical at times: \\"Looking back there was a golden haze behind the sharp edges of the rock, and a long wake from the sun, which was making jewels of the bubbling left by the oars.\\"Robinson is, by far, the polymath; his account is much longer and more comprehensive. If I was going to Aran (as I hope to do), and could read only one author, I'd choose Robinson. But Synge's account rings authentic; he also is a keen observer of the islands, more than 70 years before Robinson's arrival. Fortunately I've now been able to read both accounts; would recommend them both. Now all I have to do is get to Aran. 5-stars."},{"Title":"The Aran islands","review":"J.M. Synge might have been one of the best Irish writers in history, but despite that fact and the fact that his subject, the life on the desolate Aran Islands, is a very interesting one, I cannot help but be bored by this book. The Aran Islands is a group of islands outside the west coast of Ireland, and the life there is very harsh. The sea, the wind, the lack of good soil... all this worked to make life here very hard and shaped the culture and the attitude of the individuals. Furthermore, the islands were almost totally cut off from the mainland at the time this book was written (now it's a popular tourist spot where you can visit &quot;Synge's cottage&quot;). Synge went to the Aran Islands five or six times during as many years, and wrote this book to &quot;express a life that never found expression before&quot; (Yeat's words). The life on these islands, far from the modern civilization that takes place only a few hours away on the Irish mainland, is indeed of interest. But nothing happens. In the whole book. It starts with Synge being on the Island, his first day there. It ends with Synge leaving the Islands for the last time. In between, all there is is the interesting description of the islanders' life, which could have been described better in another way, and Synge's mixed emotions of them. As a reader you get the visitor's view of the island, a visitor that wants so badly to be accepted at one time, the next minute, he thinks of them as primitive. It is worth reading because of the informative contains, however. And if you plan on visiting the islands, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. I read it out of interest in the pioneer experience in the Dakota territories. It describes that well, but also decribes the politics of the weather service as well as the detailed weather events that occur to create a fast, killer blizzard. I didn't expect the last two topics to be so interesting, but they were."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What a day it must have been. The inhabitants of North Dakota and Nebraska in 1888 were by nature hearty souls, mostly immigrants from cold Scandinavian shores, schooled in the austere virtues of backbreaking work, abiding faith, and heavenly rewards. Amusements for these settlers were few and simple, but very sweet.So when the day dawned springlike on January 12, 1888, after months of habitual grinding Arctic temperatures, these prudent and cautious folk could be forgiven for thinking that just maybe nature had blessed them with a treat. It's easy to imagine the first smells of warmth, the delight in shed clothing, the hope that stirred in the air. But what treachery awaited them. Rarely has fate dealt so cruel a blow to such good and beleaguered people.The Blizzard of '88 is one of those American events which lives on in legend in the region, while largely forgotten in the greater annals of history. This is unfortunate, because it's a tragedy that tells a greater story about the nation at that time, a tale filled with personal stories of pathos and stoic heroism that resonate with nobility in today's jaded world. And in the skillful hands of historian and weather enthusiast David Laskin, it's a riveting read.Laskin endows this short and intense work with a lot of strenuous research, and manages to weave together individual stories and greater events with a novelist's flair. He's helped by the fact that this is an extraordinary event at all levels, but his skills as a writer and his obvious love for his subjects free the book from all hyperbole and imbue it with empathy and humanity throughout. From the harrowing journeys of all the main protagonists across the ocean, through the cities, and on out to the plains to search of a decent livelihood, the reader comes to care enough about all of these people to imagine them alive again, struggling and determined, working for a better day and a more propserous life for the children for whom they've come so far.By midday on that January 12, the children of the plains dwellers sat at school, ready for recess, excited to run about with little more than sweaters and shawls, when outside a hellish cloud was boiling. Within minutes the temperature dropped more than thirty degrees, and the storm suffused everything in its path. The debates among teachers, students and parents that dictated fate began: What to do? Stay in school or head home? How bad can this storm get?From here its impossible to peel away from the book. Each family that the reader comes to know, each child with his little quirks and habits, all these fates hang in the balance. Sometimes it's difficult to imagine that this was all real, that people endured and survived such heartache and suffering.Laskin is at his strongest when detailing individual stories, though he tarries for an extended period over the politics of the weather bureau and the primitive inadequacies of forecasting at the time. Not that these aspects of the story aren't relevant and interesting, but incompetence and political posturing aren't remarkable in modern society. But when the author writes the scene of a father bringing home the frozen bodies of three of his sons to lay in front of the fire while their mother, well beyond grief, breaks into torrents of distracted laughter that last for hours and hours, the power of the moment seems to fly away from him and become real. Scenes like this make this book a document of uncommon power, as if in the telling of it the author unleashes secrets of the human spirit even he can't comprehend."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This book drew a believable face on human tragedy. So many times we think of people from the 1800's as remote, stoic; devoid of emotion. The author successfully fleshes out the grim, gimlet-eyed, stiff portraits of our ancestors."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Having lived in North Dakota for some time, it is easy to relate to this fascinating book, it is not only about \\"the childrens blizzard\\", which in some circles is quite well known, it is about weather, geography, history, families etc. It covers so very much in its 290 some pages.It is, to me, one of, if not the best book I've ever read or have read in a very long time,it is sometimes hard for me to read books like this, cause I miss my Dakota, and because there are very real tragedies that happened here with this storm of 1888,the big snow, or whatever.I left there for economic reasons, and to this day miss it, but it is also a great pleasure to read this and other books like this because it kind of gives you a sense of being there, and being involved in it all,and, shall we say, being a little closer to home. Anyway, David Laskin has got himself an exceptional book here, and I would give it much much more than 5 stars,yes, there is a little bit of jumping around with families and names involved in what happened, but it does not cause a problem with the book,this is all expertly written, and for weather buffs, like me, the important storm information is given.It's one of those books that you can't put down, and you want even more once your done reading it."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Laskin has a rare gift for making the Unthinkable past an immediate experience, allowing the reader to walk alongside all-too-real human beings, many of them children, as they make choices and sometimes irrevocable mistakes. His tale is a slow but rewarding build and getting to the moment just before the storm breaks is akin to sitting in a bobsled poised on a slope. There is much to learn and process in The Children's Blizzard, and no small amount of heartbreak. Of additional fascination to me is the relative perspective this account adds to thoughts about my own German immigrant forbears. Truly a privilege to read and important to remember as a nation what these people endured."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What more could you ask for in learning history? Laskin puts us in the shoes of these intrepid pioneer farmers in so descriptive a way that I felt like the neighbor next door - and found myself worrying about this community like it was my own. Children were not the only vicims, but it was the horror of timing (an usually warm day, school just letting out) that makes this episode in American history so heartbreaking. What does it feel like to be in a once-in-a-century blizzard? Read this book and you'll know! I reread several passages more than once, just to imagine and experience it all over again. I understood with horrified fascination just what the varying (and serendipitous) effects might be on that unfortunate person who could not find a warm shelter in time. I thought that Luskin's structure of the book - simultaneously bringing together the poignant human drama with what was happening in the bureaucracy of that day - was illuminating. No matter what the advances were in the technology of the day, it was still human heroism, hubris and error that made the ultimate difference in loss of life. Laskin makes this crystal clear."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"\\"The Children's Blizzard\\" excels at describing the suffering endured by those caught in the 1888 blizzard. However, the author's technique of skipping from one person to another, then returning to the first, distracts from the flow of the story. It is informative in its detailed discussion of the early days of weather forecasting by the US Signal Corps. And Laskin's tracing of the storm's development and subsequent path into the US is easy to understand. I don't think any reader will experience a windy, snowy winter's day in quite the same way again."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What a mesmerizing tale woven of many threads. Stayed up way past my bedtime to devour the book. Even the scientific info (thanks for the chart) wasn't all that daunting. Having just ridden across the plains via train, during which trip several of us said we would commit suicide if we had to live in such a desolate wasteland, I felt the story in my bones. This Seattle reader urges you to read this Seattle-area author's wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Mr. Laskin did an excellent job of presenting not only the life and death struggles faced by the children, teachers, and families, on January 12, 1888, but he also explains in detail the weather events leading up to the blizzard. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the pioneers and settlers of the Great Plains."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Knowing the outcome of a disaster doesn't mitigate the drama of the event. That drama lives in the details - the personal stories of those who survived, or didn't survive. That's what grips readers and won't let go as we come to understand the true scope of the tragedy. That is where readers feel empathy for the victims.David Laskin knows this. He leads readers to understand the hardships endured by the settlers of the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota in the 1880s in his 2004 book, \\"The Children's Blizzard.\\" While describing the everyday challenges of pioneer life in sod houses on open prairies, Laskin digs deeply into the heart of one of the greatest storms of the century, the Blizzard of 1888. At the start of the book, we know the outcome through the prologue. From there, Laskin tells of specific families who immigrated to these plains and we begin to fear for these people. This is the story of a storm, how it came to be, and why it was so deadly.Like a trap set for an unsuspecting victim, Thursday, January 12, 1888, dawned unseasonably warm after a long cold spell, tempting families to venture out to tend their stock, bring in hay or simply enjoy a breath of fresh air. It was so warm, many children left their coats, mittens and hats behind as they set out for school, encumbered only with lunch pails. Early schoolhouses were often built outside of town, in anticipation of the town's outward growth. Sparse and poorly constructed, the schoolhouse provided scant shelter from driving snowstorms. By 10:30 that morning, the Groton School, in the Dakota Territory, filled with children, was under siege. At the school window, the children were mesmerized as a \\"wall of shattered crystals slammed into the school.\\" When the storm hit this small school, one of many, it changed the lives hundreds of prairie families in the space of a few hours.Laskin takes us beyond the storm itself into the early science of weather forecasting, connecting the dots of the disaster. From our contemporary vantage point, it's easy to cope with, even enjoy our occasional blizzards. We have warning of their arrival and can stock up, circle in with family, and wait it out in relative comfort. Weather forecasting was a young science in 1888, and relied on accurate information transmitted down the line from outposts of the newly established Army Signal Corps. Weather forecasting, exacerbated by military politics, conflicting business interests and individual egos, was an unreliable and inexact process. There was virtually no warning to the people who lived in this region. One minute it was frighteningly balmy; the next it was an ice blizzard that could topple a grown man.Laskin's research is meticulous with his sources listed and expanded in the last section of the book. He draws from fiction, personal history, and scientific records to tell the history of this blizzard. He takes us into the minds of the children as they blindly seek shelter in temperatures that freeze human flesh in 10 minutes. He details the effects of hypothermia by drawing on the experiences of historical and modern survivors to imagine how it might have been for children in the blizzard that day. Evidence tells us they clung each other, the oldest carrying the youngest. No one had adequate clothing. They quickly become disoriented by snow that enveloped them in a whirlwind of freezing ice. They huddled in snowdrifts, haystacks or gullies. Some survived; many died slowly.Allie Green, a boy at the time of the blizzard described the onset of the blizzard this way: \\"We could see the blizzard coming across Spirit lake. It was just as still as could be. We saw it cut off the trees like it was white roll coming. It hit with a 60 mile an hour wind. It had snowed the night before about two or three inches. It just sucked up that snow into the air and nearly smothered you.\\"Imagine yourself as the young school teacher, alone with your charges (some only a few years younger than you) in a one-room schoolhouse, a mile or two from the nearest farmhouse. Would you keep the children with you, knowing your fuel will soon be spent and you will be trapped without food or warmth? Or would you send the children home believing they could surely make it before the storm builds to full capacity? Teachers all over the prairie on that day struggled with these decisions. The outcomes were often the product of pure chance or luck.Now, with the benefit of science and technology, we look at blizzards as an inconvenience, not a life-threatening event. Laskin's account of this blizzard serves to remind us of how far we have come in our ongoing battle with the elements. It also reminds us not to be too smug, too secure in our belief that we can always win battles with nature. He honors the sacrifices of these pioneers with this book and adds to our understanding and respect of those who came before us."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"We forget sometimes just how vicious nature can be. In hurricanes this year, in 1991's Perfect Storm, the tri-State Tornado in 1925, and the Children's Blizzard of 1888 nature showed what it can do. Of these disasters, the Children's Blizzard is the least well known. Finally we have a book that chronicles this incident.January 12, 1888 was a nice balmy day, the first after a fairly hard few weeks. Children went off to school without coats and gloves, farmers went out to work on projects they had been putting off.Then the cold front came through. In three minutes the temperature dropped 18 degrees. A vicious wind blowing heavy snow caused a whiteout that dropped visibility to near zero. By midnight the windhill was down to 40 below zero. By morning (Friday the thirteenth) some 500 people were dead, many of them children trying to get home from school.1888 was, by our standards, a primative time. There were certainly no satellite imagery put on television by the local weather forecaster. To be sure, there was some indication of a drop in temperature and snow at the weather forecasting office, but extremely limited communications prevented this warning from being widely circulated.Well researched, well written, this is a book for reading in front of the fire in a strongly built house (the storm ripped the roof off of many schools, exposing the inside to the full fury of the storm) maybe with a hot buttered rum at hand."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"David Laskin sets up the story of the January 12, 1888, blizzard well. He provides the back story of the Mennonite and Norwegian immigrants, the valiant teachers and students, and the Civil War veteran, whose daughter took refuge in a haystack during the storm. The reader learns to care about the participants before the blizzard starts and there is gut-wrenching suspense as the victims head out into the storm. Which of them will survive? Will any of them survive?The main characters are the Schweizers, Swiss-German Mennonites who had emigrated to America from the Ukraine, the Rollags from Norway, and Walter Allen, a mischievous little boy who adds comic relief to an otherwise tragic story.The day of the blizzard starts off unusually warm and the kids on their way to school and the farmers working in the fields aren't dressed properly. The temperature drops precipitously and the snow isn't ordinary slow; it's more like blinding sleet.Laskin is also a weather geek; he provides more than we want to know about the cause of this \\"Storm of the Century.\\" He provides info about lows and highs, jet streams and jet streaks (this little bugger is a main culprit), fronts, and St. Elmo's Fire. He also shows how the Signal Corps weathermen bungled the forecast. It's all very informative but we want to know what happened to the Schweizer children and Will Allen. An especially riveting scene is when Laskin explains hypothermia, using the Schweizer boys as an example.In an epilogue, Laskin tells us what happened to the survivors and he makes a rather specious statement, suggesting that this storm put an end to the land boom on the Great Plains and that eventually immigrants learned that, although the soil was some of the best in the world, because of droughts and blizzards this land was uninhabitable. Apparently white people are leaving in droves and the land is returning to the buffalo and the Indians. When Wovoka told his people to dance and the buffalo would return, he wasn't too far wrong."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This book was a traumatic read for me for several reasons. First off, my family is from Norway and some of them came over to the United States at this time period and at the turn of the century. They came for the same reasons that Laskin mentioned in his book: Norway is gorgeous, but it's lands were being used without the knowledge we have today of the need to replenish and rest the land. My ancestors came because of the promise of jobs, and of freedom, and of better lives for their children.The fact that so many children were caught in this unexpected blizzard is the other reason this was hard for me to read. All of those mothers who have children and grandchildren, can place themselves in the place of the mothers whose children were lost in this very strange storm. I cannot imagine the agony of these mothers, and of the teachers who did what they thought was best for the children. It's easy in hindsight to say that the teachers should have done 'this', and that the weather forecasters were lax in their jobs...but so little was known not just of the vagaries of weather in that part of the United States, but how to get this information to those who needed it most. Even had the weather forecasters predicted this storm 24 hours before it happened, the chances that it would have reached the towns and individuals on the Dakota praries in time to prevent the deaths were slim at best.I read this book in less than two days, and I found it as mesmerizing as \\"Issac's Storm\\", which I also read years ago. Perhaps it's because my own family were Norwegian and pioneers, though I don't think they were caught in this as they settled in Minnesota and Illinois and Utah.There was one light note in this book that cracked me up. Laskin talked about the boys in one town who had a new and rather inept teacher. These boys would read far ahead of the teacher in their books, and then stump him with questions he did not know the answers too. Laskin also stated that many unaware teachers got literally picked up by the bigger boys and deposited outside the schoolhouse, which those boys then locked. Laskin said occasionally the schoolchildren had to be smoked out (by blocking the chimney). Since my great-great aunts (3) were teachers and one was a principal in Illinois this made me curious as to whether they experienced any of these stunts. Will have to check the geneaology.This was a good book, a very poignant one. I wish Laskin had been able to include more writings of the pioneers who lived through this, though I am sure more of them would have broken my heart. We are so lucky to live in a day and age where our children are mostly safe from weather and disease through vaccines. It's only human predators we have to watch for now.Karen L. Sadler"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The Children's Blizzard is a harrowing tale, at least the sections that are directly about the terrible blizzard of 1888 that swept over the Dakota-Nebraska prairie. The author, David Laskin, picks some interesting tales of both survival and death and makes the entire terrifying night come alive. The full book, though, contains much more than these sequences and feels overly padded as the tales of immigrants arriving in America blend into discussions of how cold fronts move to the history of the weather service and further into quite gruesome accounts of what actually takes place as the body freezes (despite its graphic nature this particular section proves quite important to the story.) The book pales beside such classics as Isaac's Storm as the pieces do not always move towards creating a compelling narrative. Still when the blizzard finally hits the various tales of teachers, children, and farmers caught out in it are weaved together quite well."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I bought this book at the airport when I needed reading material, and it was a wonderful surprise! I can't believe that I'd never heard of it before! I'm an avid nonfiction reader, and I love survival/adventure stories like 'The Worst Journey in the World,' 'Into Thin Air,' 'The Wreck of the Medusa,' and 'The Whaleship Essex.' 'The Children's Blizzard' has all the elements to make it a genre classic!The first third of the book is spent putting the storm into historical, cultural, and scientific context, and readers who want fast action may become impatient. The effect of all this discussion is cumulative, however. The book--and the suspense--really sneaks up on you; I read each chapter with a steadily growing sense of dismay and fear. By the time the snow started falling, I was enthralled.The historical information also serves to humanize--and better dramatize--the event. Mr. Laskin treats the immigrant pioneers, and their hardships, with dignity and respect. I never felt that the author was exploiting the tragedy for artistic or professional purposes. The subjects are difficult for modern readers to relate to--profoundly religious, parochial, Scandinavian, agrarian, (mostly) poor. Many writers would be tempted to either romanticize or condescend them. Laskin tries to let them speak for themselves.Stylistically, I found the book to be very well-written. The language is clear, precise, and elegant.Lastly, some reviewers found the scientific explanation of the storm and the history of weather forecasting to be tedious, but I enjoyed all of it! It's always nice when an author gives his/her audience credit for having a brain. I love books that I can learn things from, and this book was full of informative treats! Mr. Laskin makes the science very accessible to the layperson.'The Children's Blizzard' is a gem!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I ordered this book as soon as it came out; I have a David Laskin book written a few years ago, and it's really good. But THIS BOOK- well, I would have to say that it's in my Top 10 of Favorite Books, and that's saying a lot, because I breathe books as though they were air....if I couldn't read, I would die.FANTASTIC book. The imagery; the reality of those lives on the Plains, depending as they did upon things that to us today would seem quite trivial, with all of our modern conveniences. And then, from the frigid HELLS of the Siberian and Canadian Arctic, comes sweeping down a 200 year blizzard upon them, no warning, no real protection, and so quickly building into a maelstrom of blinding, stinging and freezing on contact with skin and all else, that many, if not most of the schoolchildren whose schools were released around the same time, just didn't stand a chance, even the ones who lived so close to the schoolhouse that in good weather, they could see it from home.This book cries out to be read......a piece of American history that brings home to us what winters could be like to live through, on the Great American Plains, and told in a way that you can visualize the true tale of the families, handing down the story from generation through generation, we hope in front of a cozy fire in the hearth.Touch&eacute;, David Laskin!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"It was a very dry read. Lots of information about how some families came to the area, and lots of information about weather data, but not really much about how the communtiy was affected etc. Not enough material for a whole book? I was expecting something more like the \\"Worst Hard TimeThe Worst Hard Time: The Untold Story of Those Who Survived the Great American Dust Bowl\\" which I much preferred."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This is an exceptionally absorbing book because it fascinates not only with history -- the settlement of the northern prairie states and, of course most exhaustively, that fateful epic snowstorm -- but also with science -- the forces that shape our weather, and other aspects of physics and biology. (For example, the four means of heat transfer -- radiation, conduction, evaporation and convection -- as each applies in the circumstance of a person freezing in a blizzard. And the physical and mental responses, in various stages, of a person freezing to death. All very fascinating!)Most compelling though is the detail with which the author brings to life real characters from the past. And somehow the matter-of-fact presentation of this detail, rather in keeping with the unexagerrated manner of these people, ultimately adds to the emotional impact of their stories. You get to know these individuals during earlier narratives of their migration and settlement. You are with them during the ordeal of the horrendous storm. By the time you read the final chapter, Aftermath, which traces a bit of their later lives, you will have exploded in tears many times, and will be left with much to wonder over."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"It's pretty easy to understand why Erik Larson gave The Children's Blizzard a glowing recommendation: it reads like one of his books. Laskin follows the familiar Larson formula of seamlessly weaving detailed facts with a few dramatizations to create a book where personal tales accentuate the story's overall epic tone.Still, as is almost always the case when something is copied, Laskin's efforts fall a bit short of the Larsen \\"standard.\\" In this case, what differs is Laskin's ability to maintain the story's flow. Probably because of his scientific background, Laskin enthusiastically depicts minutia about such subjects like the sociological background of the settlers, the meteorological conditions that created this powerful blizzard, and the physiological reactions to hypothermia. Unfortunately, Laskin lingers a bit too long with these subjects, thereby breaking the flow of his story. Consequently, a reader may feel the urge to skip past these details in order to resume the main narrative.While the story's flow isn't perfect, The Children's Blizzard is still a very entertaining, very informative book. Laskin does a great job of portraying the storm's impacts on individual lives and the incredible conditions that the settlers endured to eke out a living. In the end, the reader will have a great appreciation for nature's power and the fortitude of the pioneers who challenged it."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The book describes \\"The School Children's Blizzard\\" of 1888 in remarkable detail. The meterological details are described nicely (although more maps might have been an aide to the description). The political feud and the emphasis on the \\"verification\\" of forecasts is also explored. It's very clear that the weather forecasters of the time failed to use the technology available (observations submitted via train and telegraph)to warn the public of the impending blizzard.The decisions of the families, children, and school teachers are described for a small subset of people impacted by the storm. Their stories are truly heartbreaking. The suffering of the children is described in some cases through the recollections of their descendents. It is here that the book finds its most powerful voice. The deaths of five children from exposure is imagined by the author, and although there is no direct evidence of how the children died, his description of hypothermia and the mental and physical effects of exposure jive well with the medical literature and more main stream literature such as \\"Into Thin Air.\\"Having driven through this area of the US during the last year I found the description of homesteading and the hardships endured to be amazing. How the Dakota Territory was settled is nothing short of a miracle. Locusts, droughts, blizzards, and the lack of community brought on by settling land in 160 acre plots makes one wonder how 40% of all homesteaders managed to \\"prove up.\\"Very interesting read. Makes one feel blessed that we have the ability to predict the weather much more precisely than they did in the 1880's. Great gift for those interested in weather and US history."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This nonfiction account of a tragic event is an absorbing tale. The author delves into the social, political and economic factors which led to this tragedy with an interesting and informative style. He also makes the people involved seem real and one finds themself caring what happens next. This allows the reader to appreciate the reading experience at several levels. The Children's Blizzard, is one I have never regretted buying and have sent to others as a gift."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"In January of 1888, a terrible blizzard, which came to be known as the \\"Schoolchildren's Blizzard\\" blew in across the Nebraska & Dakota Territory prairie. It was so-called because the deaths from the blizzard were largely of children who left school because of the bad weather coming. Sadly, they left \\"at the moment when the wind shifted and the sky exploded (2).\\"Using a wide variety of sources, Laskin has put together this account of that fateful day, but the book is much more than just a retelling of the event. He also details other immigrants' experiences such as tough crossings, and the often difficult life once they reached the Dakota territory. Laskin also discusses the state of weather forecasting at the time, and asks some pretty pointed questions about the issue of fault during the course of a natural disaster. I think a lot of people would also agree that the book is a definite statement on the power of nature and the horror it can inflict when people are unprepared (not that people can always be prepared for natural disasters).I'd definitely recommend this to people who like history in focused, short bursts (like this book or along the lines of something like Isaac's Storm) rather than out of texts. The only part where it even felt a bit boggy was the discussion on the history of weather forecasting, but that didn't really detract from my reading. If you're also interested in life on the plains, this is a good one to read as well. Very well written -- I couldn't stop reading it once I started."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"David Laskin, in \\"The Children's Blizzard,\\" presents an interesting perspective on the settlement by whites across the prairie states of the US midwest.Using the great blizzard of 1888 as a framework, Laskin tells the story of immigration of Europeans from Scandinavia and German-speaking Europe into the Midwest. He also discusses settlers who arrived from the eastern US. From these stories, I learned much about the conditions in Europe and the US that led to this migration.Laskin also reviews the state of the art in weather forecasting in the 1880s. For some readers, the deep coverage of weather may be a bit too much, but it really is an interesting topic that is worthwhile to understand.The stories of individual death and hardships during the blizzard provided a human face to the narrative and helped deepen the understanding of the effects of the immigration and land distribution policies of the time. There is much to learn about the complex ways in which the US was occupied by the well-meaning settlers from Europe.Laskin also includes a good review of his sources and an index. At times, the writing is a little clunky, but the story is fascinating. On the whole, I enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I thought the book was well done, however there really was a lot of technical information that I thought detracted from the story itself. I know I skimmed over it, and went on to the content of the story.Over all I was pleased with the information and enjoyed learning about that entire part of the country. How much we take for granted with our warm homes, and safe 4x4 vehicles. Our pioneer ancestors were certainly made of stronger stuff than we are."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"David Laskin's meticulously researched novel of the Dakota/Nebraska blizzard of 1888 is a heart-wrenching yet beautiful work of literature. He painfully describes the struggles of early settlers from Norway, Sweden and German Russia as they left their homes and countries behind for the promises of easy and fertile farming in the Great Plains of the United States, along with the monetary rewards for their labors. These emigrants found life here not to be anything like the U.S. railroads had ensured, for it was their brochures that lured people across the seas. Land was abundant and free, but many settlers still struggled through harsh seasons. Laskin follows several families from the beginning of their sojourn to the harsh reality of their destination.Laskin's portrayal of the Signal Corps, which served as the weather forecasting entity of the time is very reminiscent of Erik Larsen's phenomenal Isaac's Storm. The Signal Corps at the time of the blizzard of 1888 and the Galveston hurricane of 1900 (Larsen's work) was rife with politics, drama and bureaucracy. Regulations had to be followed to the letter. Words like \\"cold front\\" and \\"hurricane\\" were only to be used under strict circumstances or forbidden entirely. The men of the Signal Corps, who took daily readings of temperature, barometric pressure and wind speed, were often arrogant to the point of delusional. So confident were they in their abilities to predict the weather that they felt the weather phenomenon had ceased to be a mystery. The main observer in The Children's Blizzard does not or refuses to recognize the clear and concise data that is available to him that a massive and dangerous blizzard is descending from Canada. Just like the Signal Corps in Galveston that fateful September in 1900 who considered the Cuban weather observers to be far less knowledgeable than them and actually tried to suppress information from Cuba that an enormous hurricane was heading for the Texas Gulf Coast.What makes The Children's Blizzard much more tragic, even though a more deadly blizzard struck New York City a few years later, was the fact that so many of the Dakota/Nebraska victims were children. The storm hit on an unusually warm day in mid-January just as school was let out for the day. Scores of children were caught unaware on the open plains. Some were lucky and found shelter and safety. So many were not and froze to death.Laskin interviewed survivors' descendants and scoured hundreds of historical records, newspaper accounts and genealogical charts to piece together an hour-by-hour, minute-by-minute recreation of the unfortunate settlers as the ferocious storm hit, changing their lives forever. He tells the stories of teachers trying to save students, frantic parents wandering out in the storm to find children and siblings trying to protect each other as the blizzard became so violent that survivors said that you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.It is heart-breaking to read the accounts of men and women who lost children after thinking they were safe at school only to find their frozen bodies the next day. Laskin pulls no punches in describing parents' grief in the days following the disaster.Fortunately the Great Plains have not known a tragedy like this since weather forecasting models can more accurately predict weather patterns and warn citizens ahead of time. Modern technology has also advanced such that severely frost bitten or frozen people may be resuscitated. Had such conveniences had been realized then, the death toll would certainly have been lower.Laskin's acknowledgements and sources, which are cited at the end of the book, are nearly as exciting as the story itself. The resources he relied upon to reproduce such intricate tales seems almost insurmountable. But in The Children's Blizzard, Larsen weaves a story that feels like a suspense novel but tugs hard at the heartstrings.(previously published on ezinearticles.com)"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This book was very well written. However, I had a very hard time getting through the very detailed descriptions of what happens to the human body as it freezes to death. The author was, in my opinion, a bit too graphic when he described the agonizing deaths of the four or five boys who struggled for many hours in this unimaginable blizzard before finally giving out."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"If you like history and weather and pioneers, this is the book for you. A lot of my historical society friends read this after I recommended it and they all felt they learned a lot and appreciated the author's attention to detail. A little advance warning and knowledge about weather fronts could have prevented quite a few deaths. Most of the towns must have had a telegraph and some of the townspeople could have spread the word, but it didn't happen. As a result, children died.Excellent writing and research! After I read this book, I found out that my grandfather and his mother stayed awake all night and twisted hay to heat in their hay burner stove in their sod house near Elgin, Nebraska. He was very little but he remembered what his mother had said. So this storm actually affected my grandfather and great grandmother."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"David Laskin brings the subject to life with his well-researched personal stories. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Mr. Laskin builds the story slowly by telling us the history of a number of immigrant families whose blizzard experience forms the core of the story. We learn of their hardships in traveling to the US and earlier hardships they faced on the midwest prairies. He gives the background of the Signal Corps that was charged with weather reporting and forcasting and the politics that affected their structure. He also explains weather phenomena and terminology as it was known then and now.He reveals how the mild weather before the blizzard lulled many people into going outside and permitting their children to walk to rural schools.The speed and intensity of the blizzard was astounding and he vividly describes the impact on people and the uncertainty they faced: do we try to get home or wait it out where we are? When the blizzard ended, the searching began and he describes how hard it was to find the lost victims -- in some cases it took 5 days to locate people that were buried in drifts just a few hundred feet from a pioneer home.Added to the actual stories and histories of some victims, he also describes in detail how hypothermia affects the mind and the body.It is a moving story that brings out the harsh existence and the tragedy that these settlers faced."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I'm nuts about gripping non-fiction. This book is a freaking gem. The blizzard took place in 1888 and killed hundreds. The book covers the immigrants who settled the plane states, this part is interesting to me because I'm from the Midwest. I know nothing about weather forcasting but I learned more about weather from this book than I have in my life. He descibes the body's response to cold weather too and that is pretty interesting. The description of the blizzard is brutal and you could read this book in Mexico in July and it would make you shiver."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The author did a very good job of helping the reader understand how and why so many children died during this blizzard.My wife would like to add that the book was a little heavy on the meteorology. Fortunately, this stuff can be glossed over without losing any of the story -- well done."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"A great read-aloud book for the middle school science classroom. What better way to bring a unit on weather alive!I first heard this book read on National Public Radio's (NPR) Radio Reader program two years ago and hung on every word. I looked forward to driving to work just so I could hear the next chapter of the book!I loved the history not only of the valiant pioneers who had left their Scandinavian and eastern European homelands for a \\"better life\\" in the Dakotas in the 1880's, but also greatly enjoyed learning the history of the National Weather Service (run by the military then), the challenges of forecasting weather without a broad network of monitoring stations that reported conditions frequently, and the very limited means for communicating weather conditions to residents spread across such a large geographic area (same population density then as now!). The scientific explanations of the progressive effects of hypothermia are excellent.Living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan near Lake Superior, we have our share of cold winters and lots of snow, but nothing compares to the challenges of a northern Great Plains winter with its terrific winds and sub-zero temperatures. To get the best impact, read this book in the winter!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This book is great - very engrossing. I had to stop reading it before I fell asleep at night because I would have bad dreams about blizzards, that's how much I got into it! As other reviewers have mentioned, there are some tangents Laskin goes off on, but they may be of particular interest to some readers. I found the techincal weather information tedious, but just skimmed over it. The tales of frontier life are downright fascinating - I'm still just amazed at how people were living (and dying) just over 100 years ago here in the USA. It's shocking, unless you are a historian of that era, I would say. I had a hard time putting this book down and really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I picked this up on a whim in the library and am so glad I did! This story simply mesmerized me. Anyone interested in late 1800's pioneer life, weather, or American history will enjoy this book. It simply tells the stories of five families and several individuals as they \\"weather the storm\\" of 1888--a blizzard such as never had been seen before. Lives were lost, lives were saved, and lives were never the same. Human error, an act of God, and love, all came together one day on the plains. Mr. Laskin is to be applauded for making history come alive and bringing to light some true heroes of another time."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The story of the blizzard of '88 is one familiar still today to many residents of the plains states. Laskin tries to build too many life stories with sketchy information, makes factual errors and provides too much tedious meterological detail. He tells what was on the minds of some of the victims of the storm even though they died before they spoke with anyone. He concludes by making moral judgments that are based on tangential information. For example, he claims that the plains should not have been settled so heavily and supports this assumption by the declining population in many areas of the plains. He forgets to mention that one family farmed 160 acres in 1888 and that same family today often farms 2000 acres. Could that have a bearing on the decreased population?"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Wow, I really didn't expect to be as moved by this as I was. An important and well written account of a truly tragic event."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"My grandparents immigrated from Norway to North Dakota, and I spent many summers with them. It's a strange state, weather-wise. I've lived in New England for 30 years and there's just no comparison.I read this book in one day; it totally consumed me, thinking about my grandparents and how they managed to survive in such an in hospitable climate. It also makes me grateful of the sacrifices they made for their children.Parts of this should be required reading in American history."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Laskin makes a good attempt at it. He gives a ton of great information, about how this tragedy occurred, and how the victims were affected psychologically and physically. At times, the reading is gripping and engrossing, tragic and overpowering. Thousands of people in the Midwest of the late 19th Century experienced such sorrow because of this blizzard.But ultimately, this is a book attempting unsuccessfully to be two different books. Junger was successful inThe Perfect Storm, but it is difficult to pull together the science and personal stories. At times, Laskin is delving deep into meteorology, exploring exactly how a blizzard of epic proportions might have occurred. But books likeBasin and Rangedo a better job of making science exciting for the layman. This reads more like dry journal articles, pieced together with historical narrative and historical fiction. Laskin would have been better served had he followed McPhee's more strictly natural history approach.Similarly, when Laskin turns to the interweaving of personal stories, they are not people that we are drawn to. There is not enough background, real or imagined, for us to identify with them. And there are far too many characters with short biographies for us to keep track of. In the end, when we learn of the misery and horrible deaths, it feels more voyeuristic than the reader's compassionate response to an author's well-written narrative. Laskin has vivid, detailed,CSI-style gruesomeness, but this is a poor replacement for genuine empathy through character development.There are stories here that need to be told, and it is good that Laskin told them. They need to be read. But Laskin could have done a much superior job of focusing either on the natural history of another perfect storm, or the human drama ofShakespearean tragedy."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I loved everything about this book. I loved the history of migration to the Plains, the characters that I came to care for, and I especially loved learning about the weather and how this storm formed. The forensic description of hypothermia was chilling. I have recommended this book to all my reader friends. This is the way to teach history!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Having grown up in the \\"desolate wasteland\\" referred to by an earlier reviewer, I found this book fascinating. Agreed, it does get a tad long in some weather details, but those facts support the storyline. Taken in context with possible global warming and the recent tsunami, I think time will prove the author correct in providing those details. The parallels to the tsunami intrigue me. Weather forecasting and communications are exponentially improved since the Signal Corps, yet there was no communication system in place to warn one of the world's top resort areas that a tsunami might be coming. My father was born after this blizzard, but he very much grew up with its tales. Stories I heard as a child came to life in this book. Some of the family names, too, are families I grew up with. I appreciated the author conveying the feeling of the difficult hand-to-mouth farm life, and the effort to find fuel to warm homes, the mind-set of a farmer willing to risk life in an effort to save a cow. That area may look like a \\"desolate wasteland\\" to outsiders but, in spite of farmers regularly dealing with weather extremes, it is the source of many agricultural products that some Americans may take for granted. The descendants of that blizzard are today's farmers. And, yes, that prairie wind creates a cold unlike anything I've run across in more than 30 years in Alaska. This book is a good, thoughtful, provocative read."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I ordered four of the books as historical family gifts because my father was born shortly after the blizzard of '88. All arrived promptly and in almost new condition."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I was born in '34 and grew up on a farm in ND. Weather forecasts were followed very closely. I doubt if country prople had radios in 1888 so a blizzard forecast would not have been available to most of the population."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"A great book! As one who has lived some years on the plains, the Great American Desert,as it was called in the nineteenth century, I have come to know how severe the weather here can be, how changeable, and on occasion, how fatal. But this is not simply a book about weather on the plains. It is a book about the American immigrant experience, about perseverence and overcoming obstacles that would daunt the bravest soul. It is the story first of people leaving everything behind in Europe for the promise of free land in America in the nineteenth century. These were families who left farms and families and traditions and all that they had known in order to travel thousands of miles and try to make it in one of the harshest places on earth, the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Montana. Their toils are enormous, and Laskin does a good job of describing just how enormous they were. In an area clearly not suitable for agriculture they painstakingly cleared the sod, built houses with it, tried to hang on until a crop could be planted and harvested, and were very hard up against it for years.And then there is the storm of 1888. In a freakish event, the weather in January of that year suddenly gave promise of an early spring. On the day of the storm the little ones went off to school wearing spring clothes, many with no coats. Then by midday the temperature dropped like a stone, and that event was quickly followed by a horrendous blizzard so thick with ice crystals that nothing was visible for more than a few feet. Teachers debated holding the little ones in the school until help came or letting them go home on their own. Some teachers tried to accompany the students. Some let them go. In case after case the little ones were quickly disoriented and soon froze to death. It was as awful and as simple as that.Laskin describes hyperthermia and frostbite, and shows why these can be fatal. He does his best to show how and why this storm was such a surprise, and therefore so fatal, to those who endured it. He drives the miles (and miles...and miles) across the prairie where the events occurred to interview the descendants of the families who suffered it all. Many still live in the region.In the end, it's difficult to cast much blame in any direction, though many tried to do so. This is a great read. If I were teaching a course on the Great Plains I would include this as required reading along with Ian Frazier, Mari Sandoz, Ken Haruf, and Jim Henderson. It is a window on the prairie and on an America now gone, and well worth the tale."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What an amazing read! Historical, true, and yet...how can it really be? That is what is so intriguing aboutthis book. With Grandparents and family who actually lived through this horrific blizzard, we now live in thispart of the country, and we know exactly how the weather can change so dramatically and so quickly! One day anda community is devastated...the next day, the sun shines on the survivors. Truly a dramatic, inspiring, incredibly detailed read...sure to be a reminder for us all how devastating the weather can be, with a mind of its own!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"As a teacher I found this book very interesting for many reasons. Besides history, I also learned a lot about the effects of hypothermia and weather forecasting. I found the history of the plains and the people that lived there the most interesting and I could relate to the dilema the teachers and parents faced as the storm descended upon them so quickly. A fascinating American story which taught me a great deal, information I never knew before."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I thought this was a very interesting book. I liked that the writer not only told about the unfortunate result of the blizzard, but also included some history on immigration to America (and to the west), the trials and tribulations of settling in the west, and information on weather forecasting during that time period. I though it was a very good book.I purchased this book on the kindle and while reading the bibliography, I noticed that there was mention of a map. I did not see a map in the kindle version of the book. Is there a map or photographs in the hardback or paperback versions of The Childrens Blizzard? I am new to the kindle, so I do not know if the photographs, maps, etc.. that are included in hardback and paper back versions of books will also appear on the kindle version. Maybe this book didn't have a map, but why would he mention it in the bibliography? If the photographs, maps, etc.. are not included in kindle versions of books, it will probably deter me from buying the kindle versions in the future."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I have to admit that when I first began reading this book I honestly thought that it was going to be just another one of those boring old non-fiction books but as I got further into the story I learned that I was wrong. This book contains definitely a lot of facts; a majority of what gave the book its suspense. While reading this book I felt as if I was there with the people living in that blizzard. I felt as though I could feel the cold breeze whipping through the air and every sharp chill sneaking through the windows and doors. This book makes you feel as though you were living through the whole event of the 1888 blizzard. I did very much enjoy this book and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys American history or natural disaster books. I would not call this book an easy read but it was worth the time it took to read it (that is unless you are a really fast reader). Though many people have never heard of this blizzard it is an important event in our American history. This book talks about more than just the blizzard, it also talks about the immigrants that come to America with promise of lots of lush lands for farming, raising their families and good weather. They were utterly mistaken when winter came around and the blizzards began. In this book I would have to say that my favorite quote was \\"In three minutes, the front subtracted eighteen degrees from the air's temperature. Then evening gathered in, and temperatures kept dropping in the northwest gale. By morning on Friday, January 13, 1888, more than a hundred children lay dead on the Dakota-Nebraska prairie....\\" To me this quote tells the reader that the story they are about to read is serious, that it is a true event, and it will be a suspenseful ride down history lane. This is an interesting story and I do recommend it for those who want to learn of the natural disaster that occurred in 1888."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I read this book many years ago,and never forgot it. A friend recently started reading a book on the Donner Party,and I asked her if she had ever read The Children's Blizzard.I remember how when reading it,I felt the surprise,terror and cold,of the schoolchildren and others who were caught out in this incredibly fast storm front. Hearing from the survivors themselves brings it alive in a way not possible from just 'second-hand' stories.Living in No.Dak for 4 years and reading this book has certainly given me the view that snow,especially combined with sub-zero temperatures,is an insidious killer!This is a white-knuckle reading experience,even more so,because you come to care about these children and several others that you read about,especially with the lingering knowledge that this is a true story!It will make anyone think twice about going out(even in our modern age of vehicles) into dangerous blizzard conditions and low temps inadequately dressed or low fuel in the gas tank,even if you are only planning to drive a few blocks to the store! Cars can slide off the road and get stuck in a snow bank,or get struck by another car.

His graphic and forensic descriptions of what happened to some of the victims, especially the children, was interesting as well as very disturbing. I doubt the author's harrowing stories of survival will compel many readers into relocating to the Dakotas or Nebraska. In my humble opinion, calling this section of the country, the Badlands, is downplaying the hellhole. The writing is somewhat technical in presentation and devoid of flowery prose. The style is appropriate to the subject matter, but the people come across as kind of flat. It's a gloomy, but illuminating read recommended only for individuals not suffering from depression.

The dream of free land under homestead provisions had created a stampede.The blizzard of 1888 was unprecedented. It was sudden. It was violent. Since many of the victims were children, some twenty per cent, it was called the Children's Blizzard. In 1870 the Army Signal Corps took charge of weather forecasting. Observations were telegraphed to Washington. In 1887 a branch office was opened in St. Paul.On January 11th in St. Paul forecaster Woodruff noted a severe loss of barometic pressure. There was an increase in temperature. In Montana a cold front developed. By January 12th it was just west of Bismarck. Children who did not leave school early were in jeopardy. The cold wave flags flew at the stations.The high and low fronts were locked into a cycle. Eerie electricity crawled through the air. People survived the night outdoors only to die the following days of shock and heart attacks. Woodruff was ordered to rejoin his regiment. In 1891 a United States Weather Bureau was established. Blizzards bring ruin, desolation, death. The Blizzard of 1888 stopped the Dakota land boom."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The fellows who deny the trend of warming of the Earth have got to be ignoring the facts of weather a hundred fifty (150) years ago. It was mighty cold for months on end. We never see double digit below zero (0) Fahrenheit temperatures today, but back then they were common, like the whole month of January.The amount of research that Mr. Laskin put into this book is phenomenal. He traveled through the territory and collected various family histories as well as the noted hero's and heroine's to fill out the story. It is amazing to imagine the hardships the pioneers had to live through. It would be bad enough for us today to try to establish a homestead with all our modern tools. It is just amazing they did.The weather conditions and developments that he describes is complicated, but that and the way the weather statistics were gathered helps you understand how it got so suddenly. He gives a short course in weather and then tells what it means to the farmers and weather forecasters. How it feels to have your face and clothes full of ice crystals. What freezing out in the open means and how the body reacts. It is very thorough.In the end he gives an idea of what happened to the land and people. He pretty much bemoans the immigrants coming to farm land that they do not know in weather they do not understand. He expresses dismay that the land purveyors were hustling this land to the peasants of Europe. In the end it is as it was before: sparsely populated and wide open spaces."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Not that great. A rather typical format: describe the characters, try to add drama and tension by describing the cliched loss of children and immigration to a strange land, jumble about with time and place, do a weak job at describing the science and end with the tragedy and you've got this book. It was pretty formulaic.I was interested in reading this because I wanted to know more about the winter described in Laura Ingalls Wilder's \\"The Hard Winter\\". I did learn that it was a different year of incredibly bad winter storms, not the particular blizzard described in this book.I was also disappointed in the overall treatment of the individual people's possible emotions, thoughts and actions. There was too much emotional drama added to what might have taken place or what those who froze to death were thinking. It didn't seem real."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yues ysl ona ona a va oub"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This storm was also written about in the Laura Ingalls Wilder book \\"The Long Winter\\".

It is a good compliment to the \\"Little House\\" series."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I am a historian, so when I picked up this book, I thought that it would be more about the history and consequences of the blizzard.

Sorry, pun really NOT intended!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"\\"I have seen the Dread of Dakota.\\"Sadie Shaw, pioneer wife, from a letter to Eastern relatives.I bought this because and my mother grew up on a S. Dakota cattle ranch and I recall my grandfather talking about the Blizzard of '88. (He was born in the 1890s.) One aspect of the social history of the region - settlement of the plains by immigrants - was well covered. The description of 19th C. meteorology and of the science of freezing to death were exhaustively informative. But, I was way more interested in social history in relation to the particular tragedy this book covers. A huge flaw: the absence of the Sioux and other Native Americans outside a few brief accounts of military actions. This is weird for two reasons: (1) the native people were a crucial thread in the social, political, and environmental fabric of the region, and (2) this is a 21st C., not 18th C., account! How did they & their children fare in The Children's Blizzard? We learn nothing about this. Imagine a modern account of San Francisco's 1906 earthquake without describing its effect on Chinatown! The best chapter, for me, was the last one,\\"Aftermath\\" -especially its summary of the human cost and utter failure of the gov't's policy of populating the plains on a scale its environment could not support. I would also have liked the perspective a few old photos of prairie winters, which are plentiful. How about more maps? There's only one and there can really never be TOO MANY maps! For a weather buff (like my dad), this book would probably rate 5 stars, but if social history is your thing, 3 1/2 stars is about right."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I picked this book up at our local library and was really delighted by it. The story of the blizzard is very immediate and filled with details that make you feel as if you were there (brrr). But that's not all. The story of the immigrants is equally compelling; why they came, how they lived, how they survived. And the history of the National Weather Service's beginnings is also interesting. Another government program we couldn't live (literally) without. I took this book on a family trip this summer and ready many of the passages as we traveled. I've also recommended this book to several friends. Overall, a great and happy surprise."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What a sad book and even more so because it's true. The horrible way many of the children died during the blizzard of 1888 is shocking and would cause a public outcry today. It also chronicles the workings of then weather service and should make many today glad for the service they have. The pages contains a fascinating look at the history leading up to the event and makes a comment about how sparsely populated the prairie currently is. This book is a perfect complement to 'The Worst Hard Times' by Timothy Egan since it predates the events of the 1930s and gives more of a background of upper end of the future dust bowl. A must read for all history buffs and a painful reminder of what American ancestors endured to settled a part of the west.

It's not fiction. It's also not in any way fun to read. It's horrific, but I think it should be a part of every American's historical education. It is the story of a blizzard, followed by deep cold, that struck the Great Plains on January 11-13, 1888. The event is sometimes called the school children's blizzard because so many school children died in it. It came into being when several extreme weather conditions met, and literally exploded into the country from Canada.The book weaves together the story of the weather that created the storm, the histories and eyewitness accounts of settlers who were affected, the actions of the only weather forecasting system available then (a department of the U.S. Army), and much more to give a fascinating and terrifying \\"you were there\\" look at this event.I cannot imagine living like those early settlers lived, even on their good days. In comparison to them, most of us Americans now are a soft, spoiled, sometimes pathetic, bunch of whiners. I salute them and the determination to survive that they bequeathed to us as a nation.Please get a copy of this book and read it-only you might want to wait until a very hot day, because it will chill you to the bone."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE, TRUE LIFE ,OMG STORY.

David Laskin tells the story of what has been called the School Children's Blizzard, where between 250 and 500 people--many children--perished in the snow and ice before they could find adequate shelter. The morning of January 12 had been rather mild across the plains of Minnesota, Nebraska, and the Dakota Territories. Then a storm came up without warning; a blinding sheet of whirling snow swept across the plains and the temperature plummeted to 25 degrees below zero. Because it had been so mild, farmers had taken their wagons into town, men were in the fields, children had left for school in light-weight clothing, and many were out on horseback or walking. As the storm approached, some children remained at school, while others were sent running home only to be caught by the freezing blizzard. Laskin writes a moving drama of the plight of the homesteader families and the hundreds who lost their lives, but also explains the rudimentary meteorology of the times, the politics of the Army Signal Corps, the science of hypothermia, the impact of the storm on westward migration, and the controversy that arose in the newspapers in the days following the blizzard. Laskin chronicles five pioneer families, from the stories of their immigration to their experience of the worst storm in memory. Laskin writes with poignancy, recounting both the fateful decisions that resulted in tragic death and the numerous acts of heroism."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What an amazing telling of a terrible storm. Others have given the highlights of the story so well that I won't re-cap...I will say that I enjoyed very much the information about the immigrants; where they came from, why they came, what their lives were like, how they ended up where they did, what their values were, etc. The stories about the storm were amazing and kept me hooked on every word. I found the historical information about weather predicting a little dull. However, I gave the book to my dad and those sections were his favorites.In any case, a very interesting book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"After reading this account of a great tragedy, I can't help but think about what these early settlers endured. I find myself thinking about this book everytime I complain because there's a little snow on my walkway!!

I had to purchase it after cracking it open in the bookstore and reading some of the harrowing accounts of those who were caught in the 1888 blizzard that struck the Nebraska/Dakotas with a sudden and unexpected ferocity.The book builds to the day of the blizzard by providing some interesting details about various families settled in the area. He follows some sad families as they journey to begin a new and hopeful life in America.The most fascinating part of this book, the piece that made me unable to put it down, was the individual and detailed descriptions of those that experienced the blizzard. Laskin writes as if he was there, describing what the victims who died of exposure must have experienced as they succumbed to hypothermia and then froze to death.Laskin pulls in all sorts of resources to make this a very robust and three-dimensional telling. He gives us detailed information about the weather patterns, the history of the region and what is known of the settlements in the area. He pulls in personal detail pieced together to characterize various individuals and families.I was on my seat waiting to see who would survive. Some stories that were beyond hopeless came back to surprise. Laskin explores the media response and the social effect of this natural disaster by recapping some of the articles written.A very finely written account, this is a must-read for anyone who enjoys 'weather thrillers'. Laskin thoroughly researched his subject and then layered his knowledge with touching personal detail to give the reader an inside view of the events surrounding this most fateful blizzard which took hundreds of pioneer lives, many of them children caught out walking home from school."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This book is excellent.

It read like a novel and we learned a great deal about that period of time and about weather. Our discussion afterwards was really interesting. Highly recommended for book clubs."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I have recommended this book to many. It is entertaining and to some degree informative, and a difficult book to put down. I have also warned the \\"recommendees\\" that while there is an obvious factual basis for the Blizzard of 1988, many of the riveting stories spun out by the author are purely conjecture. (For example, there are exciting episodes which go into great detail on the struggles of children who did not survive.) I don't mind it that the author filled the narrative with made-up events. Authors do it all the time and we call the result \\"historical novels\\" But to mix fact and fiction willy-nilly can confuse the reader and make him wonder if the \\"facts\\" are really true.It was hard to swallow the conclusion in the epilogue -- that the settlement of the Great Plains was a trillion-dollar mistake. True, the great plains do not have a San Diego-like climate, but they are certainly fit for human habitation -- more so than New Orleans and most of the state of Delaware, for instance.One final potshot: I can't understand the author's gratuitous swipe at modern military men and women in the description of the lieutenant serving at St. Paul: \\"He was an officer and a gentleman: a mixture common in his time but extremely rare in the early Twenty-first Century. \\" That colossally ignorant statement certainly is not enough to ruin the book, but once a reader encounters it, he will detect the odor of soapbox oratory; he will wonder why the author should make such an unfounded statement, and will keep him from enjoying the book as much as he should.Brickbats aside, the aithor did succeed in writing an extremely entertaining book. I even liked the \\"boring\\" meteorological pieces."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The hardships endured by the unsuspecting pioneers is memorialized.

I'm only 24% into the book & am really struggling to stay with it. I feel cheated out the $9.68 I paid for this book. It really should be free. If you're into meteorology, which I am not, you'll like this book. I just hope I can make it to the end. Hopefully, in the future, a better author will write about this particular storm, just tell the story, and leave out all the unneccesary hogwash this author uses to fill the gaps. I will be hesitant to read anything else by this author."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"But you really better enjoy meteorology.

This is a book full of human interest stories, personal recollections of the immigrant experience, and the occurrence of a sudden and horrendous blizzard. This also contains very specific weather science explanations, The Children's Blizzard occurred in the same year as the later storm that hit the East Coast, the one that paralyzed New York City and resulted in its phone and electrical wiring being run underground. There is a lot of heartbreak in this history. The people who &#34;settled the plains,&#34; with all that entailed historically, were fascinating, mostly incredibly stalwart people."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The Children's Blizzard is a fascinating tale of the tragic blizzard striking without warning to the Prairie states in 1888. As an Iowa native I was fascinated by the human stories told by Mr. Laskin. His research is impeccable an he provides touching insight into the life of the midwest pioneer families and most importantly the children. My only criticism would be the sometimes redundant very dry information about weather systems and predictions. It is interesting to a point but most probably only those as fascinated by weather as the author would find it necessary to the degree it is explained. The human story is the more intriquing. Regardless, I loved the book and am incredibly grateful to those hardy souls who stayed in the prairies despite the harshest of circumstances. I can't imagine living then. Thanks to Mr. Laskin for exploring their lives and telling the truth."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I grew up in Nebraska, and studied the blizzard of 1888 in school. The story is very compelling, and kept my interest. The hardest part of reading the book was keeping all the names and locations straight in my mind. Highly recommend this book for history buffs."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This is a book that will be very hard to put down. It will haunt your mind and stay with you for a very long time. It is the brilliantly research and chronicled story of a freakish weather event in January 1988 that took the lives of more than 100 children along the Dakota-Nebraska prairie. Today we take the daily weather forecast for granted . . . with little regard for the amazing science and research that enables climatologists to make accurate forecasts. Yet, the occasional hurricane or tornado remind us of how deadly and destructive the weather can be for mankind. David Laskin's book not only tells the harrowing tale of death and survival against the most monstrous of storms, but it also reveals the challenges of the time for weather forecasting. He reveals the lack of national communication, as well as limited understanding of weather science, that contributed to the terrible consequences of that dreadful storm. This is a wonderful book and a highly recommend read. -->When I Was a Child: Based on a true story of love, death, and survival on the Kansas prairie"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Like Isaac's Storm (Erik Larson) before it, The Children's Blizzard takes us into a nearly forgotton place in American history and slaps us with the almost casual brutality of life before modern meteorology. David Laskin has researched the subject of the blizzard of 1888 in meticulous fashion and we can't help but be impressed with his scholarship. Laskin has previously written on meteorology and he has a way of making the capricious nature of the atmosphere highly accessible.Readers should be warned that Laskin is unsparing in his depiction of the death by exposure of children trapped in the storm. If you've read \\"To Build a Fire\\" by Jack London (whom he credits) you'll have a small idea of what these children go through. Images will haunt you: Parents dragging their frozen children into the house to thaw by the fire so their contorted bodies will fit into tiny coffins. Even those who survive must endure gruesome injuries. This is history and it must be told. But one wonders what ever made these settlers think such a life was worth the hardships. It was a rare family that had not lost children, even before the great blizzard.A minor criticism of The Children's Blizzard is its tendency, especially early, to focus on historical minutiae. Emphasis on the life of plains settlers before they left Europe drags down the early narrative.Recommended, but not for the easily disturbed reader."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I loved this book for precisely the same reason as those who gave it a low rating disliked it: the book describes much more than the hours of the storm itself, but gives us the full historical context. The author gives us background into: the immigrants' lives in Europe; their journeys to the U.S.; their trek to the midwest states; their difficult lives there; the state of weather forecasting of that time; the political climate (pun unintended); etc. So by the time the author gets to the storm itself, the people involved are not faceless or anonymous, but rather, people you have already come to know. The book also deals at length with the aftermath of the storm, on a number of levels. It's like reading a fictional novel -- only this one really happened! Personally, I was fascinated by the author's brilliant command of a number of fields: meteorology, sociology, politics, economics, etc. And the research that must have gone into cobbling this work together! Poring through old diaries and newspapers, interviews with grandchildren of survivors, etc. This book had a profound impact on me, and made me appreciate how relatively easy our own lives are compared to people in the not-so-distant past. I have already begun lending it out to friends!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I rarely write reviews on Amazon, but I felt compelled to write about this one, and I am e-mailing all my friends to tell them to pick it up immediately.I spent the afternoon (by the fire--thank God) reading parts of the book aloud to my husband and son. They were memerized and it sparked all kinds of discussion--from weather patterns to the fortitude of the Homesteaders, to how lucky we are to have what we have.The phrase \\"page-turner\\" is too cheap for this book, but it is that, and much, much more.Kudos to David Laskin for writing such an important work."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Once you get past the beginning of the weather review, the actual story about the children and what they encounter through the blizzard is interesting. The weather is important, but could have been less detailed."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"If one likes history, this is a good book. If one is from or now lives in Nebraska, this is a good book. I have a relative, on a linear line, i.e. he was the nephew of my great-great grandfather, who died in 1888 in the blizzard. He died from something that no one knew about, and we did not know why he died. I am not going to tell what it is, but doctors now know what to do about people who get VERY cold, and what happens to the body after being rescued, or in Omar's case, just got up to go find help.The book gave the extent of the blizzard which really was a huge affair from Minnesota to Nebraska with Nebraska taking the full brunt of it. In thinking about this young man as well as the continued story of the young woman who spent the night with him in a snowdrift, and her long recuperation, I always wonder if the school teacher ought to have kept the children in the building and not released them to go home. He had no radio to give weather reports, so it is unfair to blame him, but one wants to find fault somewhere because of the horrific death of Omar Gibson and others. I also wonder why they did not bring the horse near them and stay very close to his warm body? I would have thought that they, as county children, could have made him sit or lie down, although I am not a farmer so maybe they could not have done this. I think that they would have survived had they done this. I would have thought that this would have been well-known survival information on the Nebraska plains of the 1880s. The horse didn't make it either, but maybe his body warmth could have kept them alive.I am grateful to people who take the time to research this sort of incident and then to write a book that young people and all readers will enjoy. This blizzard and its effects on Nebraska residents is well documented in Nebraska history books. It is good to have a 21st Century Point of View looking at it."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Pluses:1.

Laskin's intent, of course, was to highlight the role the prairie children played in the tragedy caused by the Great Blizzard of 1888. By focusing on the difficulties these immigrant homesteaders faced in child bearing and the raising of children in remote prairie settlements in the 19th Century, the author sets the stage for the catastrophe that befell so many young school children. In the Old Country many of these immgrant families had lost children in childbirth and to childhood disease only to lose their surviving offspring in transit or in the New Country. (One mother, Anna Kaufmann, had only one of her first four sons survive into his teenage years and then lost that son to the Great Blizzard.) In short, Chapter One of the book stresses the fact that prairie children were a precious and tenuous commodity, thus enhancing the pathos of Laskin's account.In his meticulously researched book, Laskin relates the role of the U.S. Signal Corp, the prototype of the U.S. Meteorological Society in the forecasting of the storm, how bureacratic bungling and infighting thwarted vital communication with the prairie communities that lay in the path of the blizzard. The author discusses, as well, the railroads and their telegraph networks, how they contributed to this fractured communication. Fascinating, too, is Laskin's portrayal of the anatomy of the storm, how high and low pressure systems commingled to create the awesome meteorological event of January 12, 1888, and left \\"...more than a hundred children...dead on the Dakota-Nebraska prairie\\"; how so many deaths were a matter of bad timing:children in the wrong place at a very wrong time.The stories of so many young victims is epitomized in the poignant account of five boys, three of them brothers, pitting themselves against a killer storm, ultimately succumbing to it. Drawing on the expertise of doctors and other authorities, Laskin creates an horrific scenario (albeit hypothetical) of the boys' ordeal and final moments: their thoughts, actions, and the physiological effects of cold on their bodies as their core temperatures drop. Using a quote from an Emily Dickinson's poem \\"After Great Pain, a Formal Feeling Comes,\\" Laskin sums up the boys' ultimate fate with the line: \\"First chill--then Stupor--then the letting go--\\". When the five bodies were recovered, the three brothers, the Kaufmanns' sons, were discovered clasped together as one, a siamese triplet of frozen flesh. (The three had to be thawed to separate them. (Because of rigor mortis it was difficult to fit many of the young victims into their coffins.)I think what impressed me most about \\"The Children's Blizzard\\" was Laskin's obvious connection, though a century removed, with the victims of the Blizzard and their unfortunate families. His pilgrimage to the grave of the castaway child/young woman Lena Woebbecke to pay his respects to her memory I found particularly moving. With the exception of the descendants of the victims and survivors of the Great Blizzard that struck the Midwest with such fury on January 12, 1888, I'm sure many Americans today are unaware of this tragic storm. Thanks to David Laskin's informative and enlightening narrative more will learn of the hapless settlers of this harsh, inhospitable new land, their valiant, but in many cases futile efforts to tame it, and the Great Storm that for many was the death knell to their dreams--and their beloved children."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Wonderfully written book about an American tragedy. Many children died during a blizzard the swept over several states.The morning weather was unusually warm and the blizzard hit mid-day catching all unprepared.The characters and their backgrounds are well developed; you weep for these victems.Should be required reading for anyone interested in early Am. History in the Great Plane States."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Laskin's story chronicles a monster blizzard that devastated the Great Plains in January 1888 and left some 500 people -- mostly children trying to get home from school -- frozen dead on the prairie. After a slow start the book became fascinating to me. I could do without all the meteorological stuff or the too in-depth background, but the stories of the families, their struggles and their survival was riveting."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"The intensity of the blizzard of 1888 is so mind-boggling, that is could only be equated to the cliche of a perfect storm. Even as the words on each page describe the storm, it is hard to imagine. Particularly in simpler lives of the 19th century, one has to wonder how people were able to survive such a storm even under the best of circumstances.David Laskin does a commendable job of explaning the circumstances of the storm to make it fathomable even to whose only knowledge or only care of meteorology is tomorrow's temperature. While at later points he becomes a little more bogged in details, I believe he reaches a fair balance. The story alternatives between those that forcasted or failed to forcast the storm and the people that endured the storm. The bureaucracy of military making weather predictions may have conspired against the people as much as the beautiful day the preceded the storm.No story is more tragic that reading of children dying. The fact that the blizzard errupted when school was dismissing and so many children were trapped in the elements earned the storm and this book its name. As I read these stories, I sometimes felt a disconnect because their were so many names. This is almost more alarming because of the scattering of records and the lack of an accurate count of the dead.Laskin has written a commendable book in \\"The Children's Blizzard\\". While his writing career seems more tailored toward weather events in history, I would embrace future works in a similar vein to this book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"An interesting recounting of a ferocious blizzard, which killed dozens of school children and adults. A little known moment of pioneer history."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Very interesting book about the formation of the National Weather Service. How three storms come together in January 1888 and many children (as well as others) were literally frozen to death on their way home from school. The inadequacies and unpredictableness of the beginnings of the NSW. Parts are very sad but the book on the whole was captivating."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Most of us don't think of blizzards as a disaster. Snowstorms may be beautiful, challenging and frustrating, but that's usually as far as it goes. Residents of the Midwest states know better. Blizzards there can come on suddenly from a warm, clear day, killing anyone caught out unprepared. The January 1888 storm was perhaps the worst, known as the Children's Blizzard because most of the several hundred killed were children coming home from school.Laskin has produced a true classic here that will appeal to many different types. I would say it is successful in three critical areas. First of all we have a fascinating story here, superbly written. When the storm hits, you will feel the sting of ice crystals hitting your face and feel the blast of wind. You will find yourself with the children in the small schoolhouse, debating whether to stay or make for home. Readers may want to put on some warm clothing before plunging into this one.Laskin also does a fine job of teaching us the basics of weather and frontal systems. We are given several meteorology lessons without the feel of a stuffy classroom. But one need not be scientifically inclined to enjoy the action here.The book is also an account of the German and Norwegian immigrants who came to the Northern prairie states in the late 19th Century. Since my ancestors settled there from Norway at that time I admit to a slight bias here, but I still think most will enjoy learning what obstacles and troubles faced these newcomers to the Great Plains. Many of these no longer exist or have been overcome. Not so with the terrible blizzard."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"January 12, 1888, entered as an uncommonly mild hint of spring after a frigid beginning of the New Year across the northern and central plains. School children and farmers, mailmen and those off to town on errands, departed leaving behind the normal heavy attire needed for the climate in which they lived and worked. With no warning, temperatures abruptly dropped more than forty degrees accompanied by gale force winds and blinding snow. This is a non-fiction account of some of those involved in that terrifying day known as The Schoolhouse Blizzard.The account of the blizzard is compelling, at times difficult to read in its harrowing detail. Distracting to me were the large sections spent with back stories on these immigrants arriving in this land and the details of the weather systems that came together to create this monster. The fearsome power of nature is deftly displayed, and maybe most of all how seemingly small chance decisions can change a life forever."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"LOVED this book. Have a signed book from the author and had to get another copy for my Kindle. Amazing what so many people had to go through with this blizzard. I'm from part of the area and cannot imagine. Something everyone should read!!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This is an incredible natural event with tragic consequences. This is a heart wrenching story of marvel and tragedy. The event of the blizzard is a natural phenomenon. This was a blizzard like no other. The speed at which it strikes and the rapidity of the effects is astonishing. It struck with such quickness that most people caught outdoors barely had time to make it to shelter and safety. And the children that were sent home from school, \\"before it got bad\\", getting caught in a white out and perishing in the frozen storm is very sad indeed. This is an excellent book. Well written, easy to follow and a very good account of this event. I really have no complaints. It is a sad book but also very interesting and educational. Once again, I would like to give it 4 1/2 stars..... but you can't do half stars!! Even if you're not interested in the subject, you would probably still enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"January 12, 1888, was an unseasonably warm day across the plains. It was the first hint that spring was on the way. Children left coats and hats behind and soaked up the warmth as they walked to school. Farmers let animals out to graze and set off to begin work in long neglected fields. It was, by all accounts, a glorious day.Just as schools began to dismiss for the day, the temperature suddenly dropped by 18 degrees. Before anyone could fathom what was happening, the area was enveloped in a blinding snowstorm and rapidly dropping temperature. By midnight, the temperature was 40 below and hundreds were dead from exposure and hypothermia.David Laskin draws the reader in with vivid descriptions of the families, most of them immigrants who were already suffering from the harsh realities of pioneer life. He balances this narrative with details about the science behind the weather and the woefully lacking weather service provided by the Army Signal Corps of Engineers.My verdict: Read it. This book is great for history buffs and the science minded. I will admit that my eyes glazed over a bit during some of the rather dry explanations of the science behind the storm, but it was not so much that I couldn't thoroughly enjoy the rest of the book. Although intended for adults, I believe this would be a wonderful resource for a student studying pioneer life.See more reviews at [...]"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This book was amazing. I didn't know anything about the blizzard of 1888. A very good read. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"If you were a young school teacher in 1888 out on the beginning of the Great Plains and an unexpected blizzard suddenly happened on a winter's day that began beautiful and rather warm, what would you do? Keep your students inside the school building to ride out the storm, send them all home, or lead them yourself to the nearest farmhouse? Also, if you were a farmer and this same storm caught some of your stock out in the flat, open spaces, would you go after them in the teeth of the blizzard or stay snug and warm in your home? There are some of the choices available to many people during the extreme blizzard weather of January 12, 1888.Weather forecasting was in its infancy, and even if the forecast had been on the button, how could news of this fast moving weather front be disseminated to isolated farms scattered throughout the region? An impossible task, obviously. This book takes the reader into the lives of a myriad group of people, school teachers, farmers, town dwellers, etc., who were all faced with many courses of action. Some did brave things and some did foolish things, but all of them did what they thought was best.It's a sad book, for the reader learns of the tragic consequences of actions that turned out to be wrong, even though they didn't necessarily appear so at the time. This was an unprecedented storm, moving at the rate of a large train bringing snow, sleet, ice crystals and tremendous wind, obliterating from sight even objects just a few feet in front of people struggling to get to shelter.The consequences of this storm were serious and sad, but that story was overtaken shortly after by the Great New York Blizzard, and the common folk in the Midwest were basically forgotten. It's a book to read and learn, even though it's difficult to say you \\"enjoyed\\" a book with so much death and sadness contained in it."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I read this book, (twice, in fact), and it wasextremely interesting, albeit incredibly sad. The author has much information on the formation of what was, essentially, a \\"perfect storm\\". He also leads the reader through the different stages ofhypothermia, & we get a very candid look at how the body falls to extreme cold and trauma. Highly recommended reading!!!!"},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This little book packs a lot of history into a small space. It reads like a thriller, has fascinating explanations for deadly weather patterns and provides an insight into the terrible trials that faced immigrant farmers in the upper Midwest. The history of these affected families before they emigrated from Europe, and their histories years after the great blizzard are added bonuses."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"What a fascinating story, from the background of the immigrants, to the history of forecasting weather, to the sad stories of the unfortunate victims and their families. Laskin was able to describe vividly the struggles and the heroics that were experienced in the blizzard. The heartbreaking part was losing people to the storm after getting to know them."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"This fascinating and tragic account of the nineteenth-century blizzard that killed scores of people is rich with personal, political and scientific detail that placed the storm in the context of America's push to settle its frontier. Laskin traces the fate of several families induced by the Homestead Act to travel to the Dakotas, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa from their native European and Ukranian homelands, to establish new farms in the harsh environment of the Plains states. Focusing on their children - caught by the blizzard on the way home from school - made the story all the more poignant.The best parts of the book focused on the personal stories of these families, how they were caught in the storm, and affected in its aftermath. One schoolteacher braved the storm after (possibly) tying schoolchildren together and all survived. Another lost more than half of his class trying to travel less than a quarter mile to safety. However, Laskin pulled too many people into the narrative, which made their stories difficult to follow at times. Likewise, the evolution and fate of Army Signal Corp. officers who failed to predict the storm, while interesting, was cluttered with too many backstories, that seemed to bear little or no relationship to the tragedy unfolding in the Plains.Some of the most fascinating passages just talked about the weather. Laskin made dry meteorological details equal parts magical and terrifying as seen through the recollections of nineteenth century pioneers. \\"The air popped and sizzled when a hand was passed over someone's head,\\" because the violent storm generated so much static electricity. p. 176. One man found that \\"when his fingers snapped [] fire came from them,\\" and another watched \\"sparks of electricity leap from the gilt molding used for hanging pictures.\\" p.176-177. Likewise, reports of powdered snow, pulverized by the storm, suffocating and blinding people as it clogged airways and sealed frozen eyelids together, made it easier to understand how tough pioneers became lost and frozen a hundred feet from safety.At times, though, the meteorological details weighed down the narrative. An early passage describing how cold and warm fronts converge, and speculating on the impact of Rocky Mountain topography on storm development, was mind-numbing. Though the author valiantly tried to rescue the description with thoughtful metaphors, those fragments of understanding seemed randomly cobbled together. Pictures - perhaps extracts from historical meteorological maps (referred to in the text, but unseen by the reader) - would have been a welcome shortcut. While these few dense passages lack the finesse of more polished works (such as Isaac's Storm), persistence is well-rewarded by the overall story.Finally, in the aftermath of the storm, Laskin's reflection that the \\"140-year-old scheme\\" to settle the Plains \\"has failed at the cost of trillions of dollars, countless lives and immeasurable heartbreak,\\" was food for thought.In sum, though slow at times, Laskin's account of the \\"Childrens' Blizzard\\" was often insightful and evocative, and I highly recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I could only read half of this book before I quit. I thought that the characters and how they came to be there was interesting but there were too many pages on meteorolgy and its history. I was more interested in the families and their plight. I am diapointed because I really wanted to like this book. I had hopes that it would be a good read for me since it was rated so highly."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"I found this book to be a nice mix of personal stories and hisorical/scientific material. Based on anecdotal evidence, I believe the author did a very nice job of researching the material and striving for accuracy, at least for the part of the story related to the Swiss Mennonites.The Peter Graber Sr on page 35 of the hardcover edition is my great grandfather and the Andreas Graber first mentioned on page 138 is my grandfather. Both died before I was born but I have vivid recollections of sitting on my grandmother's (wife of Andreas)lap as a child and listening to her tell the story of the 1888 blizzard and the death of my grandfater's brother, Peter Jr. The story Mr. Laskin tells is very similar to that of my grandmother.The book probably deserves more than 4 stars but I give it this because the last few pages of the book are drivel. The idea that settling the Great Plains was a mistake is full of east coast arrogance. With regard to the Swiss Mennonites, these people were farmers--they were not going to settle in any city or area where abundant land was not available. If not the U.S. Great Plains, they would have gone someplance like Canada or South America, no easy life either. Or perhaps they could have stayed in Ukraine--Bolshevik revolution, civil war, Stalin's forced collectivization, and WWII as an alternative. I put flowers on the grave of Peter Sr every Memorial Day and say a prayer of thanks that he did settle on the Great Plains."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Laskin retells the story of the Great Blizzard of 1888. Nope, it's not the one that swept through NYC, which you may have been thinking of. This one descended on the Upper Plains in January. It appeared out of the blue, dropping the temperature 40 or so degrees in the space of minutes and whipping up snow so that you literally couldn't see the hand in front of your face. It struck at midday, trapping many people outdoors or away from home (especially kids at school), contributing to a death toll of possibly 400.Laskin does a great job personalizing the storm. He starts out by introducing a number of characters who would eventually be caught out in the storm, doing so in the context of immigration and how hard it was to pull up roots and try to make your way on the very inhospitable prairie. He also introduces the characters of the nascent Weather Service. I didn't find this as appealing. It just seemed rather long and drawn out, and paled in comparison to the immigrants' story.The author also wasn't as successful explaining the science behind the storm. Very long and convoluted explanations and analogies that just left me scratching my head. Here's an example:\\"As night fell, the low was still deepening, and as it deepened it sucked in greater and greater volumes of air. Some of that volume got fed into the high. Picture it like shoveling snow into an ever-rising mound at the center of a gargantuan circular drive, but instead of snow, the atmosphere was shoveling the air itself.\\"Laskin finally gets into the storm itself. This is really good, as he keeps switching between characters, building more and more suspense as he does so (though I did get a little confused who was who sometimes). The human interest - the out-and-out tragedy and also the incredible heroism - is conveyed really well.Unfortunately, though, the Weather Service and some tortured science pop in again. Not that that wasn't interesting, but it just seemed jarring the way it was inserted into the story and the amount of emphasis it was given. (And that's why I can't give this a 5!)And, finally, this book is just crying out for some photos. Alas, it hasn't a one."},{"Title":"The Children's Blizzard","review":"Book was in excellent condition; contains alot about early weather forcasting; weather conditions leading up to the terrible snowstorm that took so many children's lives.

Janson, still has top billing for the volume) talks about the long tradition he and his father have had toward this volume and the larger work that carries the same name. It has been a standard in Western art education for decades, and the revisions periodically placed serve to bring new interpretations, perspectives and finds into the mix of history.Prior to diving into the depths of art, Janson provides a primer - art history is a relatively new discipline, and often studied by historians and others with interest but relatively little training in artistic areas themselves. This book is about the visual arts (those of drama, music, etc. are not included here, but architecture is to some degree); Janson gives a brief survey of key concepts that are critical to understanding the mediums (artists, Janson states, prefer to use the plural of medium as mediums rather than media). Geometric and visual appreciation concepts are introduced, as are philosophical/aesthetic ideas.The majority of the text is divided into four broad sections: The Ancient World, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance through the Rococo, and the Modern World. This is a book that really a survey or history of Western art - it does have a brief section at the beginning of the Ancient World on cave art and neolithic art in North America, but apart from this never wanders outside the main courses of Western art even in the modern period. As an introductory text, this is not surprising - many of the values and concepts of art in non-Western cultures require more explanation for adequate aesthetic appreciation of their art than an introductory survey course could cover. Still, it is a deficit worthy of note for those who are looking for a more comprehensive volume.The Ancient World covers art of Egypt, the Fertile Crescent and Persia, Aegean/Greek art, Etruscan art, and Roman art. The section on the Middle Ages begins primarily with the rise of Christendom as the dominant political power - this includes Byzantine art, early Medieval art (Carolingian and Ottonian times), Romanesque, and the ascendancy of the Gothic style, including the great Abbey of St-Denis. The Renaissance focusses early on Italy, but also explores the Renaissance influences in Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, France, and England. The Modern Period is the most diverse, with movements such as Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Art Nouveau and other schools that had a greater tendency to cross national boundaries. The twentieth century brought about a great explosion of artistic expressions, in architecture, sculpture, painting and photography, each of which get a chapter. While the fourth section begins with a discussion of modernism, it ends with the discussion of post-modernism, a period of transition.The colour reproductions throughout are stunning, and the use of black-and-white images to highlight details is also useful. Two-thirds of the 600 illustrations are in colour. The photographs showing architectural styles are interesting, far from being boring 'sample' shots. The text is engaging and informative, achieving a good balance between the artistic, the philosophical and the historical. There are maps, chronological tables, a glossary of terms, suggestions for further readings arranged topically, and a very useful index (always a plus for students and scholars)."},{"Title":"Basic History of Art","review":"This extremely helpful book assisted in developing an understanding of the contributions of art in various cultures.

(Working paper)","review":"Low City, High City is a lively and informal account of Tokyo's history from the end of the Tokugawa regime (in 1868) to the destruction of the city in the 1923 Kanto earthquake. During that half century, Tokyo was transformed from a feudal pre-industrial city of samurai and commoners to an imperial capital of bureacrats, businessmen, factory workers, and flappers. Seidensticker, a distinguished translator of Japanese literature, has written a highly readable cultural and social history of Tokyo that captures the colorful introduction of &quot;Western&quot; urbanism and chronicles the slowly fading old city. An absolute must for anyone with even a casual interest in Tokyo's past."},{"Title":"Underinvestment in on-the-job training? (Working paper)","review":"When I was a teenager, I got a summer scholarhip to go live with a Japanese family in Tokyo. The experience changed me forever. Though America long remained the center of my daily life, Japan became for many years, \\"the alternate world\\". Japanese culture and the Japanese language fascinated me and I studied both for many years. I subsequently returned to Japan several times and have remained in contact with that family all my life. I'm now sixty-five. The Tokyo I first saw was only 36 years after the great earthquake of 1923 and only 14 years after the catastrophe of World War II. So it is that when I read Seidensticker's account of Tokyo, bits and pieces bob up from the flow of memory, my underground impressions and experiences not-quite-recalled, especially sounds and sights no longer to be found in the Tokyo of today. I found it most engrossing. LOW CITY, HIGH CITY is a local history---mostly of downtown Tokyo where in the Tokugawa period, the Edo culture flourished most. The author traces the tastes and tendencies of the townsmen, and how these changed under the giant wave of Western influence that began after the Meiji Reformation of 1868. He takes the process up to the Kanto Earthquake, which came just three years before the Taisho Emperor died and the Showa era (one of the most momentous in Japan's long history) started.This is the first part of a longer history of Tokyo, but it may be read on its own. Seidensticker, who died in 2007, was an esteemed translator of Japanese literature, both ancient and modern, who lived there. If you have no acquaintance of Tokyo at all, you will find LOW CITY, HIGH CITY heavy going, I fear. That's because he talks about the city districts, sections, streets, rivers, and parks and how they all changed over time, through numerous devastations by fire, flood, earthquake, and the wish to \\"be modern\\". You will find yourself aching for better maps than the two provided which show only broad outlines. The process by which Tokyo, and Japan, transformed itself from a remote Asian city (say in 1850) to one of the centers of the modern world (say by 1970) is a fascinating tale. This book helps reveal to Western readers what happened. Transportation, cultural life, literature, architecture, parks, recreations, land use, prostitution and coffee houses-----the list of topics is nearly endless. Like any local history, the mass of detail sometimes obscures the larger processes and themes. The Low City, by the harbor and along the Sumida River, had been the heart of Edo culture, but by the end of Meiji (1912), it had given way to the High City, that newer section of Tokyo on ridges and hills that surrounded the Low and stretched away south and west, the greater part of modern Tokyo. If you know Tokyo at all, you're going to find a huge amount of interesting and sometimes amusing detail in this well-written book. If you don't, perhaps this is not the place to begin because his weaving and bobbing, jumping around, produce a collage effect rather than a single, direct line to follow."},{"Title":"Underinvestment in on-the-job training? (Working paper)","review":"I started this book with high hopes that were quickly dashed. The book jumps around both geographically and chronologically. Seidensticker will talk about one ward of Tokyo, then move on to another, and 20 pages later start talking about the first ward again. Likewise, he'll discuss the Meiji period, then the Taisho, and then back to Meiji. The maps of Tokyo also have some errors. Seidensticker also relies, it seems, way too much on the recollections of Nagai Kafu, who he admits was a close personal friend. The redeeming quality of this book is that if you can wade through this and make heads or tail of it, there is a wealth of information on the transformation of Tokyo into a modern metropolis. It's just painful to extract it."},{"Title":"Underinvestment in on-the-job training? (Working paper)","review":"A very readable and impressionistic discussion of the changes in Tokyo from the inauguration of the Meiji period to the great Tokyo earthquake of 1923. Based on Seidensticker's deep knowledge of Tokyo, Japanese literature, study of old guidebooks, and memoirs, this book attempts to chart the evolution of Tokyo from administrative capital of a semi-feudal state to a modernizing city. This is also partially a social history of Tokyo. Seidensticker adopts a combined chronological and geographic approach, using a roughly temporal sequence and traveling through many of the different parts of Tokyo to describe the changes across time. Its clear from his account that the combination of modernization and recurrent disasters of which the Earthquake was the greatest, destroyed much of Edo period Tokyo and what was left was finished off by American bombing during WWII. Seidensticker appears to be particularly fond of the popular culture of the Meiji and much of this book can be seen as a something of an elegy for that culture. This is not a systematic history. Demography, major changes in city planning, changes in governance are really mentioned only in passing. Seidensticker is a fine writer and much of this book is enjoyable reading but it tends to leave readers wishing for more structure and analysis."},{"Title":"Underinvestment in on-the-job training?

Soviets v.s. 3rd Reich in yet another battle to the death... Two months in 1944 that went mostly unnoticed by all, except those who were actually there...Yet somehow, Col Nash manages to bring this \\"lost\\" battle to life, re-telling the tale in minute and fascinating detail. He shows us the players, the setting, the story... he draws us in, and makes us feel part of the struggle.I am very impressed with this book! Firstly, it is HUGE! Almost \\"coffee table book\\" in size, it is literally bursting with rare photos, detailed organizational charts and informative maps and charts. Second, it is packed with invaluable and otherwise impossible to find information. Third, it is masterfully writen... Col Nash has re-invented the military history book! This is no dry listing of dusty facts... this is an exquisite retelling of history... a true \\"page turner\\" that draws you in and holds your attention until the last page! The best history book I have ever read, military or otherwise. I give this book my highest and most enthusiastic rating, especilly to students of WWII and/or the Russian Front."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Nash has written, I believe to be, one of the greatest works on the East Front. Stories of courage, imagination, and leader innovation are traits that mark the history of the East Front and are clearly present in this book. What makes this book an anomaly as my heading states? It is the fact that Douglas Nash clearly projects how personal the war was - not only at a tactical level, but also at the operational.The Battle of Cherkassy (Korson) Pocket signified the destruction of the last German offensive capability in the East.More importantly, it symbolizes two great operational struggles: The Russian will to destroy their invaders by attempting to create another Stalingrad catastrophe and the German resolve to survive and escape annihilation.The Book describes the battle in three major levels: strategic, operation, and tactical. Each level includes the planning, coordination, and execution of their respective missions. The decisive characteristic of this work is the smooth intregration of all three of the levels and their respective components. Coupled with the operational and strategic awareness, Nash presents a myriad of personal accounts and stories at the tactical level that are uncommon for a book that covers an event of such size and magnitude. As a result, one will easily &quot;feel&quot; the desperation on the opposing forces. The result of Nash's diligent work: one will become immersed in the story rather than bored or confused from the complexity of the battlefield.Finally, I want to address to the physical attributes of the book. The old saying, &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot; should NOT apply here. The size, material, mere construction, and the cover pic leave an incredible, positive impression which is absolutely fullfilled by its content.I became fascinated with the Battle of the Cherkassy (Korson) Pocket after reading about it in Paul Carrel's SCORTCHED EARTH; however, Carrel left me yearning for more detail about the battle - Douglas Nash successfully filled the void."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Mr. Nashs' recent release concerning the Kourson Pocket Jan.- Feb. 1944 is, to me the closest thing to perfect military historical writing that I've read yet! To begin with, the book is physically HUGE. The fact that Mr. Nash has done exhaustive research from both the german and soviet sides is evident - having a bibliography following each chapter was quite impressive. In addition, the author has done many, many interviews with surviving participants that add a intimate flavor to his writing, with a myriad of details that gives the reader the reader the feel of being immersed amid the chaos and desperation of the action. Numerous side stories to the main action are covered in astonishing detail. And the pictures! Where on earth did he collect all these wonderful pictures that make it much easier to visualize what was going on. I have been a long time student of the Ost Front, having read all of Carell's books, the recent autobiographies by common landsers' and many, many other books on the subject. None of them comes even close to the detail and pure readibility of Mr. Nashs' masterpiece on the Kourson Pocket! Buy the book, eagerly await its' arrival, and then savor it like a fine wine upon obtaining it. This should be required reading for anyone thinking of pursuing writing in military history - the gold standard against which any future writing will be measured. My only hopes are (1)That the author wil turn his protean writing talents to other neglected, but equally exciting Ost Front actions such as Mansteins' actions in the Crimea in '42, or his masterful retreat from the Caucasas, or his crowning jewel - the recapture of Kharkov in '43. (2)That the motion picture industry will recognize this work that captures the chaos and hell of war on a personal level and the sacrifice involved for its' participants and make a movie that attempts to convey this. Friends and colleagues, it doesn't get any better than this!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Hell's Gate is a very good, in depth analysis of one of the Eastern front's most important battles. The buyer should be aware however that this book, in my opinion, is meant for military historians, not for the casual reader. As indicated in previous reviews, the book would benefit from better maps and detailed illustrations supporting the troop movements and positions well described in the book. My other criticism is that the author approaches the subject very analytically, and while he has incorporated first person material he has missed an opportunity to make the subject matter much more exciting and a better read. All in all it is a very good, detailed account of military history and if you are a serious student of WWII &amp; the Eastern Front you would benefit by purchasing this product."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Excellent book, with loads of anecdotes and personal accounts, at least for the German side. The book would have been even better if the author could have managed to obtain more Soviet first hand accounts as well, but even without them he does a good job of describing and assessing the Soviet side of the battle as well."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"While the Eastern Front in World War II has generally been well covered by military historians, the campaign in the Ukraine in early 1944 has had only spotty coverage. After the defeat at Stalingrad and the long retreat to Berlin, the Germans were less interested in documenting their defeat. But stubborn resistence by the Germans after Kursk through the Ukraine, slowing Stalin's reclaiming of the Soviet Union, meant the Soviets were not eager to write much history of this part of the Eastern Front. Douglas Nash's book on the Cherkassy Pocket is a welcome, detailed work on a brutal battle, the first in a series of Soviet pocketing actions of the Germans in the Ukraine. The five months of fighting in the Ukraine were perhaps the most terrible of the war. Through assiduous research in archives plus interviews with survivors, Nash documents hour-by-hour a level of valor and determination on both sides that is hard to fathom. Modern readers of this terrible battle story will ask, &quot;How was it possible for men to persevere under these conditions.&quot; Nash's attention to detail tells a compelling story."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"In 1981, I attempted to recreate the entire Battle of Cherkassy for a massive Squad Leader scenario. It was a huge undertaking back in those days as there were not 20 different Squad Leader boards. And there was virtually no information on Cherkassy beyond what could be found in Time-Life's The Soviet Juggernaut, which gave tantalizing accounts of this fascinating battle. In later years, Leon Degrelle's, Campaign in Russia provided still more insight into the fights at Novo Buda and Shanderovka.But still there was no comprehensive single source for text and/or pictures until the arrival of Nash's book. And Nash nails it from in-depth text to pictures that are connected to the events described. If for nothing else, grab this book for the pictures. There are some excellent shots of Walloons and I was particularly intrigued by a series of shots of SS-Sturmbannfuehrer Hans Dorr, who is one of the more interesting soldiers of the 5th SS Wiking Division. In short, the pictures and text are first rate and in my opinion are the definitive accounting of this battle.Sure wish it had been around in 1981...what a Squad Leader game we would have had."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"If you want to know what war on the Eastern Front was like, there is not a better book available. The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket takes place in early 1944 as the tide of war is turning against the German Army.The author vividly details the progress of the battle. We get insight into the personalities of the military leaders on both sides. Liberal use of first hand experiences literally put the reader on the battlefield itself. The book also includes many striking photos taken during the battle.The key story line is that of a surrounded German Army force. Having learned the hard lessons of Stalingrad, the Luftwaffe puts forth an incredible effort to try to keep the entrapped force resupplied until a breakout can be attempted. During the course of the battle, the author details the typical mistakes and miscommunications that so often take place during war. The Germans are suprised by the entrapment of their forces in the Cherkassy area having underestimated Soviet forces opposite them. Likewise, the Soviets find that even at this late point in the war, the German Army can still strike back effectively.This book is highly recommended for anyone who wants to get a feel for the intensity of the war on the Eastern Front."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Douglas Nash's first book about the Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket is bound to be an Eastern Front classic. It is extremely well researched, with tons of detail. More importantly, it is an easy read. He has interviewed both German and Soviet veterans and provides a thoroughly unbiased presentation of the day by day events that made up this historic battle for survival. The maps provided are detailed, yet easy to read and understand. The photo's found within are excellent and provide some insight into the hell that was the &quot;kessel&quot; (cauldron), as the German soldiers referred to the area in which they were surrounded.

The writing is clear and unambiguous; the text is supplemented with many photographs, including previously unpublished photos made available to the author by participants of this battle.There are some irritating production shortcomings, such as the occasional line dropping off at the bottom of a page and the seemingly inevitable misspellings throughout.In all, I readily recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Nash does one of the best historical accounts of a massive and complicated battle that I have yet read,The extra time spent on the personalities involved and their relationships adds tremendously to the value of this book. Winning the battles but losing precious equipment and ground was a big part of the German retreat, Sadly the loss of life here is also extreme and the personal stories that delve into that loss are painful and foretell of worse to come.Filled with rare fantastic photos and first person accounts this is the definitive book on Korsun/Cherkassy. I hope that while survivors of battles like these are still living Nash will continue to create works like this that add so much to history and our understanding of WWII."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Col. Nash has written what I consider to be an epic on the war on the Ost (east) front of WWII. His plain language style and the relating of participants accounts are compelling and draw the reader in. He makes a theater of war not fully known in the west understandable. The story as depicted could be the basis for a screen play in what would be an epic film matching \\"Das Boot\\", \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"Stalingrad\\" if Hollywood only had the courage to show it the way he presents it (sans politics). The strugle for survival is basic and one that everyone can understand and Col. Nash is an artist in painting that picture. This is the kind of book I love, one that gets into the day to day life of the soldier while giving the bigger picture. If anyone reads just a few books about the eastern front in WWII make this number one on your list!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Mr. Nash presents The Korsun battle in an intelligent and refreshing style. Using a well balanced combination of context, operational overview, and first-person detail, the book provides the reader an enjoyable and informative account of this little known action. Both photos and text concentrate primarily on the German point of view, although this does not seem to detract from the overall utility of the work. The selection of photos includes many that I have not seen before, and are well captioned. Especially impressive was Mr. Nash's sometimes keen analysis of various events or situations - however, one wishes he would have included more such sections. I recommend this work for all interested in the Eastern Front, and consider it well worth the price. Bottom line: If you don't recieve it for Christmas, go out and buy it on your own."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Expert writing on a relatively little-known albeit vital battle on the Eastern Front in 1944. Military History does not get any better than Mr. Nash's account of the battle of the Cherkassy pocket!"},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"The book is well researched backed by the author's visit to the battlefield site. He interviews numeorus survivors(mostly German) of the battle. It is a pity that the Russians are not more forthcoming in allowing researchers access to their archives.The only negative and I may be the only that thinks in this respect, is that I hate coffee table sized books."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Mr Nash begins his book, which is driven from the German perspective, by describing the events that lead to the Cherkassy Pocket. It started with the Russian counteroffensive after stopping Operation Citadel in mid July and the subsequent drive to the Dniepr River by late September. In October and November the Russians fought for and established bridgeheads over the river at Lyutegh, northwest of Kiev, Zaporozhye and Metilopol in the south. During a German counterattack that ultimately failed the Kanev salient was formed. Since the rest of the assault failed, this salient was more liability than asset. Manstein wanted to move back but Hitler forbade him to move back. This salient will be one of the keys that the Russians will use to defeat the Germans in the coming battle of Cherkassy Pocket. Two German Corps, the XI and XLII, will have to face the 1st and 2nd Ukranian Fronts. The Russian forces are greatly superior in men, tanks, guns and supplies. Its an unfair contest but it is a testament to the determination of the German soldier to endure.After setting the stage, the command structure and troop dispositions are discussed as well as the plans that Zhukov and others create. These beginning chapters are very deliberate so that by the time the battle begins, the reader will have a good understanding of what is happening and will be able to follow the coming battle.Konev of 2nd UF begins his assault on the east boundary line on January 24th and Vatutin starts the next day from the northwest of the German position. Within five days the two forces meet at Zvenigorodka and it looks like a second Stalingrad has occurred. The speed of the encirclement surprised the Germans but Manstein quickly ordered Breith to relieve the pocket. In a quicker response than at Stalingrad, Breith moves out toward the trapped soldiers which have to be resupplied by airdrop. Breith's forces weren't strong enough to reach the pocket and Stummermann had to move out to meet him. The preparations for the eventual breakout was deliberate and fascinating.Key battle action is described very well throughout the book. The Russian offensive and the German defense within the pocket, Breith's attempt to reach the pocket and Stemmermann's attempt to breakout of the pocket is all covered very well. If the operational aspects were all that was covered, the book would still be good but what elevates this book to greatness is the addition of the human element, the brutality and suffering these soldiers had to endure. Besides being shot at, the lack of sleep, food, medical supplies, the extreme cold, struggling through muddy roads and more faced these soldiers everyday for a month and Mr Nash expresses this condition as well as I've every read. You can almost feel the hunger and pain, the cold.In addition to the great narrative, 14 full page maps clearly depict the series of events from the initial dispositions, to the daily progress of the Russian advance, closing the pocket, squeezing the pocket, the relief corridor and the eventual exit corridor. There were couple typos but its not worth going into. There are many fine photos. Most of the many soldiers discussed have their photos included. There are also many fine battlefield photos as well.Reading the book is all the proof you need that its deeply researched but there are endnotes and an impressive Bibliography to back up that belief. An Appendix and Index are also included. The Appendix includes an Order of Battle, a Glossary of terms, the Breakout Order of Stemmermann's, a comparison of German and Russian commands, Knight's Cross Recipients, a correlation of Forces in the Kanev salient on 1/24 plus other info.Mr Nash has performed a great service for the history community by writing this accurate and moving story. Its highly recommended to all who are interested in WWII or are concerned about human suffering during war."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Acquiring a copy of the recent RZM reprint HELL'S GATE, can state that the book is worth both the time spent reading and the high cost to the purchaser.The author, both a graduate of West Point and an avid scholar of the Eastern Front, has put together a grand study of the Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket (Korsun Pocket), January-February, 1944. This last offensive of German arms eventually led to the subsequent advance of the Soviets into 'Poland, Rumania, and the Balkans\\". It's and hour-by-hour, day-by-day, study that took the author years to accomplish. The battle took its toll as fully 34% of the German troops would not live to see its end.

Sometimes a place is mentioned but you can not find it on the map.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"I have been a avid student of the history of German military operations on the eastern front for most of my adult life. I have read many books relating to the subject over the years, but I have to say of all the books that I have read Hells Gate stands alone. Most authors write about a specfic battle of event but never go deeper than a general explantion of the events. Hells Gate is the exception, the author takes the reader down to the tactical level in his description of the events leading up to and the events that occured during the German encirclement known as the Cherkassy Pocket. I strongly recommend to anyone with an interest in the events on the Eastern front to buy this book. I would have to say that It is one of the best books on the subject that I have ever read. It stands alone for not only the quality of the writing, but the obvious lengths that the author went to to research this book. To anyone interested in this subject matter this book is one of the best ever written."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"This book is an exhaustive and detailed study that presents a nearly hour-by-hour accounting of the Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket during three hard-fought weeks of January and February 1944. In addition to the facts of the battle, there is a wealth of supporting information regarding the commanders and their backgrounds, tactics, histories of the armies involved, great B&W; photos, maps, and first-hand soldier accounts. The battle itself was a disaster for the Wehrmacht and hastened the fall of the Ukraine. The Soviets sought to create a second Stalingrad (while the pocket contained 65,000 Germans, the Soviets thought it contained twice that number) and very nearly did.The overall description of the battle is very interesting and features ancillary topics such as the Luftwaffe's attempt to supply the soldiers trapped in the pocket. The first-hand accounts from both the German and Russian sides are fascinating to read - the hardships the Landser faced during the ordeal are unimaginable. This book is well worth the price but due to the amount of detail involved, is really best suited for serious students of die Ostfront."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"This interesting book about one of the third most famous encirclement battles on russian front during the Second World War (First Stalingrad, Second Curland, fourth Velikiye Luky) is more based, as new military historical approach requires, on the report coming from soldiers and officers and on the analisys of their operations report than on the simple discussion of the plans and of the battles. Obviusly, this approach negate the depth of the data can be found on a Glantz or Zaloga book but it seems me than this isn't the target of the book. The suggest is to use it with a normal military history book to complete the information of the latter with the ones coming from the first. The real missed opportunity of this book lies in the few maps present inside as the strategical ones can be found on any military history book on russian front and the tactical ones are extremely useful for wargaming and to understand the german small operation tactics but no more and, without operative maps reporting the ground on the battlefield (woods, hills, ravine, villeges or other), it's impossible to capture the mounting of the pressure on encircled forces, the foresee of the commander or the real problems opposing an operation to breack the encirclement."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Nash has written a highly researched tome about a battle that probably got very little media attention at the time. My interest in the Eastern front, post-Stalingrad, came from reading Guy Sajer's \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\". Sajer's book is the perspective of an 18-year old, just trying to put one foot in front of the other; Nash's book is the perspective of an operations officer. Nash doesn't go into the details of being a frontline infantryman; the smallest unit that he discusses is a Kampfgruppe, which might be an overstrength battalion, or small regiment.Criticisms: overall, a lack of maps. Usually, at the beginning of each Book (which is divided into chapters), is a map showing dispositions, towns & cities, and some geographical elements. However, as the book continues, one is having to flip back to the last map, which sometimes doesn't have all the places that are discussed in the chapter. Also, because of the scarcity of maps, and the different scales used in the maps, it is difficult (well, at least for me) to get a good grasp of how the pocket (or Kessel, or encirclement) kept shifting due to enemy attacks and movement of units within the pocket.2) While I don't want to say the timeline is inconsistent, Nash discusses the rescue forces, and the problems they had, almost in their timeline entirety, without keeping you informed, on a day-by-day basis, of what was happening in the pocket. Hence, once he returns to the encircled forces, there seems to be a disconnect in time.Ok, 2 criticisms on this physically huge book - not bad, no? It is well illustrated with photos (I think they're all black and white, unfortunately).In sum, if you're interested in reading a good military history book, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Douglas Nash's first book about the Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket is bound to be an Eastern Front classic.

But I'm happy to report that it is now back in print and can be bought on here on Amazon for a reasonable price.The Battle of Cherkassy (also known as the Korsun Pocket) was an important engagement on the southern part of the Eastern Front in early 1944. Hitler left two of his Corps holding a long salient into the Soviet lines for political reasons and because he harbored (unrealistic) hopes of using it as a springboard to recapture Kiev. The Soviets decided to attempt a second Stalingrad and bite the salient off at its base.Mr. Nash has written a truly outstanding book on what happened during the ensuing battle. Through impressively extensive research and by consulting with surviving veterans, he was able to write a multi-faceted book covering the build-up, the battle itself, and the aftermath from a tactical, operational, and strategic level for both sides. He clearly shows how far the Soviets had come militarily since the beginning of the war and, correspondingly, that while the Germans were not as good as they had once been, they still had some fight left in them, especially when on the defensive and in a tight spot.I recommend this book as strongly as possible if you have any interest in World War II, the Eastern Front, or just want to read a near-perfect example of a military history book."},{"Title":"Hell's Gate: The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket, January-February 1944","review":"Lucky, the ones who escapedBy far one of the best written books about this epic battle on the Eastern Front [Cherkassy] during W.W.II.

Nash worked with some of the most prominent and well-known researchers on the Eastern Front during his time in the Army, including David Glantz, another specialist and authority on the Eastern Front and the single most well known authority on Soviet operations during the war. Nash used extensive resources including both Soviet and German archives *AND* veteran soldiers so his account cannot called biased at all.In reading Nash's book I sense no tone other than historical; here is no desire to portray the \\"Nazi\\" cause in anyway - heroics of the common solider on both sides, yes, but an apology for National Socialism - NO. In reading Nash's work I didn't sense any of the grand apology that he was so seemingly upset by. In fact, I question his ability to read through this massively detailed book at all as it seems obvious he has confused this work with another. Nash has focused on the operational and tactical events of a specific battle and as such there is no place for discussion of occupation policies, National Socialist political goals, etc. This work is about *A* battle and the details of its operations from both sides. If one desires to read about the horrors of German occupation or the politics of National Socialism there are plenty of other works around. I wouldn't expect those works to detail the tactical goings-on of a obscure battle on the Eastern Front any more than one should expect Nash to discuss the fundamental issues of German occupation policies in a work such as this. The reviewer mentioned above doesn't have much of a clue if he wants to suggest any book that doesn't dwell on those aspects is somehow automatically acting as an apology for German crimes.Disregard his uninformed and silly review. This is an excellent work of scholarship on a critical and very unknown battle on the Eastern Front from many perspectives that deserves nothing but the highest of praises....I can firmly say Doug has written an authoritative and amazing account of a little know battle on the Eastern Front that stands the test of academic excellence on all levels.

This is particularly commendable, as too often the Civil Rights Movement is simplistically portrayed as all black people joining hands and marching forth as one unified voice.

Du Bois (Portraits of Black Americans)","review":"This a biography of one of the original founder of the Civil Rights movement. W.E.B. Du Bois(William Edward Burghardt). He was born in Massachusetts in 1868. He grew up with his mother and brother. His father had left when he was quite young. It was soon found out how smart and intelligent he was that he eventually skipped a grade. He did not see the extreme prejudice of being black till he enrolled at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He eventually became professor, writer, speaker and social activist. He is the author of the well known book \\"the souls of black folk\\" which is still very valid today. He was one of the first African American involved with the founding of the NAACP(national association advancement of colored people).

The author takes you step by step from early Old Testament ethics through New Testament ethicsbacking every chapter with Holy Scripture. I fully endorse this text for any Christian library or even non-Christian seeking God's truth. The book reaches it's pinnacle of strength when the author describes the chapter &quot;Content of Christ's Ethics&quot;. This very high standard of our Lord Jesus Christ is defined in the &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot;. The author literally defines each of the beatitudes of Jesus leaving the reader lost in wonder and virtually stunned with Gospel power. Also the &quot;Marriage and Family&quot; chapter backs with Scripture the primary reason for marriage is companionship and then procreation. The author simply exceeds his intended purpose and out does himself. A great book."},{"Title":"A Penknife in My Heart","review":"Two men agree to exchange each other's murders to provide themselves with a perfect alibi. Parts of the plot are very similar to that of Strangers on a Train, and the author acknowledges this at the beginning of the book. One of the men seems much more admirable than the other, but is he really? Suspense as the plot unfolds."},{"Title":"Performing Femininity: Rewriting Gender Identity (Ethnographic Alternatives)","review":"What is ethical and/or moral when it comes to sexuality? Who determines this?Is sex performance/genre any more or less ethical than other performance style? Is it less or more powerful?Why is Western society so uncomfortable with its own sexual expression and choices?Desire is desire is desire...the hierarchy of desire......at the top, of course is the most accepted form, heterosexual monogamous coupling. Below this and in declining order resides queer desire, desire expressed in S/M, masturbation, desire aided by pornography or sex toys, promiscuous desire or more than one partner at a time, desire for partners from different generations, and desire expressed or fulfilled via commercial sex (Lockford 61).Lesa Lockford explores the physiological, psychological, sexual, and social feminine identity today's Western culture within her dissertation. Lockford interweaves humorous stories with first hand accounts in an academic method known as autoethnography, which breaches the line between feminist verses patriarchal points of view. She explores the social and cultural paradigms of feminine behavior as a result of women's physiology, and sexuality.\\"To be a feminist, one has first to become one\\". Commonly referred to as \\"consciousness raising,\\" this process of profound personal transformation\\" entails self-reflexivity and the development of solidarity with other women [regardless of sex or gender]...this transformative experience \\"goes far beyond the sphere of human activity we regard ordinarily as \`political'\\": indeed it manifests itself in everyday performances of self: In the course of undergoing the transformation to which I refer, the feminist changes her behavior: She makes new friends: she responds differently to people and events; her habits of consumption change; sometimes she alters her living arrangements or, more dramatically, her whole style of life. Becoming a feminist then is the embodying of the maxim \\"the personal is political\\" (Lockford 32).The social implications and expectancies constructed by our predominantly patriarchal and sexually inhibited culture renders women sensitive to issues of appearance, identity, and sexual confidence. She explores the most baring of feminine issues: from the humbling system of weight loss...to the allure of make-up and a girl stuffing her bra...to the public politeness of sexless/fearing academic circles... to the independence of a confident stripper and exploration of herself as a performance artist.The subordination of women by men is pervasive, that it orders the relationship of the sexes in every area of life, that a sexual politics of domination is as much in evidence in traditionally private spheres of the family, ordinary social life, and sexuality as in the things we do in the traditionally public spheres of government and the economy. The belief that the things we do in the bosom of the family or in bed are either \\"natural\\" or else a function of the personal idiosyncrasies of private individuals is held to be an \\"ideological curtain that conceals the reality of women's systematic oppression. (Lockford 32-3)By society's everyday actions and words, women are dictated on how they should behave: by what we have been taught and how we are expected to behave, determines our power and the way we are perceived in society and our culture. When a woman undermines the primary social power's expectations, she becomes an outcast, a renegade, a delicious forbidden fruit.The persuasiveness of objectification...time to start the music...Lockford explores how \\"we women experience our agency and constitute our subjectivity given the persuasiveness of objectification\\" (x). The most extreme objectification situation she discovers and experiments with herself is inside sexual performance. She then discovers that society underestimates the true power of the sexual performance, and that the labels of objectification are misplaced. She then questions society itself and the labels we place upon ourselves as a result of other's expectations and \\"moral\\" implications.Claiming space and giving voice to our perspectives was and is a vital touchstone for the development of empowered being and for revalorizing what traditionally has been considered important in the world (x).I think we are approaching a time where the emphasis of the individual is becoming the forefront of intellectual and social accpetance. Perhaps this makes me idealistic, a liberal feminist, etc. I choose individualism, and this book definitely breaks the ice on feminist theory and sexual performance."},{"Title":"The Barbarians: Warriors and Wars of the Dark Ages","review":"When I first saw this book,I thought it was a juvenile book for Middle schools.This impression came first from the cover which is an illustration of Middle Age Warriors on horseback.Something like you see on Sci-Fi or Fantasy books. Then the size.It is large,71/2\\"X10\\",and only 3/4 \\" thick,including hard covers.A quick thumb-thru indicated it had a lot of pictures and illustrations.I picked it up anyway.Although I read a lot of history,I am pretty weak on the history of the Middle Ages. I thought this book would give a simple overview of this period.Was I ever in for a surprise!!. This is an excellent history of this very long and complicated period.I does a good job of sorting out all those groups of people,and endless series of conflicts and invasions ,across all of Europe and the Middle East.Just looking at the cultures that rose and fell,it is little wonder it gets confusing.If you think this area of the world is complicated today, just imagine what it was during these 1500 years; when we had the: Alans,Anglo-Saxons,Arabs,Huns,Avars,Barbarians,Berbers,Bulgars,Bazentines,Romans,Carolingians,Celts,Danes,Franks,Gauls,Germans,Ostrogoths,Viaigoths,Greeks,Khazars,Magyars,Christians,Mongols,Moors,Norwegians,Slavs,Rus,Teutons,Vandals,Vikings,Wahshi and many others.This part of the world has seen a continuing string of conflicts where oppression and domination has attempted to destroy Western Civilization. Forces are at work today with the same intent.The character,intents and cultures we have seen in the past have not gone away;and in fact are very active today.A study of this area and period is very helpful in trying to see what happens when evil forces are accomodated and allowed to succeed. It was not a pretty picture in the past and what is taking place today must be taken very seriously.The book is very well written and the B&W; and Color Artwork and Illustration are excellent and bring this history to life and make it more understandable."},{"Title":"The Barbarians: Warriors and Wars of the Dark Ages","review":"This book covers the various barbarian invaders of Europe, beginning with the Huns and Germans in the Fourth century and continuing through to the Mongols.

The first chapter, 'The Most Terrible of All' gives a brief account of the campaigns waged between the Late Romans, the Huns, and the Visigoths, including the decisive battle of Adrianople in the year 378. The second, 'Fear in the Forest' tells of Rome's wars with the Gauls and West-Germans, like the brutal slaughter of AD 9. Chapter three, 'Business as Usual' deals with the barbarian wars that saw the traditional 'fall of Rome' in 476. Chapter Four, 'The Empire Fights Back' tells the confusing but heroic story of Byzantine Wars in Italy under Belisarius and Narses. Chapter Five, 'The Force of God' tells of the early Arabs, the foundation of Islam, and the fall of the Sassanid Empire. 'The Wolves of Wodan' tells the legendary story of the very-real Vikings and their campaigns against Byzantine, Celtic, French, and Arab foes. The Seventh and final chapter, 'The Relentless Plainsmen' tells of the Turkish and Mongol wars from the point of view of Eastern Europe. The text is supported with 16 color plates by Angus McBride, which capture the barbarians in realistic poses and expressions."},{"Title":"The Barbarians: Warriors and Wars of the Dark Ages","review":"THE BARBARIANS by Tim Newark.The story of the various barbaric hordes that ravaged Western civilization precipitating the fall of the Roman Empire and there after for roughly the next several hundred years. The Huns, the Vandals, the Goths, the Muslims, the Vikings, the Magyars and the Mongols are all covered in what is a rather cursory, shallow and childishly revistionistic manner. Rather like a cliffnotes version of Gibbon's DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. Overtly Pro-Muslim. Covertly anti-Christian. We learn that the Muslims, for example, were just so nifty and keen that Jews and Christians were giddily happy to be conquered by them and could not wait to convert to Islam. Islam is, of course, the religion of peace who would never harm the chin hair of a goat. Somehow they managed to reach the borders of France on a cloud of love until those stinking intolerant Europeans just said no.Written in 1985 when Academia was doing everything it could to save the Soviet Union from that mean old defender of Western Civilization, Ronald Reagan so the author tries...and fails...to make a comparison between the Barbarians and the Soviet Union saying that the West's animus towards the Eastern invaders was really just a matter of perception and not motivated by a genuine concern over a genuine and serious menace. Once the West decided that the Barbarians were no longer really so bad, everything became all wonderful and happy. Better barbarian than dead and all that rot.Yeah. Right.The book is okay. Nothing special.History for the cotton candy dayglow crowd."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"In this book, Philip Klass deals with the phenomenon of &quot;alien abductions&quot;--that is, the by-now widely known instances in which individuals, often with the aid of hypnosis, recall being taken by aliens aboard spacecraft and subjected to biological experiments. Klass deals thoroughly and convincingly with the hypnosis aspect of the phenomenon, and rightly points out that far from being a gateway to &quot;repressed memories,&quot; the technique is actually very likely to elicit fabrications, and perhaps even to plant memories of events that never happened. Additional space is given to cases like that of Travis Walton, which Klass maintains was almost certainly a hoax. Some discussion is also made of the possibility that temporal lobe epilepsy may be responsible for the experiences described by some individuals.Klass' explanations range from the strong to the very weak. His dissection of hypnosis and the likelihood that most abduction &quot;researchers&quot; are in fact guilty of planting false memories (inadvertently, it should be noted) is devastating. When he brings up TLE, however, he's really reaching. Klass was also notable for promoting ball lightning as an explanation for many UFO sightings, and the same conclusion can be drawn here: perhaps a few cases can be explained in this way, but likely not many. More common phenomena, such as sleep paralysis and waking dreams, would seem to be more appropriate for explication.In any case, this book is typical Klass. It's an entertaining and easy read, with the caveat that Klass' attacks on abduction &quot;researchers&quot; and abductees are occasionally nasty (in the case of one individual, the possibility that she might be of interest to alien researchers is discounted, albeit apparently in jest, simply because she is physically unattractive). His logic goes awry once in a while, but overall it is difficult to come away from a reading of this book and fail to appreciate the level of delusion required to consider oneself an abduction researcher. Klass makes a convincing case that the efforts of Budd Hopkins, Whitley Strieber and others are actually harmful to the individuals they analyze and to the public at large. For anyone interested in alien abductions, this book should be required reading."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"Philip Klass, one of the leading UFO skeptics, delves into the UFO abduction phenomena with fascinating results. To quote the back cover, &quot;If you have read Whitley Strieber's Communion or Budd Hopkins's Intruders, you owe it to yourself to read UFO Abductions.&quot; Mr Klass presents the other side of the coin in the abduction phenomena.The book discusses the claimed experiences of Betty and Barney Hill, Betty Andreasson, Whitley Strieber and other celebrated abductions. He also writes a very cogent chapter on the dangers of using hypnotherapy to unlock these experiences.After finishing this book, I couldn't help but wonder what the general consensus about UFO abductions will be in 300 years. Perhaps our descendants will know these visitors on a first-hand basis, or maybe they will laugh at our gullibility. As one of our current theories about the Salem witch trial concerns contaminated wheat, perhaps future scientists will decide that over-exposure to MSG or the newsprint used in the National Enquirer lead to this particular cultural phenomenon."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"This is a great book if you don't believe in UFOs, and a horrible book if you want to believe in them. UFOs do exist. They are Undentified Flying Objects. This doesn't mean they must be aliens from another world. Are they aliens? Read this book and the truth will be obvious to you. This book does and excellent job of breaking through the fact and fiction on UFOs.If you're afraid of aliens this book is also useful for you."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"As the title to this review says, this is a highly valuable resource. I found this book very refreshing in it's approach to UFO phenomena, a calm, cool annalist of *all* of the data and coming up with the most rational conclusion based on *that* rather than what sounds the most sensational.There's a little bit of a dated feel with regards to polygraph tests and just how accurate they are anyway, but mostly it's about the facts of many different UFO abduction cases, most of which were available at the time the cases were making headlines.If you enjoy the investigative books of Joe Nickell, then Philip Klass will be right up your alley as well."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"If he lived deep in the jungles of South America he would tell his tribe that theres no such things as to the likes ofairplanes,cars,cell phones,etc etc and never could be on this planet.And if someone said there is then theyre lying.Mr.closed mind would have us believe with all the billions of planets out there we are the only one with life on it.As I wrote in another review,look how far weve come in only 100 plus years from the covered wagon to space shuttles etc.So imagine if another planets civilization was 1,000 years more advanced,5,000,10.000 etc etc.Do I believe all these abduction stories? Absolutely not but there are 10s of thouands of them and I doubt everyone singleone is bs.Just like the ufo cases,95% are hoaxes,explainable, etc but the 5% of thousands and thousands cases cant beexplained and very credible people were involved too.But Klass would still think the world is flat."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"Any of the other reviewers who didn't like this book are morons.

It's so refreshing to find a normal, logical person in the UFO contriversy and not some New Agey idiot."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"This author\`s a skeptic. Need i say more. Is he narrow minded? Maybe, but his main intentions, like all skeptics, are to debunk whistle blowers and keep defending official government lies. And whenever any top secret information leaks out to the public, via a whistle blower, then it\`s the skeptic\`s job to still try and put a lid on the leaked top secret information despite the classified information being released. The skeptic usually does this by attacking the whistle blower personally and not debating the whistle blower\`s information with him or her. Another way the skeptic trys to debunk suppressed information that accidently leaks out is to claim that the whistle blower has been implanted with some sort of false memory. Many pedophiles on trial today use this false memory garbage on their child victims now so as to try and get away with their crimes against children. Philip Klass, in ths book, also accuses people being abducted of having some sort of false memory implanted in them. It\`s funny, skeptics always want proof and/or evidence, yet Klass gives no evidence or proof at all of abducted people being implanted with some sort of false memory."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"Klass is to be lauded as one of the individuals who refused to jump on the bandwagon of aliens, UFOs, abductions, and other paranormal stuff to instead seek the truth. This highly readable book picks up right where UFOs: The Public Deceived leaves off. Klass begins by summarizing briefly and dismantling the Fire in the Sky case (Walton) and then proceeds to level a majority of his critical outlook on the quackery of Budd Hopkins' seeming exploitation of \\"abductees\\" with psychological issues, likely for his own gain (the part about Hopkins trying to get his book out ahead of Strieber's is very interesting). Klass demonstrates over and over that Hopkins is not in any way qualified to psychologically assess his \\"patients\\" and Klass systematically demolishes hypnosis as a means of recalling hidden memories. Klass' dry sense of humor shines through here more so than in other of his works and his analytical mind is a still needed and relevant counterbalance to the various trappings of New Age and Pseudoscience that get cranked out year after year, repackaging the same fallacies and errors of judgment if not outright hoaxes."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"These days the History Channel has shows featuring nuts willing to tell us that every human achievement from the discovery of fire to building the Sydney Opera House was in fact the work of extraterrestrials. Evidently there's money to be made in aliens and as a result it's hard to find a good counterpoint. Klass tears this issue apart and leaves it a simpering shell of an argument only to be whined in one star Amazon reviews. By far the best thing this book ever did (for me) was to take all the wind of out of the Fire in the Sky case. That movie scared the crap out of me as a kid and I wish this book had been around then.The mean-spirited aspect of the book seems to be a hanging point for some people here but I find it a bit refreshing. After all, everyone in the abduction world is deluded and ought to be brought back down to earth where they always have been in the first place. Overall, this is an enlightening and enjoyable read for anyone interested in getting the side of the debate that doesn't get to be on TV."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"Mr. Klass is a popular forerunner of the skeptics in our society regarding the &quot;u.f.o. phenomenon.&quot; In this book, he attepts to express his understanding that human percerption is inherently biased and, therefore, cannot be relied upon for accurate data (with respect to the ufo &quot;abductions&quot;). I think that if you are really interested in the validity of abductees, a thorough understanding of sensation and perception psychology is a necessity. Then, you would be better educated to decide whether there is any credibility to these &quot;abductions.&quot; Mr. Klass makes interesting points in this book which are worthy of your time; however, dismissing testimony of an alleged abductee because she was not attractive does raise serious doubts as to Mr. Klass' priorities and scientific methods. I say, buy a book on psychology instead."},{"Title":"UFO-Abductions : A Dangerous Game","review":"If you are interested in exploring the truth, you won't find it reading this book!

Not only does it offer creative ideas for beginners, it has plenty to suggest for advanced kissers as well. Sure it deals with some kisses that you may have heard of before (like the eskimo kiss and the french kiss) but it treats them in depth so that even experienced kissers will learn something new. (By the way, if you think the eskimo kiss is just for kids you haven't read this book.) The best part of this book, though, is all the great romantic ideas it offers experienced kissers. It's down to earth and practical, like Ovid's THE ART OF LOVE, but devoted all to kissing. Who knew that lip-o-suction could be done in a pulsating action? Who else tells you how men and women respond differently to french kisses? Do you know how to do the Trobriand Islands kiss?

After all, isn't that what a book on kissing is supposed to do?"},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"I've been going out with my boyfriend for 5 months now. Everything has been great but there had been one aspect of the relationship that was creating tensions. He didn't know how to kiss differently...just one way ALL the time. It was gets a little old, and getting to the point where I didn't want to get intimate and kiss. I had to someway ameliorate our relationship before we just ended it. Our five month anniversary was April 6 2000 and I bought him this book, and he laughed. We would hang out alone and try them out. It's improved our relationship 100% and I can't wait to kiss him when we're together! We both realized what we want &quot;physically&quot; out of each other in kissing and such. It was wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"Although people that kiss probably know this things... The book helps you seeing the kiss in another way, it has some interesting thoughts and the good part is the opinion of men and women... I think anyone will find at least something important to know from this book. So if you want to know what the opposite Sex like, then: BUY IT! But if you want to improve your relationship and to make someone feel in love, then I think you should start with books like \\"Light his fire\\" or \\"Light her fire\\" and \\"Then 10 Second Kiss\\". After you read these books, you can come and buy this one. Practice the kisses with your mate, because some of them are hard to do..."},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"How do you turn a complete amateur into a confident kisser? Read this book, that's how. I got it the summer before I started college. I never dreamed I'd have the confidence that a lot of my roommates seemed to have, but after reading this wonderful book I was a different person. I wasn't dreading kissing, I was actually looking forward to it. You learn not only all the different kisses - there are about 35 - but you also learn what the opposite sex likes and dislikes about each one. I'm now happily in a relationship, and my boyfriend tells me I'm the best kisser ever. (I taught him the Trobriand Islands kiss!) My sorority sisters are always borrowing my copy of this book, they get such a kick out of it."},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"Believe it or not I was 22 before I had my first kiss, and I got this book to help me get over my shyness. Omigod did it help! After I read the first twenty-five pages I was like ready to run out and corner this guy I had a crush on and try a biting kiss on him. So it turns out we were at a party and I got the opportunity. Before you know it I'm using the ideas from the book and had my first kiss, did the biting kiss (he loved it), then went for a french kiss (which he complimented me on), and finished off with a vacuum kiss. Needless to say the book helped me. If you love to kiss, you owe it to yourself to get *this* book. It worked for me, and then some!"},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"This is one of the most romantic books ever written"},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"If you want to know anything about kissing this is the book for you.

Whether it be a first kiss with a new lover or a kiss from your spouse of many years, kissing is one of the most sensual ways to express your feelings. William Cane's 'The Art of Kissing' explains many different types of kisses in depth, giving views from many men and women from a survey taken on the internet. It is truly a wonderful book to have around. A variation in a kiss can truly add a spark to an already wonderful relationship."},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"Go with a winner. This is hands down the best book on kissing. I'm no neophyte when it comes to kissing, but I bought this book because it's got tons of helpful info for advanced kissers: how to kiss the ear, the neck, the arms; how to use the tongue, the teeth, the lips; how to kiss for a long time, how to vary your technique, how to be a better kisser. Plus it's well written and full of helpful quotes from guys and gals on what they like.

I had a chance to read through the book and found it not to be what I was wanting, but for her it would do. I thought it was supposed to be about the art of kissing. I am still on a mission to find a book that is completely about ways to kiss. Now don't get me wrong this book has some tips on kissing, but this only accounts for a very small partial amount of the book."},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"This book is not for anyone who is over 15.

I read this book because I was actually unaware of the actual mechanics of a kiss in regard to pressure and suction.Giving my inexperience, I feel I should have been able to get some new information from this book, but I was unable to learn anything from it, with the exception of the electric kiss. I was dissapointed because it seemed like the kisses were ordinary, common sense, and simple, the kinds you have seen in movies a million times, and descibed with a level of ambiguity that gives me the impression the author has not tired some of these kisses himself. The author also seems rather prudish (even by my standards) when he questions wether one should kiss on the first date.All in all this was a very dissapointing book."},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"How to,when to,and where to are common questions you ask yourself during the couse of a hook up or a deeply intimate relationship.Why?Well, for one, the obsession of what every body elae thinks.Their opinions shouldn't be a problem, but if they do arise here are some easy steps to follow: Step 1:Pay good attention to your girlfriend or the person you would like to kiss.

He wrote this book, he also made an awful DVD also called \\"The Art of Kissing\\". First, William Cane's persona is based on Woody Allen. He's no Woody Allen! He even goes into this whole thing about being very uncomfortable out in nature, just typical Woody stuff. But Woody is funny and original and this guy is not. The DVD also features a cast who repeat the same thing that every one of the other cast members say, but in different scenes and as if it's just something off the top of their heads. Like one girl says that one of her boyfriends kissed her mechanically. Then in another scene, this lame guy says something like, \\"This one girl, she kept on kissing me, what's the word, um, mechanically.\\" This DVD was the worst veiwing experience I've ever had, it was such an embarrassing, painful mess. It tried to be funny but failed miserably. Some of the actors are decent, maybe they'll go on to better things. On to the book, it's not good. It has some useful information, you could do worse than to buy this book if you're new to kissing. But there are better books out there. Oh, yeah, and I've heard that this guy does mini-seminars in colleges and that they're awful and awkward."},{"Title":"The Art of Kissing","review":"I thought that this book is gonna be so helpful and interesting,,but nope,,not at all..it is so dump and boring,,Im so dissappointed,,,I cant beleive I wasted money on that,,Im sure gonna return this stupid book as soon as I can."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"I don't know what these other two reviewers are talking about. I was raised Lutheran until high school and studied the Reformation in college. And I think to date this is my favorite treatment of Luther. Nestingen successfully covers the life of Luther, both is personal and public life and paints him in a likeable but realistic light. He pulls together mounds of scholarly info into a very brief account drawing light on things I'd never even heard of before. As for the typeset and the format of the book itself, I work in publishing and I think its fine, even cool! This new way of putting flaps on the paperback cover is different but easily allows you to mark your place in the book. I got used to it quickly. The photos in the book from movie stills add a lot both to the cover and the feel of the book. View a copy yourself before believing these other two reviews!"},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"James Nestingen graduated from of Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota in 1967, earned a master of divinity degree from Luther Seminary in 1971, and the master of theology degree in 1978. In 1984, He received his doctorate in theology from St. Michael's College, University of Toronto.Following his ordination in 1971, he served as a parish pastor for two congregations. In 1980, Nestingen returned to Luther Seminary as a professor of church history. Today, he is part of a renewal movement with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, trying to return his church body to its confessional roots.At first look, Nestingen's book appears as nothing special: the book is cheaply bound and the print is too small. However, do not let such dissatisfiers dissuade you from reading this book. Like some other recent Martin Luther biographies, Nestingen tries to get the reader to understand the man Luther and his theology. Nestingen mostly succeeds. If I can say anything negative about this book, it is this: it is too short to flesh out his thoughts and put Luther more in context within his medieval, historical surroundings.Luther: a Life takes more dedication to read than, perhaps, what is considered (and rightly so) the current-day standard of Luther biographies: Kittleson's Luther the Reformer. Nestingen delves more deeply into Luther's mind and theology, yet skimps on covering some historical events that were simultaneously taking place. Although Nestingen's theological explanations are needed to understand Luther, they are never discussions merely to impress, or are they off-putting. However, Nestingen puts the reader in the precarious position of filling the depth, shadows, and color of much of what takes place in Luther's life.Starting chronologically, Nestingen glosses over Luther's early life and does not slow down to delve deeper until Luther becomes a monk. But as he digs deeper, one begins to see the rich deposits stored in Luther's mind that Nestingen brings to light. Nestingen describes the Christian life as \\"a dance of dying to Christ in the crucifixions of everyday life to be raised with him to newness of life--life in faith\\" (pg. 23). The very next page, Nestingen proclaims the purpose of preaching within the Church: \\"[it is] not merely to communicate information or to appeal to people's wills, but actually to give the gifts and benefits of Christ Jesus.\\" Oh, what joy to read from a man who truly understands Luther!But Luther the man and theologian is not one so easily grasped. Nonetheless, Nestingen in short order opens a door to a way of thinking that we living in the 21st century do not naturally have: we contend for the \\"golden mean\\" or the ideal, middle ground. Yet, Luther worked within a dialectical world--a world of seeming opposites. Nestingen writes, \\"Truth comes out of the dialectic, that is, from the way in which two extremes butt up against one another to limit or to establish each other\\" (pg. 35). Luther \\"is paradoxical, so that it often seems as though he is contradicting himself, saying one thing in one situation, something completely different in another\\" (pg. 36).On Luther's \\"Gospel discovery,\\" his \\"tower experience,\\" I agree with Nestingen (and Lohse) that it probably coincided with his name change from Luder the Luther, \\"a small change based on the Greek word for freedom, elutherius. I see the similarity as too exceptional simply to explain Luther's name change as merely a respelling from Low/Middle German to High German.As Luther aged and chaos began to rule in much of Germany, Nestingen brings out more than other biographies the strain it took on Luther and Melanchthon's friendship. Nestingen also revisits that strain renewed in their theological differences well into 1530s and 40s (pgs 92-93). In addition, Nestingen uses enough pages to show clearly what was at stake in the debate between Erasmus and Luther on human free will. I found his treatment of the Peasants' War especially balanced; he shows Luther's efforts of trying to bring peace and order, but how poor timing and excessive blustering brought his efforts to nothing (pgs. 57-58).Chapter 6, \\"Luther at Home: Refuge from Chaos,\\" shows Luther the family man, focusing on the relationship between Luther and Katie. If it were not for Katie, Luther would probably have given everything away. Katie was a strong and astute household manager, and perhaps, at times, proud. But Luther and Katie loved each other dearly. Luther's letter to Katy on February 10, 1546 had me cackling with laughter at the banter they shared as husband and wife.When Emperor Charles V commanded the Lutheran princes to explain their beliefs, Nestingen gets under the surface and shows what took place for the Augsburg Confession to become a reality. \\"Consulting the Marburg Colloquy, [Melanchthon] edited the Schwabach Articles. . . . He then added three articles of his own . . . [and] finished the work on liturgical matters begun at Torgau\\" (pg. 85). Eventually, he even shows how the Emperor's reluctance to tolerate the Lutheran churches led to the eventual state-churches in Europe.Martin Luther: a Life shows well the chaos that the Reformation had wrought by the late 1530s. \\"Luther's old friend Agricola had turned on him and left town. The Swiss were blocking an agreement on the sacrament [of the Lord's Supper]. He had given up on councils . . . the emperor was poised to make good on his threats\\" (pg 100). By 1545, Luther was so tired of his fellow Wittenbergers' moral laxity and abuse of the Gospel that he, in effect, went on strike.Martin Luther: a Life is an admirable book, primarily weakened because its length is too short to do full justice to the sweep of Nestingen's look into Luther's life. If the book had more supplementary information to paint a fuller palette--and had a proper binding and text size!--this book could surely supplant Kittleson's as the biography of Luther to read."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"I grudgingly went to see the Martin Luther movie with some friends, but the film piqued my curiosity. This book not only answered all my questions, but I found it a fun and easy read. There are other books out there on Martin Luther, but this one is the best. Nestingen has written a book that manages to be not only informative, but amusing. Finally, considering Luther's revolutionary role in church history, this book is a must-have for anyone who identifies themselves as a Christian."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"This book is a major disappointment.The author, a seminary professor, can't help but reflect that perspective, and writes with a somewhat irritating style of condescension toward various views of Luther. He doesn't really say anything new, and he seems inclined to advocate a more left-wing/liberal view of Luther. The book has just enough scholar-speak and &quot;technical biography&quot; style to make it not a very reader friendly book.To add insult to injury the book is printed in very small, low resolution type, slapped into a strange paperback cover and printed in such a manner that you have to nearly break it in half to read it, the words run into the middle of the book.I did not like this book, feel there are many others (even from the same publisher!) that do much better job.The pictures from the movie are nice, but they are just stuffed into the center of the book.The much better book is Luther: Biography of a Reformer, it is beautifully published, better content, easier to follow."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"I really love the new movie out about Martin Luther, so I've been trying to buy any book done to go along with the movie. I've found this one and the one from Concordia Publishing House called &quot;Luther Biography of a Reformer.&quot; No comparison! The Concordia book is a hardback and is clear, to the point, easy to read and even easy on the eyes. This book seemed to be slapped together, both in terms of the writing and the way they made this book. I am surprised by this, but it sure is too bad. The print in the book is hard to read, the binding is so tight it is hard to read the book. The photos from the movies are nice, but each one is cluttered up with the same information for each picture.The other book, from the Concordia Publisher, doesn't have all this clutter with their picture, and they have more pictures too.If you want a good book to go along with the new movie out on Martin Luther, this isn't it. Augsburg Fortress Publisher puts out great books on Luther, but this isn't one of them!Not worth the money, for sure. Don't bother with it."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"I loved this book! It brought to life the amazing events in Luther's life and also beautifully treats the theological and political issues of the Reformation and Luther's life. I truly don't know what book some of these others were reading who rated this book a one star. I'm not so sure they even read it. Nestingen is solid in his scholarship and in no way one sided in his approach. If you want to understand Luther and the significance of his life, get this book!"},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"I have to agree with the negative reviews posted here. The book &quot;Martin Luther: A Life&quot; was obviously slapped together in a hurry and printed very poorly. You do have to just about break the book in half to read the text, it is printed in small hard to read type, on low quality paper, set very densely together. It almost looks to me like somebody printed this on their home printer! Pictures from the movie are slapped into the middle of the book with no rhyme or reason, and the credits are as large as the picture titles, making them irritating to view.The text of the book is written with a &quot;snippy&quot; attitude of, &quot;Oh, well, yes, Luther and all that, but today we know this that an another thing.&quot; I was expecting better when I ordered this book. I thought, &quot;Oh, come now, the negative reviews can't be right, and I read the positive reviews and thought, this can't be too bad.&quot;WRONG it is a very poor excuse for a book. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"It is surprising how bad this book really is. I have to echo what others have said here. I thought, &quot;Oh, come on, can't be as bad as they said.&quot; It's worse!Pathetic to think a publishing company that is supposed to be Lutheran would put out something this poor. But, as I look at other things that Augsburg-Fortress offers, it is not surprising. They are so into politically correct left-wing theology it is not really a mystery why they would give a book on Luther such short schrift.Bad layout, design, printing, formatting and writing.A real bummer of a book."},{"Title":"Martin Luther: A Life","review":"Slapped together, obviously. Hard to read the print is so small and crammed together. Some egg-head approach to Luther.

So only purchase one."},{"Title":"Aquarium","review":"If you've read Russian literature, you'll know that it's emotionally expressive, very vivid and breathtakingly fascinating. It's not that this book can be compared to literary masterpieces, nor does it attempt to be one - but it certainly follows the tradition in its own way.Of course, Suvorov had great material to begin with, having gone through the Soviet army, Spetznaz and the GRU. The book was bound to be good because of that alone, even if he hadn't written it with such obvious passion. But he has; one of the greatest strengths of the book is that he has managed to capture the feeling of all the institutions and the whole situation so overwhelmingly well. Another is definitely the facts themselves - they are just interesting, not to mention important enough for this book to be required reading for anyone who wants to understand the history of the XXth century.I feel this book is among the best (if not THE best) written on this subject, but the greatest thing about it is something quite simple - you needn't be interested in history to like it. You will anyway."},{"Title":"Aquarium","review":"This book is a true description of how the less known and more dangerous of the two biggest soviet spy agencies - the GRU - operated. They were well trained, highly effective, motivated and ruthless. I'm afraid they did much better during the Cold War than the West's intelligence agencies. And don't think GRU ceased to work in the Yeltsin Russia - these guys, maybe even some of the Suvorov's colleagues described in the book - are still out there, doing their job...I would also recomend another book by the same author - \\"The Liberators\\" - describing in more detail his career in the soviet military before he joined the GRU."},{"Title":"Aquarium","review":"The author, one of several brilliant Soviet military professionals who, learning the truth about the communist system, finally reached the point when they could not continue living &quot;the old way&quot; any more. They chose to defect, hurting the System but helping their Motherland, however paradoxical it may sound.This book reads very well and captivates the reader. It offers valuable insights on the life and training of Soviet officers in armour, Spetznaz and GRU, which the author knows first-hand. It also shows how Soviet spies enlist Western citizens to sell their own countries' secrets. This book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Aquarium","review":"In this book, the author gives the reader his personal impressions as a commanding officer from the Red Army in the 60s and the 70s. Suvorov speaks with pride about the enormous might that would have undoubtfully crashed the Western armies, had it come to an open conflict. &quot;Aquarium&quot; and &quot;The Liberator&quot; (also a must-to-read) provide the general picture of an army that is both mighty and pathetic, strong and weak, a picture very familiar to any Russian man."},{"Title":"Aquarium","review":"Really, to me it is not. After living in the Soviet Union for ... all my life, I can say that what Suvorov writes is too much realistic and pretty easy to believe. I had seen and heared enough of that from real-life tellers before I red Suvorov's books. It is not that I want to add another mistral to the spirit of the cold war. It is a challenge if other nations know who really rules their lives. Suvorov's &quot;Aquarium&quot; gives this sick thought a very good try."},{"Title":"Aquarium","review":"\`Aquarium' by vladimir bogdanovich wich gives an interesting account of the military career of Vladimir Bogdanovich Rezun(born April 20, 1947), better known by the pen name Viktor Suvorov.

By the time I finished my second reading I felt I have the answer to the most important question in everyone's mind about this horrible murder.....WHY?More than once throughtout the book I found myself thinking about Al Pacino's words in the last scene of The Devil's Advocate:\\"Vanity ... definitively my favorite sin.\\"If you are a Peterson trial fan, you must have this book.

It is very investigative and legal in many parts, but, the author does a wonderful job of making Laci Peterson real to the reader and you come away understanding more who Laci was.

She takes a reader through a linear time-line of behavior and documents it with credible sources. Unlike other sensational journalistic accounts of case law I think Crier does a great job of compartmentalizing emotional aspects that are only relevant in an ancillary way but do shed light on intent.I still think that typically juries do the right thing and trust the process, so I think this book is a reliable testament that justice unfolds most of the time. Great book. Well done."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A Deadly Game lives up to Crier's reptuation in the legal and reporting fields and uncovers countless details of the case that even avid followers do not know. We are taken from the first day through and get a behind the scenes perspective from law enforcement's point of view. Plus we hear from witnesses and read reports never covered in the trial or in reporting. This case has fascinated the nation but I think a few have had some sort of doubt about Peterson's guilt due to lack of forensic evidence. This detailed account will put any doubts to rest. Plus, it finally gives readers a hold on who Scott Peterson really is and the approach he took toward life (and women) from where he is coming in his psyche. I found it interesting that he didn't just have \\"affairs\\" as if that wouldn't be bad enough. The truly remarkable thing about his extramarital ramblings is that he approached these relationships as one might do if he was single, with all out gusto. This is a must read for anyone interested in the case."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Now that Judge Delucchi imposed the formal death sentence on Scott Peterson, many intrigued by the case will be looking for books to recap the investigation and trial that led to Peterson receiving the harshest penalty for killing his wife Laci and unborn son Conner. Catherine Crier's A Deadly Game is the most detailed and informative Peterson book out right now. It certainly blows Amber Frey's scant and fluffy book out of the water. Crier's work is 436 pages of text with details from the investigation previously unseen by the media and jury, including a photo section in the back of previously unpublished evidence files. Crier uses her vast resources as a Court TV journalist to provide an important work that will impress even the most devoted Peterson case follower.First Crier covers Peterson's early deceit with other girlfriends that set the stage for the many lies to come, then she plunges into the investigation demonstrating reasons why officer Al Brocchini became suspicious of Scott from the start. Little details that would have been missed by most observers (i.e. the oddly located indentation left in the Peterson bed, pg. 19) were red flags to Brocchini. In the early chapters, I, as the reader, could sense Peterson's assumptions of getting away with the crime crumble before his eyes. Peterson obviously did not anticipate the case taking on a life of its own, with the massive search parties looking for Laci and his house and office being closed to him for a time for investigative purposes. Conversations between Peterson and the investigators are revealed here with some details published for the first time (Scott wanted a receipt for items of his and Laci to be used by search dogs) as well as information considered prejudicial for the jury (one porno site on Scott's laptop was entitled \\"Raping the Teacher\\"). This book focuses on the investigators in the case and clearly shows how their work in the first twenty-four hours were one of the key elements in the ultimate conviction (for example, Scott moved a lot of evidence from his truck and around his house after the initial meeting with Brocchini).The one qualm I have is that there is a lot of repetition in this book, even in the first chapters. I lost count at how many times Crier noted that the dog McKenzie was given to Scott as a present from Laci. It probably could be condensed to a less bulky work and be just, if not more, revealing. Still, this book is rich in information that anyone considering a career in police investigation should read. Catherine Crier knows her stuff."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"WOW!! If you have any interest in this case - you should definitely read this book - it is absolutely riveting!There are tons of things we hadn't even known about - details that didn't come out in the media or in the trial.Reading this book is like watching a compelling thriller with tons of drama, twists and turns, and surprises.........sadly, the fact that it really happened makes the case that much more chilling and tragic.It is truly an examination of a cold-blooded sociopath........and how he used his charm and charisma for evil."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I couldn't put this book down. What I found most intriguing was the way Scott and Jackie and Lee Peterson responded to the growing evidence against him. Instead of being concerned, or scared, all three of them developed this bizarre rage, arrogance and cattiness toward the police and, most distastefully, toward the Rocha family. Though I don't blame Jackie or Lee Peterson for the crimes of their son, this book does shed an interesting light on their own very dysfunctional personalities and how a sociopath could blossom in such an environment. Lee Peterson is a man who muttered \\"F*#K you\\" to Ron Grantski after Scott was sentenced to death. Jackie Peterson referred to Sharon Rocha, in the midst of all this tragedy, as a \\"bi#@h\\". When Scott told his dad he was wrong to have had the affair with Amber while Laci was pregnant, his dad's response was \\"two-thirds of people have affairs,it's no big deal.\\" Really, this is a family primed for a study in total psychological dysfunction. The book offers firm evidence of Scott's guilt (for anyone out there with any lingering doubt) and shows the hard work that went into this investigation. The police were on top of this from the moment Laci went missing and this is refreshing for us, the public,to know. The book was highly readable except for the plethora of typing errors (a rush to print, perhaps?).The one thing I came away not really understanding is Scott's sociopathy. Crier offers some convincing evidence that this mental illness was at work in Scott for many, many years but does not help us to understand how he was able to hide it for so long. How did Laci, who spent so much time with him, not see this? Was Laci not a perceptive person? We just don't know. What we do know is that no one seems to have known Scott Peterson, including his parents who don't seem to know much of anything it turns out."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"There is almost a bombshell per page in this riveting, intelligent, and horrifying book by Court TV legal analyst Catherine Crier, whom I have always found fair-minded, even and measured in her television broadcasts.In the same even-handed way, but with a definite point of view, which she tells us immediately, Crier meticulously lays out the chilling profile of a sociopath and the crime he committed without, seemingly, any guilt or feeling. The author tells us almost from the start that she believes Scott Peterson to be a classic sociopath. And then she simply lets the story tell itself, using reams of material never allowed in court, and never publicized before now.The case, for those of us who followed it from Day One, comes alive again as we follow the detectives from their initial response to an anguised family's phone call (Scott never called the police about his missing wife; he left that to his frantic mother- and father-in-law) to the web of increasingly bizarre and contradictory lies that Scott told with impunity.As becomes obvious in very short order, despite Geragos' claims to the contrary, it was not the police who suspected Scott from Day 1, but rather Scott himself, with his bizarre, flat behavior and endlessly ridiculous lies, who put himself in their faces as the likely suspect. And their meticulous behind-the-scenes fitting of the pieces of the puzzle only strengthened what Scott all but told them from the first.I mentioned above that the book is horrifying; in terms of what a sociopath can do, the lies that come so easily, the complete lack of human feeling or remorse, the intense narcisism that these people display and for which Peterson was the poster boy, is really scary. And of course the crime he committed was completely vile.As for bombshells, those of us riveted to the case didn't know everything. I kept finding myself saying, WHAT? WHAT? I didn't know that! He's so much guiltier than I ever thought!The Rochas come across in the book as more human--yes, Sharon Rocha can use the F word--and more tragic than they ever appeared on television, if such a thing is possible. As for the Petersons, as in Anne Bird's book, they do not fare well. At least not in my opinion. While I have complete sympathy for their own bewilderment and grief, they were scarcely likeable people behind the scenes, particularly Jackie.This book is well-written (although it has its share of grammatical errors and typos; a rush to print?), intelligent, meticulous, and completely mesmerizing. Even if one had lived on another planet and never heard of the Peterson case, it reads like a first-rate True Crime tale, worthy of the best of them. Read it and see!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This is better than the books on this same subject that preceded it, because there is substance. And Catherine takes the readers on a very detailed journey of the investigation, and through the penalty hearing.I chose to read this because I wanted to know what was different from the detailed televised interviews and printed media.The Scott Peterson case represents problems in how many people are too busy living their lives, without being connected enough with others - they have forgotten the importance of earning one another's trust, during each interaction.The deadly game that Scott defined himself by, and everyone in his life bought into, was the ability to disown his emotions and his thoughts in a way that forces others to perceive him as being more of what they lacked.And as the investigation developed, Scott was confronted with parts of himself that he had spent his entire life disowning. His reaction was always to lie, and to try to force his interlocutors to question themselves.When you put a salesperson up against seasoned police detectives the deadly game can no longer be played, because generally speaking, cops are experts in reading everyone who they come into contact with - their careers depend upon this.It was also great to read from this book about many details about Laci Peterson's habits and expectations.For those who still claim that there was no evidence, I invite you to read this book, and be honest about the thoughts that rise up from within yourself.It's easy to actually chart reasons why he is guilty as you read this book."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I bought this book a couple of days ago and could not put it down. There is so much more insight into this horriable crime. That we never seen or heard on the news. If you had doubt about the Horny Basterd (which is how he names himself).You are sure not to now!!! excellent Job Catherine. I still am wondering though how Laci reacted when she found Scott and that other women in bed together. It would have been nice to of had that girls input on Laci's and Scott's reaction so we would know her reaction to Amber Fry if she indeed did know about her and how he reacted did he go after her yell at her or what. What a chilling tell!!!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A Deadly Game is an excellent, in-depth look at one particular sociopathic type. It is detailed and as close to objective as any book thus far on the case and yet written so vividly that it is near impossible to put down.The author's reasoning is solid and backed up by actual transcipts which shed light on the whole case. I came away with a real sense of loss for Laci's family as well as a deeper awareness of how and why Scott could have done it.In all honesty, I was so overwhelmed by all the media hoopla that I didn't even intend to buy this book but I actually read some sections of it while waiting for a friend to purchase another book in a bookstore...by the time, she got through the checkout line, I HAD to buy this book. It was simply that well written.After you finish it, I'd suggest you try reading The Sociopath Next Door. If you do, you'll realize how easily sociopaths fit in to society (most aren't even in jail!) and the information from both books may very well save your life and/or help you identify the next person who could commit such a crime."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Having covered this case from Day One, Catherine Crier has unparalleled insight and sources. Judge Crier expertly weaves forensic evidence, telephone transcripts, and first hand accounts into a riveting tale in no way diminished by the fact that the reader already knows exactly how the trial portion of the case concludes. I could not put this book down.Much of the body of information Crier produces was not or could not be admitted during the court proceeding itself. For the first time one is able to view State of California v. Scott Peterson from the perspective of the investigators, the prosecution, the defense, and the parties themselves. Simultaneously intimate and professional, the book includes never before published photographs, documents, and interviews. I was particularly intrigued by the stunning differences in comportment between Laci's and Scott's families, as well as \\"tidbits\\" gleaned from third party witnesses.For example, well in advance of the murders Scott detailed how he would conceal a dead body by weighting it and dropping it in San Francisco Bay. Laci knew about Scott's infidelities from early in her marriage. And throughout his adult years, Scott had a pattern of leading a double or even triple life filled with fantasy, manipulation, and deception.Whether you are examining the Peterson case vicariously or studiously, this book should be in your library."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"If you were an avid follower of the Peterson trial, this is a must read!

You'll learn never-before-known facts and confirmation of things you always suspected.Absolutely riveting!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I read this book cover to cover. I had found errors even in the first few chapters. Those errors were confusing, such as the age of McKenzie in Scott's affair with Janet. Later, on page 120, the policemen started interviewing Shawn Sibley (Amber's friend) at 11:02. Then on page 124, according to the book, one of the poliecemen switched off the tape recorder at 12:41 PM. Both policemen stretched their legs before continuing their session with Amber Frey. On page 125, one of the policemen said that he was about to start interviewing again at 11:50 AM. HOW WAS THIS POSSIBLE?There are many errors like these, so they made me doubt the credibility of the author and the book. If this is the best book on the case, then I'd better not read any other books about this case at all."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"\\"A Deadly Game (The untold story of the Scott Peterson Investigation) is a must read for all prospective Forensic Psychologists and Psychiatrists.

No surprises. If you hadn't read those 3 books, then the information would be new and worth reading."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation by Catherine Crier provides a comprehensive look at this famous case, but does so in a very easy-reading manner. She starts with the disappearance of Laci Peterson, spends much of the book detailing the extensive investigation, and then ends with the arrest and trial of Scott Peterson.Most Americans are very familiar with the disappearance and murder of Laci Peterson, and there aren't too many of us whose hearts didn't ache for the perky, petite 8-month pregnant Laci with her bright brown eyes and beauty queen smile. When she went missing on Christmas Eve 2002, the police quickly zeroed in on her husband, Scott. His answers didn't add up, his demeanor was odd, and the house seemed to have been sanitized. Also, his story kept changing. Through perseverance and a few lucky breaks, they were able to get enough on Peterson to arrest him and then bring him to trial. The police labeled Peterson a sociopath, and Peterson thought he was intelligent enough that he could outwit law enforcement efforts. He was a \\"pathological liar\\" who \\"lied again and again\\" and \\"showed no guilt or remorse when caught in deceptions, large or small.\\"Little did he realize that the cat and mouse game he was playing with the police was for his life.Despite knowing quite a bit about this case, I still found A Deadly Game interesting.Crier includes a lot of information that did not come out at the trial and didn't always make the news. I didn't realize that homicide is the number one cause of death for pregnant women. Also, it's shocking to read how the family of Scott Peterson covered for Scott, made excuses for him, and did everything they could to protect him. What was especially outrageous is that they set up a private tip-line. When the police called the tip-line with phony information that incriminated their son, they did not forward that information to law enforcement. A Deadly Game also contains lots of photos (many in color), as well as maps, official reports, and pages and pages of evidence.No matter how much you know about this case, after reading A Deadly Game, you'll have a better appreciation of the things that went on behind the scenes."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I followed the Scott Peterson case pretty closely, that is to say, as much as I could stand after becoming immune, for the most part, to the biased views of the so-called journalists covering notorious murder cases. This book does have a lot of new info, starting with the very first page about Peterson's adultery at the beginning of his marriage. I read this book straight through and actually was surprised at how well it was written and how well it was edited considering it is a so-called quickie book. There are a few errors, but a very few, and they don't distract at all from the book. Along with Amber Frey's book and Anne Bird's book, this should complete the story of Scott Peterson, may he relax in peace at his new, tiny home in San Quention."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Although I am a horror aficionado, this book chilled me more than the grossest fictional tale ... because it's true. Catherine Crier brings this true-crime to life using a solid voice, chronological timeline, smooth prose, and an insight that can only from a strong legal and journalistic background.Crier was involved with the investigation from day one, and while admitting that she believed there was something wrong with Scott from the very beginning, her beliefs did not prejudice the telling of the story. I say this because her beliefs tended to follow the public escalation of concern over the behaviors of Scott Peterson during the time his wife was missing.What this book offers above the previous media coverage are events, evidence, conversations, behaviors, and insights that never hit the media circus before or during the trial. If you believed Peterson was guilty before, there will be no doubts left in your mind after reading what went on behind the scenes of his heinous crime and sociopathic actions. Laci's murder was premeditated, as Scott admits in an admissible court record to his girlfriend that \\"he lost his wife\\" while Laci was still alive and awaiting the birth of her baby.This book is a true-life horror story, the protagonist being Scott Peterson, one of the coldest, most soulless personalities I have ever read about in either fiction or non-fiction. The book contains eight pages of color photographs and nineteen pages (in black and white) of evidence submitted to the courts. If you ever had any doubts, I strongly urge you to read this book. While gruesome, it is well written and will keep you up reading long into the wee hours of the morning. Lock your doors. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Catherine Crier has written the best detailed and most interesting account of this tragedy to date. I have followed this story since it broke on Dec.24th 2002. I learned a lot more than I already knew from this book. Absolutely a must have in the Peterson collection of books.I sincerely loved it. It was if I was hearing about the whole story for the first time all over again. Filled with unsuspected suprises, it was well worth every penny and every second of my time. If you buy no other book about Laci and Scott Peterson, you must have this one!!! By far, the most informative, insightful, suprising , captivating read I have experienced. 5 stars to Catherine Crier and many compliments on a job well done!!! You go girl!!!!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Don't read Amber's or Anne's, just read this one, it gives you the full story. A fantastic read, you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I read Amber Frey's book and reviewed it here. I am a big fan of Court Television and a big admirer of Catherine Crier. Scott Peterson case was one of bewilderment. He has a beautiful, loving pregnant wife, Laci at home and an unborn child. Even the hardest criminals would find his crime to be unmerciful and barbaric act of murdering her and their unborn child. Crier and the other author, Cole Thompson, paints a portrait of Scott Peterson as both a sociopath and the boy next door. Crier compares Peterson to Bundy. While Bundy murdered several women and girls, Peterson coldly murdered Laci who could not fight back and their unborn child. Why didn't he just leave? Why do the spouses like Peterson and others think they are going to get away with it? High-powered and expensive attorneys like Mark Geragos can't get you off. This case is not O.J. Simpson, Robert Blake, or Phil Spector. She was killed right before Christmas Eve which even adds to the cruelty of the crime. There were no known physical fights or signs of Peterson's behavior until after his very pregnant wife went missing. Sadly, I don't blame his parents, Lee or Jackie who I think did the best that they could for Scott, or Amber Frey who got caught in the mess but was smart enough to get Scott in her testimony. Scott Peterson comes across as a smoothe, charming, and charismatic man who would by many single women jump at the chance to have somebody like Scott be their partner. I am sure there were female friends of Laci who admired and envied the golden couple. Unfortunately, the story plays a like a Greek tragedy. Scott didn't want Laci or the baby and he didn't want to admit it to anybody. Laci never saw through to Scott and their marriage was more for SCott's appearances. Scott could never love another human being like Laci or their unborn child. Other books written about this case seem endless but Crier and Thompson come across as genuine, fascinating, analytical, and the information is fresher than it was that I remembered watching the case unfold nightly on Larry King Live."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I was familiar with this trial and was even in the courtroom during the Peterson trial. This book was informative and had documents that were not available to the average person. Loved it and found it to follow what I had observed. Catherine has cute hair!!!!!!! She is so professional and smart and I never miss her program or try hard to catch it often."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"It is difficult to fathom what was intended when the hype said \\" The never before told story\\" Excuse ME .... what was never before revealed ? Ms. Crier can't be criticized for cashing in on the notoriety of the case any more than any of the other \\"authors\\" but it was hardly worth the $26 it cost to read her take on the case.It is amazing to me that there are still people (among whom are self proclaimed law experts) who maintain that Peterson was convicted on flimsy, circumstantial evidence. The judge in the case had the ability to lessen the death sentence but instead declared Peterson guilty of such an egregious crime that he should die for it...... and the judge sat through the proceedings and listened to ALL of the evidence. That pretty much says it all !The book was definitely not worth reading in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I fail to find anything of significance that was \\"untold\\". I have found an UNBELIEVABLE amount of grammatical and typographical errors that should have prevented this book from ever making it to the bookstores in the first place. Absolutely the worst quality of publishing I could ever imagine. In addition to the errors, the content is difficult to follow at times. If they didn't take the time to correct grammatical and typographical errors, I question the accuracy of the insignificant \\"untold\\" portions as well. Very dissapointing. She should be embarrassed."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"To begin, I followed the Peterson Trail on Court TV. It was a fascinating glimpse into the trial, evidence arguments and conviction of Scott Peterson. I got closure from the trial. However, my wife bought this book for me as a treat. Some treat! I found this book to be tedious, tiresome, filled with contradictions and containing many typographical errors. Many others who reviewed the book say essentially the same. It seems to me to be a rushed bit of writing, and at times is mind-numbingly boring. In the last 25 pages, I found it almost impossible to want to read any further. But I did slog through to the end.There were a few interesting observations by Crier, a lot of speculation, some unseen evidence and a lot of police photographs. Crier refers to Peterson as a \\"sociopath,\\" which he apparently is.Most of America already knows at least 95% of what the book contains. You decide."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I went into this book with a totally open mind. I, knowing that the author is 100% convinced that Scott killed Laci and Conner, was looking for something which would convince me as well \\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\\" I left this book no more convinced than when I began that Scott is guilty. This book is advertised as having all of this additional information that has never been revealed which would be sure to shed more light on Scott's guilt. Personally, I didn't see it in this book. What I saw, is a woman who is hell bent convinced that Scott is guilty and her agenda is very clear, to convince everyone that she is right. Granted, Scott is clearly a pathological liar but this book did not convince me that he is a murderer. I hope that someone could write a book which would be more convincing of Scott's guilt because if this is the best those who consider him guilty have got, it is scanty proof (at best). Frankly, I don't understand how the jury convicted him if all of the evidence they were presented with has been outlined in this book. I am no proponent of Scott or opponent of Laci & Conner. I, as an attorney myself, tried to go into this book with an open mind. I walked away unconvinced of Scott's guilt. Perhaps if one of the prosecutors or jurors writes a book, I'd feel differently. Laci's family was 100% behind Scott until they found out he was a cheater. Then it was a 180 turnabout. Granted he is a lying cheater, but does that make him a cold blooded murderer. No cause of death was ever determined, no \\"convincing\\" motive, no DNA or other incriminating forensic evidence, no witnesses, no confessions, no \\"real proof.\\" Just hunches. I also have a hard time putting my mind around the fact that EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY person who knew Scott & Laci personally thought they were \\"problem free.\\" Laci's best friends, Laci's family, etc. EVERYONE. Is Scott such a good actor?? Should he have pursued a career in Hollywood instead? Was Laci either that oblivious to her husband's true persona or so dishonest with every single person in her life that she hid the problems of her marriage from EVERYONE?! I find that hard to believe from a person who (as her friends and family admit) could not stop talking (though they say so lovingly). Granted, the defense really never did offer any other VIABLE explanation for what happened to Laci & Conner. Perhaps, Scott is guilty. Perhaps, Scott never anticipated that this case would get the media attention which it had. Perhaps, Scott's false grandiosity convinced him that he'd get away with murder?? I don't know. What I do know, is that THIS book did not leave me more convinced one way or another. It was just a book with a clear agenda to convince society that Scott is guilty without any real evidence."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Crier's book may be unique in the history of literature. While there have been many examples of oxymoronic statements, this may be the first book which, in its entirety, is a contradiction in terms. To quote: -p. 237: Whenever a guest on my program tried to argue that everyone reacts differently to grief and loss, I wondered, then shall we eliminate all the great works of literature that illuminate the contours of universal human behavior? If we give up a belief in basic shared characteristics, motives, and behavior, psychology itself becomes a worthless field of study.Also: -p. 37: Scott's demeanor was an issue from the start of the investigation. His family, attorneys, and a gaggle of television pundits would make their excuses about how we all respond to tragedy and argue that nothing should be read into the young husband's seemingly callous behavior. However, years of observing human nature would lead the experienced detectives to different conclusions. After the interview, Brocchini carefully recorded that Scott appeared \\"casual and nonchalant. . . bored, tired, and devoid of urgency.\\"So this seems to be the basis for her book - that the psychology of Scott Peterson can be deduced by understanding his behavior. One wonders, therefore, why she fills the book with examples showing that he is, while flawed, the very antithesis of the sociopath she claims he is?The next question is should we look at those who knew Scott or those who did not, such as the MPD, Crier et al? Reasonable people would assume those who knew him longest or earliest know him best. Our final question is whether we should look at the views of those people before the MPD and the media blackened his name and reputation or after this was done.Since it is clear that the actions of the MPD were intended to make him look as bad as possible rather than the reverse it seems that we should ascertain the feelings of those who knew him before he was so completely slandered by the media. After all, who among us would want our every secret and failing known universally?Let us therefore look at the views of those who knew him best, before the many mistruths about him were added to his actual personal failings in order to make him the whipping boy for all and grist for the media mill.From Crier's book: -p. xiii. Janet (Ilse) was charmed by this courteous, self-assured young man. ... Scott was especially generous, thoughtfully planning each of their dates, taking her to nice restaurants and lavishing her with intimate presents-a delicate necklace with sparkly green gemstones, a fancy black designer dress. Janet was a vegetarian, and they hadn't been dating long when Scott announced that he had stopped eating meat. ... As Scott began talking of their future together, Janet found herself falling in love.p. 41. (Karen) Servas described her relationship with Scott Peterson as warm and friendly. She and her ten-year-old son were frequently invited to swim in the Petersons' pool; from time to time, Scott helped her with chores and repairs around her house. She described the couple as active and upbeat. They enjoyed entertaining at their home and appeared to have a good relationship. Servas had last seen Laci and Scott on Sunday, the twenty-second, when they told her that their baby was a boy. They were planning to name him Conner.p. 49. The two investigators tried to keep Scott (Peterson) talking. Did the couple have any future plans? Scott said he and Laci (Peterson) intended to move to San Luis Obispo when Conner began school. He wanted to buy an olive ranch. Grogan remarked that Scott seemed very poised in social settings; he must be a very successful salesman. Scott smiled and thanked him, saying it was important to have those skills in the sales business. Did Laci ever embarrass him in social situations? Not at all, Scott replied; she was actually quite helpful.p. 61. Sharon Rocha (Laci Peterson's mother) described Laci as \\"headstrong,\\" noting that her birth sign was Taurus, the bull. This description would be echoed by friends and neighbors after her disappearance: One girlfriend suggested Laci \\"wore the pants\\" in the family, interrupting Scott when he was speaking and directing him to take out the trash in front of company. According to another friend, Laci even followed Scott to the bathroom, where he sometimes retreated from her chatter, and just kept talking to him through the door. ... (Ron) Grantski's (Sharon Rocha's partner) only complaint was about Scott, who he felt did too much around the house. Ron was concerned that Sharon might expect the same from him.p. 62. Katy (Hansen, a previous girlfriend) recalled Scott as very bright, congenial, and courtly, and told the police that he never appeared stressed, even under the intense pressures of college exams. Scott started his senior project two days before the due date, yet bragged that he had aced it with an A. (His college transcripts confirmed the claim.)p. 67. She and Scott discussed fertility tests, but before they could pursue the idea, Laci got the news she'd been waiting for: She was pregnant at last. She was overjoyed, and Scott seemed to share her feelings. Laci's mother recalled watching Scott hurry over to feel Laci's stomach when she said the baby was kicking. He seemed as excited as she was. \\"I assume if he didn't want to have a child, he wouldn't have allowed it to happen,\\" Sharon told investigators.p. 69. Relatives told police that (Laci) even used a wheelchair while visiting Disneyland with Scott's parents and half sister, Anne Bird (It was Scott who pushed her all over Disneyland in the chair) ... In our interview, Anne told me that Laci looked radiant during that trip. She was excited about having the baby and talked a lot about how much she loved her mother, Sharon. Anne first met Laci in March 1998, about seven months after the wedding. She liked her immediately. Laci filled up the room, loved being the center of attention, and rarely let anyone else get a word in edgewise. Like Laci's other girlfriends, Anne agreed that Laci did boss Scott around. And, like those women, Anne wished she had a husband like Scott, who did everything his wife told him with a smile.p. 107. \\"And then that was the last we had talked about it,\\" Sharon explained. Laci's parents thought Laci and Scott had a good marriage. \\"Even when Scott should have been mad at Laci, he wasn't,\\" Ron told the detective. The couple had never separated according to Sharon and Ron, and they spent up to 90 percent of their time together. They shared the same goals, including having a child and buying a larger home. Grogan was taking notes. \\"Neither Sharon nor Ron ever heard Scott or Laci become involved in an argument, raise their voices at each other, or complain about any problems with their relationship,\\" he noted.p. 132. (Amber Frey describing an encounter with Scott) \\"I looked down and there was a single rose that was odd from all of 'em, and I pulled it out and I said, 'What's with this single rose?' and he said, 'Well, you have a candle?' And I said, yeah. He said, 'Can you get the candle?' Sure. So I get the candle, he shuts the light out and lights it and says, 'Well, I, this is all I could think about in San Francisco when I woke up today.' So he cuts the rose, the stem off, and it's just, you know, a short stem at this point with the rose.\\"He started-he starts rubbing the rose on my face and kissing me, and he said that. . . ah, he was just talking about his dream that he had. And then he leaned me up against the wall and was rubbing the rose down my neck and he was saying, 'I don't know how it feels to have a rose rubbed all over me, but this is how I woke up.' His dream, apparently, that he was having. And he unzipped my top that I had on and was kissing me and ah, it was pretty, you know, intense.p. 171. During her childhood, Amy (Rocha, Laci's half sister), Brent (Rocha), and Laci had stayed with their father on weekends. Amy first met Scott while she was in the eighth grade, when Laci was invited to teach Amy's cheerleading squad a new cheer, and she brought Scott along. She and Laci had grown close after Laci returned to Modesto in 2000. Amy described her sister's relationship with her husband as a good one. The two seemed very much in love, she said. She never heard them argue, and Laci had never confided anything negative about Scott to her. She characterized Laci as easily excited, a \\"talker\\" who was often \\"antsy\\" and \\"high energy.\\" Scott, however, was calm and relaxed. He never appeared stressed or ruffled, and always seemed \\"laid-back.\\" Amy also described Laci as \\"a little spoiled.\\" She usually got her way by asking for things nicely, but isn't a brat. \\"She got anything she wanted because Scott tried to give it to her,\\" Amy explained.p. 264. \\"As far as any violence with Scott,\\" Grogan asked, \\"any violent acts that you're aware of as a juvenile or anything?\\"\\"No, absolutely not. I mean, not even as a, not even as a five-year-old or ten-year-old, I never saw him lose his temper,\\" Mark (Peterson, Scott's estranged half brother) said.\\"Never, even as a child?\\"\\"No.\\"pp. 287,288. During the long meeting at headquarters, all four women reported that ... they had viewed Scott as a \\"good, attentive\\" husband. They based their impressions on his willingness to endure some of the \\"small irritations\\" that Laci thrust upon him. The consensus was that Laci was an incessant talker, and that her ceaseless chatter sometimes irritated those around her.The women recalled that once, at a party, Scott had told a friend that Laci's talking was so constant that he sought refuge in the bathroom-only to have Laci follow him to the door and just keep chatting. The women agreed that Laci's constant jabbering didn't dull their affection for her, but they admired Scott for his patience. ... Renee (Tomlinson, friend of Laci) remembered that the previous summer, when Scott was out of town, she was at the house when he called to speak with Laci. Renee overheard Laci asking him about the status of their health insurance, since she was in the first stages of her pregnancy. When Laci learned that the insurance wasn't active, she accused Scott of not caring about her and the baby. For weeks after the phone confrontation, Laci had expressed frustration oven her husband's failure to take care of the insurance issue. It was the only time that Renee recalled her being truly upset with her husband.The women also agreed, however, that Laci regularly ordered her husband around in front of her friends, telling him to take out the garbage, change a CD on the stereo, and perform other jobs around the house ... the women all thought it was \\"so cool\\" that-Laci was able to give Scott directions without him getting angry.pp. 290,291 Stacey Boyers (friend of Laci) told Buehler that when she found out that her own boyfriend, Brian Argain, was cheating on her, both Scott and Laci were very supportive throughout their breakup. Marie (Rocha, Laci's aunt) also told the detective that her niece could be headstrong at times. Laci often talked about babies, and \\"If Laci wanted to have a baby, she would have a baby whether Scott wanted one or not,\\" she said. Marie described Laci as a loving and kind person, but also stubborn and accustomed to getting her way. Yet she was \\"totally in love with Scott\\" and never said a derogatory word about her husband.pp. 322,323. Anne (Bird) recalled that Scott and Laci seemed \\"very happy\\" during the family's Thanksgiving trip. Scott had even rented Laci a wheelchair so that he could wheel his pregnant wife around Disney's California Adventure Park and \\"pamper her.\\" Anne didn't think Laci needed the wheelchair, but she went along with it to humor Scott. Scott told police he had rented it \\"to cut down on the amount of walking\\" she had to do. The young couple appeared to get along well, and Scott seemed excited over his impending fatherhood. During the trip, he carried Anne's six-month-old son in a car seat. He even comforted him one night at dinner and managed to stop his crying, Anne recalled.p. 356. Heather (Richardson, Laci's maid of honor) also recalled an argument between Scott and Laci after Scott's graduation from Cal Poly. She and Mike had attended a celebratory dinner with the couple afterward. Heather could tell that Laci was upset. When they left the restaurant, everyone drove to the house Scott was sharing with his three roommates. Laci and Scott went into the bathroom. Heather overheard her yelling at him. Scott did not respond.\\"It sounded like he was just taking it,\\" Heather saidp. 425. In addition to Scott's family members, myriad individuals offered anecdotes about Scott: his high school coach, a Cal Poly professor, his former boss at the restaurant where he worked in San Luis Obispo. Not one of them could imagine Scott committing these crimes.\\"I can't reconcile the accusations with the person I've known,\\" one said. \\"The Scott Peterson I know is the kind of person you respect and admire,\\" said another. \\"He is the absolutely last person I would ever think would be suspected for something like this,\\" offered a third. Such sentiments were heard over and over, as thirty-nine people took the stand.This is not the description of a sociopath. In fact, it is the description of the exact opposite, a sociophile. It seems, therefore, that Crier's psychological diagnostic skills are sorely lacking, and that most ordinary men and women on the street are more perceptive than she. As for Scott being a narcissist, if he was he was no more so than his wife, Laci, who was known to walk around Modesto wearing $70,000 worth of jewelry - and was warned not to. Whatever his psychological profile, there is not a hint of violence or criminality in it.What is most disturbing about this book, however, is the extraordinary bias against Scott Peterson. You would imagine that a former prosecutor and judge would be able to analyze the actual evidence presented in court and give the reader a clear and analytical summation, weighing each piece carefully. Instead we get some of the most twisted and distorted thinking I have ever seen in which she takes every item and, often ignoring simple and obvious explanations, comes up with laughably ludicrous \`theories'. The whole book it littered with \`I think' and \`I believe' and \`I wondered why' preceding some very hyperbolic logic. Possibly Crier doesn't think well, certainly her views, expressed at the top of this comment, would make Procrustes proud. Her notion that we are all psychologically identical is plainly false. Even if one can excuse her minimal psychological skills, her poor performance in legal analysis is stunning and somewhat frightening considering the puffs on the back of the book. I am inclined to wonder if those who are quoted actually read the book.If you are looking for a book to reinforce the view of Scott Peterson force-fed to the public by the media this is probably the best of them. At least it contains only one photo of the author, and that on the dust cover, plus it contains a lot of material that the others do not have. Also, it is not padded out with large white margins and many blank pages as many of the others are. If, however, you want a book offering a balanced treatment of this case you will not find one. Once again it is the blogs and forums on the Internet, such as those by Marlene Newell, CrimeNews2000, and Huck (fratpack) that have proved most valuable, often proving that the testimony offered in court was at best misleading, and at worst false. Other books on the crime have been extremely disappointing and the movie, sadly, repeated much of the early misinformation spread to discredit Scott and later proven to be false, often by the police themselves while under oath.So buy this book and read it with caution. It is far from a balanced view of this horrid crime and its aftermath."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Catherine Crier is a TV show host. She was the youngest elected state judge in Texas. Why was there so much interest in this murder case (\`Introduction')? Homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant women, usually by the father of her child. \\"It was a slow news day\\" (p.ix). Crier had her doubts because Scott wasn't emotional (p.x). [And if he had been very emotional?] Was he \\"insincere\\"? Do successful CEOs have \\"sociopathic tendencies\\" (p.xi)? Was Crier's early suspicions due to bias or hate? The \`Prologue' shows a side of Scott Peterson in college. On 12/24/2002 Laci Peterson was reported missing (p.2). [Did their dog bark during this time?] Laci's purse with wallet and keys were in her closet.Scott's behavior seemed suspicious to the police (p.11). They called a Homicide detective to investigate. There were no reports of marital problems, no sign of an intruder in the house. A neighbor heard a dog barking at 10:30 AM that morning. Scott had \\"inconsistencies\\" (p.42). Chapter 3 tells about Scott and Laci's lives. Did they have money problems (p.70)? Was Laci seen with two men around 10:45 (p.74)? Who burglarized a neighbor's home (p.79)? Did Laci leave her home in a vehicle (p.81)? Scott did not want to appear on TV (p.85). [Would someone recognize him?] Who were those three men at the burglarized home (p.99)? A woman named Amber Frey called the police (Chapter 6). The six detectives on the Peterson case were handling 34 other homicides (Chapter 8). Scott could really spin tales about himself (p.150). Scott made a cement anchor (p.159). He denied having affairs (p.160). His parents believed him (p.164).Laci's relatives did not suspect Scott (Chapter 9). Scott was always calm and quiet, never upset or angry (p.193). His unemotional state was normal to those who knew him. The police monitored Scott's activities and telephone calls. Nothing incriminating was found, except Scott could tell self-serving stories. The families on both sides stood by him (p.225). Scott's relatives learned about Amber (Chapter 13). Laci's mother and sister had doubts about Scott (p.275). A Congressman took a polygraph after the disappearance of an aide but it was useless to prove his innocence (p.300)! Chapters 9 to 15 cover the events in January 2003. These seem like padding to fill up the 480 pages of this book. This book has too many pages and lacks a chapter with a time line for December 23 and 24 showing what the prosecution charged and what the defense claimed. That is more important than the chapters that are filled with wiretaps.Chapter 16 tells why Scott was the prime suspect in spite of an \\"absence of evidence\\" (p.302). Scott's character made him a suspect. Eyewitness testimony \\"is not always reliable\\" (p.308). Was Crier biased about that cell phone call (p.310)? The toxicology exam of Laci's remains showed no poisons (p.319). That hair in the needle-nosed pliers could not be matched to Laci (p.327). The body of a baby was found near Richmond (p.333), then the body of an adult female (p.334). [This is north of Berkeley where Scott went fishing.] Scott was arrested for murder (p.347). Was he convicted in the court of public opinion (p.358)? Nancy Grace gave her opinions (p.360). The Preliminary Hearing was a huge media event (Chapter 18). The prosecution had no DNA, no confession, little crime scene forensics (p.366). [Was Crier biased over that pool (p.369)?] The trial attracted much attention (Chapter 19). Did Scott's adultery and deceit convict him of murder (p.391)? The bodies found in San Francisco Bay was critical for the jurors (p.401). \\"The Penalty Phase\\" is the last chapter. Those who knew Scott could not imagine him guilty (p.425). Some who were close never testified (p.427). Scott remained cold and impassive after the death sentence (p.428).I thought this book was way too long in covering the events of January. About 320 pages would make a faster read."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I was looking forward to reading this, but was very disappointed. There is nothing new, and Catherine Crier needs to think a little before writing all this crap. She repeats the same things over and over, and goes back and forth during the entire book, from her point he was quilty from the start and she turns everything around to make her look good in saying I told you he was guilty."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"If you followed the Peterson trial there isn't a lot in this book that will be new to you.

Fast & enjoyable read, a must for anyone who is familiar with this case."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I was very disappointed in this book -- unfortunately I paid the full $30 for it while on vacation -- and have regretted it ever since. There was really not much new in it that we did not already know from Court TV's reporting during the trial. I too found many typographical errors and errors in timelines that would have been caught with a careful reading by a good (or even fair) editor/proofreader. I also didn't feel that the photographic evidence and photos were very well outlined. Many of them had vague statements under them and were never really referred to in the book. I put it down feeling disappointed as I had expected more information and explanation."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"There is not a lot that is new in this book, but it makes an interesting chronicle for anyone who can't get enough of the Peterson case. I do wish that the writer (isn't she a lawyer?) would stick to the evidence and keep her personal opinions out of her writing, however. As a former debater myself, I was a little disturbed (and a lot annoyed) by the writer's opining as she labelled Scott a sociopath. Or, is the writer also a psychiatrist? Still, the book is an interesting over-view of the case and the investigation leading up to the conviction."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I didn't watch every day of coverage on court tv. I did follow the case fairly close though because my own son was born shortly before Laci and Connor went missing and I could only imagine how Sharon felt and was truly puzzled by Scott's lack of reaction as the case played out. First let me say that I do like Catherine Crier's show. I bought this book because she has a quality show and I really expected this book to be deeper than it was. I almost returned it to the bookstore after the first two chapters. I was bored stiff because there was just nothing new there. I am not generally one to put a book down unfinished so I persisted. I'm glad I did. It did get a little better. I did find some of the recordings between Scott and his parents interesting. I will say that she organized her book in a chronological order of events and conversations which really highlighted Scott's lies and built the case against him. I believe Catherine was as factual in her book as she could be. Ultimately I agree with one of the jurors, Scott was convicted because of his own actions after Laci went missing. Not once did he act like a truly grieving, expecting his wife to return, husband and father-to-be. You could actually get more information about Scott and Laci from the website claiming that Scott is innocent than you get in Catherine's book. (Although it is beyond me how the lady that put that site together is still convinced that he is innocent!) I believe that I will return this book because I doubt I'll read it again. Read it, but check it out from the library."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I just read 'A Deadly Game' and I enjoyed it very much. I, of course, was aware of Scott and Laci Peterson, but not 'obsessed' with them, All in all it was very sad what Scott did to Laci...Reading this book, it gave me the answer to the 'WHY' Scott did what he did, plus it answered all the question I had about them. I did not think for a minute that Scott murdered Laci to be Amber Frey. That was just to far fetched...This book is very well written and very easy to understand. If you have any questions about this murder... this book will answer them.. I think it is a must read..."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I have followed the Laci Peterson case since her disappearance was first made public in December 2002. Like millions of others, I was captivated by this story, by Laci and baby Conner, by her parents Sharon Rocha and Ron Granski - I very much personalized this tragedy, largely I'm sure because I have a family member who was Laci's age at the time, who looks very much like Laci and had just had a baby boy a few months prior to Laci's disappearance. I read every article, watched every news show and interview with any and everyone connected to this case, I watched every press conference given regarding this case and was glued to CourtTV during Scott Peterson's trial. I thought I knew as much as anyone not directly involved in the case - and then I read Catherine Crier's book, \\"A Deady Game\\". The book is so well written, so informative and provides even those of us who thought we knew so much with SO much more. Ms. Crier lays out a time-line that is not only easy to follow, but answers any lingering questions one might have about this case and about Scott Peterson's guilt. The amount of never before published evidence was truly amazing and it is very evident that an enormous amount of time, research and thought went into the writing of this amazing book. While I'm not usually a non-fiction reader, I was absolutely spellbound by Ms. Crier's book and I literally could not and did not put it down until I had read it cover to cover. And then I read it again. She goes to great lengths to explain the rules of law and evidence in such a way that those not intimately familiar with the workings of the legal system can easily understand the investigative process, how the prosecution put their case together and how a conviction was inevitable despite this being a largely circumstantial case. I have read many other books on the Laci Peterson case and Catherine Crier's book is far and away the best, the most informative and the most conclusive and all encompassing of them all. The never before seen photos were very telling and some quite sad, the never before seen or heard transcripts of phone conversations between Scott and his parents, specifically his mother, were both utterly shocking and mesmerizing. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Catherine Crier shows again why she has had such an amazing career both as a judge and a journalist and anyone with an interest in the Laci Peterson / Scott Peterson case should absolutely read this book!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"\\"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story Of The Scott Peterson Investigation,\\" by multi-talented former judge/news reporter/turned writer, Catherine Crier, is a well-researched, well-written, look inside the \\"real-life\\" of Scott Peterson...\\"the man\\" ...the \\"monster.\\"Crier breaks the legal mumbo-jumbo down in \\"layman terms,\\" so it is easy to understand.Inside the courtroom coverage and a look behind the courtroom scenes make this book an exciting page-turner to be sure.BRAVA Ms. Crier on a job well-done!If you are a person who enjoys books of this intriguing genre then you should order your copy of, \\"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story Of The Scott Peterson Investigation from Amazon.com, today!

Having said that, the one thing this book has going for it, that makes it even worth a read, is the legal nook and cranny approach the author took to present little known or never made known facts of the case.To bad most cases do not make the news either because the victims are poor, not pretty, middle class/wealthy, or have the media machine behind them to keep them in the news."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Although Catherine Crier did an excellent job with the chronological analysis of Laci Peterson's disappearance and the police investigation, I did find some glaring errors. The first error I noticed was when Crier was explaining the background of Laci's parents, she states that Dennis Rocha left Laci's mother, when actually the opposite is true. Sharon Rocha, in her book FOR LACI, explains that that she thought she married too young and she wanted more out of life, having left college before she really even had a chance to finish her degree.I also thought the book could have benefitted from endnotes or footnotes with documentation of what she was saying. I looked through the book carefully two or three times, before I posted this review on Amazon.com to make sure I had not missed such documentation. There isn't any. While the conversations between Scott and Amber Frey may have been on transcripts that were released in court, there are other things Crier probably could have documented.That said, however, I thought Crier did an excellent job of balancing the reactions of the families (Laci's family vs. Peterson family) to the disappearance of Laci Peterson, with the factual portrayal of what the law enforcement officials went through when investigating this case. Crier did an outstanding job of portraying the callous, completely selfish and sociopathic personality of Scott Peterson. Her portrayal really brings Scott to life and makes us wonder how Laci Peterson and her family could have missed all the signs that Peterson was really so dangerous."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This is a terrific book to read.

It was very well written and an easy read. What I enjoyed most about the book was we got a real good insight on what kind of person Laci was, as well as all the people involved. The media has \\"told\\" us who she was, but this book brings it to a new level. At points, I got goose bumps reading some of the details after finding Laci's body. All in all it was a really good book. The only thing that I disliked about this book was there was a little too much dialog, which could of been left out, imo. I read Ann Byrd's book, as well as Amber's and both seemed just thrown together for mere profit. Catherine Crier's book was not thrown together. It was highly researched, and gives us info the \\"average\\" person who have followed this case on a regular basis, would not know."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Who is Cole Thompson? Does anyone know?In any event, the book is very interesting. I couldn't put it down. I read about half of it before I even purchased it. It is a fast read as I am, along with many other people, familiar with the case. I also read \\"Blood Brother\\", the book written by Scott's sister, Anne Bird. That book was excellent and more intimate as Scott lived with Anne after Laci's murder and revealed himself to her in a most incriminating way.What is most amazing about both books is the mountains of circumstancial evidence that they have piled up showing that Scott murdered his wife and unborn son. The mountains of circumstantial evidence are overwhelming. It is impossible to even imagine a scenario in which all of this circumstantial evidence could point to Scott not being the murderer. In terms of probability, the probability that Scott is the murderer would work out to something like 9,999 chances in 10,000. There is far more evidence than one will find in most convictions.I am not a big believer in circumstantial evidence. However, in this case the evidence is overwhelming. In addition, the case is not based on eyewitness testimony which is some of the worst evidence used to convict persons. This, in itself, is a plus.The picture that emerges of Scott in both books is that of a classic sociopath. However, that does not make him a murderer. It just explains his lack of remorse. Interestingly enough, some big time CEOs and CFOs are sociopaths. Again they do not have ordinary remorse for the damage that they do when they steal from or destroy the Company that they lead."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This book was excellent.

It had a lot of information that I had never heard before, and I followed the case very closely. If you don't already think Scott is guilty, you will after reading this book."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I was SO excited to read this book before it was even released. Once it was available for purchase, I snapped it up and began reading but was so thrown off by the terrible editing of the book that I was actually distracted the entire way through! I kept wondering, \\"Were they so desperate to get this book out FAST that they couldn't take the extra time to have it properly edited?\\" Never have I had an experience like this before when reading a book! Most of the content (when I was able to focus) was good, but I hope that Catherine Crier finds another editor for any future books."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I don't know what else there could be to know about this case than what's in this comprehensive true crime book. Put together from a raft of documents and interviews, many never before published, you get a good sense of how and why Scott Peterson killed his pregnant wife, a better sense than from tv coverage during the trial. Was the crime over-covered? Yes. Could I put this book down? No."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I've read all the book about The Scot Peterson case and I have to say it book was the best out of all of them. It was very well written and not only supplied information that was not discussed in the other books nor in the trial, but all included pictures of the Petersons house, your really get a sense that you knew Laci Peterson, from pictures of her cookbooks to Conner's room. Great True Crime Book!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Catherine Crier sure did a fabulous job on this book. It amazes me that someone with her schedule would have the time to do it. I was intrigued by all the info that was not available to the pubic or brought out in trial. I could hardly put the book down. I found it extremely interesting to learn more about the individual personalities of the Peterson's, Rocha's, etc., which were also not brought out in public. I was in favor of the death penalty, but reading about Catherine Crier's reasons for being against it made me think twice. She made perfect sense for more than religious reasons. The only criticism I have of the book is the number of typos and words omitted. Other than that, it was awesome. Keep 'em coming Catherine. Great job."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I liked this book. It confirmed my feelings about Scott and presented some information that I did not know. This book does get a little bogged down with details, expecially in the middle, but keep on reading to the end. It's worth it."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I ORDERED THIS BOOK: THE DEADLY GAME BY CATHERINE CRIER. I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRICE. I WAS GOING TO BUY THIS BOOK IN A BOOK STORE AND WAS VERY EXSPENSIVE. I COULD NOT AFFORD THIS BOOK. UNTIL I WENT ON LINE WITH AMAZON.COM. I ORDERED THIS BOOK AND CAME VERY FAST AND SHIPPING AND HANDLING VERY INEXPENSIVE."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I was very caught up in this case. I thought this book was very good. I couldn't put it down, and read it in 3 days."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Excellent and comprehensive review of facts and evidence in this case. A must read for anyone who has followed the case."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Catherine crier did a beautiful job of researching and writing this story. It was factual, it was interesting and informative.Well-worth reading!!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I followed the Peterson case on Court TV daily. At first I thought that Peterson was not guilty and had been framed by the Medesto Police Department and that they did very sloppy work. After reading the book, I found out that the Police did very good work that was never told in court. I was a little disapointed that the book came out before the sentencing phase. I was also disapointed that they did not prosecute Peterson's mother, whom after reading the book, was definitely a co-conspiritor. Now I can not wait to read the book by Peterson's step sister."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Catherine Crier is right on the money with the trail of the 2000's. Check it out. Very interesting stuff."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"The book is a very good read. However, some of the perspectives of the the author, Catherine Crier, are very biased. Here's one statement, which concludes my argument. She states that Scott Peterson should have known which jewelry Laci was wearing the day she went missing. This is obscure to me. On any given day, you can call my husband and ask him what jewelry I am wearing. I will bet you he has no idea. Does this make him a murderer? There are other similar statements throghout the book, which are just as ambiguous.There is no doubt in my mind that Scott murdered his wife, but her perspective is based on circumstancial data only. Because of this, our judicial system scares me."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"The book was very informative. You don't need to be a shrink to determine that Scott is a whackjob(sociopath). Blame his mommy and daddy, especially the former who spoiled her son, and appears to have her own psycho problems.Scott would have walked free IF he had kept his mouth shut, acted like a normal human being, and buried the bodies in the earth, not a body of water. Fortunately, he did neither and convicted himself with his abnormal behavior, lack of true emotion(only crying for Scott), etc.Even with all the circumstantial evidence against him, Scott would have probably walked free or a mistrial, IF two of the jurors hadn't been removed by the judge. They were as whacky as Scott, especially juror# 5 who made the media circuit after his removal from the jury, proclaiming Scott was innocent in his \\"book\\". Naturally the media gave him his 15 minutes of \\"fame\\".This was a no brainer verdict for any juror, since Laci & Conner's bodies washed up at Scott's alibi location. Scott thunk he was smarter than everyone else, but forgot that a human body eventually rises from any watery grave.Scott's infamous lawyer used the typical defense strategy of some other dude or dudette done it, and blame the cops for a rush to judgement, bungling the investigation of the crime. Scott's ego and arrogance was only surpassed by his attorney, who should have been disbarred for his shananigans(his boat copy with a dummy inside was malignant dumb lawyering and way beyond tacky tactics). This backfired when the fake boat became a shrine for Laci & Conner.My only complaint about the book was that it fell apart at the binder cause of the colored picture pages that were much heavier grain of paper than the rest of pages in the book."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This gave me incredible insite into Scott Peterson and the trial. Catherine Crier is an excellent Court Tv analyst and this book was expertly written. If you want to know anything and everything about this trial, this is book. Don't waste you money and the books by Amber Frey and Anne Bird. The do nothing but show you what idiots they are."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This is my third book on this subject and Catherine Cryer covered it better than the other two put together. If you are really a True Crime fan and want the facts and not a lot of personal opinions, buy and read this book. There are facts in this book that never made it to the court room. Just because of who Ms. Crier is, she had friendly access to many more sources of information than any other author could possibly have. The book is written in an easy to follow manner with great attention to detail. This book was not thrown together over a weekend. If you are really interested in the facts and not just another crime story for the sake of entertainment, then read this one! You will walk away KNOWING who killed Laci Peterson."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Very well written.Hell has to burn a little hotter for Scott Peterson.I am glad he is in love with himself,because I\\"m sure no 0ne else can love him.He is sick,sick,sick."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"It was the best $4.00 I've ever spent. The book was brand new,unbelievable. I never thought that I would find a deal like this, in today's economy, but I have and I will continue to shop this way!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. This book had it all - the inside scoop as well as the well reported facts of the case. I enjoyed reading about the wire taps and conversations that were not part of the trial transcript. I also enjoyed learning about the dysfunction within the Peterson family that helps us all to understand Scott Peterson's behavior a bit more, perhaps. Photos of the evidence were also appreciated.My only criticism of this book is that I did find a few errors - incorrect dates, incorrect names or circumstances - that seemingly were glaringly obvious. I would chew out the editor vs. the author, however.I highly recommend this book written by a seasoned writer with excellent skills. I also recommend Sharon Rocha's book \\"For Laci\\"."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This book is very well written. Catherine Crier brings all of the details together, from the evidence gathered (much of which I previously knew nothing about) to the emotions and psychological impact on the many living victims Scott left in his wake. A Deadly Game is an objective and factual analysis of the investigation from beginning to end, yet kept my interest moreso than any work of fiction I've read."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Great book and great reading. Highly recommended for all Scott and Laci \\"addicts.\\""},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I read the book hoping there would at least an un-biased report. I was disappointed. Just like the rest of the books, it has nothing new to offer. I personally do not feel that the D.A. proved their case and the \\"guilty\\" verdict, if by following the law, never should have been handed down. I say \\"heaven help us all\\" if this is what our judicial system has come to."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I am an admitted Peterson case junkie, and have purchased every book relating to the case. This gem by Catherine Crier is by far my favorite. It was a page turner in every chapter, and I found it difficult to put down. Ms. Crier has a true talent when it comes to telling a story and relating to the reader. I found all of her research to be spot on, and the book contained several things that I had overlooked during the trial. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even those like me who think they have heard it all about the Peterson case. This book is on proud display on my true crime / Peterson shelf in the family room. I will treasure it for a lifetime. A++"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Excellent. Factual, As on TV, Catherine Crier tells it like it is."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This was my favorite book of the ones I have read on the case so far. Much better than Amber's. A lot of new information. Good work Judge Crier."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Crier's book is, so far, the best to be written on the subject. Even avid followers of the trial and readers of the transcripts will find much of interest in this book which has not previous come to light. To her credit, Crier also provides a realistic look at all of the main characters in the case.My criticism is that some passages are slightly confused (e.g., present from Scott to Laci with no follow up as to contents), and some things are surprisingly omitted (e.g., allegations of a fight Laci had with another girl in high school). Perhaps it is simply a matter of careless editing and a rush to press. As to the latter, perhaps Crier delved into the allegations and found them to be baseless. She does not deal at all with the surveillance cameras across the street from the Peterson house or possible grand jury proceedings which were obliquely referred to in the course of the case."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I couldn't put this book down, and at times my mouth was literally hanging open in shock. But please, this is some of the worst editing I've ever seen and it made it hard to stay focused on the text. A real let down in that sense."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This book contains very little new or \\"untold\\" information regarding the Scott Peterson case so if you are looking for stuff that's not already out there, don't expect to find it in this book.According to the book, there were over 3,000 taped telephone calls between Scott and Amber, yet the author of this book chose the include the same old tired transcripts of telephone calls that have already been played ad nauseum on every television station that has covered the story. Surely one or two of the others could have been included even if they weren't especially relative to the case just for the sake of something different.The author's use of \\"ya' instead of \\"you\\" (as in \\"Ya' killed her, didn't ya'?) was annoying to this reader as it doesn't flow very well on the written page. I know people tend to speak that way in reality, but it just gets irritating when used again and again in a book.This book also has a very flat affect to it - it has no emotion to it at all. When the author speaks of Sharon Rocha's grief or of the Peterson's anger, I did not feel any emotion at all. Considering that \\"flat affect\\" is a characteristic that Crier frequently applied to Scott Peterson, I'm surprised she didn't notice it in her own writing style and try to spice it up just a little.Photos were a disappointment as well - all have been widely displayed on news broadcasts and on CourtTV, and continuity seemed to be a problem in some places.Don't pay for it if you really want to read it - just borrow it from your local library."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Of all the books written on this case, this book is probably the best. Catherine Crier obviously did alot of research. The book spans from the beginning through the verdict, with much back ground information on Scott Peterson. It makes it easy for someone who didn't completely follow the case to understand how someone can be convicted on a mostly circumstantial case.The book is mostly fact-based. However, Ms. Crier does throw in her own opinion from time to time, including speaking out against the death penalty. Regardless, it took me only three days to read the book.If you are interested in the case, I highly recommend this book over any others."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A long-time fan of true crime stories, I picked this up at the Chicago airport to read on a long flight. And I'll admit, the first half intrigued me; I couldn't put it down. But as I continued to read, certain things--like calling Scott Peterson's Southern California hometown \\"Solano Beach\\" (instead of Solana Beach) several times--bothered me. It's so easy to do city and street fact-checks these days with Google. Since I'm from Southern California (where Peterson's parents still reside), I know many of the areas referred to in the book. If minor errors such as these were incorrect, it made me wonder what other errors were wrong as well. All in all, this was a good, entertaining, and informative read. I just wish it hadn't been so sloppily edited; for what they charge for hardcover books these days, this shouldn't happen--even if it IS your only entertainment on a long flight!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Catherine Crier's book on the Scott Peterson case. Amazing insight that she gleened by being there, involved, from early on. She gives an incredible account of the police investigation and the unfolding court case. I'd recommend this book highly.Another I recently enjoyed is \\"She Wanted It All\\" on an Austin, Texas, case, the Celeste Beard case. It, too, is an insider's account of the investigation and trial. I came away like I did after reding \\"A Deadly Game\\" with a real feel of having been involved in the case. Can't wait for Catherine Crier's next book. This one is a keeper."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A Deadly Game is written by former Texas judge Catherine Crier. She now has a television show on court tv called Catherine Crier Live. This book is volumous not just in the literal sense; but in substance. I read Amber Frey's book thinking that I'd get insight that I was unable to get because the trial was not televised. It was an interesting and fast read. I said that I was done with the case. I then was intrigued that Scott Peterson's half sister had written a book declaring him guilty. I read Anne Bird's book in an hour and thought that I now had insight into what his family saw. I again declared that I was done reading books on this case. I then picked up Crier's book and realized that I could have skipped the first two! A Deadly Game fills in the pieces of the case. Crier had access to information that was left out of the trial as well as interviews with key people in the case. Surprisingly this book was the first that gave me a sense of Laci Peterson. (Bird knew Laci but her book did not give more than a glimpse of her). I appreciated the intelligent insight into why Scott Peterson could have done this. I realize now why I am so intrigued by this case. I have dated men who appeared perfect as did Scott. They were not. I think that the fear of ending up with a Scott Peterson is why this case is so interesting. A Deadly Game is not a tabloid book thrown together for a timely profit. Read it."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I thought I was tired of the whole Scott Peterson hype. I had passed on all the other books. But I picked up this book and skimmed the first few pages and I was hooked. It is compelling in that you get a lot of information that never came out before including transcripts of phone conversations. It is a bit repetitious in spots but never boring. Once you read all the evidence, the case against Scott Peterson is irrefutable. True crime fans and courtroom drama junkies must read this one."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I've read Amber Frey's book and Anne Bird's also, but this book by Catherine Crier is by far superior. It has complete and timeline worthy information and is never dull. It rarely even touches on the other 2 books except for transcripts of telephone conversation, which is obviously unavoidable. I did feel that it was obvious she thought he was guilty but still conveyed information on a semi-non-biased front.Some of the evidence presented, I thought, deserved a closer, longer look at. Such as the marina pass Scott purchased on the 20th for use on the 22nd and 23rd, but when he told investigators that deciding to go fishing instead of golfing was a 'Morning Decision', that was pretty obvious that it wasn't.Good book, very informative."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Nothing too startling here. However, the facts are well organized and will convince anyone with remaining doubts that Scott is guilty. Good information about the families of both Scott and Laci and the ripple effects to so many lives of the decision of one sociopath. I found myself shaking my head at some of the decisions that Scott made. On the other hand, no one caught him committing the murder or disposing of the body. And no one ever even seems to have known that he had that potential. Well written book, easy to read, and packed with well research information."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This book gives you a complete narration of the Peterson case in a very understandable way, narrated in a friendly manner, without being pretentious. It gives you almost a step-by-step account of the dreadful actions that derived in the unjustifiable murder of a young and promising wife and mother to be and an unborn and innocent child on the hands of the person that should have protected them most. The description is thrilling and chilling at the same time, but very interesting. Definitely a page-turner that will take you to the last page longing for justice for the 2 innocent people that were killed."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Ms. Crier is to be commended on a truly outstanding book!It is a definite page-turner!The detail that is contained is fascinating rivieting and very inciteful.Scott is portrayed as a unique individual.How and why would a husband whose wife is 9 months pregnant, go on a fishing tirp Christmas Eve? What goes through the mind of such a person?He was a supreme game player! Smooth as silk!GREAT BOOK!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"At this late date (July 2010) genuinely \\"new\\" information is not going to be forthcoming. This book, however, is the most comprehensive I've read, and I've read nearly all of them. This goes into minute detail through almost each, individual day from the time Scott called his mother-in-law on Christmas Eve to the time when Scott is sentenced to death. It includes both the complete facts of the case and Ms. Crier's opinions (if you're in the \\"Scott is innocent\\" camp you might try skimming over the more opinionated passages.) I recommend _A Deadly Game_, _For Laci_ by Sharon Rocha, and _We, the Jury_ for a complete overview of the entire case."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I purchased this book for myself, really enjoyed the work. My wife read it later and she also liked it."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"CATHERINE CRIER TOLD THIS STORY FROM HER EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN THE COURT ROOM. SHE A ABSOULTELY FABULOUS JOB GETTING THE FACTS, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!! IT WAS WONDERFUL!!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I recently read this book and thought it was very informative and interesting. I couldn't put it down. When this story first broke I was pregnant with my first child;a boy due in March. I felt a strong connection to Laci Peterson since we were both pregnant around the same time. I never realized Scott had more than one mistress while he was married. I hope he rots in jail for what he did. No doubt about his guilt! Great read!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"As I mentioned in another review I've recently started reading all the books about the Scott Peterson case that got decent reviews. So far this one has offered the best all around synopsis of the investigation beginning with day one. This book told me a lot I didn't already know about the case, but then I only generally followed the case when it was occurring. Perhaps, as other reviewers have stated, this book doesn't really tell us anything \\"new,\\" but for some (like me) who don't know the intimate details, this book appears to outline many of them.I gave the book 4, rather than 5, stars for a couple of reasons. Someone told me that the book was filled with \\"inaccurate garbage,\\" some of the dates and names were apparently wrong but I'm not exactly sure what those inaccuracies are. I suppose if I did enough research of my own I could find the discrepancies, but I was just looking for a general overview of the case. The fact that a few people who know this case inside and out find inaccuracies in this book leads me to take Crier's assertions with a grain of salt.Secondly, I found numerous places in the book where things didn't quite come together as Crier probably intended. I won't list specific examples but there are places where Crier mentions something or someone she assumes you already know - but many times I didn't. I found her thoughts a bit scattered at times and there were a few typos - which surprises me with professional editors/publishers. From a literary standpoint I'm surprised that some of this wasn't caught before the book was published and I'm not a professional by any means, just an average reader.Whether or not you'll like this book depends on what you're looking for by reading it. I wanted a general overview of the case and why from the get-go police were convinced Scott was guilty. This book gave me that. It gave me insight into how investigators were operating and details about the investigation. How accurate it is, I can't say but I have to assume that the majority of it must be true to have made it to publication.Overall, it's a good all-encompassing view of the Scott Peterson case which is just what I wanted."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Ms. Crier has done an amazing job with this book. I read it in 2 days. It was so chilling, I could not put it down. I've read many of the other books about this crime and this is certainly the best one of them. Peterson's guilt was rather clear to the police and to a lot of people close to the scene (probably including his own family) from the start. But at least until the bodies were found, it was difficult to put the finger on the proof. After reading this book, I was able to count well over 300 different clues and signs that point to his terrible guilt! When someone is guilty, one often can see it in every move they make and in every word they speak. This book was able to convey this in a very natural and objective way. Even if you never heard of this murder trial, I still highly recommend it as it is a \\"great\\" story. There are many reasons this story became so widely known and why it is so chilling. But most of all, because it is a classic story about the \\"murderer next door\\"."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I was skeptical as I picked up this book. I mean, REALLY! Wasn't this case thoroughly covered at the time? Once I got into it, though, I was striken by the detail, insight and nuance Catherine Crier brought to a story I thought I knew start to finish. In addition to evidence I hadn't heard about, I was fascinated by the human aspects of the case. For example, watching as Laci's friends shifted from defending Scott and the marriage that looked so perfect from the outside to deciding Scott had done the unthinkable. And the chilling behavior of Jackie Petersen, willing to sacrifice anything and anyone to protect her favorite son, even though it's easy to believe she knew he was guilty of the unthinkable. If this case captured your imagination, you will find this book a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Catherine Crier has done a fabulous job of pulling together all the behind-the-scenes info. Some of these types of books can get boringly repetitive, but not this one. I was fascinated page by page and found it difficult to put down. Her experiences during her career in \\"the system\\" make this an excellent read!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This is definitely the worst true crime book I ever read! I don't even want to go into detail about the author's bias, inconsistencies, conclusions, etc. It's not worth it.Catherine Crier convinced me that Scott Peterson should never have gotten the death penalty; he shouldn't even be in prison. Is this our legal system? Very scary!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I read this book from cover to cover and did not find more than 3 items that I didn't already know. As an avid Fox News watcher, there was nothing new discovered in reading this book that Fox did not already cover. I found the book to be a very disappointing read. When Ms. Crier was interviewed about the book on tv, I thought I would discover relevant items regarding the case that had not already been put out there in the news. You could tell where the author interjected her own thoughts every now and then but for the most part, it was word for word tv coverage. I would not recommend anyone buying this who had already watched the Fox News channel coverage of this tragedy."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Through out the book their are many mentions of \\"what they didn't say in court...evidence that could not be shown in court...\\" None of which convinced me of Scott's guilt. Don't get me wrong...I know he DID it, but this book offered no new evidence."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I FEEL THAT SCOTT PETTERSON HAD A LOT TO GAIN BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS WIFE OUT OF THE WAY HE COULD DO WHAT HE WANTED TO DO ALWAYS BESIDE CHEATING ON HER ANYWAY AND BY GETTINTG HIS WIFE OUT OF THE PICTURE HE COULD CONTINUE WHAT HE HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO DO"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I do believe Catherine Crier got it right: the investigation and trial was a deadly game, but it was perpetuated by Detective Brocchini, the night Laci was missing, not Scott Peterson. The newer book, Presumed Guilty, reveals this telling fact, that Scott was threatened that night with being guilty. Is this responsible investigating? Of course not. Would this have affected Scott's behavior? Of course. I think Catherine Crier would end up with a very different analysis if she had some of the actual evidence from Tales form the Morgue, and the newer book, Presumed Guilty. Evidence, is ultimately what any human being should have their sentence based on. I think all who have followed this case would want the same for themselves. I believe Scott was betrayed in a multitude of ways, which will be resolved in the next trial he deserves to get."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I tend to think that Scott Peterson did murder Laci. Only because it really looks like he did. If you read this book, you will see there is no real evidence. The things that the detectives were saying were \\"EyeBrow Raising\\" weren't at all. They could have been exactly what Scott said they were. All Scott's answers didn't seem much different than what I myself would say or my husband. Why is the throw rug messed up? Scott's answer: \\"The dog and cat messed it up playing.' Well my cats do that.... Why did he immedietely put the bucket of water and mop outside the door as soon as he walked into the house? Well, my husband would have did the exact same thing because he's a perfectionist just like Scott. They already said he was a perfectionist! In other books too, they stated that. I just haven't seen any physical evidence. And I think he killed Laci, but in a trial they don't have what they need to convict him. Beyond a reasonable doubt. Well, there is a doubt. Everything that points to him killing her, could be explained away. So go figure.....why is Scott sitting in jail and on death row? It just looks like he did it. And that's not enough."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"As a practicing attorney in the great state of Texas and a Harvard Law School graduate, let me say how utterly abominable I find this sort of book...ABOMINABLE!!! It is a total and complete disgrace to the legal profession to use our hard-earned skills simply to capitalize on the morbid curiousity of the lowest common denominator of the population, the same witless, television-lobotomized fools who snap up all the trashy sensationalistic journalism that virtually 95% of our media have sunken to in the post-OJ Simpson age.The book begins promisingly enough, but quickly becomes mired in its own conflicting and hypocritical impulses (typical of this dreadful genre) to come off as reasoned and analytical while titillating the reader with all manner of breathlessly presented prurient trivia...who was the editor here, Geraldo Rivera? Jerry Springer?Mrs. Crier is far too intelligent a lady to waste her time inflicting this sort of inane twaddle on this great nation of ours...I say there are far far more important things to address than whether a couple of assorted media-created/celebritized nutballs did or did not do whatever to whomever...I say, \\"PEOPLE, PULL YOUR HEADS OUT OF YOUR BLOATED BACKSIDES AND LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE *OUTSIDE* OF YOUR CRUMMY TV, FOR GOD's SAKE!!!\\"And for all of the shill reviewers who've leapt up to condemn Eduardo Nietzsche's one-star review of this book, I find it interesting that most of them are anonymous and/or have had only one or two other reviews to their credit---usually a dead giveaway for the countless paid hacks who flock to review sites like Amazon. (The other dead giveaway of a shill reviewer is a long history of reviews but all of them being 4 or 5 stars.) I have also looked up Mr. Nietzsche's review history and am glad to report that I can find zero pattern of any shill behavior---he seems to tell it like he sees it in a very unpredictable pattern, and even if I often disagree with him (he seems to like very depressing movies) I have to respect his authenticity."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"The Queen of NE brings her completely slanted view to the Scott Peterson case.

In fact I barely made it to page 100. Why? I was stuck at my wife's hair salon waiting for her to finish and it was either this or a dozen Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping magazines.First off I must say that I was a bit biased...I normally never watch TV anymore and get all my news online since both TV and TV news in the past 15 years have gone straight down the toilet called Idiot Culture of Celebrity and Tabloid Pseudo-Journalism. Anybody who gives more than a flying fart about pathetic and meaningless little incidents like the Peterson case, Kobe Bryant's rape case and now Michael Jackson's child molestation case---needs to turn off that darn boob tube and get a life! Which usually involves reading a book, but something other than books like these.However the writing was somewhat decent, about the same 10th grade reading level as Time Magazine and Newsweek these days, splattered with the latest buzzwords and breathless sensationalistic oversimplifications and easy overgeneralizations...very skimmable, which is the only way I could stomach something like this, I just skimmed through. I was impressed that grammar, spelling and punctuation were generally OK even if diction, tone and style were often appalling, that was far better than I expected. And no large print, either...whooo-eee!Thank the Good Lord though, my wife's hair was done in all about one hour, and had I reached page 101 my lunch might've ended up all over that nice little waiting area and my poor wife would have to go elsewhere to get her hair done from now on...LOL"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Yet another book from someone trying to capitalize on the misery of others.

I think the book could have been even better had more time been taken to review and proofread it (ie it gives Laci's age as 26 in one spot and 27 in the other, this type of error is all over the book and takes away from its effectivness and credibility). All in all though, I think it gives us a closer look at who Scott actually is and who Laci was, but still has not convinced me that Scott is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt based on my opinion that Court TV was biased during the trial aside from Beth Karas, she was fair in her reporting."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I have just started to read this book.

I usually read political and historical nonfiction, so this is a bit of a departure for me. Catherine Crier's book is very thorough and detailed, and you truly get a feel for the families and for detective work. Most fascinating are the myriad of observations of Scott's perplexing behavior, even fom the beginning of Laci's disappearance. Catherine ties anecdotes, evidence, photos, and documents together masterfully. This book seems like it transcends true crime genre and makes you feel as if you learned a lot of useful things about police work and about human nature.

There is the sense that one gets when dealing with this particular kind of sociopath, that the perp thinks he is smarter than the cops, smarter than the media, and can pull the wool over the eyes of just about everybody, and most easily over family and friends. One might call that \\"a deadly delusion.\\"But it was hardly a game, not for the hundreds of people involved in the investigation, and not in fact for Scott Peterson. Pretending it was a game of hide and seek, chase and dodge, was perhaps his way of deflecting the truth from himself, the truth that his carefully planned crime of monstrous proportions was a house of cards about to come tumbling down.Here's a guy so arrogant and so dumb that he thinks he can murder his wife and unborn son, dump the body in the San Francisco Bay and get on with being a wine 'em and dine 'em and bed 'em player with no responsibilities. Risk? Well, if he had ever read up on the stats of who did the crime when the spouse is murdered, he'd have known who suspect number one would be. What he thought was--and by the way, this was the exact thinking of Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald of \\"Fatal Vision\\" infamy--the crime I am committing is so monstrous and I am such a charming and upstanding guy with such a totally non-violent and loving history, that nobody but nobody is ever going to believe that I could do something like this. As you might recall MacDonald murdered his also pregnant wife and two young daughters and tried to blame some hippies. The sheer audacity and the cold-blooded, reptilian equation (my discomfort verses their deaths = my discomfort is the worse to bear) is the sort of thinking that can only come from a sociopath: someone with no conscience.Most sociopaths are cowards and most do not commit violent crimes or any crime they cannot be sure they are going to get away with. (They look out for number one first, foremost and exclusively.) What happens with people like Scott Peterson is that they have parents who have let them get away with so much all their lives, parents who defend them and excuse them and do not confront them with their consciousless behavior. What this does is create a slightly unreal environment for the young sociopath, allowing him (for violent sociopaths, it's usually a \\"him\\") to believe he can get away with almost anything. Scott's parents, Lee and Jackie Peterson, come across in this book as enabling parents, parents who are more concerned about superficial appearances and status than about societal or moral values. They are the kind of people who believe if you deny, deny, and deny enough and attack the accusers, that denial and attack will carry the day. They certainly denied the overwhelming evidence that their son Scott and only their son Scott could have committed this horrendous crime.Catherine Crier does an outstanding job of presenting the case against Scott Peterson in a chronological narrative that begins with the murder and ends with the conclusion of the penalty phase of the trial. This is not an easy book to put down. The story is engaging and told in a manner that makes the characters and the circumstances come to life. Fertilizer salesman Scott Peterson is especially vivid as is the central California milieu in which the crime was committed. Amber Frey is shown in a clear light and quoted extensively. Still, one wonders why she put so much time and energy into the case. Certainly she was highly motivated. Whether to get back at Scott for what he did to her, or to bring celebrity upon herself, or to help the cause of justice--anyone of these are understandable motives--is unclear. Perhaps Amber Frey felt the impetus from all of them.Crier knows the law and she knows this case. She and Cole Thompson, who helped her write the book, put a tremendous amount of work into making this a very detailed best-seller kind of narrative and a true crime classic.Bottom line: start reading this early in the day and expect to burn the midnight oil. It's really that good: truly a \\"must read\\" for true crime fans, especially since some of the material appears here for the first time."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Of the four books I've read on the Scott Peterson case, this one does the best job of detailing the compelling evidence against Scott Peterson, from his Christmas Eve phone call to the Rochas that she's missing until the day he was sentenced to die. Although the other three books I read were authored by family or friends close to the case, two of whom are good first time writers (Laci's mother Sharon Rocha and Scott's biological half sister, Anne Bird), Catherine Crier's legal expertise is quite valuable to understanding Scott Peterson and the case against him. Crier is a Court TV host, legal analyst and attorney who has served as a judge. She does a fabulous job of digging into the police records, interviewing multiple people who have known Scott and/or Laci, discussing evidence presented in the trial transcripts and omitted from the trial, presenting the Scott Peterson timeline of suspicious activity, and analyzing the many indicators that Scott is a pathological liar, sociopath and murderer. The book also contains a wealth of photos not only of Scott and Laci's lives, but of crime scene evidence.Crier shows that Scott has the \\"MOM\\" (motive, opportunity and means) to have murdered Laci, although she doesn't use the acronym. Combine \\"MOM\\" with Scott being a sociopath who would not hesitate to murder someone who got in his way, and we have a deadly combination.Motive -Scott gave off many indicators that he did not want children, despite Laci's pregnancy. Laci, OTOH, made it clear she wanted more than one child, a bigger house, new car and an overall upgraded lifestyle. This interfered with Scott's desire to be free from the responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Had he divorced her, he would have had to pay child support and likely alimony, which would have cramped his bachelor style. Crier details the family expenses, showing that despite Scott's monthly income of about $5000, the couple spent at least $4,880 a month, which included Scott's $390 a month country club membership; Laci's regular routine of spa treatments, manicures, pedicures and clothes shopping; and both their purchases of fine wine (when Laci wasn't pregnant). \\"Their accumulated savings left little to pay for a new infant...especially when it became clear how much money Scott was spending on his extracurricular activities.\\" Those extracurricular activities included Scott's affair with Amber Frey, as well as at least two other affairs during his marriage. Scott gave one of his mistresses an expensive 12 dozen roses on a date.Opportunity - Scott's parents seem to believe it's a most unfortunate coincidence that Laci and Conner's bodies turned up in the same spot in the Berkley Marina where Scott happened to be \\"fishing\\" (but not knowing what he was fishing for and having the wrong type of tackle.) And yet another unfortunate coincidence that he happened to be making homemade concrete anchors for his boat which were never found. Scott's story that Laci was walking their dog in the park was fabricated, in light of Laci's troubles with getting out of breath during exercise and her comment to her prenatal yoga instructor, \\"The dog probably thinks I'm mad at him, because I never walk him anymore.\\" And Scott's claim that Laci was mopping the floor is ridiculous, considering the housekeeper had mopped the day before, and Laci had so much holiday preparation to do. If Scott's version of events was correct, \\"Laci had only twenty minutes to finish mopping the floor, load the breakfast dishes, use her curling iron, change clothes, don her sneakers, take the dog to the park, and be abducted.\\" Crier leads us through Scott's web of ridiculous stories, detailing the entire case against him.Means - It would have been easy for 6 foot tall, 200 lb. Scott to murder his 5 foot tall pregnant wife. The prosecution believes \\"Laci was the victim of what is termed a 'soft kill,' a death from strangulation, poisoning, or suffocation, which might not leave behind a great deal of blood or forensic material. Crier writes, \\"the two drops of blood present on the couple's duvet cover suggested that Laci might have been killed on the bed.\\" She also shows a crime scene photo of \\"an indentation that spanned the width of the bed, as though a body had been laid out there.\\"A comment on the Scott's parents - In Anne Bird's book, they come across as \\"my son can do no wrong\\" indulgent parents. Sharon Rocha's book shows that plus their outrageous rudeness toward the Rocha's during a time of terrible loss. Catherine Crier's book shows all of the above plus tangible evidence of Jackie's dishonesty. In one telling example, Scott emailed Laci's mom a flier for Laci's search containing two tip lines, the Modesto Police and a non-police tip line. Concerned that some valuable tips could bypass the police, Sharon contacted the detectives. One of the detectives called in a phony anonymous tip claiming to be a truck driver who had seen Scott's truck on Highway 580 around 3:30 pm Christmas Eve with a bundle in the back wrapped in a blue blanket. Jackie never followed up on the tip nor reported it to police, breaking her promise to police that she would report all tips on that line. Obviously the purpose of that \\"tip\\" line was to make sure that leads implicating Scott bypassed the police. I have no doubt that Jackie, like Scott, is a sociopath.If you want a good overview of the case against Scott Peterson, and can only read one book, this is the one I recommend. And if you have any doubt as to Scott's guilt, this book should prove it to you beyond a reasonable doubt (unless you're Jackie Peterson)."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Finally, a book that lays out the case in chronological order. What I like about the way this book is written is that we get to see Scott's early lies, and follow him as he tries to decieve police and his in-laws. I found most telling Scott's telephone conversations with family and friends, as well as what he mumbled to himself after each of these calls! The book is well-written and held my interest from start to finish."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"If you are interested in a comprehensive overview of the Scott Peterson case, this book will not disappoint you. The cover of the book promises more previously unknown and untold information than it delivers, however. There are some intersting details and facts in the book that were not part of the general media coverag, but nothing that truly shocked me. Beware of the typographical errors and sloppy editing. I counted in excess of 30 typographical errors, most of them in the final third of the book. Catherine Crier often criticises the defense for claiming that the police investigators and prosecution made a \\"rush to judgment\\" about Scott Peterson. Perhaps she should have considered the consequences in a \\"rush to publication.\\" There is simply no excuse for this many egregious typos and shoddy editing. Shame on you!If you have lingering doubts about Scott Peterson's guilt, you will not after completing this book. Let's review. Scott is a chronic philanderer and \\"wanna be\\" playboy who lived well beyond his financial means. On the day of his wife's disappearance, does he contact the police himself? No. While under surveilance, he makes 5 separate trips to the marina where he claimed to be fishing on the day of the disappearance. Did he travel to the marina to assist or to inquire about the investigation? No. He simply sat there and watched the acitivity unfold. Later, the decomposed bodies of his wife and son washed ashore in the very same waters. Coincidence? Probably not. Furthermore, Scott Peterson used rental cars on several occasions and other countersurveilance techniques to elude the police. Are these the behaviors the actions of an innocent and grieving husband? I think not!I disagree with some of the criticisms of Catherine Crier's \\"armchair diagnosis\\" of Scott Peterson as a sociopath. I am a licensed psychotherapist and Mr. Peterson does indeed meet the criteria for diagnosing sociopathy - or Antisocial Personality Disorder - in an individual. Look it up in theDSM-IV if you are still in doubt. It is all there in black and white.One of the most interesting and least commented upon areas of the book is the extraordinarily strange relationship that exists between Jackie Peterson and her son. Aside from wallowing in denial and failing to address mental health issues of her own, Jackie Peterson encouraged and supported the narcissim and lack of personal accountability upon which sociopathy is grounded.A final thought. Amber... Amber... Amber. If there is a lesson to be learned from the tragic circumstances in which she found herself, it is this. DO NOT have sex with a man you do not know. DO NOT invite a man into your home whom you have just recently met. DO NOT introduce this same man to your innocent child. Since it does not appear that her track record with upstanding, responsible men is very good, one would think she would have displayed a bit more discretion upon meeting Scott Peterson. Behind every manipulative man there is a stupid woman!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Although I did not follow very much the murder by and subsequent trial of Laci Peterson's killer, I decided to pick up this book because I wondered how what looked like such a weak prosecution could turn into a capital murder conviction with death penalty. It was a riveting read.The book examines the beginning, which occurred not on December 23 or 24, 2002 but years before when Laci Rocha met the man who would kill her. In contrast to the one-dimensional, perpetually smiling Laci presented on TV, the book paints a picture of a determined young woman who could have easily yet entirely inadvertently aroused the murderous capacity of a sociopath. Don't get me wrong; there is NO victim bashing. But the book looks seriously at the complicated interplay of personalities in a loving extended family and thus provides insight about how such an apparently healthy and good-hearted group can unknowingly stoke latent sociopathy.What surprised me most -- a bit of a spoiler here, perhaps -- is how clear it was from the outset to investigators who was the killer. As the case builds inexorably toward trial, little doubt remains in the reader's mind about how the case should resolve. Because of that, even though one knows the outcome, it is impossible to read the account of the early days of the trial without a tingle of apprehension.The book includes photos, including photos of evidence, and an appendix of evidence. There is a reasonably comprehensive index (not always included in non-fiction these days). I found it a little difficult to follow the dates. Despite the clear chronology of the chapters, inevitably text would refer to earlier or later events that would send me hopping around the book to try to locate events in context with each other. A simple timeline would have helped.This minor criticism does not detract at all from the fact that this is a well organized, tightly written book that not only brings together the volumes of evidence that became public, but also includes many things never before reported. (I found that tag annoying at first, but came to appreciate having things flagged that would not have been seen before.)A reasoned discussion of the death penalty should provoke further thought and I am glad it was included.Having read this book, I find I have the creepy sensation of the killer saying, \\"Made ya look.\\" A sociopath could well be unconcerned that we are made to look at an irrefutable case against him and could, I suppose, simply be basking in the attention, such as it is. So, yes, I suppose he makes us look, but the long look is educational and might even spare others in their encounters with this breed of human pathology."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I followed the Scott Peterson trial at the time, and read as much about it as was out there to read. A lot of it was overly dramatic and sensationalistic. But Crier's writing is far from emotional or sensationalistic. She calmly explains every detail possible in the lives of Scott and Laci Peterson. She doesn't attempt to nominate Laci for sainthood, for which I'm grateful. Laci was an ordinary woman with the faults and weaknesses we all have. Her misfortune was to have fallen in love with, and married, a sociopath who reached a point in his life where he thought he was intelligent enough to get away with the murder of his wife. It would seem that he had simply wanted out of his marriage and the heavy responsibility of parenthood. The fact that he was also murdering his soon to be born son apparently didn't mean a thing to him. Crier doesn't waste any time feeling sympathetic towards Scott. Good for her. He left a million clues for detectives to follow, and was caught and tried for his crimes. So much for his supreme intelligence. Crier's book is, in my opinion, the very best on the subject."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"i would have to say this is one of the better books written about peterson. crier takes you through the entire case which helps you visualize the events happening. it is well written and detailed. it keeps your interest flowing from start to finish. you can see why he was convicted and his actions throughout the case. this is one of those books you can read over and over again."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson InvestigationCatherine Crier, former CNN news personality, former Court TV anchor, former civil attorney, former assistant D.A., former judge and author of a half dozen books which all have their basis in the legal system has written an encyclopedic rendering of the infamous trial of Scott Peterson. Having worn all the hats she has and having occupied each legal eagle seat in a courtroom, I am shocked by her bias toward Scott Peterson. She freely admits that she had him pegged as a sociopath from the very beginning and cuts him no slack in a case that was, for all intents and purposes, circumstantial at best.Crier disallows virtually every piece of \\"evidence\\" that might have shed a more illuminating or different light on the case and on Peterson. While the book itself covers the case like frosting covers a triple layer cake, the feeling I had while reading it was, without a doubt, that she approached this case with a presumption of guilt and not innocence. From a person with her credentials, I find that approach quite shameful and appalling. It would have been a better book, carried more weight and been more appropriate had Crier taken it from the presumption of innocence through to its end.Crier, having worn her many hats, should be more than superficially familiar with the behavior of a sociopath and yet she professes the sophomoric views of a lay person with no legal knowledge. While Scott Peterson may very well be a sociopath, why does Crier expect normal reactions from Scott Peterson when she fully realizes that no such thing is possible from a true sociopath? The jump from sociopath to murderer, in this case, is nothing short of a giant stretch of a stunted imagination from a biased reporter who should know better, in my opinion.You'll learn some new things in this book but nothing to further your overall knowledge or clarity of the case in this over-written book by Catherine Crier."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"A chilling tale of murder, but few major surprises - for those who live on this planet, the media made sure of that. Most of us remember the pictures of the happy couple, the initial support for Scott by Laci's family, the exposure of the tawdry affair, the strange and uncaring behavior by Scott, the washing up of the bodies, the relentless media coverage of the trial, and the words of Laci's mother shouted directly at Scott during the penalty phase: \\"Divorce is always an option, not murder!\\"What we didn't get were the meticulous details of the story, which are filled in brilliantly by this author. With her background of legal, journalistic, and police networking, she provides the most comprehensive book available - and it is from the point of view of the prosecution. The chapters are arranged by date, chapter I being titled \\"December 24, 2002.\\" That is followed by daily chapters, then weekly, then monthly - as the reader sees the tragic drama unfold.This theme was apparent throughout: In addition to being a sociopath, Scott Peterson proved to be a pathological liar. His recorded words showed (even on TV with Diane Sawyer) that he never expected people to compare notes. The normal human, however, has a pretty good deception detector, and even Scott's best friends were not close to him - routine lying by him was not a new behavior.Almost immediately after Laci's disappearance, the Modesto police had Scott under near-total phone-tapped and GPS surveillance. The primary detectives maintained almost daily contact with Scott and he occasionally made statements that were close to self-incriminating while he played cat and mouse games with them. On tape with Amber, he repeated incriminating dialogue they had once spoken in private. Even with the finding of the bodies, it would have been much more difficult for a jury to reach that verdict and penalty - with almost totally circumstantial evidence - had they not had the benefit of listening to all those tapes. His own words convinced the jury that the death of (at least) Laci was pre-meditated, sealing his fate.A small criticism: This author repeatedly added her own negative takes on dialogues and events, which would have stood up quite well on their own merits - a small insult to her reading audience. The inclusion of the insightful, colorful daily notes of the detectives, themselves - and Scott's own words - were convincing enough."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Having followed this trial intensely for two years and reading every newspaper/magazine article on this case available, I thought there would be nothing about this trial I didn't know.Crier's book opened up many new doors revealing details and strategic accounts of this prosecution previously unread anywhere else. She obviously did her research and utilized her many inside sources.Excellent read even for those who thought they knew everything about this case and trial.Thank you."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"As someone who has followed the case in the media from the very beginning, I was initially reluctant to purchase this book because I was afraid it might simply be a rehash of everything that has already been reported. However, I'm very glad that I did buy it - Catherine Crier is an excellent writer and the entire story is compelling.The book includes information which did not come out during the trial, such as the wiretapped conversations between Scott Peterson and his parents. For instance, at one point shortly after Laci's disappearance, Scott tells his father, Lee, that he would like to go to his club but wonders whether other people might take a dim view of this and compare him to O.J. Simpson (who also made a \\"show\\" of looking for his wife's killers). Lee reassures him and gives him the go-ahead - telling him, for all intents and purposes, not to let a little thing like his pregnant wife's disappearance and possible murder get in the way of his enjoying life as usual. While this does not form part of the evidence against Scott, it does provide insight into the reason Scott turned out the way he did.As for the evidence we did hear at trial, Ms. Crier puts it into context and shows how the police and prosecution were able to build a case against Scott Peterson.Highly recommended for anyone interested in this case."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Compared to the other titles on this subject this book stands head and shoulders above the rest.What makes a difference is that the book is well written and reveals previously unknown material-Bird and Freys books are a waste of time and money (in both cases its so obvious the authors are in it for the money)-well done to Caterine Crier for a well researched book."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"If you have been away on a trip to Mars for the past few years - Welcome Home! - you missed a murder of a mother-to-be and child in Modesto that grabbed the attention of the nation - and possibly the planet - much to the chagrin of father-to-be who didn't wanna be. He thought his wife's disappearance would be a ripple in a little pond. More like a Tsunami swept San Francisco Bay and beyond.There are other books about the saga of Scott Peterson and Laci's legacy, but this one, by Court TV commentator and former Texas State Judge Catherine Crier, really does live up to its subtitle: \\"The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation.\\" Crier clearly has no ambivalence as to Scott's guilt or the jury's verdict - she pulls no punches: the reader learns early-on that she thinks Scott is sociopathic scum.This in-depth Hardcovered 430 plus page tome published by big-time publisher HarperCollins is engrossing and informative and includes colour glossy photos in the middle and black and white evidence photos at the end, as well as a handy dandy index. Even recently returned Martian vacationers will learn what Martha's (pre-prison) meringue had to do with it and about the possibility of North Dakota paternity. As the JC Penney people say: \\"It's all inside\\" Crier's chronicle. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"I enjoyed the book, a page turner you don't put down until you finish it. Personally I think Scott is guilty. How could he not be with his behavior. BUT. But I do agree how can a jury convict him when there is no direct evidence linking him to the crime? No crime scene. No forensic evidence. Nothing just all circumstantial. Wow. If Scott got the death penalty because of his behavior, truly, God help us all. Legally I am amazed he was convicted on so little real evidence against him. He got arrested when the bodies where found. But still what evidence ties him to the bodies in the Bay other than he went \\"fishing\\" there supposedly. Aside from the legal issues here...so much suppositions. I mean Anne Bird sees a pair of diamond earrings that are screw back and claims those must be Laci's because they don't make screwback earrings anymore. How Wrong can she be. I thought she was affluent. Doesn't she ever buy real diamond earrings? All true gem earrings are screw-back earrings to prevent them from falling out of your ear. The book touches slightly on the psychic--I forgot her name. The one that works in helping solve crime cases with police. She says that Laci got hit on the back of the head while walking through a doorway. I would like to know more of what the psychic has to say on that. I've read all the other Scott Peterson books and this is the only one that has any real information. The other books--forget it. I love Crier's writing style. This is a great read and never boring. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Easy to read and a solid piece of journalism by Judge Crier. This book takes you through the 'Scott' we never saw or heard from with so much detail and wisdom.This book is one you won't want to put down, as Judge Crier takes you through Scott's life, highlighting what we missed (and the jury missed) during the trial. Details, so many details that fill in the empty spaces.Picking up on so much that has been so easy to miss in this case, Judge Crier brings to light the personality of not only this cold-blooded killer, she also brilliantly highlights for her readers the psychology of the Peterson family as well as Laci...Great book from beginning to end."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Well written.

This book jumps around and doesn't complete thoughts. She introduces evidence that wasn't brought to trial. For example, the book states that a girl at the college peterson attended had mysteriously dissappeared, but she never lets us know the outcome and why they looked into peterson for this. She says family members suspected he had some thing to do with it, but that's it. She moves on to the next thing. Many pieces of evidence are presented in this fashion."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"The most important purpose of A DEADLY GAME: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation, by Catherine Crier (with Cole Thompson, her associate), is \\"not merely to chronicle the events that this unforgettable case comprises. It is to take an intimate look at the character and psychology of a man convicted of the most heinous crimes --- the murders of his wife and his unborn son.... Many participants [gave them] in-depth interviews, often sharing with [them] stories that never made the news or reached the jury.... [Crier is] intimately familiar with our criminal justice system, having served as a prosecutor and judge and now a journalist. It is rare to obtain the kind of access that gives rise to such an in-depth look at an investigation and trial.\\" She and Thompson \\"have also had access to previously unseen police and Justice Department records, photographs, audiotapes, and forensic reports, all of which contributed to the detailed account\\" that is at the heart of this extremely cogent analysis of the most publicized murder case in the U.S. since the O.J. Simpson trial.\\"Ever since Laci Peterson disappeared on December 24, 2002, and the public became galvanized by the story, people have asked ... Why? Why was there so much interest in this single murder case? Why did it sustain our attention for so long? Women --- even lovely, very pregnant women --- go missing all too often in this country, and many of them are murdered. In fact, statistics show that homicide is the leading cause of death for pregnant women. And these deaths ... are usually the work of the person the woman loves and trusts most --- the father of her child.\\" In this case that person would be Scott Peterson. Ironically, Crier \\"learned that it was one of Scott's parents, either Jackie or Lee, who had alerted the national media to the story through a connection with the Associated Press. [She believes] that Scott never expected the media attention that the case drew. [She thinks that] he also miscalculated the abilities of the 270 member MPD. He probably thought some small town cops on Christmas Eve were no match for him, and expected the story to disappear rapidly from the news when Laci's body could not be found. If so, Scott Peterson chose the wrong small-town cops. The MPD has a 90% homicide clearance rate, almost a third better than the national average.\\"And Crier says, \\"As the story began to unfold ... [she began to have doubts about what she was seeing and hearing.] After almost three decades studying, practicing, and reporting on the criminal justice system, [she] felt that something wasn't right in those first news stories about Laci Peterson.\\" The more she watched, and the more she discussed the events of the case with colleagues on her Court TV program, \\"Catherine Crier Live,\\" the more convinced she became that Scott was not only a pathological liar but that he was a sociopath as well. Early on, she expressed this opinion and backed it up with examples of his behavior and the flat affect he displayed when he should have been at the very least shaken.Laci Peterson was almost eight months pregnant on December 24, 2002. Her husband was (allegedly) the last known person to have seen her alive on that Christmas Eve morning. He told everyone that Laci was to walk the dog after she mopped the kitchen floor, go shopping and bake gingerbread cookies for the evening celebration at her parents' house.According to Scott he decided to go to his warehouse office around 9:30 am, then later took off to the Berkley Marina because it was too cold to golf. This sounded absurd, since he admitted that he traveled ninety miles from his Modesto home on a gray, damp, cool day to try out his new, small boat. But the first law enforcement officer to arrive at the Peterson home that night smelled something foul in the air. When the detectives arrived on the scene they too had instinctive gut feelings about Scott Peterson's version of how he spent his day and believed that his fish tale stunk. Later the investigators determined that no one knew he had purchased a boat, and they found a fishing license dated for two days: December 23rd and December 24th --- very strange indeed. Do coincidences like this really happen? Perhaps they do. But not in Modesto, according to the detectives.Scott Peterson became the prime suspect in the disappearance of Laci almost as soon as she was reported missing. For two years rumors, myths, illogical scenarios, lies, contradictions, suspicion, and strange behaviors floated like balloons over the case. Scott Peterson became his own worst enemy when he started to stumble through public statements. Professional pundits saw his demeanor and attitude as classic symptoms of a personality disorder known as \\"sociopathy.\\" The talking head shows cablecast hours and hours of the case, which garnered interest on an international scale. A DEADLY GAME shines a light into the dark corners and secret revelations that stymied case watchers. Crier spares no opportunity to inform her readers about everything she found that left no doubt about Peterson's guilt.Laci's body washed up within a mile of where Scott Peterson said he was fishing the day she vanished; and Conner, their unborn son, washed up there too. By that time Scott had been aware that police investigators were following him and he tried to brazen out the surveillance teams. When the bodies floated to the surface of the bay, law enforcement realized that Scott Peterson had been living only thirty miles from the Mexican border. He was a definite flight risk and thus was arrested the day the DNA reports on his wife and son were released.In Redwood City, California, Judge Delucci oversaw a six-month trial full of delays and every trick Scott Peterson's attorney could play. But the jury was not fooled and they found Scott Peterson guilty of murder. He was sentenced to death and now resides on San Quentin's death row. His appeals, which could take years, have not started yet. All of this is documented in accessible language and written with the same professionalism Catherine Crier brings to every project. This is a chilling tale but one that is repeated daily throughout the United States. We may never know why this case captured the world's attention, or why Scott Peterson murdered his wife and unborn son, but A DEADLY GAME is certainly the definitive resource for case watchers seeking information that may help answer these questions.--- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaum"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Knowing that the leading cause of death in pregnant women is murder, you have to wonder why this particular case commanded so much of the public's attention; on the other hand, I wonder why that equally shocking statistic hasn't done so as well. This case it what it took to shine some light on that apallingly ugly truth.If you are looking for some insight into Scott Peterson, there is none here nor is there any into his fascinating & puzzling parents.If you wonder why the public's attention was captured you need only to look upon the charismatic & smiling faces of the two people most involved, Scott & Laci. Then remember that Laci was 8 months pregnant & that it was Christmas & you have a story that holds the utmost fascination, that of a Christmas tableau gone horribly wrong.I imagine that Scott never realized that the story would take on a life of it's own & that he would become entangled in it & the public's fascination with it. If he hoped Laci & the baby would soon be forgotten as a \\"cold case\\", he was very mistaken & is now paying for his cold-hearted crime by residing on death row awaiting execution. His parents are paying too, for the way they treated their \\"golden boy\\" and covered or dismissed his every miscalculated move. They are paying financially & emotionally & have to live with Scott's actions & their reactions to them. Many of the things they said during the course of the search for Laci & then the trial are just now brought to light in this book. Their son bankrupted them in more ways than one.Laci's family carries a double burden too; they've been deprived of their daughter & their unborn grandson by a cruel & selfish murder. You heart breaks for them & their family & the knowledge & the doubt that they will carry for the rest of their lives.There are a few things in this book that have not been revealed before & they are of intetrest. If you hadn't followed this case on a daily basis & known most of what was happening as it occurred, then you might want to read this book to \\"come up to speed\\".

My only knock against the book was the author's including her own impressions about Peterson's motives and/or reasons for behavior. It is ok to speculate but Crier seems to go overboard at times. Interjecting her own personal observations and then trying to analyze why Peterson said this or did that. I would also have enjoyed reading more about the trial since I paid little attention to this whole sorid tale. Being a criminal attorney (stints at both defense and prosecution), I was a concerned about the lack of solid or physical evidence used by the state to convict Peterson. After reading this book I have no doubt that he killed his young pregnant wife and for that he needs to burn in hell, however, I still feel as though the state did not have sufficient evidence to convict him.

I can also recall one specific instance where the author seemed to contradict herself, saying that there were no gifts under the Christmas tree from Scott to Laci when just a few pages before she had detailed one such gift that was present. When confronted with such sloppiness in a published work, it made me wonder if the author was sloppy with her data too."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Expect nothing but real life twists & turns in this book. Very insightful to the case. Hard to put down, excellent!!!!!!"},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"In Catherine Crier's book, A Deadly Game, touted by Reganbooks as the \\"definitive account\\" of the Peterson case, the former judge and journalist and host of a Court TV program presents a thorough review of the investigation of Laci Peterson's murder, along with a smattering of interesting gossip and previously unpublished evidence that was not admitted at trial because of its prejudicial content or legal limitations.Most readers who didn't follow the Peterson case except through media reports, or who are relatively new to the subject will not notice Crier's frequent errors, inconsistencies, blatant omissions of significant probative testimony, and curious lack of criticism of the defense strategy and Mark Geragos's overrated, pompous buffoonery. Many readers may be satisfied with Crier's armchair misdiagnosis of Peterson as a \\"sociopath,\\" because they would just as soon delegate Peterson to that rare group of anti-social individuals who commit incomprehensible crimes because they lack the social and moral fiber to conform to society.However, I argue that Crier's treatment is just another example of the media's continual misreporting and artificial spin on this widely covered case. To dedicate 90% of the book to four months of investigation and less than 10% to a six month trial is selling short the real story, and the meticulous and valiant efforts of the prosecutors that resulted in one of the most satisfying and spiritually validating victories in the history of jurisprudence.Crier devotes more narrative to Justin Falconer's dismissal, media reaction to the trial, and Geragos's antics than she does to the trial itself. The only testimony she finds worthy of citing are Brocchini's and Grogan's, and even then gives short shrift to their obvious impact on the jury. Crier characterizes Geragos's red herring Thursdays as \\"bombshells\\" which, in retrospect, caused less damage than defective firecrackers, and she knows it.Crier's armchair diagnosis of Scott Peterson as a sociopath is erroneous and misleading. It is also a disservice to those who have survived relationships with narcissists or who are searching for explanations, patterns of behavior, warning signs, and preventive measures to avoid becoming a victim of one.To her credit, Crier includes a number of interesting anecdotes about the Peterson family and Scott's behavior that never saw the light of a courtroom but serve to illuminate the big picture."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"This was the most comprehensive book I've read on the Scott Peterson case.

It's a good read but a very sad story."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"Regarding the blasting given to this book by Eduardo Nietsche, please note this excerpt of one of his 'intelligent and scintillating' reviews of \\"Captain Corelli's Mandoline\\", one of the many many many movies he apparently spends all of his time watching: \\"Really about the best thing in this film is the fleeting glimpse not only of Penelope's (Cruz)lovely uppper torso but more deliciously, of her coal-black but neatly-trimmed armpit hair during the one very PG-13 (read: tame, vanilla stuff) love scene. This is about the single most physically appealing and authentic moment in the whole 2 hours, I'm afraid.\\"Ugh.. I guess books about real life, including factual representations of crimes that do (or should) affect most people, are a bit beyond Eduardo's ability to comprehend. Eduardo, if you feel that intelligent writing is so greatly lacking, please feel free to actually write a book yourself instead of continuing on as the 'wanabee' you really are (note the over 1000 reviews of all kinds written by this guy)Ms. Crier (a former judge in Texas) is intelligent, insightful and straightforward in her description of the facts in the case.

I would definitely say it is worth your time to read if you are interested in the Laci Peterson disappearance.

The tradition does go back earlier much earlier than the days of television but since the OJ trial America has a rabidly ghoulish fascination with murder trials in progress that has given rise such things as the cable channel Court TV.It seems like every day on the news we are exposed to an endless parade of the dregs of humanity. Has the television become the modern day pillory? Why are we so fascinated? Does it give us comfort that the bad guys are caught or does our comfort come from seeing that there might be people worse than our ownselves out there? In someway these super trials that dominate the media these days are sideshows that distract us from the real issues we should be dealing with.That being said Catherine Crier is good at what she does and she does a great job of breaking down and factually presenting the case.Personally I was sick of this case as it seemed every single bit of it was replayed over and over in the news. However if you read this book you will find there was even more to this sad story to know.What made America have such a fixation on this case? I think it is a combination of things and the way that each day the media unpeeled one layer of the onion after another even before the trial. Initially it was the heartbreaking story of a missing pregnant woman, then the bizarre actions of her husband, the sudden appearance of the husband's mistress and through it all we finally are overwhelmed with evidence that the charming well groomed Scott is not exactly the boy next door.If you are not overly tired of the media supersaturation of this trial I recommend it."},{"Title":"A Deadly Game: The Untold Story of the Scott Peterson Investigation","review":"The opening paragraph in Ms. Crier's book asks \\"why.\\" Lovely, very pregnant women go missing all to often in this country. Murder is the leading cause of death for pregnant women, and usually the killer is the father of her child.Why, here is to me, two questions. Why would the father kill the mother and his child? But also why is the public so interested, why did this one story get headline attention in newspapers and newscasts all around the country?Ms. Crier answers the first question pretty well. She is convinced that Scott Peterson suffers from a scoiopathic personality disorder. The symptoms he was showing, after her disappearance are classic. There's not enough time to discuss the sociopath here, if you want to know more about this disorder, there are books in the library, particularly the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the Mental Illnesses and Personality Disorders that will cover it completely.That leaves the second question. What attracted the country's attention to this one case, this one case out of thousands? I don't know. Ms. Crier says that she gives the pat response that it was a slow news day that Christmas Even when Laci vanished.But back to the book. The sub-title is \\"The untold story of the Scott Peterson investigation.\\" Perhaps a better one would be \\"The Complete story ....\\" Yes, there are tidbits of information here that is not recorded in other places, but most important is that here is everything in one volume.

In reality she has written about facts that do exist sadly to the detriment of Jamaica.If you read one book on Yardies/Possee's it has to be this one. It hits hard and for those of us around at the times of these horrific crimes it opens up old wounds."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"Born fi Dead is by no means the definitive work on the topic of Jamaican criminal gangs, but as it is one of only a published few, one is obliged to read it if at all interested in the subject. The American author, a Harvard graduate and self-styled \`street ethnographer,' carried out 10 years of intensive research for the book- some two years of which she undertook in Jamaica. It charts the rise, rise and fall (more of a stumble) of the notorious Jamaican gangsters - dubbed \`Posses' in the US and \`Yardies' in the UK. Laurie Gunst eloquently illuminates the hostile backdrop that spawns the gunmen, depicting their path from political conception to subsequent redundancy to their flight to America, where crack and easy access to more guns were conveniently waiting in the early eighties. Poverty, high-powered weapons and narcotics are the staple diet of the content of the book. All the major warlords are acknowledged - Claudie Massop, Bucky Marshall, the CIA, the Jim Brown dynasty, \\"Uzi\\" Edwards and the like, though some are portrayed with a little too much deference to the cowboy movies we're informed had so much influence on the protagonists. The colonial context and crimson history of the island and it's inhabitants is also covered, though with a hand towel rather than a tarpaulin; more pages are devoted to the surviving and/or imprisoned soldiers of the ghetto ranks, recanting the cinematic scenes from their virulent, violent careers. Ms Gunst, however, doesn't refrain from telling it how she saw it - pulling no punches when disclosing the catalytic role played by the fire-starting local politicians: \\".......they got their guns from the JLP (a one-time ruling party.)\\" The book is an informative introduction to the study of Jamaican criminal crews and is worth a read, though you may have to look past the author's somewhat mawkish stance and her romanticised sense of reality: she describes a machine-gun toting soldier, carrying out what's known in the ghetto as a \`rat-patrol' as having \\"beautiful hands, poised ever-so-gracefully on the barrel.\\" Their is a portent to that sort of thing in the book's introduction, where the writer describes how she conceived the book as \\"part travellers' tale.\\" There is also a quite intentionally scaremongering afterword entitled \`Is Britain next?' that is covered, along with the rest of this subject matter, far more broadly and authentically in the book Ruthless written by Geoff Small."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"Although there were few things in the book which were new to me, I found it refreshing to read from an objective-thinking author. The book is also supposedly banned in Jamaica due to its political content, but is becoming a popular read for many Jamaicans in the US.I enjoyed it tremendously."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"Riveting and aggressively reported, this is the finest study available on the Jamaican drug posses. It also gives a revealing look at their origins. But most of all, unlike lesser U.K. and West Indies-derived texts, it's exceptionally well written."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"A must read for anyone interested in the history of Jamaican political gangs. Laurie takes you back to the begining to give to a ful understanding of how these gangs began. From the political wars in Jamaica to the drug war in the streets of New York."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"This well written, well researched book represents the unadulterated truth. Ms. Gunst writes as an academic, at no time pleading a specific case, but rather allowing the facts to speak for themselves as she traces the origins of Jamaica's present gang culture. She spares neither details nor reputations, calling those \\"bigger heads\\" who have had a hand in creating this Frankenstein's monster out by name.Perhaps this is the reason that the censor happy authorities back in Jamaica have banned this tome, along with controversial songs like \\"Fire Pon Rome\\" and silly slackness terms for sex like \\"daggering\\". Thankfully, the most these cretins and their supporters can do to curtail free speech abroad is to crank out cranky, one-sided, negative book reviews on websites like this one.It is worth noting that the only reviewers who gave this book a bad review are those who apparently have a political axe to grind, but whether they like it or not, the sad fact remains that to its undying shame the Jamaica Labour Party recruited and subsidized armed and violent street hooligans in order to consolidate its political power. Also to its great shame, the opposition party chose to fight fire with fire and follow suit, getting their hands bloody as well. Those who fault Ms. Gunst for bringing this indisputable reality to the fore tip their hand with statements such as, \\"We really did not do enough during the 80's to eradicate the Socialist evil that was unleashed onto that Land.\\" Hmmm...arming the street gangs and promoting violence in order to ensure victory at the polls was \\"not enough\\", eh? I wonder then where, if at all, the line should have been drawn? Does the end justify the means? How many bodies in the street would be \\"enough\\" to ensure an outcome at the polls pleasing to Jamaica's elite and their patrons abroad?Most Americans could never imagine a world in which one of the major political parties recuited the Bloods, Crips, or Latin Kings to ensure that individuals living in certain districts voted in certain ways, ways contrary to their own interests, but unfortunately, that was the reality in Jamaica for many years. This book tackles that reality boldly and unflinchingly, allowing the facts to speak for themselves. If some individuals cannot deal with the fact that the well-to-do puppet master who places the M-1 in the hands of his street level thug is just as guilty as that thug when his thrall pulls the trigger and murders an innocent, then it is that individual who is running from reality, not the erudite author of this book."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"I read this book in 3 days.. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the polticial system including the area leaders aka dons. She gives uncut stories about all the big mon that came up since the 1970s. She also gives great detail about how they came to Brooklyn and took over. You will be surprised to see how Seaga and Manley both financed the Concrete Jungle and Tivoli posee dem.I read Shower Posse and this book is way better because the writing is better and it is non biased."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"This is a fascinating story, told with great skill, about a very complex situation that is difficult if not impossible to examine objectively. I lived in Jamaica from 1975-76, doing research for my doctoral dissertation, and I have been back many times since. It was an unforgettable, tragic, and fateful period. Prime Minister Manley and his party the PNP engaged in a radical experiment to create a more just society that unfortunately divided the country into two warring camps. The opposition JLP under Edward Seaga took on the mission of saving the country (or at least the privileged) from what they said was communism, and naturally received strong support from Washington. Money flowed into the country and a lot of it went into arming political gangs to intimidate voters and disrupt political rallies. Your party affiliation could easily get you killed, particularly in 1980. Seaga and the JLP came to power and the socialist experiment was over, but the guns, gangs, and culture of violence remained. Today, Jamaica leads the world in homicides per capita, particularly in Kingston, and this gang culture spread to the U.S. and to the U.K. in the 1980s. The main problem today is drugs, not politics, though, as Jamaica became the major supplier of marijuana to the U.S. in the 80s and the major transshipment point for cocaine traveling from Colombia to the U.S. in the 90s. Seaga takes most of the blame for starting this violent spiral in this book. I lived in a Labor district, where Manley was portrayed as the anti-Christ and Seaga a deliverer. Jamaicans are still divided on the issue of who was at fault, but most are sick and tired of the violence and fed up with politics as well. I think Gunst has given as balanced an account as possible, given her informants and experiences. Another person, with different informants, would probably provide a different perspective. No one is going to find the \\"truth\\" to everyone's satisfaction."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"This book displayed a harsh reality of what life was like for many Jamaicans during this period. It clearly showed why so many Jamaicans migrated to get away from the somewhat savage-like environment that the politicians created for the less-educated lower income Kingston residents. I enjoyed reading a book full of harsh realities. This should show people, either PNP or JLP that the goverment is to blame for the condition of this beautiful country now and then."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"I read this book and it opened my eyes to the root of the Jamaican situation. Born in the UK but living in Barbados it was most interesting reading of a political situation that a Bajan would never dream of experiencing...but yet we are all West Indians.The author is obviously biased and they're two sides to the tale...however the violence we all know existed spoke for itself and having not been in the situation one has to depend on logic not to be mis-led. The main thing that came across was once your party is not in power you starve. Secondly the posse and yardie movements in the US and UK was based on gang turf for drug and other illict trades with political bais brought from Jamaica.The pain is how many lifes were lost due to the latter. I never knew what \\"Green Bay\\" was all about........I always liked Kojak's version....the politicians losing control of the gunmen and trying to turn them against each other..........a setup to get rid of as many of them at one time. My point is let's put the bias aside...it is obviously pro-Manley...........but the book also shows politicains check for and care about themselves only and that is where reality conquers bias in this novel."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"Miss gunst is to be commended. This is a book that no Jamaican had the gutz to write. Mr. Seaga is indeed one of (by no means the only) the worst tragedies in Jamaica's history. He is evidence that mental slavery, of which Marcus Garvey speaks, is still rampant among negroes in this country. Apart from bulldozing squatters and replacing them with his serfs, arming them with the help of the CIA, creating the Shower Posse the most notorious drug gang, and selling out Jamaica to white capitalists by trying to turn it into an offshore sweatshop factory, what has this Lebanese done for black people in this country? Burning Spear was right, Marcus Garvey words really come to pass."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"As someone who knows what it is like to live in Jamaica, I found this book to be an excellent hatchet job on those who opposed the government of the 70,s. I think that Laura has been made a bit of a fool by the Anansi types that inhabit our intellectual ghettoes,and also our economic and social ghettoes. She accepts without question the things fed to her by one side of the civil war. In her pseudo-objective (and very superficial),so called academic fashion she comes to conclusions that demonstrate her lack of understanding of the dynamics of the situation that existed then. If it is true that we are now suffering from the monsters that were created then,it might be because we did not do enough, in the 80's, to exorcise the demons that arose during the period of the 70's. Had Miss Guntz the intellectual capacity to adopt a more objective approach in researching and writing this book, she would have done us a favour. As it is, she has only added heat, and not light to, the current situation in Jamaica. Can I give her zero stars?"},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"Ms Gunst is not bad as a storyteller and this book might have made a good novel. But after talking to some people she 'interviewed' and hearing how she twisted their words, I don't think it is worth very much as a work of history."},{"Title":"Born Fi' Dead: A Journey Through the Jamaican Posse Underworld","review":"As somene who actually lived through those times and lived in the Southside ghetto she writes about and knew a lot of the people in this book I must say that the spin on events that happened during this time is the same propaganda that was spread by the ruling PNP government of the 70's and this book is a disservice to the many people who lived and died during those times. We really did not do enough during the 80's to eradicate the Socialist evil that was unleashed onto that Land. As with any book proceed with caution and question the Author's intentions."},{"Title":"Films and Career of Audie Murphy","review":"I have been a fan of AUDIE MURPHY, since I saw the movie &quot;THE DUEL AT SILVER CREEK&quot; in the late fifties at a theater in Denmark, it was not shown here until then, but living here, and collecting filmstars at that time was a very tough hobby, because we did not see much material. However, I was very happy to learn from a friend, that a book was finally written about him, and I must say, that it has everything. A complete film-biography, with a very good picture from each one of them, together with his efforts under WW2, and what followed of honours etc. Besides all that, the author has even included poems and songs written by Audie, just amazing! In all, a great book, told by a very good author. Can only be recommended to all AUDIE MURPHY fans!"},{"Title":"Films and Career of Audie Murphy","review":"This book is great!..It has everything, from his biography to complete reviews of each of his films (with photos), to his military awards and even a few selections from his poetry.

When I saw this book advertised I just had to have a copy. I think it has been well presented with a very obvious show of respect for a man who deserves our respect. There are little snippets of background stories which are good, but I would have loved to have read more about Audie the person behind the scenes. The positive and the not-so-positive. It is through these stories and memories that we can get to know him. Nevertheless, the book has a special place in my library, and recently they have been showing a few more of his movies on pay T.V. I simply pull out the book and read the reviews. Thank you Sue Gossett. I am not disappointed."},{"Title":"Films and Career of Audie Murphy","review":"Audie Murphy was WW II's most decorated soldier by age 20 and went on to become a bona-fide movie star appearing in over 40 films. Although his roles were mostly in formulaic B-Westerns, his best work includes the lead in the Civil War classic, The Red Badge of Courage, directly by John Huston, and his film biography, To Hell and Back. Sue Gossett's filmography captures the complete record of Murphy's movie career and rarely-seen, made-for-TV dramas, plus details about his wartime service and life outside the film industry. The book contains dozens of never-before published photos of excellent quality drawn from private collections. Each film summary contains detailed technical information and comprehensive plot descriptions. The front cover contains a full-color photo of Murphy in Western gear; the back cover is a color portrait photo of Murphy in uniform displaying his many decorations, including the Medal of Honor. This book ranks among the best filmographies ever and is a must for any serious student of the cinema, not just Audie Murphy fans."},{"Title":"Films and Career of Audie Murphy","review":"This book is a treasure. In the past year I have become a huge fan of Audie Murphy and I wanted to find a book that covered his films and career, and I found it in this book.

It is very well written, with care and thoughtfulness, to the memory of a war hero and movie star. A must have book, for the Audie Murphy fans around the world."},{"Title":"Films and Career of Audie Murphy","review":"This is a very informative book. I am a fairly new fan of Audie Murphy's, and in reading this book I learned a great deal about him. Not only does it cover Audie's filmography, but it also goes into his life and his military career. I especially enjoyed the sections that gave some background stories on each movie and all the great pictures. This is a wonderful book that every Audie Murphy fan should read. Sue Gossett is an insightful and talented author. She definitely does justice to the memory of Audie Murphy with this book."},{"Title":"Films and Career of Audie Murphy","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed everything from cover to cover. Not only did I learn new information about Audie's life but it gave me a &quot;behind the scenes&quot; about his movies. When I watch them now, I seem to enjoy them a little bit more. Also, I liked what Sue did with regards to telling us a little about the people she contacted to get some of the background about Audie.
