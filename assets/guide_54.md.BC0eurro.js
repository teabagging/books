As an Arab Muslim, I believe there is a desperate need for this kind of books that seek to deal with the text of the Quran objectively, putting aside the halo of the taboo and seeing it just as plain old, classic text. It reminds me of the great German scholar Luling and Christoph Luxemborg. More and more books of this genre are direly needed for more profound appreciation of the legacy of Islam.Ibrahim Arafat &quot;Timothy Abraham&quot;"},{"Title":"The Devil and Mrs. Devine","review":"I found this book exciting and hard to put down. It is not quite like the usual gothic romance, in that romance doesn't constitute the whole story and the solution, although it is certainly part of the plot. In that way, it resembles theThe Ghost and Mrs. Muir, which Josephine Leslie wrote under the pseudonym R.A. Dick.The story begins in 1807 with the 12-year-old Danielle Bellaires. Abandoned by her father after her mother's death in child birth, she is unhappily in the care of her father's sister-in-law. Rebelling, she finds sanctuary in two marriages, each happy in their own way, but each ending with her widowhood. Along the way, the devil causes her to be always 30, as long as she wants to live, although she never actually agrees to his bargain. This sets up an issue raised throughout the book: is silence assent? Is it enough not to agree to something, or must it be explicitly rejected?Danielle can never be entirely at peace, either, as she constantly flees when people begin to notice that she never ages and, in order to hide, gives up her family, fortune, and home. She goes to Europe, America, and Australia in her constant wanderings, finally coming home to England and her descendents.I found it a grippng story, interesting in having only a few real villains, except of course for the Father of Lies. Many of the unlikeable people reveal a likeable side; the battle is more with personal integrity than with people. It goes beyond the usual gothic in leaving the reader to ponder several issues of morality, guilt and innocence, which the writer has left somewhat ambiguous. In that way, it is a profounder book than Mrs. Muir.There were two things I didn't like, but other readers may view differently. I did not like the characters' moaning about how the world is going to hell in a handbasket. I am not sure that people were ever much more moral, and one could certainly find severe criticism about the Regency, which takes up the most time in the book. One of the problems with modern times seems to be that the lower orders don't know their place: I can't sympathize with that one.The other issue is one that I know many will disagree with. In this book, the Devil is not a seductive figure, bearing more resemblance to a stalker. On the other hand, God is not too attractive either.

If that's true for you, then you might like to pick up this slim volume by one of Europe's most prolific Buddhist writers. In under 175 pages you will be introduced to perhaps the most remarkable man of the 20th century.Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born at the end of the 19th century as the last child of 14 into a family of untouchables. The lowest caste in Indian Hindu society, untouchables were not allowed to drink the same water as other castes, could not walk the same streets, in fact had to be careful of the sun so as not to cast a shadow over higher caste persons. They were denied education or any but the most menial employment. They were forbidden even to hear, sing or read the Vedas, the very scriptures underpinning the moral order enslaving them. The penalty for defiance could be death.Despite having been born with few advantages, Ambekar would go on to become not only one of India's first university educated untouchables, but also one of the first of his caste to do post-graduate work overseas, earning degrees at both New York's Columbia University and the London School of Economics. Returning home he took up the cause of emancipation of the lower caste, tussling with Gandhi, whom he found patronizing, and after independence serving the Nehru government as chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee. He is remembered in India today as the father of the constitution. After establishing a college for untouchables and an unsuccessful run for political office, he retired to writing about Buddhism and in his final days led a mass ceremony of conversion to Buddhism for nearly half a million untouchables before passing away in 1956.The author of this book, Sangharakshita, has an equally compelling story that is only briefly reviewed within its pages. An Englishman stationed to India during WWII, he stayed on after the war to become a Buddhist monk, spending 14 years in India during which he met Ambedkar on three occasions, participating in campaigns to empower untouchables through Buddhism. After returning to the UK, Sangharakshit founded the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order and became a prolific speaker and writer on Buddhist topics, including this biography, in which he attempts to trace the origin and development of Ambedkar's interest in and later adoption of Buddhism, as well as to summarize Ambekar's major writings. Beginning with the time he was presented as a child with a biography of the Buddha, the reader is given a thorough overview of Ambekar's life, as well as his major ideas, including the origin of caste and untouchability, and his conception of a stripped down, socially engaged Buddhism for a new age. Unfortunately in such a survey not everything can be described in great detail and so some particulars are glossed, but nothing so much that it leaves the story incomplete.Despite having been written by a Buddhist, Ambedkar and Buddhism is pitched to the general reader, does not proselytize, and requires only a passing familiarity with Buddhism and 20th century Indian history. This book is also a worthy companion to the 2000 film, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, helping to fill in some of the detail in Ambedkar's thinking.#"},{"Title":"Frank Buchman's Secret","review":"This is Frank Buchman's story, or part of it. Written by Peter Howard, it tells about the formation of \\"Moral Re-Armament,\\" and how Buchman's vision was that \\"..he wanted all men to learn to live like sons of God, and poured out his life to win that glorious liberty.\\"Buchman fearlessly held everyone to the truth that if he listened to God, God would tell him where to make a start in their own lives. When he made that start, he said that God showed him the place in another man's life where change could begin, and how to help the other man to make that beginning. Buchman believed that we needed to learn to read men like a page of print. \\"Sow a thought, reap an act. Sow an act, reap a habit. Sow a habit, reap a character. Sow a character, reap a destiny.\\"He also believed that democracy was as strong as the character of those who spoke in her name, and that free men were blind to the fact that the way they lived shouted louder to the world than the fine speeches which their representatives made at the conference tables.All in all, it boiled down to this: Buchman's secret was that \\"peace was not just an idea, but people becoming different and that the true peacemakers were those willing to pay the price of it by giving their lives to bring nations under God's control.\\" That was his life's secret. He died in August, 1961, at the age of 81 years, and when he died, apparently messages came from 22 heads of state and prime ministers from all over the world. He was heralded as the greatest man of our age.It was Frank Buchman's belief that everybody who wanted to be a re-maker of men and nations should in the first waking moments of every day, move out of themselves into Christ, and then out to others and then live out to others all through each moment of the day. A mighty message, but there are few today who may be able to stand in his stead. Interesting reading."},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","review":"I found Imaginary Playmate to be a definite page tuner. Each page kept me wanting to know more about Demeter, her life and the mystery surrounding her family. Imaginary Playmate is the story of how Demeter's real life and dreams collide...how dark family secrets always come to light. Demeter is a professional African-American female whose life seems to be perfect but is really a roller coaster spiraling out of control. Demeter starts to have very vivid dreams. These dreams take her to a place of beauty, serenity and the man of her dreams. Ms. Breaux draws you so far into Demeter's life that you (along with Demeter) can't tell what's real and what is a dream.I think this book is a great sequel to The Family Curse and one of the most exciting books I've read to date.Reviewed by R. Walls"},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","review":"I am still trying to think of an adjective that can sum up this book: mystifying, outrageous, off the wall, sensuous, intriguing and the list goes go on and on. The protagonist, Demeter, uses lucid dreaming as a form of therapy. She is explaining to her therapist these dreams she is experiencing. These dreams happen at inopportune times, in which it appears that Demeter has blacked out or traveled from this universe to another place in time. In her dreams, she meets Marcellus Angelell. Marcellus is every woman's dream of a mind blowing sexual encounters. He and Demeter have passionate sexual encounters that will leave your mouth hanging open. Demeter ends up pregnant every time they make love. She and Marcellus have a family that she sees only when she is experiencing these lucid dreams. When not dreaming, Demeter is trying to maintain her sanity, but she can not figure out what is happening to her. She is losing time, months and years after the dreams. She is an engineer and director of a power company in Georgia. She is addicted to coffee from Mr. Chaps, the deli owner in her office building, who vows that he is going to marry Demeter one day, even though he is about a hundred years old. She has co-workers that work her nerves. Her sister, Percy, is taking care of her, she has a turbulent relationship with her father and her best friend is dead. A re-occurring theme in the dreams is the appearance of the best friend in different people. Either they look like her or they have some part of her name, Cynthia Dewey.There are many clues given through out the book that can aid the reader in figuring out some of the dreams, but the finale stretches the story a little further than expected. Mr. Chaps, coffee, the strange old man, the names Cynthia and Dewey all play an important part in the story. Much attention is given to details throughout the book. The colors of the home, sky and surroundings are vivid. Musical sounds set the mood. The sense of hot and cold will send chill through you, give you goose bumps, or have you sweating. If the same attention had been given to the editing, the missing words and repeated sentences, it would not have been such a distraction. All in all, I would recommend this book for someone looking for a story featuring erotica and suspense.JeanetteAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","review":"Okay. The first book, Family Curse, was just too strange. I couldn't understand it. So I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe this one would be better. NOT!

The reader is automatically drawn into the mystical world of the paranormal through Demeter Pickens. Demeter is an educated woman who discovers the art of lucid dreaming. She meets the very alluring and sexy Marcellus Angelell and she begins to confuse reality with what's imaginary. Demeter experiences a love beyond this world. Is Marcellus just a figment of her imagination or is he real?Marcellus has known of Demeter long before she became a part of his world. Destiny is what finally brings them together. His magnetic eyes are able to pierce through her soul and they instantly connect on a spiritual level. They discover a passion that neither has ever experienced. Will Demeter choose to stay in Marcellus world or will reality pull them apart?Imaginary Playmate is captivating and full of sensual and intriguing scenes. The characters are well developed and the reader should enjoy the transformation between Demeter's reality and the imaginary world of Marcellus. Ms. Breaux has taken the paranormal and introduced it to the world of romance."},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","review":"Our book opens with Demeter Pickens visiting her doctor for assistance with sorting out her fantasies and real life. It all began when Demeter took a class to combat stress through lucid dreaming. In a lucid dream, the fantasist is in control of the imaginings. Demeter dreams up Marcellus Angelell; he is all she could hope for and more. Marcellus is handsome, rich and considerate. Marcellus is also a better lover than anyone could even conjure up in a dream. They meet, marry and have two children; unfortunately, it is all too good to be true, right?Conversely, what happens when Demeter begins to spend more time in her dream world than the real? Each time she enters her fantasy she comes back to find that she has missed days, months and even years out of her real life. How can she dream walk through life? Moreover, she is beginning to feel pain, cold, and heat in her dreams and she is no longer in control. Didi, Demeter's nickname, wants to stay to avoid her hum, drum, and stressful life. On the other hand, how can she just walk away from her sons, family and friends? More importantly, is she losing her mind?Imaginary Playmate is definitely sci-fi, which, in my humble opinion is a new genre for African-Americans writers. However, maybe because I am not generally a sci-fi reader, I found the book confusing. I spent a lot time trying to figure out what was happening; perhaps this was the author's intention. Moreover, the book contained technical jargon (astronomy, Karma and physics) that I do not believe even avid readers will find familiar. This book would also require an \`R' rating for sexual content. I have to further warn, that the sexuality reads more like soft porn than romance, which some could find offensive. Fortunately, Ms. Breaux offers a reader's companion at the end, which clarifies the plot. Personally, I found this a hard book to finish, although a sci-fi buff may find Imaginary Playmate a winner.LeannaR.E.A.L. Reviewers"},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","review":"Sometimes our dreams can be so vivid, the ability to discern them from real life becomes difficult. For Demeter Pickens, it becomes a near impossibility.Breaux's sophomore effort, Imaginary Playmate, provides an intertesting twist to the art of dreaming.The name Dr. Pickens may be familiar to those who have read her debut, A Family Curse, and this name returns more prominently in Imaginary Playmate. Demeter Pickens, the doctor's daughter, finds herself teetering on the edge of a dream world and reality. Plagued by the memories she can't conjure and narcoleptic fits of phantasm, Demeter believes at first that she is having a lucid dreaming experience that she can no longer control. In her dreams she is visited by her imaginary playmate, Marcello, and he becomes larger than life when he walks her through the halls of her innermost desires.Imaginary Playmate is an intense look into the unknown realms of time, dreams, memories, and the universe as a whole. Filled with erotic love scenes and underlying themes of forgiveness, this was an enthralling read. I love Breaux's look into the supernatural, and enjoy the way she weaves her tales, intermingling her characters' existences. With a touch more editorial polishing to tighten up the sequence of events and minor grammatical errors, this would have been a five star book. I am looking forward to the next installment of this series (which is hinted at within the text of Imaginary Playmate).Reviewed by CandaceKThe RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Imaginary Playmate","review":"Having read and enjoyed her first book, The Family Curse, I settled in to read Imaginary Playmate expecting more on the same story line.

I think that it is good to have both and to explore more of Gaskell's creations."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is a delight and an idyll of calm in our clamorous twenty-first century world of clutter and clatter! The short novel was first serialized in Charles Dicken's edited periodical \\"Household Words\\" during 1853. Its author was Elizabeth Gaskell (1810-1865) of Manchester who was the wife of the Unitarian pastor William Gaskell. Despite a busy life of charity work, raising several children and a wide correspondence she managed to develop into a fine novelist. Gaskell was friendly with Florence Nightingale and became the biographer of her good friend Charlotte Bronte. This novel has become a popular miniseries on BBC TV and is being broadcast in the United States on the Masterpiece program on PBS.Cranford tells the story of Miss Debroah and Miss Matty Jenkyns late middle aged daughters of a Church of England clergyman. We visit their quiet world of sewing, morning visits to friends, afternoon teas and trips to church events. We learn that they are old fashioned disdaining the coming of the railroad. Miss Deborah engages in a very humorous argument with Captain Brown (significantly this character is killed by a train) over whether Dr. Samuel Johnson or Charles Dickens is the best writer. We learn that Miss Matty had been courted by the eccentric farmer Mr. Holbrook. We learn he has 26 cows or one for each letter of the alphabet. Holbrook dies as an old man after fulfilling his dream of visiting Paris. We discover the story of the siblings wandering brother Peter who leaves home after a quarrel with their stern father. Peter becomes a sailor. Several years later he returns from India to be reacquainted with his surviving sister Matty and his friends in Cranford.We meet such eccentric old maids as Miss Pole and learn of other residents of the tiny village. Cranford is based on Knustsford the village in which Mrs. Gaskell grew to womanhood. Knustford is located close to Manchester in the industrial north of Great Britain.One of the most heartwarming tales of Cranford is to see how the friends of Miss Matty rally around and support her when she loses all of her money in a bank which failed.Cranford is a gentle glance into a rural England which only exists on the printed page. It is a loving little story of ordinary men and women bound together by blood, love and common interests. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book has been called Gaskell's greatest, something I just cannot agree with. ok, so it provides an sharp insight into the small town life of the time.

This particular Kindle version is very well formatted."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This story is wonderful if you love to read about people, their quirks, their daily life. The story itself is not what the book is focused on but instead it's about this group of women in a small English town and their view of life and the odd inner workings of their minds. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I believe there is also a movie made but it might be hard to track down. So far my favourite Elizabeth Gaskell book is North and South."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Just fun to read. Easy to become a part of the setting and to know the characters. Just plain enjoyable."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It took a few pages and a bit of patience to appreciate the voice of the author- but once my modern mind slowed sufficiently to the pace of a small town, and the understated comedy of little quirks and eccentricities of character and custom, it was very enjoyable. Reads very much like a newsy letter from an old aunt whose daily life sees great drama in little things. I laughed out loud more than once- as the writing is both sincere and gently parodying itself at the same time. I finished the book with a smile and a few times was quite touched by the goings on in Cranford. Has many elements from the BBC mini-series but in many ways quite different."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" like the village to which it refers (only 30 miles by train from the larger town of Drumble in which narrator Mary Smith and her father now live) offers multum in parvo as Rector Jenkyns might have said: much in little.Woven together in chapters that build quietly but skillfully on each other are the stories of Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matilda Jenkyns, their friends Miss Pole, Mrs FitzAdams, Mrs Forrester, Captain Brown and his daughters Miss Brown and Miss Jessie, Lady Glenmire, the Honorable Mrs Jamieson, Signoir Brunoni and his wife, the requited and unrequited lovers, the servants Martha and Mr Mullinare and others sketched swiftly but memorable such as Mr ffoulkes who was so very choice and Mrs ffarington whom he married \\"...and all because of the ff's in her name\\" though being very genteel, pretty,and wealthy were no hinderance.Connected aned interdependent they are: had Signoir Brunoni not performed in Cranford, had he and his family not been sheltered during his illness by a kind innkeeper and his wife, had the ladies of Cranford not discovered his plight and come to the rescue, then Mary Smith would not have heard the story of the wife's journey through India to protect their daughter Pearl, of the kindness of a plantation owner,a Mr. Jenkyns....and she would not have written to him thinking he might be the Miss Jenkyn's long-lost brother, Peter, and more yet would not have ensued.We care about the little town whose portrait is drawn in \\"Cranford,\\" drawn in the watercolors of Beatrix Potter and with the same precision of observation. The much that we get in this book includes a compassionate study of life in a small English town in the early 1800s before Victoria, using as Austin does, the stratum of families (mostly single and widowed women) who saw themselves as genteel though needing to practice elegant economy as the viewpoint. We get writing where each word is exquisitely chosen yet unpretentious; we get a quiet but clear sense of the social stratification where servants were kindly treated but unpaid including the little workhouse maiden whose arms were too small to carry a tea-tray. We get laughter as in the story of Miss Betsy Barker's cow going to pasture in grey flannel after she lost her hair when she fell into the lime-pit.Most of all, we get love: the love between sisters, brothers, fathers and mothers; the love between men and women;lovingkindness to strangers; and the love between the lifelong friends who are the women of Cranford.My copy is over 100 years old, illustrated in pen and ink drawings that are as witty and compassionate as Mrs Gaskell's writing. Found it in an odd lot in a Maine shop years ago, and it has been a good companion since, timeless as good stories and beautifully written work is, from Gilgamesh on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"There are rules and regulations at Cranford, and women, and a society of women. The town keeps early hours. The inhabitmts of the town exchange kind acts.Captain Brown is killed by a railroad as he removes a small child from the rails. There is a general absence of men in Cranford, but not of the kind of young men suitable for dating the servants. The central postion in the story is occupied by Mathilda Jenkyns, daughter of a clergyman, an unmarried woman.The author has amusing ways of describing the people in the village, their quirks, their eccentricities, their habits. One character prefers Mr. Boz, (Dickens), to Dr. Johnson. Miss Mathilda Jenkyns is persuaded by her friends to visit Mr. Holbrook, a former beau who was considered by a member of her family to be unsuitable. The guests wonder whether it is possible to eat peas with the utensils provided. Shortly after the visit Mr. Holbrook dies to the secret consternation of Miss Matty Jenkyns.From letters it is learned that her mother expected Matty Jenkyns to grow up to become a great beauty. Her brother Peter, after mischief-making and being whipped by her father, disappears. He is sighted in Liverpool and it is understood his employment takes him to India. He sends his mother a shawl and then the family ceases to hear anything about him.Mrs. Gaskell describes a milliners shop in Cranford and another establishment selling general goods. Expenditure of dress in Cranford is mainly a case of new caps. A hostess gives her dog cream with his tea and her guests, milk. In misfortune, a bank failure, kindness and love are bestowed by friends and associates for the victim's support and betterment. Harmony, reciprocity are the qualities clearly evidenced.The appendix contains an essay of Gaskell's,\\"The Last Generation in England,\\" which bears upon her knowledge of the sort of society portrayed in CRANFORD."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Very good read.

You find even though it has been several hours of storyline; you are still not ready for it to end."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Having been an avid, fast reader most of my life, I found this book hard to concentrate on. It is a story about a town and it's upper crust society among middle aged spinsters.

There are times when I wondered why I continued to plow through to the end."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have the video and the book 'Cranford' and enjoyed both.

If you've seen the video, go ahead and get the book, you'll still enjoy it."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Gaskell's plots are village and people oriented, something like Jane Austin's. Unlike Austen, she provides not only the humorous descriptions of characters' actions and speech; she will at some point explain how that character came to be the way he/she is. I bought this because I had seen a PBS series based on the Gaskell's books. The TV shows omitted some characters and subplots and shortened or combined some actions. Even if you've seen the Cranston TV series, the novels are enjoyable because of the depth. They are a really good read."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This book was very entertaining. Just loved the Ladies of Cranford. It was a good story well told of days gone by. Very good"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is just to alert someone in Amazon that the book that came wasn't the book I ordered. I ordered the Penguin Classics edition, which was described as having 304 pages and included the two novellas besides the excellent \\"Cranford.\\" The picture on the book that came is the same as the one pictured on the website, but the book I received only has 257 pages and doesn't have the two novellas, which is why I wished to have this edition.Now I notice that the great reviews of this book are from some other edition -- strange and misleading. How can be sure to get the right one?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I hate to be a naysayer, but I truly do not understand the appeal of this book. Old maids sit about pinching pennies (or farthings) poke their heads outdoors to frown on their neighbors and head back inside to grouse. A reader of this review commented that some of the details (I considered them banalities) do indeed constitute spoilers and therefore I have deleted them from this edited version (12/5/11).That same reader was kind enough to point out the history of the novel which explains its disjointed narrative and lack of cohesion. Whille I understand better why it is such a tedious stinker, I am no more inclined to improve my opinion. The book is nothing more than a multitude of the mundane strung together as plot. Our narrator pops in and out of town on visits recording these banalities to what end? A few instances made me smile, a skirmish between fans of Dr. Johnson and Dickens had some charm but for the most part the characters and their lives left me bored. Some of the reviewers here have compared Gaskell to Austen. Sorry but not even close.I can't imagine this being a Masterpiece Theater selection. Did they film Judi Dench taking an hour long nap?"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Quaint\\" is the first word that comes to mind. I would almost describe it as one of Eliot's idyllic novels, if it had been written by Dickens. I would say that, if it weren't a disservice to all the authors involved. Jane Austen would be a more apt comparison, if Austen's works were more episodic. Mrs. Gaskell has a sweetness and a wit throughout the novel, with a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards the inhabitants of Cranford, that brings to mind both the works of Dickens and Austen--especially the characterizations, which are quite good. This is important, as with only a thin veil of a plot to tie to chapters together, the responsibility of drawing the reader in falls solely on the shoulders of her characters. Moving from incident to incident, as was not uncommon in Victorian novels, the novel begs us to pay attention simply because the characters are worth giving our attention. Obviously, a weak novel is one wants to study plot, but one could certainly choose a worth book to pick up to study the art of comedic characterization. With less on it's mind than some of Gaskell's other works--from what I've read--Cranford is an easy, enjoyable read, but far from life changing. It is simply a well-written, enjoyable read, and there's nothing wrong with that. Something to enjoy over afternoon tea."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Last winter, I rented Cranford, the BBC miniseries (starring Judi Dench), from Netflix--and that got me interested in the book on which that's based. The book is a series of vignettes about the ladies of the town of Cranford, many of whom are elderly spinsters like Miss Matty Jenkyns and her sister Deborah, or Miss Pole (much as I tried not to, I kept seeing Judi Dench and Imelda Staunton in the roles of Miss Matty and Miss Pole).This short story differs significantly from the miniseries; the miniseries focuses a lot on the encroachment of the railways on the town of Cranford, and there's a romantic subplot going on there. The book is much more centered on the middle-aged and elderly ladies of the town, as seen through a semi-outsider, Miss Mary Smith, the daughter of a family friend of the Jenkynses.As another reviewer said on Librarything, reading about the ladies of Cranford is a lot like reading about the Golden Girls. This is a very lighthearted, funny book in many places, but still very touching. The ladies are very provincial, focused on the mundane details of their lives--but very loyal to one another, as seen when Matty looses her money and her friends conspire to help her out. It took a few pages for me to get into the story, but once I did, I was fully engaged in the lives of the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have always been a fan of 19th century novels and many of my favorite authors come from this time period. I have never read anything by Gaskill, and finally grabbed this book after seeing the BBC miniseries of the same name.It was a sentimental look at several spinsters in the town of Cranford, all of which are likable and good people. The overall tone of the book was very positive, with one of the main lessons showing that people love to help genuinely good people. It is a nice contrast to many novels that show the worst in people.Note that this does not match the BBC series in all aspects since the BBC series took all 3 Cranford books and condensed them into a miniseries, but many of the episodes from the book are included with modifications. I enjoyed the book and the TV show, even though they did not match exactly.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in this type of literature and who wants a refreshing glance as a time that was."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"...I came to the conclusion that this printing of Cranford has the CUTEST cover (i.e. a pretty teacup and a great font), therefore I bought it.My wife agreed.Mission accomplished hubbie. Mission accomplished.But seriously, if you or your wife are into Jane Austen(ish) stuff like my wife, Cranford is a MUST have. And of all the printed versions, this one is by far the cutest looking, which apparently is somewhat important to wives who like Jane Austen and her crowd of Victorian/Regency era authors. If you're a husband looking for a gift for your wife, this is a great one.And definitely buy her the DVD bundle of Cranfod and return to Cranford.And definitely buy her the DVD first few seasons of \\"Lark Rise to Candleford\\".Believe me...it's worth the money.She'll feel like you understand her a little bit...and she'll have some of her friends over for a \\"girl night\\" where they watch their DVDs and drink tea and dream about living in mid nineteenth century Britain, and you'll be able to work on the car/the yard/whatever without feeling like you're neglecting your wife because she'll be having way more fun than you.That's worth any price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Explore the 3 life perspectives of the folks in Cranford and surrounds and you'll settle in for a cup of tea at Miss Matty's in no time.

So, settle into Cranford for the summertime and enjoy the rhythm of their lives."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Inspired to grab a copy of the book after seeing the PBS series, I am very pleased with this version of Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell. With several options to choose from, I am very happy with the aesthetics of this book. In particular I truly enjoy the \\"tea cup\\" cover and the simplistic and easy to read layout of the interior. And it's always good to have a nice book to look at on the shelf when you're done with reading it.After being impressed with this book I also checked out the other books tagged with cricket house and their other offerings are as equally impressive.This version of Cranford is definitely worth it's price."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I was inspired to read Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell after watching the PBS/BBC miniseries last year. The town of Cranford is dominated by women. There are relatively few men, at least in the social circle of the characters in this book. The main characters are all single, either spinsters or widows, and they fiercely guard their way of life.The book, originally published serially in 1853 in Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words, is a series of vignettes of the daily life of Miss Mathilda Jenkyns. This book is definitely character driven and starts off slow. Nothing truly exciting ever happens in Cranford and you have to get to know the characters before you understand how small disruptions can make huge waves in their lives. Gaskell manages to convey how important small events are to these characters. You get the sense that if anything big ever happened they'd die from the shock. The narrator, Mary Smith, a frequent (and slightly more worldly) visitor to the town tries to keep molehills from turning into mountains and for the most part is successful. But, sometimes even she gets sucked into the daily drama.Fans of the miniseries might be disappointed with the book. Many of the funniest storylines from the series are added. But, the loyalty and friendship the characters display towards each other should endear this book to all but the most jaded reader."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"When I finished the last sentence of Cranford, I was so sad. I was so sorry that it was over, that I would not be sharing more time with these wonderful people, especially the dear and familiar Miss Matty. I was moved to laugh and cry over the events of this book, and I will not forget the parts that touched me most. I found the most real and lovely part of the book was when the friends came together when Miss Matty needed them most, and they did this just as real friends do, without mentioning it. I have purchased the mini-series and look forward to watching that, but nothing compares to the days and nights I spent \\"walking\\" the streets of Cranford and sharing an inside knowledge of all that was going on."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This novella has a good deal of charm and real feeling--I don't think you'll soon forget Miss Matty, who is the center of these little stories, even if her older sister was much more forceful in character. The efforts of the ladies of the village--and it is pretty much ladies--to cope with limited incomes, burglars, death, love, tea, cows, servants, and addressing the nobility are both funny and poignant. However much they bicker and contend with each other, when the chips are down, you'll find them (or their handmaidens) at the door with the 19th century equivalent of a casserole. (For one born in New England, these ladies are very reminiscent of much older relatives.)Heartily recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford (Penguin Classics)I bought this book after having seen the Masterpiece production of it. The book is unique in that it is a novel set in the mid 1800s and comes complete with appendices explaining the words and references to people and events used throughout the book. It was very historically educational in addition to being a very interesting and well written novel. I very much recommend the book and I will be reading more by Patricia Gaskell"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This paperback version is the one that the recent tv series fan will want, because unlike some of the other paperback versions, it includes the three Gaskell novellas that were the basis for the Judi Dench-Eileen Atkins miniseries. The three books were\\"Cranford\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"Mr Harrison's Confessions.\\"Mrs Gaskell stories are considered comedies, and this comes clear in the original texts. Some sadness of course in events, but mostly there is a clear comic, even sardonic voice in which we can fall in love with the characters and still laugh at their foibles, fashions, and foolishness which seem still so apropos today.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Let me begin this review by saying that if you are thinking about reading this book only because of the BBC series, you will find it very disappointing. The makers of that series used the authors name, the title of the book and some of the characters but the remainder of their production is pure invention. I am enjoying watching the BBC program, but it is not this book.Ms Charlotte Mitchell provides an Introduction and Notes for this book. It is my belief that it is essesntial to read the Introduction in order to fully understand Cranford. Elizabeth Gaskell had written a series of stories which appeared at irregular intervals in a magazine edited by Charles Dickens titled Household Words. The stories first appeared together as a novel in 1853. Ms Mitchell uses the Introduction to explain the chronology for the publishing of this and other novels by Elizabeth Gaskell. She also takes this opportunity to explore the question of whether or not Cranford was ever meant to be taken seriously by readers of Ms Gaskell since her other novels are so very different in tone from this one.One of the things I really appreciate which Ms Mitchell did was to include the Notes section to explain words and phrases which appear in the book which were very well understood in the 1800's but which may be unfamiliar to readers today. I read a lot of historical romantic fiction and these Notes gave me concrete explanations for words and phrases I have been too lazy to research for myself. I thought I knew what they meant before, now I know for sure. Items such as:1. gigot - a sleeve style described as leg-of-mutton2. baby-house - a dolls house3. sarsenet - a soft thin silk material4. blind man's holiday - a proverbial term for night or twilightMs Mitchell states in the Introduction that Gaskell later came to regret the fact that she had caused Colonel Brown to be killed in the first story. If he had remained a character longer in the series, I think that Cranford might have gone in a very different direction. As it is, Cranford is the story of a certain class of women, either unmarried or widowed, who live in a small English villiage. The main character is Miss Matty Jenkyns who only comes into prominence after the death of her older sister, Miss Deborah. The women relish their lack of male inhabitants and see themselves as lucky in not having to deal with the ways of men, which they see as uncouth and almost barbaric (they will speak too loud!). There is a very strict social structure among these women, even as to what time of day they can visit each other and what kind of clothes they should be wearing when the visits take place. These rules are in place to keep everyone on an even keel, so that everyone understands the rules, and no one may change the rules without the approval of the most prestigious ranking member of their set.Cranford is a study in contrasts. The differences in the male approach to the world, with their freedoms, and the female approach to the world, with all the restrictions placed upon them. I can honestly say that I had fun reading this book. I grinned, smiled, chuckled and even laughed out loud. No episode was too tiny to cause a complete, unrealistic upheaval among the ladies of Cranford. One of my favorite parts of the story concerns how they all react when rumor and half-truths have them convinced that a gang of thieves and burglars are roaming the countryside. It is funny and heartwarming but also sad to see the lengths they go to in order to protect themselves and their households from these thieves who are, in reality, simply the result of gossip and overactive imaginations. Another part I am particularly fond of is when the main characters allow themselves to unbend to the extent of divulging to their friends what their worst fear is. Miss Matty revealed that she was afraid each night that a man was hiding under her bed. Her method of reassuring herself that no person was there was actually quite astute and surprising for this woman's character. But Cranford is not all warm feelings and quaint happenings. There are real tragedies which effect these women and move their lives into totally different directions.This book is told in the narrative style, something which I usually do not like. There is very little dialogue. The name of the narrator is not even mentioned until page 137. I had read the persons name in the Introduction but I was very surprised to see that this type of presentation did not detract from my enjoyment of the book at all. It is not the most exciting book I have ever read, it is not a very long book, and it does not require much stretching of the readers intellect but I enjoyed all of the time I spent reading it and will certainly read it over and over.Very highly recommended for any reader who enjoys historical fiction. It is not a romance, more a journal of the everyday lives of women who depend on themselves and their friends for comfort and companionship."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This Viking edition includes \\"Mr. Harrison's Confession,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow,\\" the three novellascombined to produce the Cranford BBC series. The works are quite different from each other, \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" differing the most in tone and style.\\"Mr. Harrison's Confession\\" is the droll account of a young doctor who comes to Dunscombe (a Cranford stand-in) to practice with the much older Mr. Morgan, an old friend of his father's. As young Harrison makes the transition from the lively streets of London to the quaint lanes of the little town to which he has moved, he is involved in many humorous misunderstandings--and especially troublesome are those caused by a prankster friend of his! There are poignant moments too, as Mr. Harrison and the townspeople learn to know each other, and the young doctor finds love.\\"Cranford\\" is the most fully fleshed out of the three novellas, and easily the most readily absorbed by the modern reader. To one who grew up in New England of swamp Yankee parentage, the mindset of the Cranford ladies is completely familiar. Why care about dress when everyone in your town knows what clothes you own, and why care when you are away where no one knows you at all? The various subplots of the story are very reminiscent Sarah Orne Jewett, who wrote a few decades later in the US--\\"The Country of the Pointed Firs,\\" for example. The novel comprises several interlocking stories centering on Miss Matilda Jenkyns, her family and her friends who inhabit the little town of Cransford--a town of Amazons. Very few men live in the village. Though many of the stories are humorous, there are those that touch the heart.\\"My Lady Ludlow\\" is the most old-fashioned of the three novellas--set decades before the others at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and full of sentiment. Lady Ludlow, herself in old age, must learn to change as the world around her does. The story, narrated by a young woman in frail health, from the vantage point of later years, contains a lengthy and melodramatic subplot reminiscent of \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\"\\"Cranford\\" is a wonderful piece of work, and the other two novellas are very enjoyable. Especially if you liked the BBC series, you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"\\"Cranford\\" is likely the best known novel of Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. The novel follows the day-to-day social lives of a group of upper-middle-class women in the small, fictional town of Cranford, England. Rather than having a strong narrative, the novel delivers a tableau of social goings on that illuminate the characters and their lives. These stories are told largely through the eyes of a younger lady (Miss Mary Smith) who often visits from a nearby town. The ladies of Cranford are not rich, but wealthy enough to belong to a certain social strata, and much of the comedy derives from their careful considerations of who to include and exclude at various social gatherings. Miss Matty is essentially the main protagonist, and she is a basically kind woman if a bit miserly, especially when it comes to candles. She and her friends typically look to the most prominent member of Cranford female society, Miss Jamieson, and then assiduously follow her lead. Unfortunately, Miss Jamieson is sometimes rather narrow-minded, unlike the other ladies, which creates certain socially awkward situations.This enjoyable novel may seem a bit meandering to some readers, given that there is not a main narrative thread. The novel was originally published in serialized form in \\"Household Words\\" (edited by Charles Dickens), which may partially help explain its lack of a strong plot. Indeed, the 2007 BBC mini-series versions of \\"Cranford\\" included stories from several of Gaskell's other novels. However, the stories here all add up to a devastatingly accurate picture of small town life and the sometimes vicious yet amusing ways in which people in them behave. Gaskell clearly understood human nature, and readers are likely to recognize many truths about human foibles in her stories. I found myself laughing and touched often.Note: This review is for the Kindle version. The text is well-arranged and does not contain any noticeable errors, although there are lots of spaces in between section and subsections (which actually makes reading easier). This version has no extras, such as a biography of Gaskell or an introduction to the text; however, such materials are so easily available on the internet now that this exclusion is not a major debit."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"To you scoffers who find this novel uneventful - I say read it again toward the close of your life. The stories of these genteel ladies with their 40 year old lost loves and their strong familial relationships are very moving. I also like the way the book is contructed in a series of vignettes. But most of all I am enchanted with the \\"feel\\" of the portrait of village life in the middle of the 19th century - such a contrast with the mores of today it's hard to believe we are the same species! If you like Mrs. Gaskell, be sure to read Barbara Pym for the 20th century version."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I have just discovered this wonderful author after watching \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre. I ordered several of her titles and I am hooked. I will read everything she has written. As someone who always wished that Jane Austen had written just one more book (or two or five or forty!!!), Elizabeth Gaskell is a real find. Her works are more \\"worldly\\" than the mild Miss Austen, but her characters are just as compelling and I love her."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I read this series of village sketches as an independent study and found that it is most commonly referred to as &quot;charming.&quot; This so called charm is achieved through the humourous realism with which Gaskell depicts the citizens of the small, rural town of Cranford. The women presented are 'old maids' and though genteel, their economic status is far from certain. Perhaps the tender concern Gaskell shows for their welfare, and the friendship demonstrated for a friend in need is most pivotal in creating the charm of the novel. This book has the feel of a 'chick flick': no grand action necessarily, but little episodes of social excitement followed by periods of daily activity. The book provides both comic scenes and tear-jerkers and the method of storytelling could be likened to that of movies such as &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; or &quot;Fried Green Tomatoes&quot;."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Delightful, surely one of the most charming novels ever written. Using the lightest of touches, Mrs. Gaskell pokes fun at the simple people who inhabit the provincial community of Cranford in rural England in the 1840s, a village we are told at the beginning that is curiously \\"in possession of the Amazons\\": its male inhabitants nowhere to be found. Told in the form of reports by a frequent visitor to the village (Mary Smith) from a more cosmopolitan place, we are made privy to the disappointments, hopes, fears, and affronts of a number of the female residents, particularly Miss Matty Jenkyns and Mrs. Jamieson. All are related humorously, some wildly so. My favorite scenes include Mrs. Jamieson's defense of Samuel Johnson over Captain Brown's preference for Dickens's Boz and the sad story of Peter Jenkyns who is insulted by his father and runs away to join the navy. But every chapter offers its delights, and it's easy to see, as Frank Swinnerton mentions in the introduction, how many people at one time knew the book by heart. Long a best seller in the Everyman's Library, it's sad to see the book not included in the recent reissue of 100 of that library's most popular books, a gross oversight for sure."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Sherwood Anderson once described life as a \\"history of moments\\". Miss Gaskell has created in Cranford a glimpse into a dying culture of the more egalitiarian rural Bitish Yoemanry of the 18th century collapsing under the urbanization of the society and with a more repressive capitalism to claim the lives and souls of the youth leaving the village for better lives. Goldsmith's the \\"Deserted Village\\" comes to mind.The story is told from the lives of elderly mostly female, spinster as well as widowed community of genteel rural poverty- self imposed and otherwise. Quaint yet, but with vinegary pithiness of death, stoicism and social veneer, in other words real life. This is civilized 19th century social writing at its best, like a journalistic Austen. The narrator is a wise insightful character commenting on the eccentric and slightly mad village women who make up this world. The rivalry between Captain Brown and Miss Jenkyns based upon their literary preference of Dr. Johnson vs Charles Dickens is especially amusing considering that Cranford first appeared in Dicken's magazine, \\"Household Words\\". Endearing and haunting- much more than its surface appearance."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Reading \\"Cranford\\" is a lot like spending an afternoon in the doily museum of a provincial city; you can't help but admire the skill of the embroidery but you have to wonder at your own sanity for being there. I stuffed the book in my carry-on, as a relief from the 20th C anguish in the novels I'd been reading recently, and found myself waiting out a snow delay with nothing to read but this staid portrayal of a circle of spinsters nourished chiefly by their own proprieties. Cranford is not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches of the old-fashioned manners and quaint habits of genteel but impoverished provincial ladies, gently satirical, a porcelain cup counterpart to Charles Dickens's \\"Pickwick Papers\\". Dickens is explicitly mentioned in several chapters of Cranford; Miss Dorothy Jenkyns, the most literary of the Cranford ladies, finds him vulgar and less eloquent in every way than Dr. Johnson.Elizabeth Gaskell and Charles Dickens were quite well acquainted with each other's work; in fact \\"Cranford\\" was first published in serial form in one of Dickens's magazines. There are many parallels, particularly between Dickens's \\"Hard Times\\" and Gaskell's \\"North and South\\". Both books focus on the dire conditions of labor in 19th C England; both can be considered liberal protest novels. I suppose Gaskell is never as knee-slapping funny as Dickens can be, but she has other virtues, closer to Trollope, in terms of cogent story-telling and sympathetic insight into characters of all classes and both genders.Gaskell was totally 'out of fashion' when I went to college. The luminaries of Victorian literature, as taught at Harvard in the 1960s, were Eliot, Austen, and the Brontes, with Dickens and Thackeray cast as their knaves and Trollope as their butler. But Gaskell has made a comeback. Aside from \\"North and South\\", her novels \\"Ruth\\", \\"Sylvia's Lovers\\", \\"Wives and Daughters,\\" and others are in print and well worth reading. As her titles suggest, her feminism was more overt than that of her peers, and her sympathies were clearly 'liberal' in the current American political sense. Above all, she could tell a good story.Cranford was immensely popular in its time, when perhaps most readers had their own maiden aunts to caricature. It's quite well done in its way, but if you've never read Gaskell before, I wouldn't suggest starting with it. You might find it challenging to sit quietly with the ladies as they crochet and dither over their bonnets."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"As with all of the other Gaskell books I've read, this was extremely well-written and a pleasure to get lost in the time and place. It did not truly grab my interest on an emotional level until the end because the story itself was not that strong, but how interesting could it be when it revolved around the lives of a bunch of spinsters? I did enjoy reading about the mindset of that group of women and as I had known already, their focus on the trivial. But wouldn't life be great if that was all that one had to worry about. And that's the feeling I had about Cranford itself.There was a good amount of humour and some human interest lessons that proved valuable and thought provoking. The spinster character type is often portrayed in a minor or negative way and it was nice to see them in a harmless, charming light."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford is one of the better-known novels of the 19th century English writer Elizabeth Gaskell. It was first published in 1851 as a serial in the magazine Household Words, which was edited by Charles Dickens. The fictional town of Cranford is closely modelled on Knutsford in Cheshire, which Mrs. Gaskell knew well. The book has little in the way of plot and is more a series of episodes in the lives of Mary Smith and her friends, Miss Matty and Miss Deborah, two spinster sisters.But what is it about Cranford and its deceptively simple tales of country life that makes the work so appealing? It has been aptly described as \`a piece of exquisite social painting' ... \`tender' and \`delicate.' Narrated by Mary Smith, a friend of Miss Matty and frequent visitor to Cranford, the lives, loves, tragedies, and triumphs of the inhabitants of Cranford are woven together seamlessly to create a tapestry portraying timeless emotions and choices.The petty social bickering, cold shouldering and jockeying for importance in the village's pecking order are outlined in a humorous yet pointed way--the author loves her characters, with all their faults, and is tolerant of their foibles while holding them up to gentle ridicule. In every community there is an arbiter of good taste, a setter of trends, a leader of public opinion, and all the other social whimsies that make up this colourful collection of characters. It is not easy to keep secrets in this closed environment, and as Mary Smith remarks, \\"It was impossible to live a month at Cranford, and not know the daily habits of each resident ....\\" Despite the squabbles and occasional \`no speaks,' the ladies of Cranford would rather die than see one of their own fall by the wayside. It is the community spirit that inspires Miss Matty's friends to decide to donate a portion of their annual income to sustain their beloved friend when an investment goes sour.As a different kind of history book and one that very possibly the author did not set out to write as such, Cranford is actually an analysis of an early Victorian country town. The inhabitants are shaken and disturbed by inevitable changes such as industrialization, the advent of the railway and other events that force an inescapable transition into an increasingly modern world.The appeal of Cranford cannot be better described than in the popularity of the BBC drama series. The teleplay by Heidi Thomas was adapted from three novellas by Elizabeth Gaskell published between 1849 and 1858: Cranford, My Lady Ludlow, and Mr. Harrison's Confessions. (The Last Generation in England was also used as a source.)A gentle, charming read, Cranford has much more to offer the discerning reader than a unassuming look at country life."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This was a birthday gift for my younger granddaughter. I was very pleased with the item and the shipping. She was delighted to receive the book. I will shop first at Amazon for everything I am wanting to purchase."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"delivery time and price of book where great, I just wish the deliveries to Australia werent so high!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Loosely linked stories (sometimes described as a novel) about a group of spinsters and widows living in a small English town in the first half of the nineteenth century. They have small private incomes (Matty has 127 pounds a year and a pound contained a third of an ounce of gold - a new silk dress costs five pounds) and observe lives constrained by etiquette and class distinction. It has been praised for its &quot;gentle&quot; humor (although I was chilled by the &quot;Irish beggarwoman&quot; saying her children were starving who gets the door shut in her face). I think you have to have a certain interest in how life was lived in 1850 to read it through. In this edition, with the explanatory note it is mine of information on domestic arrangements. The narrator often points out how old-fashioned these ladies are and what fasions are new and draws comparisons going back over fifty years. This adds an extra dimension. The train has arrived but sedan chairs are still used. Some of the explanatory notes are written in British English that needs more explanation to Americans. The introduction by Charlotte Mitchell says a lot more about the place of this book in feminist history. Basically it is something you'd read for historical interest rather than immediate entertainment. I did not laugh out loud or find it hard to stop turning the pages."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is the best book ever! Why don't more people know how good this author's books are?

In fact Dickens was the editor of the publication this novel first appeared in.I highly recommend this novel for those who enjoy Victorian prose."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"What I like most about this book and the two related novellas is that the author is clearly someone who has little to worry about in her life.

I wish Penguin would release more books in such high quality editions.I'd never read any of Gaskell's work before, so Cranford was a pleasant surprise. It's a lively and warm-hearted novel which will appeal to fans of Garrison Keillor and Alexander McCall Smith.Another reviewer described Cranford as \\"not a novel at all, but rather a series of nostalgic sketches.\\" Certainly Cranford is nostalgic, perhaps even sentimental, but it's more than a series of sketches. I would go so far as to say that Cranford demonstrates a remarkable tightness of plot and character development, though Gaskell works with such a light touch (and elliptical style) that I can see how it would be easy to overlook the unity of the whole novel. If you read Cranford as a collection of anecdotes, I encourage you to ask yourself which parts could be removed without undermining the book."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"In the last few years or so, I've been noting a resurgence of a writer who was very popular in nineteenth century England. Not quite as famous as Charles Dickens or Anthony Trollope, Elizabeth Gaskell did find a niche writing about everyday people in the small towns and villages that dotted England's landscape.Cranford is a slim collection of vignettes. Each little story explores a person, a gathering, or an incident in the past or present. Some are humourous, others are very poignant, and some just look at the life and manners of the time. In specific, to one particular group in the village.For Cranford, as we are told in the opening sentence, is a place that is governed by Amazons. The Amazons are a group of elderly spinsters or widows who have fallen into genteel poverty, supported by meager savings left from legacies and inheritances. As a group, they inhabit nearly all of the homes of Cranford, deciding on questions of taste and morality, the correct behavior of servants, managing gardens, discretion in clothing and so forth. And where are the men, you might ask? Nearly all of them have fled, it seems -- to the military, to the navy, to the nearby city of Dumble (a stand-in for Manchester), frightened off, no doubt, by the formidable array of feminity before them.As the 'leaders,' there are the two daughters of the former vicar of the town. Miss Jenkyns and her younger sister Miss Matty, have risen to a level of respectability in the community, leading their little bevy of companion in acts of charity, mourning, welcoming (and shunning) strangers, and even to such details as what is to be considered suitable literature. When we first meet them, the town has been sent into turmoil by the arrival of a retired military man with two daughters -- and he has the temerity to actually suggest books to Miss Jenkyns. Horrors!But there is more to the story, and as the nameless narrator leads us through the various members of the village, there are stories that are humourous, such as when a string of burglaries occurs, or when a traveling magician arrives. Other stories are very poignant, such as Miss Matty and a collection of old letters, or when a bank in Dumble defaults and one person's savings are wiped out.What makes this collection stand out is the level of compassion between the various women as their little world is shaken up by the encroaching Industrial Age, and their somewhat stubborn intent on keeping their village just the way it is. And underneath some of the bristly exteriors, there are acts of selflessness and care that they extend to each other. This and the humour that the author brought to each story, was what made the book for me.I really don't want to reveal much more of the book as not to spoil it for anyone. The collection itself is rather slim, just sixteen stories of about twenty pages long. Along with the stories, there are extensive notes that have been added by Patricia Ingham, which really do help to understand the terms and usage of the language, and help to clear up some very unfamiliar terms.All in all, a very enjoyable read that is much lighter in tone than most Victorian fiction. Great fun to read, and to sigh over as well.Four stars. Recommended."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"This is a really good edition of the book. If you by classic literature you know that some editions are better than others, this is a very good version of the The Cranford Chronicles. This volume houses Mr. Harrison's Confessions(86 pages), Cranford (188 pages), My Lady Ludlow (203 pages).The type is not ridiculously small it's pretty average, this is a very readable version of the Cranford Chronicles. The story of the town of Cranford and it's inhabitants, the comings and goings, the slow and steady development of the women of Cranford and their coming together."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not a novel, not an anthology of short stories, Cranford is perhaps best described as a cohesive series of vignettes. Recounted by a young woman of about 30 from the city of Drumble [Manchester], these stories depict family, friendship, and love lost and found in a village dominated by poor but genteel spinsters and widows. \\". . . all the holders of houses, above a certain rent, are women.\\" Small, rural, and elitist in its way, Cranford is a place out of time, where faded fashions and proprieties still matter.Gaskell begins Cranford with a series of descriptive statements. Some are accurate, while others prove to be ironic. For example, \\"Although the ladies of Cranford know all each other's proceedings, they are exceedingly indifferent to each other's opinions.\\" While discovering Cranford and the Amazons who possess it, we also learn the dry perspective and voice of the narrator, who clearly loves the village while gently highlighting the foibles of its female inhabitants. \\"But I will answer for it, the last gigot, the last tight and scanty petticoat in wear in England, was seen in Cranford--and seen without a smile.\\"Like Gaskell's Wives and Daughters, Cranford is focused on gender roles and the different lives of women and men. The sexes share many characteristics; Captain Brown and Peter Jenkyns display the thoughtful, neighborly solicitude associated with women (with Peter going so far as to don a woman's dress), while Miss Jenkyns (the woman Peter impersonates) exhibits a manly will and resolution. It is the opportunities they have and the way in which they live that separates the sexes. Captain Brown, Peter, and Signor Brunoni have traveled and seen some of the world, and have even influenced it, while Miss Jenkyns, Miss Matty, Miss Price, the narrator, and their friends are constrained by their gender, gentility, and social code to hearth and home. Here, they perform their small household tasks, including ensuring that their maidservants are not disturbed or distracted by \\"followers,\\" or interested young men. The social code that prevents any of them from working in \\"trade\\" also determines the hours that can be spent outside the home. \\"Then there were rules and regulations for visiting and calls . . . 'from twelve to three are our calling-hours.'\\"In such a small, interconnected village, everything that happens is noteworthy, and every decision is important if the occasionally cruel social order is to be maintained. \\"The whole town knew and kindly regarded Miss Betty Barker's Alderney,\\" whose fall into a lime-pit warrants Captain Brown's advice, \\"Get her a flannel waistcoat and flannel drawers . . .,\\" so the narrator can ask the reader incredulously, \\"Do you ever seen cows dressed in grey flannel in London?\\" Miss Matty's decision not to marry against her family's wishes keeps the peace at great personal cost, and her wistful decision to allow Martha to have a follower recompenses her later when the outside world intrudes into her realm with its ugly realities--one of the many signs that Cranford must and will change. When Lady Glenmire renounces her title and takes the name of Mrs. Hoggins upon her remarriage, Cranford reels with shock and dismay, and it takes Peter Jenkyns, and his broader perspective from India, to reconcile the village and its de facto leader, Mrs. Jamieson, with the new ways.The narrator, who divides her time between her father in the progressive world of Drumble and the slowly and reluctantly changing Cranford, finds herself under the village's influence. As an observer, she describes the complex set of rules that governs Cranford society and the social slights they necessitate, not without a sense of regret. She is aware of the absurdity of Cranford society's beliefs and behavior combined with expediency, such as the occasion of Miss Betty Barker's party for the Cranford elite. \\"'Oh, gentility!' thought I, 'can you endure this last shock?'\\" when \\"all sorts of good things for supper\\" appear. \\". . . we thought it better to submit graciously, even at the cost of our gentility--which never ate suppers in general--but which, like most non-supper-eaters, was particularly hungry on all special occasions.\\" More seriously, she pities Miss Matty and her lost love and life, and like her other well-meaning friends determines that she shall be happy.With the arrival of Signor Brunoni and the ensuing panic over the perceived crime wave that seems to hit Cranford, the narrator loses some of her wryness and seems to become nearly as frightened by the rumors of strangers and robberies as her elderly friends. It is the new outsider, Lady Glenmire, who \\"never had heard of any actual robberies; except that two little boys had stolen some apples from Farmer Benson's orchard and that some eggs had been missed on a market-day off Widow Hayward's stall.\\" Even while caught up in the panic, however, \\"I could not help being amused at Jenny's position . . ..\\" When she speaks of Jenny's ghost, the narrator says, \\". . . for there was no knowing how near the ghostly head and ears might be . . ..\\"Through the narrator, who seems to represent Gaskell's own perspective, Cranford pokes gentle fun at a time and place that had already become a fairy tale-like setting, where goodness outdoes pettiness, justice prevails over setbacks and hardships, and even the prodigal son (or prince) can return to set things right. In Cranford, Gaskell reminds the reader of a recent past that is both amusing and moving, a time to look upon fondly but without regret for the changes that Peter and the marriage of Lady Glenmire/Mrs. Hoggins bring about. The one constant in life is change, and in Cranford change is at least as much for the better as for the worse."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Elizabeth Gaskell's Wives & Daughters and North & South have recently become two of my favorite books, so it stood to reason that I should check out her other novels. When I read Cranford I already knew that it wouldn't have a coherent plot, so I wasn't disappointed about that. What I found was a short but slow read made charming because of Gaskell's humor and elegant style of writing.Plotwise, it reminded me of L.M. Montgomery's stories, because Montgomery usually features young girls being brought up by dominant spinsters in small towns. Cranford doesn't include children of any variety, but similar quirks of aging ladies and domestic life are depicted. Of course, Gaskell's writing is not quite as saccharine as Montgomery's.Men are so rare in this novel that they are great curiosities, to the main characters and to the reader. My only complaint is that the narrator (I think her name was Mary Smith) did not talk more about herself. Was she destined to grow old without love just like her friend Miss Mattie?This isn't a book I would read more than once or twice. I can't imagine that I would have enjoyed as much if I hadn't already been obsessed with the author."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Not really a novel, but more of a series of stories of the narrators recalling of her time spent in the fictional Cranford. Quite funny in parts (\\"When it was ended, she turned to me, and said with mild dignity, 'Fetch me \\"Rasselas,\\" my dear , out of the book-room.\\" You know things are going to heat up when someone is going to go and get the Dr.). Once upon a time writers used to have love for their characters they created, which I believe is why so little of fiction from the last 50-100 years or more appeals to me.Unfortunately, the Introduction is a horror of modern criticism bugaboo gone wild. I'm remined of Kerouac's saying \\"I have the critics explaing me to me.\\" This is the sort of intro that trots out the writers (and what about the practise of putting the editor, the person who does the introduction, and the likes, NAME on the cover, inside and everywhere else, as large as the Authors? Its quite funny to look up a writer on Amazon and see someone elses name tagged along, as if Dante and Homer and the rest had a helper writer we didn't know about!) pet peeves and overly biased views: \\"In his healthy appetite for food ('the peas were going wholesale into his capacious mouth,' p. 33) we see an image of sexual appetite, unhampered by social shibboleths.\\" We do? Maybe you do, but I don't. It's amazing how many writers attribute their loony views to poor writers who, in all probability, meant no such thing (Freud, Fraud, Freud...). And they can't refute such nonsense and drivel, most being dead (and being dead being beyond refutation)."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"These little stories are about life and love in the mid-nineteenth century. This book was first printed as serials as so many books were at that time. By the time Mrs. Gaskell wrote Cranford, she was extremely popular with the English people. This book is essentially a comedy of manners. The people in Cranford live genteelly and they are very proud of that fact even if they don't have much money. The book is about four old ladies and the life they lead. Mrs. Gaskell's characterizations are wonderful. Their lives consist of tea, cards and gossip. This is a book about ladies. There are very few men in it, but we certainly get a good description of the male species from the ladies' observations. It's a wonderful world that Mrs. Gaskell has created for us.

At the center of the novel is a circle of spinster and widowed females who wrestle mightily with the challenges of lives of genteel poverty. On its surface, \\"Cranford\\" is a comedy of manners, but its episodes have surprising and often moving depth.\\"Cranford\\" was originally published as a series of short stories, all narrated by Miss Mary Smith, a frequent visitor to the village and the young friend of its leading spinster ladies Miss Deborah and Miss Matty Jenkyns. The chapters are therefore not quite chronological in the telling; characters overlap but plot lines appear, disappear, and sometimes reappear.The narrative works through the relationships of the circle of women, as they deal with births and deaths, marriages, questions of fashion and manners, and such mundane events as a traveling magic show and a bank failure. Men are suffered to live in Cranford, but it seems that it is the women who actually arrange everything important in the village. The reader cannot help but be drawn into their lives through Gaskell's authentic dialogue and superb sense of place.\\"Cranford\\" was the basis for a Masterpiece Theater mini-series in the Spring of 2008, and is well worth reading on its own for its sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle now a distant memory.

Take one of those wonderful, wonderful novels, delete all the men, all the romance, and all the passionate class critique, and that leaves CRANFORD.All I can say is, this novel is like Barbara Pym's QUARTET IN AUTUMN or her EXCELLENT WOMEN, only more so. More old ladies, more \\"spasms and flutterings\\" of old ladies (to borrow from Andrew Davies' P&P; screenplay), more petty snobberies and antimacassars.A plot of some sort does rear its head at about 75%, but don't look for one before then.

Here is an idea for Dover Press: Rename the line Dover Classics, Dover Thrift makes it sound like a book you buy at a Goodwill for a quarter- have some class, some pride- after all you are publishing classics.Gaskell was a well known literary figure in her day- she wrote non-fiction as well as fiction, including a biography of her homie Charlotte Bronte.

A charming tale of leisurely--but never idle--life in the era, the author's cunning wit and ladylike charm adorn every page. In the oddly Amazonian town of Cranford, all the men have gone off to seek their fortunes in nearby indutry or simply never were born; the ladies of Cranford, then, occupy their time with ever-modest hostessing, challenging games of Preference, and demure speculation on the comings and goings of the penny-ante gentry that breeze through their midst.

This book is indeed full of funny, ridiculous and heartwarming stories about some old-fashioned but really friendly and kind-hearted women (mostly old maids or widows) living in this little town called Cranford. I think Mrs. Gaskell did a good job in bring up themes like the confrontation of the old and new world, the comparsion between the life in an industrial city like Drumble (believed to be based on Manchester) and the little tranquil town Cranford.

Other times the same effect can be achieved by a slow novel about middle-aged women and their daily troubles.Pettiness and kindness, age and genders, nobles and lowborn, progress and tradition, all come together and weave the tapestry of rural middle England of the 1840's.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"I would like to begin by saying that this book is very little like the PBS production that is being aired on TV right now. There are many characters that make their way into the miniseries, but many that the producers seem to have borrowed from other Gaskell novels. However, though the producers do not stick to the plot of the book, I feel they have captured the spirit of Cranford.If anyone were to ask me what this book is about, I am not quite sure what to tell them. In essence, it is a book about nothing in particular and everything meaningful in general. The key characters are elderly ladies who, like prim Amazons in middle-aged caps, look after each other and those around them. The adventures in this story are so mild, yet taken so seriously by the characters, that I was myself as excited as they were to learn that a magician had come to Cranford, or that the new fashions had arrived, or that a Lady was to marry someone quite beneath her. The most moving part of the whole story is Miss Matti's past love, a love that she sacrificed for the sake of her family. Her stories brought many tears to my eyes.Overall, I am so impressed with how such a simple story could be so altogether moving, and, quite unexpectedly, very fast paced. I read it very quickly yet I feel as if the tale will live with me forever."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"It's true that the novel \\"Cranford\\" doesn't mirror the recent Masterpiece dramatization, however this is because the adaptation was based on a series of Mrs. Gaskell's works, of which \\"Cranford\\" is only one. The others are \\"Mr. Harrison's Confessions\\", \\"My Lady Ludlow\\" and \\"The Last Generation in England\\". Taken together, all four give a complete -and more familiar- portrait of the delightful village we saw televised. I recommend each of them highly."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"Cranford by Elizabeth Gaskell, follows the lives of a group of women living in a small English town.I enjoyed this book very much. More of a collection of stories than a novel, it reminded me of The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens, to whom Mrs. Gaskell pays particular homage in more than one place in the book.Like most Victorian novels, the humor is droll and significant attention is played to social class. But it is also a quick, somewhat easy read, adjectives that don't usually come to mind when describing works of this era.This is a book about women, a point that Gaskell makes clear in the first line:\\"In the first place, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons; all the holders of houses above a certain rent are women.\\"And while the middle-aged spinsters of Cranford are a far cry from the women warriors who came to the assistance of the Greeks at Troy, the stereotypical rich, handsome man who comes to marry the woman in distress and therefore saves the day is absent from this story.Told through the eyes of Mary Smith, the two main characters of the novel, Miss Deborah Jenkyns and her sister Matty, put me very much in the mind of the Miss Brownings in Gaskell's final novel, Wives and Daughters. The foibles and misadventures of these two sisters and their circle of friends often had me laughing out loud.This is a delightful book. Written at a time when a woman's worth was often tied to how well she married, the gently humorous but dignified way in which Gaskell treats her characters in this novel is lovely."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A delightful portrait of a somnolent English village in mid-nineteenth century Midlands, striving to shut out the noisy industrializing forces changing the world as they knew it. Vivid portraits of the largely single women--spinsters or widows--who dominate the social life of the town and their struggles to control who gets invited to tea parties etc and who doesn't, their criticisms of who doesn't observe the proprieties, and their underlying good-heartedness. In other words, Gaskell observes the manners and the people of this world with great insight and wit, not just looking at struggles to define etiquette but also at the last vestiges of a peaceful rural place and the changes being thrust upon its classes--working, middle, and nobility."},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A very quick review. A beautifully written book filled with the feminine niceties and social customs of provincial early 19th Century life. A very interesting read to myself as I was born at Cranford Lodge, Knutsford, the true market town in the north of England that Gaskell based her novel on. A visit to Knutsford itself brings out the flavour of the writing and tours of \\"Cranford\\" including Miss Matty's house and the Assembly Rooms at the George can be arranged through the Gaskell Society!"},{"Title":"Cranford","review":"A sweet, gentle story of a small English town not unlike Jan Karon's Mitford, only 150 years ago. No high drama- only caring people with all their flaws. I read it years ago and remembered it fondly. Reading it again recently, I was not disappointed. Don't miss this little jewel."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"I am what's called a &quot;Senior Engineer&quot;, I regularly have to read and make sense of very technical and obscure material. I have now been through this book three times slowly, and can not make sense of it. It seems to restate the contents of the manual but has not organized it in a way that helps me to make a connection between the functions of the cameras and the flash unit and their various combinations of possible settings.Maybe the publisher pushed him to get it done in an unreasonably short period of time.There are a few helpfull comments on the general subject of flash photography."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"Typical of Magic Lantern guides, this one does not disappoint. An excellent companion to the owner's manual, it also covers most of the capabilities of the predecessor flash units (SB-24, SB-25, SB-26) in Nikon's line of top flash units. Mr. Huber thoroughly details all of basic and advanced modes. He also includes a comprehensive review of the basics of electronic flash and gives recommendations on how to deal with specific situations."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"I read the instructions that came with the SB-28.

The sad thing is, this book is really necessary."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"Chock full of examples that the average photographer can relate to.

If you can't learn something from this book, you are either deluding yourself or should be writing your own book."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"I purchased this book with the hope that it would provide me with greater insight into using my SB-28. Ha. I don't think that I have ever come across a more confusing, ill-conceived book. It's enough to make one want to go back to flashcubes.The book is poorly organized--headings and topics pile on top of one another without purpose or reason--at least none that I can discern. The explanations often leave one hanging, longing for more detail or at least greater clarity. Frustrating? Let me tell you. I would definitely NOT recommend this book. I only give it one star because zero stars isn't an option."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"This Magic Lantern Guide is a genuine disappointment. I am an advanced amateur with 20 years of Nikon and Hasselblad experience. Usually, the Magic Lantern series lucidly fortifies your owner's manual. Not so, here. The Sb-28 Speedlight is a sophisticated device, reasonably well documented in its owner's manual. But, I craved a more thorough review of foreground and bacground exposure options. Most particularly, I hoped for a cogent explanation of using the Sb-28's exposure compensation controls in tandem with my F-100's custom setting, exposure compensation, and bracketing functions. This type of important and detailed discussion is missing from this book. Overall, the writing is confusing and awkward. The author spends too much time on the general basics of flash photogrphy and fails to focus on how to use the Sb-28."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"This book is a hard read; it is poorly organized and tough to follow. OK, so just use it as a reference book, right? Wrong. There's no index."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"Do not believe the promises made in the opening pages of this book. They are unfulfilled. Despite early protestations that this book will be better than, and different from, the instruction manual -- it is barely more than a bad rehash of the instruction manual with confusing additional information thrown in.When the author asks that &quot;due to constraints of time and cost&quot; we should excuse the &quot;artistic and aesthetic aspects&quot; of his illustrations, we should sense that this was a 'quick and dirty' effort. Forget the &quot;time and cost&quot; for photography! How about investing some conceptual and organizational thought -- and concern for the reader? (Isn't that what we are paying for?) In fact, this looks so 'quick and dirty' that it seems like different people actually wrote different parts, with little communication, and with no visible editorial control. Furthermore, the illustrations are often unrelated to the text. When related, I have seen many illustrations elsewhere that illustrate the point in the text much better.The book contradicts itself in places. For example, on page 30 it is claimed that &quot;the SB-28 uses a combined CONTROL OF flash energy via flash duration and FLASH OUTPUT ...&quot; [emphasis, mine] and then on pg. 140 we read &quot;To my knowledge, complex electronic CONTROL OF the actual FLASH OUTPUT is presently not used by any camera/autoflash mode ...&quot;. Since the context of these two sentences make it explicitly clear that the points being made are completely contradictory, one begins to lose faith in the veracity of other claims in the book.I read this book from cover-to-cover, twice, thinking it was my fault. What a waste of time! Even with my Ph.D. degree, I could make little sense of the author's intent. A bunch of facts thrown together and often repeated several times throughout the book, with little useful organization or explanation, poor illustrations, and no index. I found myself trying to re-write the book as I fought for understanding.You should not have to buy a book like this and then have to re-write it in order to understand it.Save your time and money.It gets one star, because I can't give zero stars!Do not be tempted by this bad apple from the (usually good) 'Magic Lantern' barrel."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"I will agree with the fellow reviewers on this book. Magic Lantern and Michael Huber must have been on vacation while writing this book. the book is called Nikon SB28 not Sb24 or SB25.

The Nikon owners manual is the one to use!"},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"Usually I glean at least a few useful facts from these Magic Lantern books, but not this time. Just stick with the manual."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"I was disappointed in this book, I only covers a bit more than the owners manual which is fairly clear. In many cases the author discribes the function of the speedlight but does not give examples of why you would want to use this function. Little is devoted to flash set up and planning of the shot. I would not bother with this book."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"Advice: Don't buy it! Cons: Confusing, less useful than the instruction manual"},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon Sb-28","review":"...I decided to buy this book.

I already had a fair understanding of the flash and the various modes, but I still had a few outstanding questions that I hoped this book could answer. The book just confused me and raised even more questions. The author's run-on sentences and poor grammar made for difficult reading and comprehension.

This is now one of my favorite Dorothy Garlock stories. Liberty is the perfect main character... feisty, defiant, and bold! I loved reading along as her temper gets the best of her... frequently!!! Farrway Quill is the typical strong woodsman that Ms. Garlock tends to write about... but with much more substance (though I still haven't found a better male character than Johnny Henry from Garlock's With Hope series).Characters from \\"Love and Cherish\\" appear (Juicy, Rain Tallman... and Sloan and Cherish Carroll's son, Colby Carroll) appear throughout the book. Rain and Colby being Farrway's closest friends.Though the time and location of the setting of this story is surrounded by the struggle of land between the indian and white man... this story tackles another danger, the struggle of the white man and what he will do for power. All of Ms. Garlock's books include a high respect for the indians, but also shows savages in both the indians and the white man. This book is no exception... and you'll be amazed at the strength of Liberty Carroll and the strength others find in themselves when near her.This story thought ended beautifully, left some interesting untied ends of revenge and love, knowing they will be settled in the next book - Dream River. I'm anxious to read this book, and excited that it is about Rain Tallman... as every time he appeared in this story, his character just stood out among all others."},{"Title":"Lonesome River (Wabash Series)","review":"When I read this book, I wanted to read &quot;Dream River&quot; because it featured my two favorite characters in the Wabash trilogy: Amy and Rain. I liked Libby and Farr but the closeness between them was underwritten. In the next two books, they seem to share an unbreakable bond that is envious to their family and friends but it is impossible to see how this closeness came about by reading this book. Although the readers can appreciate how and why Libby fell in love with Farr, Farr's love for Libby simply appeared. There was no explanation about how his lust for her turned to love. I like these two as individuals, but I did not see them as a couple until &quot;Dream River&quot; and &quot;River of Tomorrow&quot;. The story of Farr and Fawnella is heart-breaking and incredibly ernest. Also, Willa and Colby's romance is sweet. But the greatest love burns in the two kids, Amy and Rain, and they finally get their turn to shine in &quot;Dream River&quot;. &quot;Lonesome River&quot; has unforgettable characters, such as Juicy, Elija, Maude, and George Washington. These are colorful group of people, most of whom do not appear again in other books. A pity. All in all, this is a good book for everything except the lead players. The author should have focused more on them than on everything that was going on around them. Perhaps, she could not wait to get to the telling of Amy and Rain's story, just like I couldn't after I read this book."},{"Title":"Lonesome River (Wabash Series)","review":"I loved this book. It was in the true early Garlock style. Her characters are always true to their personalities and don't change, or suddenly see the light, so to speak. If they're bad, they stay that way.The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because the ending seemed a bit forced. Other than that, I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Lonesome River (Wabash Series)","review":"I have enjoyed the Dorothy Garlock Wabash River books, because of the accurate lifestyle details she includes for the particular time-period. One feels she is experiencing the daily hard work, sacrifices and simple joys of the characters. This author always captures the social philosophy of the book's setting and how it affects the lives of the characters.Garlock blends the family members of a previous book into the next, which makes each new book in the series even more enlightening. In no time after beginning Lonesome River, for example, I found myself engrossed in trying to fit the pieces of the puzzle of the book into place as the specific problems of the story are being solved.I was delighted with Lonesome River - couldn't put it down from beginning until end!"},{"Title":"Lonesome River (Wabash Series)","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a really long time. I liked Liberty right from the beginning, she is feisty, loyal and strong and lives up to her character all through the book. Farr is memorable, macho and Liberty's equal. I just wished that he had been a bit more in love than in lust in the beginning as the romance was a bit unsatisfactory. Felt like Liberty got cheated for a while in that aspect. But for all that its still a good book, and you'll remember them for a long time. This is not one of those books where you read it now, and pick it up a few years later not realizing you have already read it. You will remember Libby and Farr. Very good read."},{"Title":"Lonesome River (Wabash Series)","review":"This books is part of a trilogy, so be sure to get Dream River and River of Tomorrow.

Thank you"},{"Title":"The naturalist in La Plata (The collected works of W. H. Hudson)","review":"In The Naturalist in La Plata, Hudson does a good job of blending scientific content with interesting stories, anecdotes, and other tidbits from his observations of the area. Hudson grew up in the Pampas, and the book illustrates his special affinity for the region. Additionally, he has a love for nature and a respect for its wonders. An early environmentalist, Hudson often laments man's destruction of nature in this volume, presenting wonderful arguments as to the value of convservation. I probably wouldn't recommend this as an easy leisure read, but it is a good example of naturalist writing. Hudson's stories and obvious admiration of nature keep the book from being too dry."},{"Title":"The naturalist in La Plata (The collected works of W. H. Hudson)","review":"Every page of \\"The Naturalist in La Plata\\" is steeped in the sights,sounds and smells of nature. The tone of the writing is one of 19th century grace and charm. The author writes of his personal observations of the Argentine pampas,both the land and its life-forms. He was particularly interested in animal behavior, especially that of birds. Some of the stories about animals, such as the puma and the huanaco ,incorporate native legends as well as his own scientific speculations. Some topics covered include dancing rituals of certain birds,facts and thoughts about spiders, the graveyard of the huanacos, curious animal weapons and many more. The character of the pampas is also revealed as a backdrop to the animal anecdotes. There is no sensationalism or sentimentality, but rather a wonder and appreciation for nature as manifested in a particular landscape. I found it to be a pleasant excursion to an unfamiliar but fascinating territory."},{"Title":"The naturalist in La Plata (The collected works of W. H. Hudson)","review":"W. H. Hudson wrote two classics of late 19th century English literature and yet today is almost unknown. Both works, \`Green Mansions,\` and \`The Purple Land,\` take place in South America, the former in the verdant jungles of Venezuela, the latter (highly praised by Hemingway) in Uruguay. Raised on a farm in Patagonia, Hudson eventually emigrated to England, pining away his final years with a deep nostalgia for South America.\\"The Naturalist in La Plata,\` is the well-ripened fruit of such nostalgia. In it, Hudson comprised an amazing compendium of essays , all centered around the unique wildlife of the Argentine grasslands. Any naturalist, amateur or professional, will enjoy reading these informative and engaging essays on topics as diverse as, \`Music and Dancing in Nature,\` \`The Strange Instincts of Cattle,\` Fear in Birds, \`Some Curious Animal Weapons,\` and many others.The real joy in reading this book is twofold. First, W.H. Hudson was a man far ahead of his time. A pioneer conservationist in an age of glorified extermination hunting, Hudson\`s thoughts on species preservation will resonate with many an eco-minded reader of today.\\"The life of even a single species is of incalculably greater value to mankind for what it teaches and would continue to teach than all the chiseled marbles and painted canvases the world contains.\\" Regarding the murderous hunts of his day, Hudson laments that the age\`s motto should be, \\"Let us slay all noble and beautiful things, for tomorrow we die.\\" Hudson\`s belief in the interconnectedness of all life was revolutionary for its time.The second reason one should spend time with this remarkable writer and scholar is for his rare mastery of the English sentence. On cursory inspection, Hudson\`s English appears clunky, long-winded, leaden with unnecessary ornamentation. Yet, digested slowly and thoroughly, Hudson\`s prose comes alive and reveals hidden gems. Take for instance the following sentence, \\"I hasten to say that the hu&aacute;nuco or guanaco as it is often spelt, is not a perishing species; nor as things are, is it likely to perish soon, despite the fact that civilized men, Britons especially, are now enthusiastically engaged in the extermination of all the nobler mammalians:---a very glorious crusade, the triumphant conclusion of which will doubtless be witnessed by the succeeding generation, more favored in this respect than ours.\\" Despite their serpentine length, such sentences contain a myriad of fact and opinion.\`The Naturalist in La Plata' abounds in such seemingly prolix sentences, which can easily bog down the impatient reader. Yet, given time and effort, Hudson\`s prose style can be mastered and even enjoyed for its unique combination of clarity and beauty. And for those hardy souls who manage to reach its end, \`The Naturalist in La Plata\` rewards greatly with fascinating and stimulating snippets from a great naturalist\`s notebook. One can learn about the intricate dancing rituals of many bird species, about the social complexity of the vizcacha, about the primordial migrations of the guanaco as well as other fascinating tidbits of nature lore.Whether one is an armchair naturalist or just a lover of fine English prose, W.H. Hudson\`s \`The Naturalist in La Plata\` will surely please."},{"Title":"Handbook of Water Use and Conservation: Homes, Landscapes, Industries, Businesses, Farms","review":"Amy Vicker's Handbook Of Water Use And Conversation is a vast, scholarly, yet eminently practical guide and reference work enabling the reader to skillfully get the most use out of the least water, whether one is attempting to conserve for one's home, business, industry, or farm.

This book corrals the eclectic conservation field for the first time into a single comprehensive volume that offers advice on conservation planning as well as the best available information on domestic water use and efficiency, landscape water use and efficient design, industrial and commercial demand, and agricultural use and conservation.Amy Vickers, who has degrees in engineering and philosophy, has been a leader in the fields of water conservation and integrated resources management for more than 10 years. Unlike most conservation experts who have focused their efforts on the arid West and Southwest regions, Vickers has built her consulting practice on the East Coast. Her clients include water providers across North America and Europe, giving her a broad understanding of water planning issues and efficiency practices and technologies. The Handbook of Water Use and Conservation, which took Vickers more than five years to research and write, is a melding of her own experience and the latest research efforts into water use and conservation effectiveness.Vickers approaches water use and conservation as an engineer. The Handbook details scientifically sound conservation practices and measures that offer verifiable water savings. The book includes the expected and often re-hashed discussion of low-volume toilets, but it also provides an extensive consideration and analysis of new waterless toilet technologies including waterless urinals, composting toilets, and incinerator toilets. The Handbook of Water Use and Conservation is populated with hundreds of photos, charts, tables, and water use statistics that illustrate how conservation technologies work and what savings can be expected.This book should be required reading for new water conservation specialists entering the field and it is an invaluable reference for anyone working in the field of water conservation."},{"Title":"Handbook of Water Use and Conservation: Homes, Landscapes, Industries, Businesses, Farms","review":"I have found myself lately in the loop of western conservation literature, and with all the talk of water I really only found one place to go.

If you ever considered what the office would be like with waterless urinals, and it's impact on water consumption per person in the office, this book is for you! This book escapes a lot of the chit chat and gets to the answers that you seek. Be warned, this is an academic book with real applications, facts, and statistics that are heavily researched. Don't pick up this book if you want to hear a fairy tale of how a drop of water from one of the poles made it's way to the kitchen sink. Pick up this book if you want to carry on intelligent conversation about water conservation solutions with modern day technology, pick up this book if you want to take that step forward in the home or at the office.

Also, the card tent that gives tasting tips were helpful for the wanna be serious tasters to learn what to taste for. I learned that there is not much in a wine tasting party as long as you have lots food and wine (other than the blind bottles). We blind tasted 6 bottles of red wines of different grapes and varietals and price. The guest rated the wines based upon what they liked the best on a scale of 1 to 10 and logged their preferences on the tasting note forms. We had a couple bottles costing over $60 and one under $15. To all of our surprise, the $25 bottle won! It was all good and fun. All 25 of my guests want another tasting party again, which might be based upon varietals rather then different types of wines.The kit is made for a small party of about 6 people because the kit supplied 100 tasting note forms. We hardly used all of the forms because about half of my guest didn't bother rating the wines. However, they knew which bottle they liked and were surprised by the winner at the unveiling ceremony. The bottle bags are a rich burgundy color which were enhanced by the sparkling crystal tasting glasses. It was an impressive table setting. I didn't have a clue on hosting a wine tasting party. If like me, this kit is a good first start."},{"Title":"The Wine Tasting Party Kit: Everything You Need to Host a Fun & Easy Wine Tasting Party at Home","review":"It wasn't expensive so I shouldn't complain but I found the quality a little disappointing.

In under 200 pages, Heywood traces the origins of scholarly interest in the history of childhood, summarizes Philippe Aries's classic work and the major critiques of it, and outlines current thinking on several major topics, including infancy, early childhood, the \\"third stage\\" (from age 7 through adolescence), children's labor, and education. Heywood's treatment of each topic is inevitably very brief, and while he cites numerous primary sources, he sometimes uses them uncritically. I did not learn much history from this book; if you're looking for an engaging overview of childhood in early modern and modern times, I would recommend Steven Mintz's Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood or something similar. The merit of Heywood's History of Childhood lies in Heywood's extremely clear and succinct laying out of the major themes and research questions in the field. It would be useful to a graduate student preparing for comps or to someone who is just beginning a research project on some aspect of the history of childhood."},{"Title":"A History of Childhood: Children and Childhood in the West from Medieval to Modern Times (Themes in History)","review":"This book is a good general start for studying children's history.

Anyway, I look forward to more scholarly interest in something so fundamental to our lives as childhood."},{"Title":"Opening the Heavens: Accounts of Divine Manifestations, 1820-1844","review":"In this monumental collection of firsthand historical narratives, \\"Opening the Heavens\\" comes very close or fulfilling the bold prediction of the editor in his assertion that \\"this book . . . may be one of the most important LDS Church history books you will ever read. . . .\\" (from the Introduction). John W. Welch has assembled an impressive collection of original documents relating to six foundational topics in Mormon history: 1) the first vision; 2) the coming forth of The Book of Mormon; 3) the restoration of the priesthood; 4) Joseph Smith's lifetime visionary experiences; 5) the restoration of temple keys; and 6) succession in the presidency.In scope, this collection can only be compared with Dan Vogel's five volume collection of \\"Early Mormon Documents,\\" published between 1996 and 2003. However, unlike Vogel's comprehensive collection, Welch focuses almost exclusively upon firsthand and contemporaneous sources. This is refreshing, since the chief problem with Vogel's collection is that it casts its nets so wide as to include much material of dubious historical value. I have found Vogel's collection to be very helpful, but have often lamented that much by way of hearsay and polemics has been presented side by side with firsthand contemporaneous documents of great historical value. To use a legal analogy, Welch's collection seems closer to what might be \\"admissible\\" evidence in a court of law, whereas Vogel's collection seeks to bring in a vast quantity of pure hearsay and speculation from \\"witnesses\\" far removed from the actual events of Church history. After all, how much weight should we accord to a hearsay statement only first recorded forty, fifty or sixty years after the actual events?Welch has not only provided faithful transcriptions of the actual documents themselves, but insightful essays written on each of the six chief topics.While these essays are interesting, it is the documents themselves which are the precious jewels of this book.I agree with Welch's insightful comment that \\"a generation from now, few people will care how various historians in our day have interpreted the past. . . But the original documents convey testimonies that will always be of the utmost interest.\\" (From the Introduction).With these collections by Vogel and now Welch, in hand, the day should be long past in studies of Church history, when any reader possessed of reasonable intelligence should put much further credence in the rarified theories of professional historians. Few academic writers have ever been honest enough to \\"proclaim their malefactions\\" - their personal bias - in their writing, pretending, instead that their work is \\"scientific.\\" What many historical writers - both apologists and critics - fail to admit is that, \\"A fact is a fact\\", until you begin to string two or more facts together. Then it becomes a work of the imagination and not a science.I have a few additional comments, criticisms and disappointments regarding this collection, as follows:1. The best commentary in this set, by far, is that which precedes the collection of documents relating to the first vision. The excellent essay by Dean Jesse, and especially the one by James B. Allen and Welch himself, far exceed the others in clarity. Joseph Smith's ten accounts of the first vision, contained in thirteen documents, are then presented chronologically. Welch and Allen use the very helpful tool of providing charts summarizing the contents of each of the ten accounts.2. Welch's collection of documents on the coming forth of the Book of Mormon is of almost equal clarity and quality to the collection on the first vision.3. While the collection of priesthood restoration documents edited by Brian Q. Cannon is well presented, Cannon's commentary itself leaves something to be desired. I felt as if his writing lacks the clarity found in the previous essays of Jesse, Allen and Welch.4. Most disappointing in this collection is the essay and collection by Alexander L. Baugh. In fact, there really isn't a collection of documents here, but only chronology and summary of seventy-six \\"visionary experiences\\" received by the Prophet during his lifetime. Why weren't the documents themselves published here? The chronology prepared by Baugh is helpful, but I want to see the documents, not merely Baugh's rather pedestrian essay.5. The documents and essay regarding \\"Succession in the Presidency\\" are also disappointing, in that they focus solely upon the \\"mantle of the prophet\\" experience of 1844, and not upon other key events, such as the \\"rolling off of the keys\\" upon the Twelve or the additional authority conferred upon the Twelve in conjunction with the restoration of temple keys and the activities of the \\"quorum of the anointed\\" in Nauvoo from 1842 to 1844, etc.6. Even with its several problems and disappointments, after a first reading I tend to agree with John Welch's initial suggestion that this \\"may be one of the most important LDS Church history books you will ever read.\\"Excellent book well worthy of the highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Opening the Heavens: Accounts of Divine Manifestations, 1820-1844","review":"I have always been a fan of LDS church history, and was thrilled to get my hands on this collection of primary sources of key events of the restoration. It contained many of the documents that I had read throughout my life in various sources, but the true treasure was the many other versions of events that I hadn't read before. An example is that it contained all 8 known versions of Joseph Smith's account of the first vision. I read five of these for the first time in this book. It also contained five second hand accounts of the first vision I had not read before.There are a total of six sections in this book covering the first vision, the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the restoration of the priesthood, various visions, the restoration of the temple keys, and the mantle of the prophet Joseph being passed to Brigham Young. Each section begins with an essay summarizing the various accounts, which I found useful. The highlights of each section are the individual accounts of the events.This book gave me a much better understanding of the details of these major events. There is nothing like seeing things from many different perspectives in both time and by individual to give one a big picture view of what really happened. As a believing Mormon, it has strengthened my testimony of the hand of God in the latter day restoration. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in LDS church history; this is an essential volume."},{"Title":"In the Red","review":"Geremie R.

Swindoll (Easyread Type)","review":"This book is a great read. It is humorous and yet has a great message that people need to read and take to heart.Rusty Roses"},{"Title":"Laugh Again: Charles R. Swindoll (Easyread Type)","review":"Swindoll's dated book (1992 hardback) claims to be about laughter but it's really a mostly dry Bible study on \\"joy\\" in the New Testament book of Philippians. It is NOT a book that looks into laughter in the scripture--as a matter of fact he ignores the fact that there ISN'T laughter in the New Testament! Instead he misinterprets the word \\"joy\\" for \\"laughter\\" and \\"happiness.\\" Those are all very different things.He doesn't use many practical examples--this is mostly a sermon-like, verse-by-verse approach to Philippeans. When he does use examples they are odd choices of people who actually disprove his theories. Mother Teresa is one of the first he mentions, quoting her about the need to be joyful, but the saintly woman who rarely smiled was not talking about laughing! He also mentions former coach Tom Landry (a real sourpuss whenever shown on TV) and British author Malcolm Muggeridge (one of the saddest-looking people ever). So while Swindoll tries to claim the book is about laughter, in reality he can't find laughter in the New Testament nor in the people he uses as examples!Most offensive is his swipe at the Pope--in discussing the word \\"saints\\" (why is that needed in this book?) he claims that \\"Pope John Paul II has been sainting more men and women than all of his predecesors in the 20th century.\\" He then briefly explains what the Catholic church requires to be a saint, then says, \\"I should also add you need a pretty good slug of money to saint people.\\" What? They don't saint people in order to make money! His views are archaic and demeaning to Catholic readers.His interpretation of Scripture is just strange in many places--he takes a simple word and then twists it to fit a different meaning. He says that \\"the most Christlike attitude on earth\\" is NOT LOVE but is being \\"unselfish\\" (how this ties into the theme of the book isn't exactly stated!). He also claims that he has studied Jesus and \\"I find no evidence of impatience or anxious irritability as I study his life.\\" What? Did he skip over Jesus sweating blood before he was crucified or turning over the tables in the Temple?He isn't preaching the pure word of God...he is preaching his own word and then supporting it with scriptures that really don't have anything to do with what he concludes. The theme of the book is a good example--\\"Laugh Again\\" implies that God wants you to laugh, yet there is nothing in scripture that supports that. Does he show there are some verses that support \\"joy\\"? Yes--but that is not the same as laughter and often those joy verses come from Paul who wrote of having joy through his serious pain. Paul wasn't laughing as he was being whipped in prison, though he did \\"count it all joy.\\"This is the first Swindoll book I have read and will be the last--he is tricky in his twisting of scripture and creating a conclusion that just isn't there. I was looking for steps to be happy and instead came away unhappy."},{"Title":"Laugh Again: Charles R.

Swindoll (Easyread Type)","review":"A person who experiences joy is not one who has an absence of troubles, but one who has learned to live abundantly in spite of circumstances. Swindoll tells us life was meant to be enjoyed, not merely endured. He advises us not to let circumstances control our emotions. On page 19 he writes &quot;There is nothing better than a joyful attitude when we face the challenges life throws at us.&quot; We told to laugh in spite of, not because of circumstances. He tells us to relish the moment. Live life in the now.The confidence such people have is based in God. They trust His love, His sovereignty, His plan, although they may not see what the future holds.The apostle Paul is a role model of living a life of this nature. Swindoll says Paul drained every drop of joy out of every day (p. 27).Chapter two tells us that joy is a choice we make. It is a decision made from our own free will.Chapter three sells us on this joyful way to live. We're told to regularly deposit the right kind of emotions in our internal bank (p. 51).This book is full of positive, solid, Scriptural principles for how to live the life Jesus intended His followers to live.It is a powerfully strong book."},{"Title":"Laugh Again: Charles R. Swindoll (Easyread Type)","review":"This book is a prime example of how an able Bible expositor can sometimes rework a scripture text in order to make it say what he wants it to say. Swindoll does this throughout his book LAUGH AGAIN, which is a loose exposition of the book of Philippians. He substitutes the word \`laughter' for \`joy' and transforms the book of Philippians into a message that helps us to laugh about life. His application of the first eleven verses of Phillipians 1 is that we begin to laugh again when we place our full confidence in God (p. 44, large print edition). Moreover, his title for the chapter on Philippians 2:12-18 is \\"While Laughing, Keep your Balance.\\" When Swindoll is determined to teach something that isn't in the text, his exposition tends to go awry, and that is exactly what happens in this book.Dr. Swindoll would have been farther ahead to write a book about experiencing more joy in your life and letting Philippians speak for itself. Not only would joy have been a relevant topic of discussion, but this approach would have modeled for his readers how to handle scripture. I do not recommend this book, but Swindoll has written other books that I do recommend heartily, including his GROWING DEEP IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE and his book PAUL from the stories of great lives series."},{"Title":"Laugh Again: Charles R.

Once you meet the hysterically klutzy Hal, you can't help thinking that he's Clark Kent, minus the Superman counterpart. But he does come to Lili's rescue playing the faux beau for a family get together.This book made me laugh, you just never know what Hal was going to do next. He reminded me so much of Clark Kent and Henry Grubstick (Betty's sweet and hunky accountant boyfriend on Ugly Betty) with all the typical male idiosyncrasies . There were times where he just didn't have a clue about women - and that just made this novel even funnier. Then when he did get it right, he'd turn around and do something totally guy-like to ruin the moment. And you can't help but laugh or wince.And Lili, Oy! The goofy trouble she puts herself through. The tangled web she wove just to get her tight knit family off her back about getting married. She gets more than she pays for when she hires Hal from Love Match, an escort agency, for this family gathering. She has to deal with bumps, bruises, and finally a bunch of broken hearts when her plan backfires on her, Hal, and her family big time.Lili's family also plays some pretty funny parts as they try to figure out what Hal (known to them as Dr. David Mulder) is all about. Hal will say things in ad-lib trying to play up his make believe character leaving them scratching their heads in confusion or disbelief. One moment they love him, the next they want to knock his teeth out.This book is romantic comedy. It's a sweet and fun read. You can't help but want to have a klutzy Hal of your own once you're done reading this book. (I certainly wouldn't mind if he looked like Dean Cain or Christopher Gorham. Oh, that's right.

I could easily belive the circumstances that Frank described that caused him to get dragged into the world of \\"under the table\\" business dealings and found his discussions of the negotiations he entered into with his agents and others in Asia very familiar. His experience in this area is deep and broad and it shows through in his writing.Frank makes a good case that doing business with China should be predicated on \\"fair\\" trade, not just \\"free\\" trade. Before reading this book, I would just buy the lowest price items in the store, usually from China. Now, I take a close look and try to find American alternatives.

Majoring in religious studies and family therapy, I currently teach and administrate at a private, Catholic school. Needless to say, the mutually exclusive worlds of parochial education and international business couldn't be more dissimilar. So, what can I possibly say that would be worthwhile or helpful to a prospective business book buyer? Quite a lot actually.Although an international business-oriented book with a few jargon-dense sections, it really delivers as an impassioned, fast-paced, and highly readable account of one man's business ordeals in the disingenuous and adversarial \\"Middle Kingdom\\" of China. Moreover, Frank's insistent call to all Americans to reconsider the true value of their purchasing power in an attempt to maintain their cherished American standard of living is as compelling as it is timely. Consider the emergence and subsequent domination of WalMart, a service sector behemoth that exploits the import market as well as their own American employees' inability to find better-paying jobs; all in the name of offering \\"the lowest prices possible.\\"You almost won't believe his autobiographical accounts of the closed-door dealings, the interminable posturing, China's de facto culture of corruption, the inevitable betrayals, the leveling of criminal allegations, and the paralyzing sense of fear and loathing born of senior management's unwillingness to acknowledge the realities of doing business in Asia. It's fascinating stuff!Dad's riveting account is even more credible through his insistence that we, as Amercians, have the power to right the listless, sinking ship of our national economy. Especially within the manufacturing sector that has been, to our collective loss, hemorrhaging jobs at a dizzying rate, we owe it to ourselves to give China: We All Fall Down a serious look. Regardless if you agree with the international trade policies of the Bush adminstration or not, regardless if you believe in the lofty ideal of economic globalization, and regardless if you yourself have a manufacturing job or not, you owe it to yourself and to your children (to whom you will entrust the American Dream to!) to READ THIS BOOK.Can you wrap your mind around the startling claim that \\"the entire fate of America's middle class way of life hangs in the balance\\"(7)?

It's high time I corrected it, since it's been there for more than a year, no doubt befuddling readers who thought they knew something about analog electronics. Specifically, I had said that the designation of the input terminals as '+' and '-' really made no difference: it's more reflective of convention, sciz. (assuming something other than a difference amplifier), the significant input network is attached to '-'--with '+' grounded--if the configuration is inverting, but to '+' (with '-' grounded) if the configuration is non-inverting. That's the truth, but it isn't the whole truth. When we examine border cases--those that tax the operational limits of the device, straying outside the \\"passband,\\" analogically speaking (yes, I know, that typically refers to a frequency range, but here I use it to address an input voltage difference range)--the otherwise cosmetic or mnemonic choice of '+' or '-' terminal becomes rather more manifest. Remember that the amplifier actually amplifies the input voltage difference in the microscopic sense--even though it implements a semantically notable linear operation in the macroscopic sense--relying upon the feedback network to remanufacture an appropriate input voltage difference that maintains the nominal purpose of the circuit. When things go ape and the input voltage difference is much too high or, alternatively, much too low (and that may be a tough nut to crack), the output characteristic will be dependent upon what was connected to '+' and what, to '-'.Now, wasn't that as clear as mud? Remember, I'm constrained to use words, and words alone, as my medium of communication, and, since I have only a fraction of a thousand words, I have only a fraction of a picture!"},{"Title":"Design With Operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated Circuits","review":"This book can be an excellent resource for any Analog Integrated Circuit Design Electrical Engineering student or practicing engineer. The book can assist in the modeling of IC devices such as transistors, resistors, and capacitors. It also sensibly covers the building blocks of analog integrated circuits: gain stages, output stages, level shifters, current sources and mirrors.The reader is expected to have a general understanding of electronics, frequency-domain analysis procedures, and understand basic Pspice operations. The book generally covers enough material for a half-year of courses at the upper-division/graduate level although the book could certainly be useful for a single class.The material generally starts out as basic and proceeds to a complex level. There are helpful figures and diagrams on nearly every page and the organization is generally sensible and intuitive. There are many worked examples and hundreds of end-of-chapter problems. The text is supported by a website that offers downloadable design projects, additional examples, and design software. Franco has done an admiral job at presenting a complicated subject.Here's a brief description of SOME of the topics found in each chapter:1) Basic amplifier concepts and arrangements are explored. Also covers negative feedback, the loop gain, and basic circuit analysis.2) Current-to-Voltage &amp; Voltage-to-Current Converters, Current, Difference, Instrumentation, and Transducer Bridge Amplifiers.3) Active Filters. Transfer Function, 1st order, KRC, multiple-feedback, state-variable, audio, and biquad filters.4) Filter Approximations, switched-capacitor, universal sc filters, and cascade design.5) Low-input bias-current Op amps, low-input-offset-voltage Op Amps, Op Amp Circuit Diagrams, and Input offset Voltage.6) Open and Closed loop response.

Some acquaitance with op amps will be needed before reading this book because the learning curve is steep in the first chapter. However, the approach is thorough and professionally presented. The book is more than a cookbook. Furthermore, the book does not stop with the single op amp, but discusses the use of op amp(s) in circuits. The book is perfectly suited for prototyping the many circuits contained between its two covers. Since my interest was in instrumentation amplifiers, I decided to reduce the circuits of chapter 2 to practice. It was a real learning experience. I think chapter titles will further indicate the comprehensive nature of the book: (1) OA Fundamentals, (2) Circuits w/ Resistive Feedback, (3,4) Active Filter, (5) Static OA Limitations, (6) Dynamic OA Limitations, (7) Noise, (8) Stability, (9) Nonlinear Circuits, (10) Signal Generators, (11) Voltage References and Regulators, (12) D-A &amp; A-D Converters, (13) Nonlinear Amplifiers &amp; Phase-Locked Loops."},{"Title":"Design With Operational Amplifiers and Analog Integrated Circuits","review":"Really a top notch book on op-amps and almost anything you'd ever do with them.

Currently, they are running an exhibit called \\"Three Gutenberg Bibles\\" which puts on display all three of the Gutenberg Bibles in the library's collection. For anyone interested in books, it is an impressive show--one complete Bible in vellum, one complete Bible in paper, and one Old Testament in paper (probably created from leftover sheets at the end of the press run). I had some basic knowledge of Gutenberg and his Bibles, but this event left me much better informed.My only disappointment with the show was that the library bookshop didn't have a book describing the Morgan's Gutenbergs. Instead, they offered this volume, which is based on the Gutenberg Bible in the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.In spite of that, this is a nice little book. It is pretty and well-made, with plenty of color photographs of the Huntington's Gutenberg. The text is brief but informative, covering some of the details I picked up from the exhibit. (Did you know that Gutenberg only printed the main body of the text? The lead capitals and margins were left blank for owners to hire scribes to create the artistic flourishes typical of mediaeval books. That's why every Gutenberg is unique.)Though I still wish the Morgan had produced a similar book for their collection, this book is a fine substitute and a good primer for anyone interested in learning about the Gutenberg Bible. With luck, someday I'll travel to the Huntington and check out their Gutenberg too."},{"Title":"The Gutenberg Bible: Landmark in learning","review":"This short book, a mere 48 pages, is a real gem. Of the 48 pages, 20 or so are full-page or most-page, full-colour graphics of pages and illuminations from the Gutenberg Bible in the collection of the Huntington Library. Another five pages include black-and-white reproductions of highlighted letters, engravings, or other such details from the Bible.The Gutenberg Bible holds a special place in the annals of literary and publishing history. Prized by collectors, this particular Gutenberg Bible was quired in 1911 by Henry Huntington by fascinating circumstances, laid out as part of the history of the Bible -- Henry Huntington's purchase at auction was at the time a phenonmenal event, the highest price paid at auction for a book, at $50,000.The Gutenberg Bible was not, in fact, the first thing published with movable type printing presses. However, it was the first major book to be printing by this then-revolutionary process, and has become iconographic of many things, including invention, literacy, and spirituality. The revolution in learning, the ability for libraries to spring up in every community (as opposed to just a few centres of learning), and the expanding availability of texts of every type were precipitated by the invention of the printing press -- that Gutenberg chose the Bible as the first major work also speaks to the air of change that would sweep across Europe with the Reformation.Of course, it was not simply the availability of the printing press itself that made the particular achievement of the Gutenberg Bible and the more general achievement of literary production in volume -- movable type presses had been invented prior to the time of Gutenberg, including in places beyond Europe (such as China). However, the convergence of discoveries in ink, availability of paper, and the press (as well as a willingness to use and develop this new invention) caused a revolution in Europe.The brief text, written by James Thorpe, details the book, the press, the history, and the path this book took to its present location. It is a wonderful book for a gift to the bibliophile, as well as a nice coffee table book, and a good piece of reading for enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Gutenberg Bible: Landmark in learning","review":"An outstanding account of how Huntington acquired this rare bible--the first book printed with moveable type.

These include Russel MeansWhere White Men Fear to Tread: The Autobiography of Russell Meansand Dennis BanksOjibwa Warrior: Dennis Banks And The Rise Of The American Indian Movement. While the movieIncident at Oglala - The Leonard Peltier Storyhas added to the story, this very insightful story examines the role of the FBI on the American Indian reservations, especially Pine RIdge and others in the Mid West. It deals extensively with the mysterious 1976 death of Anne May Aqash. This is a heavy book that makes the FBI out to be a truly negative influence and examines the continuing negative role of the U.S federal government vis-a-vis the reservations.Thoguht provoking and important.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Unquiet Grave : The FBI and the Struggle for the Soul of Indian Country","review":"There are many unforgivable flaws in this book, such as the author's clumsy attempt to expose a dedicated AIM activist as an FBI informant and his casual intution that Leonard Peltier is guilty and that the author would not find him personable after serving 33 years on the basis of a farcical legal proceeding that has never been retried. An astute editor would have corrected these errors. Yet I find this book is significant in accentuating the need for a comprehensive investigation of the crimes against the people of Pine Ridge and AIM. This could follow the model of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which all who testify would be granted immunity for all actions to which they confess. Free Leonard Peltier, Arlo Looking Clound, and the consciences and legal concerns of federal agents and informants willing to testify. This book surely raises questions about the true reponsibility for the killing of Anna Mae Aquash, which the FBI dared not investigate until it was certain that it could be another tool for the descrediting of AIM and Leonard Peltier, and the snuffing out of hope for future generations of Native peoples.

What is the author trying to say? It is never clear. The first part of the book seemingly is about, among many, many, many other things (way too many if you ask me), the murder of Annie Mae Aquash - and great detail is included about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of her death. Abruptly at some point in the 2nd part of the book, we find ourselves at the trial of one of three people accused of her murder (none of whom were ever mentioned in part one, and, as to whom there is virtually no biographical detail included). At the same time, the book includes voluminous biographical detail and digression about many, many, many other individuals, for no particular reason it seems. I finished the book because I wanted to see if the author was going to bring this tangled mass of trivial and unimportant details together in some coherent way, but alas, all I got for the effort was high blood pressure. Among the book's many other flaws are these: the author reports on at least one trial, but seemingly has no grasp of trial tactics or evidentiary rules - he chastises lawyers for not bringing up details that (a) would have been irrelevant; and (2) would have been inadmissible; the author too often says things like \\"but we will never know . . . \\" about things that are perfecty checkable, things he could have fact-checked if he had chosen to; and, the author seems to believe in a big conspiracy or two that must explain all of the loose ends he leaves, but he never explains what those conspiracies were about and who was in them.

Hendricks limns not just the atrocities of the FBI, but also the LAPD, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Justice Department, Supreme Court, State of South Dakota and more in a retch inducing indictiment. His deep though unobstrusive research starts in the Seventies and ends in today's world. This book deserves wide readership: and a wide readership deserves to know about this book. What happened to Indians or editors in Indian Country could very well happen to you and I today, anywhere. The governmental machine has lied and cheated and abused us all; only some of its direct objects, as discussed by Hendricks, happened to have red hued skin.

Hendricks assesmbles his extensive research, skillfully weaving the micro (Aquash's murder) and the macro (the Indian rights struggle) into a tale of betrayal and cover-up that will keep the reader hooked to the end. Painstakingly documented, this book unravels in careful detail the missteps and abuses of power of government agencies, AIM activists, and ruthless Indian tribal leaders alike; it is a chilling account of injustices that helped to sink the Indian civil rights movement and of the innocent Lakota men, women, and children brutalized in its wake.

The author, Hendricks, sifts through reams of information without imparting the pain of his research to the reader; with a novelist's ear and eye he makes every word count, every paragraph visual.Throughout the book he weaves interviews, news accounts, court records, and censored FBI documents into a story you learn to care about. He does not shy from critical analysis of historical events or of the characters and parties involved, which is refreshing given the geography of most U.S. journalism today.If you're concerned about the abuses of government powers (past and present), if you think injustice needs to be properly witnessed, then flip through The Unquiet Grave. It's a good read, a hopeful beacon in the fog and the darkness of the American political psyche.

I knew part of the answer was almost atotal culture of poverty rather than the Indian cultures I had learned about in school.Multi-generational abuse,physical,sexual,and substance abuse,was the direct cause of much dysfunctional behavior I witnessed.I decided early in my life and to do whatever I could do to help change whatever I could in my lifetime that would stop this injustice. I would give my own life to change that.I always deplored most organizational efforts to accomplish anything however I joined the Michigan Chapter of the Great Lakes Indian Youth Alliance and the American Indian Movement. The reason why I joined is because for the first time in my life I could feel the surge of self respect,self actualization and spirituality within these organizations,and the individuals and Indian Communities involved at that time.It was a refreshing healing wind of change like you feel after a thunderstorm.I actually thought the young brilliant Indian Warriors were street/woods wise and spiritual enough to avoid the pitfalls of other dominant culture civil and equal rights organizations but ultimately as far as I am concerned the movement became more and more corrupt exactly like the enemy as it matured.Individual's like Russell Means,Dennis Banks,Ed McGaa,Floyd Westerman and others less visible continued to self actualize and work hard to individually accomplish the original goals of their and our youth in rather unusual ways after AIM died. I know that each one is committed to do what they can do to improve the lives of their families,extended families,and Indian Nations. Sometime being human they fall short of our and even their expectations. They do what they can as Warrior in spite of almost total overwhelming repression by the United States Government and the American society. However humanly flawed they remain in my mind truly contemporary Warriors of this century.I also feel Steve Hendricks and many others are doing their best to bring out the truth and documentation of constitutional and personal injustices of those days.I expect other individuals with information to come forth with their knowledge and writing because our society is even much farther away from the truth and principals that this Country was founded on today.As far as I am concerned whoever killed the active committed lives of the Freedom Fighters,Ray Robinson,Anna Mae Aquash, Neogeshick Aquash the FBI Agents, and the others made a serious mestake and destroyed the purity, beauty,and Sacred Place of the Movement. The murderer or murderers who called for the hit on the precious Warrior Anna Mae Aquash in that instant killed AIM with the same bullet. They will pay for that decision deep within their soul.I was pleased to see a that the Law Library at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law purchased the copy of The Unquiet Grave I am reading for their students.It is my hope and prayer that the youth of today will read everything they can get their hands on work, and commit to make justice a reality in their lifetimes.As long as this abuse, poverty, and injustice remains in our society no one will be free.

We complain about journalists who concoct a regurgitated version of the news.

He informs his \\"brothers\\" that their goods have not yet arrived and that the French claim their land as theirs. He also cannot resist gazing at Rebecca. Quickly they fall in love, but he has a goal to prove to his family he can make it and she feels loyalty towards her adopted mother and tribe. On top of their personal dilemma, the outbreak of war between the French and English over who owns the North American colonies makes it is unsafe for anyone to travel the countryside.There is no doubt that readers will think of the Last of the Mohicans with the backdrop and in many ways this well written colonial romance fits as the exciting story line provides insight into the precarious era. What is somewhat different than the Cooper classic is that the audience also receives a powerful look at the impact the French and Indian War has on an Indian tribe. The lead couple is a warm pair deserving of one another. Many readers will have wished they spent more time together but the realism of war impeding their courtship makes for a stronger overall novel and just a fine time for historical and Pre Revolutionary War romance readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Old World Bestiary, Vol. 1","review":"I have to say I like this \\"monster companion\\" much more than some of the other rpgs that are out there at the moment. Instead of giving one or two paragraphs about the monster, and the main focus being on the statistics of the monster, this supplement to the WFRPG is a delight. It examines the ins and out of what makes up a creature in the Warhammer world, whether the normal orc style bad guy to the demons and the dragons. This is not an index of monsters, this is (and this might sound silly) the National Geographics of monster exploration. What makes up a creature in the Warhammer world? What provokes the creature on and off the battlefield or dungeon or city, what action does the creature normally take in day to day, why does the monster do as he does? A GM worth his or her salt will look at this book and truly see villains and creatures to be encountered in the vast campaign of Warhammer, not some lvl 2 goblin that is placed in room 5 like some games are designed. We GMs are tired of just having creatures for the sake of placing them into some room to be encountered, after encountering another creature beforehand in the earlier room. We GMs, like this book hands us, want meat in our creatures, we want them to have their own reasons and whys, we want them to have their own character for the sake of the game world's dynamics. What might be a simple orc encountered in a dungeon in another game, becomes a 3-dimensional villain in this game's makeup."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Old World Bestiary, Vol. 1","review":"First thing: Amazon is mistaken, this isn't a Warhammer Novel. It's a supplement for the second edition of the Warhammer RPG.That being said, it's the best supplement they've put out (the line is currently in the process of putting out the Skaven sourcebook: Children of the Horned Rat)It's also the best \\"Monster Manual\\" I've ever seen, a must for all Warhammer FRP GMs, unlike the rest of the series (which honestly has been quite hit-and-miss, unfortunately).The reason it's so great is that there's a beginning section detailing all the monsters using the \\"peasant superstition\\" method WFRP players have come to love (and sectioning them off by \\"Chaos Beasts\\", \\"The Undead\\", etc), and leave all the monster stats alphabetized in the back of the book for quick reference by the GM.While the whole line is a bit pricey, the Old World Bestiary easily merits it's purchase to a WFRP GM, especially at the Amazon discount.Here's a list of the monsters outlined in the Old World Bestiary:BansheesBeastmen-Bestigors (leaders)-Centigors (centaur beastman)-Gors (horned beastman)-Ungors and Brays (barely-horned and non-horned beastmen)Chaos Cultists - 4 different cultsChaos Dwarves-Bull Centaurs (dwarf centaurs)Chaos MaraudersChaos WarriorsDaemons - 5 different typesDire Wolves (undead with skull-like heads and glowing red eyes)DragonsDragon Ogres (Ogre/Dragon centaur)DryadsElven CorsairsFenbeasts (basically a swamp-golem)GhoulsGiantsGiant RatsGiant SpidersGiant WolvesGoblins-Night GoblinsGreat EaglesGriffonsHarpiesHippogriffsHobgoblinsHydrasManticoresMinotaursMummiesMutantsOgresOrcs-Black Orcs (biggest and strongest orcs)-Savage OrcsPegasiRat Ogres (exactly what the name implies)Skaven - 4 different clansSkeletonsSquigs (big furry balls with big mouths)Snotlings (kobolds)Spirits-Ghosts (not usually evil)-Poltergeists (tricksters)-Spectres (mostly insane ghosts)Treemen (treants)Trolls-Chaos Trolls-River Trolls-Stone TrollsUnicornsVampire BatsVampires - 5 clansWarhawksWerecreatures (the Were template)WightsWild BoarsWraiths (look like death himself)WyvernsZombies"},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Old World Bestiary, Vol. 1","review":"While I feel this book could have been longer, overall I've been impressed with the book and it is already one of the more extensively used in my Warhammer collection. Like most GM's who create there own material, (even if it is just as filler between pre-fab adventures) I find a useful guide to critters is indispensible. This one fits the bill nicely, although I do hope they follow it up with Volume 2 as I am looking forward to an even wider array of creatures to select from.For those familiar with WFRP, most of the old favorites are here. Some of the more esoteric ones which were never popular have been removed to make room to expand on the more popular ones, and a few new creatures which are popular in fantasy genre in general have been added.For those who are new to WFRP, the 'Slaughter Margin' is a useful tool for guesstimating the challenge of various encounters for a beginning party so that you don't inadvertantly annihilate your party before they really get hooked on the game and all it has to offer. It's also somewhat handy for experienced gamers from the first edtion who are still getting their hands around the second edition rules for much the same reason.The book is laid out in basically two sections, the players section and the GM's section. This is a bit of a misnomer, since really neither is really meant for player's eyes. However, it is handy in that it seperates knowledge for the GM in a very convienient fashion. The 'players section' includes different viewpoints of the monsters which can be used to give the players background without giving them a list of the monster's statistics. The GM's section contains ways to modify individual encounters to make them tougher (or easier) without sacrificing credibility. It also holds all the stats of the monsters in a concise format including their armor, skills, talents, mutations, weapons, and any special rules.The Player's Section includes a 'Common View' which is how the monsters are percieved by the inhabitants of the Old World in the form of quotes from various persons ranging from a retired mercenary, to a farmer, to a church official, to a scholar. The interesting thing about these is they are not always based in fact, and some are flat out wrong or misguided, which is in keeping with what the characters would 'know' when encountering a new creature for the first time. These are good for player's who use their 'Common Knowledge' skill successfully to find out how much they know about what they have just encountered in a dark alley. (As a GM I also find this section very handy when foreshadowing an encounter.) It also has a 'Scholar's Eye' section which is a supposedly informed perspective by a researcher of the monster in question which can also be mistaken but is generally more reliable and is useful when players make an 'Academic Knowledge' skill test. Finally, there is an 'Our Own Words' section which gives a paragraph or two describing the monster from it's own perspective. This is particularly handy when a player decides to capture or otherwise parley with a monster rather than simply destroy it and move on.The GM's section goes into a fair degree of depth on the social structure of the greenskins, beastmen, and skaven as well as the various factions therein and their relationship to each other, as well as detailing various statistical differences between them. While it clearly leaves room for a sourcebook on each for future expansion, it is more than enough for detailing the occassional encounter.Also found in the GM's section are: the aforementioned 'Slaughter Margin' which ranks monsters in terms of difficulty (Ranging from Very Easy to Impossible) for a standard soldier with half the advances of his first career for easy comparison to help guesstimate encounters until new players and GM's are used to the new system; new skills and talents available to some of the monsters; an expanded chaos mutation table, and a selection of new spells for magic using monsters. This last section is particularly useful for getting the attention of players when they go to slaughter yet another skaven or greenskin and suddenly find themselves facing spells they have never seen before and cannot find in the core rule book. (What can I say? I enjoy keeping them on their toes.)The book is as well illustrated as any of the second edition books, and in fact may be slightly above average in that regard.Throughout the book are margin notes which detail things such as daemonic auras and chaos armor. These notes are placed well, almost always next to a relevant entry and provide useful but non-essential detail which is handy when running an encounter or for dealing with players who want to ask esoteric questions or strip every corpse for every last brass penny.I was initially annoyed at the way the monsters were organized into sections according to type. Forest creatures are grouped together, undead, greenskins, etc. Being a long-time gamer, I'm used to everything being alphabetized. However, I am starting to realize that this is not as large a problem as I had originally thought. The index is comprehensive and alphabetical, and when planning an encounter in a particular environment I find it increasingly handy that other denizens of the same terrain are close at hand. I almost never have an encounter involving a single type of creature anymore, which has the players frequently looking past the initial attackers now waiting for the other shoe to drop. Even if there is no second wave or boss running things, it creates the feel of paranoia that I like for them to have without treating them unfairly.My only real frustration with the book is that I wish it had been thicker, 128 pages is a bit light for a resource book. I was pleased however, that this is (so far) the first book they have created for the second edition which didn't contain an adventure eating up a substantial amount of the page count. As a resource book, I would have been more than a little annoyed to see a portion of the pages go to a one-use adventure which I may or may not even use.Overall, aside from the original rulebook, this has been my most used book. WELL worth the money I paid for it."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Old World Bestiary, Vol. 1","review":"This book is set up in two parts- your usual stats block for monsters at the back of the book, and the very creative and adventure-hooky descriptions, myths, hearsay and accounts in the front. It's a fun way to have some new ideas about the monsters in your adventures and really adds color to the creatures. Everything from witchunter's journals to the ravings of peasants are included.I use this book currently for a Dungeon World campaign, as the first part of the book is useful on its own and I can ignore the stat blocks in the back. I imagine the same would be true for any fantasy campaign."},{"Title":"Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay: Old World Bestiary, Vol. 1","review":"This is a really great book.

It is both entertaining and informative.Every chapter contains a bit of wisdom in the writing field and a small personal story that tugs the reader along for the ride. I've found most &quot;How-To&quot; books dull and unimpressive. Clausen's book is neither. I was entranced from the opening to the end.As a comparison, I've read &quot;Stephen King's On Writing&quot; this month as well, and Clausen's book, was far more entertaining and informative. Where King would include endless pages of self-dramatizing autobiography, Clausen would wax poetic with stories about writers, which actually relate to the message he is trying to convey in each chapter.It is not often that I can pick up a non-fiction book and laugh until I fall out of my chair, and learn something in the process. Clausen's book accomplished this feat."},{"Title":"Too Lazy to Work, Too Nervous to Steal: How to Have a Great Life as a Freelance Writer","review":"John Clausen's book is helpful only to those would-be freelance writers who have never read one single issue of Writer's Digest magazine.

His book is as much a freewheeling autobiography as it is a blueprint for success as a writer -- in advertising, direct mail, magazine features, public relations, and marketing/consulting. Clearly this is a profession that can be tailored to an individual's talents and preferences. For most freelancer wannabes, the hardest part is gaining the confidence to make the commitment.

My mother, a successful librarian, offered a copy of this book to me that some patron had donated but the library did not intend to stock. I read it on a three hour trip to Ingelside Naval Station (I'm also a midshipman in the NROTC program) on Saturday. By yesterday morning I had an interview with a client, a law firm. Using the principles Mr. Clausen outlined in his book, I obtained my first assignment and was paid last night when I turned the assignment in.Without his book, I would not have known where to go to obtain the client nor how to negotiate during the interview. The law firm intends to use me again for other assignments in several categories. Last week I was living on ramen and one dollar worth of gas in my tank. This week I have a steady client and options for further expansion. I also was informed that I won an essay contest worth a small amount of cash. Suffice to say, it's nice to see my writing make the account balance go up, rather than the other direction.I only regret that I was not the individual who purchased the book originally.

Koans are not solipsistic puzzles. They are public cases, reality is whole. Koans are a type of irrational alarm clock used to wake us from our rational minds. To wake us from duality to nonduality so that we are present and accounted for.It is better to realize the meaning of a Koan than to interpret it. Interpretation is a rational function. One must learn to turn the light around, to make the inside the outside, to make the two one. Realization is a wholistic function that includes the rational as well as the irrational aspects of our being. Koans are more intuitive than intellectual. Pure intellection has a tendency to see things as distinct pairs of inimical opposites. Good versus evil. Intuition knows things don't exist separately from each other, that seeming opposites are the polar expression of an underlying unity. Though a rope has two ends it is one rope. The heart that unites is superior to the mind that divides.What is the sound of one hand clapping? What is the sound of nonduality? In silence one may hear the clear tone of enlightenment.Thou essence art that essence."},{"Title":"The Iron Flute: 100 Zen Koans","review":"This collection of 100 Koans, was first compiled by Genro in the 18th century, and then is commented on by his disciple Fugai, and then by the Japanese Zen Master Senzaki who first brought Zen to America in the 20th century.The koans are remarkable, not puzzles ... not paradoxes ... but what? And having written this, I am worthy of a blow, and perhaps you the reader of this review another blow, for there are many blows from the master to the student here. So don't place to much credence on the words, which are just the shadows. The interweaving of the 3 commentaries, can be humorous, for example Fugai entreats his master Genro &quot;Stop! Stop! Don't try to pull an unwilling cat over the carpet.\\". Senzaki's commentary places the koan in context.There is also some poetry from Genro, that comments on the Koan -- for example &quot;A cloud rests at the mouth of the caveDoing nothing all day.The moonlight penetrates the waves through the night,But leaves no trace in e water.&quot;Nyogen says &quot;American Zen is running sideways writing books, lecturing, referring to theology, psychology, and what not&quot;.

In both the Soto Zen school and the Rinzai Zen school Koans are sometimes used as a learning tool for stuents.

Dawson dscribes the beginning of ocean liner travel in the mid 19th Century, and ends with, to date, the largest and grandest ocean liner ever built, QM2. Dawson describes countless vessels such as the RMS Britannia, Great Eastern, RMS Lusitania and Mauretania, Normandie, RMS Aquitania, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth's I and II, and the most famous of all, the RMS Titanic. I would recommend this book to any maritime enthusiast and aficionado."},{"Title":"The Liner: Retrospective and Renaissance","review":"Get this book if you are an ocean liner enthusiast. You won't be disappointed. My only regret is that I didn't get it sooner."},{"Title":"The Liner: Retrospective and Renaissance","review":"Philip Dawson's book is particularly interesting in a number of respects. First, it covers a considerable time span from the beginning of Atlantic steamship service in the 1840s to 2005, the date of initial publication. Second, it is of the form of a narrative with illustration rather than a picture book, despite the considerable and succesful effort spent on graphic presentation. Third, despite a great affection and respect for the past he does not endow it with moral properties it did not have in comparison with the present. Fourth, Dawson spreads his eight chapters quite evenly in time, not particularly emaphasizing one era over another.It is important to understand in consideration of this book, that it is about naval architecture in the broadest sense. Dawson in most interested in what these ships were intended to do rather than how they accomplished their purposes. So it is foremost a history of what the ocean liner was meant to be. As such, there is considerable emphasis on the business and economics surrounding the construction and use of the big liners. Technology is covered in passing in some cases and not at all in others. For example, in discussing the transition from steam assisted sail to sail assisted steam to full steam propulsion he never mentions the transition from single expansion to double expansion to triple expansion reciprocating engines which was absolutely critical. On the other hand, he brings to light many of the otherwise publically unknown, but certainly eminent in their field, people who designed the living areas of the great liners. In addition, he is quite good at pointing out the interaction between the interior architecture and the mechanical arrrangement of the necessary machinery.Particular note should be made of the illustrations, which are of a quite remarkable number and quality. In order to break up the monotony of so many inevitably black and white photos, Dawson tints some and put some on a tinted background. He does a good job of connecting the illustrations to the text but at times he describes in detail some features on ships that are not illustrated at all. The mix of ship exteriors, interiors, and promotional art are well balanced.At the end of the last chapter,which takes us through the introduction to service of the Carnival/Cunard Queen Mary 2, there are two appendices, a series of short profiles of each of the ships prominently mentioned in the text, and a timeline putting the overall developments of the ocean liner in chronological order. As befits the non-scholarly nature of the book, the bibilography is relatively short and confined to secondary source articles and books.I found the book well worth the purchase and with good understanding of what it is and isn't, you should too."},{"Title":"The Liner: Retrospective and Renaissance","review":"I got up to go get the mail and i thought it was going to be at the front door and it wasent so i when to my mail box and saw a big square yellow packege and then i want back to my house so open it and saw it was my book so thank you for supricing me"},{"Title":"Characters of Shakespear's plays, (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys.

What you may read between the lines of this volume is the unmistakable joy of life that Bobby brings to everything he undertakes-the natural result of his many years of practice of the TM technique. And anyone who learns the practice can have that same joy and enthusiasm, as Bobby mentions.It is absolutely true that the practice cannot be learned from a book, and Bobby makes that quite clear. Too many of the reviews of the book found on these pages express irritation, even anger, because the reader failed to understand that the work is not an instruction manual, but simply a descriptive introduction to a very simple and effective practice for creating more peace, more life, and more naturalness within one's life.In this time on Earth, when there appears to be so much darkness and strife, any work that endeavors to bring more light and harmony into human life has profound value. This book has great value not only because it is suffused with the inner light of someone who has been working for the good of the world for many years, but also because it pertains to what is the greatest knowledge available to mankind, the knowledge of how to create peace within oneself and thereby create a peaceful world.If the people of the world do not recognize the value of this wonderful practice right now, it is only a matter of time before they will, and Bobby Roth will, I hope, have had a large hand in helping them with that recognition.If you're interested in the simplest, most natural technique of meditation which can be learned, this little book is an easy way to find out more about it."},{"Title":"TM - Transcendental Meditation : A New Introduction to Maharishi's Easy, Effective and Scientifically Proven Technique for Promoting Better Health, Unfolding Your Creative Potential, and Creating Peace in the World","review":"This book doesn't explain how to meditate, it's a lengthy sales pitch to get you to have a personal instructor teach you, which will cost you thousands of dollars.

I also attended Maharishi International University. After 28 years of doing TM I came to the conclusion that TM is bogus. It did have some postive effects in the beginning but after a while I realized that my will was being oppressed.Maharishi International University really opened my eyes to the reality of TM. Maharishi International University was a joke. The food was atrocious and the courses third-rate. I got the feeling that all they were interested in was getting tuition fees from the students. The TM organization relies a lot on its practitioners ignoring a lot of what they they see as negative about TM and just focusing on the good points of TM. I have done a lot of research and reading over the last 20 years and have come to the conclusion ,based on my research and my own personal experiences, that Transcendental Meditation is at best a waste of time and at worst demonic in nature. I would advise anyone even mildly interested in TM to very carefully scrutinize what they say about God and Jesus. Anyone with any religous faith will find it at odds with belief in what the bible says about the suffering and redemption of Jesus."},{"Title":"TM - Transcendental Meditation : A New Introduction to Maharishi's Easy, Effective and Scientifically Proven Technique for Promoting Better Health, Unfolding Your Creative Potential, and Creating Peace in the World","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book.

It makes (vague) promises of better health... IF you give the TM organization hundreds of dollars for a beginner's &quot;introductory&quot; course, and preferably thousands more for the &quot;advanced&quot; courses.TM uses this - and other - books to promise the readers pots of golds at the end of the rainbow, in the form of &quot;Yogic perfect health&quot; that can be achieved after the &quot;advanced&quot; courses had been completed and the TM organization enriched with roughly $10,000 or so of the reader's money. TM claims that these vague, odd claims are really &quot;scientific&quot; because - supposedly - they agree with Quantum Mechanics' claims. This is, quite simply, a lie, but to start and dissect in detail just WHAT is wrong with TM's &quot;scientific&quot; claims would take dozens of pages, since just about *everything* they say about Quantum Mechanics is based on popular misunderstandings of what QM is, or on deliberate misquoting and distortion of what scientists actually say to make it *seem* as if they agree with TM's wierd claims. Instead in going that way, let us examine just what is the difference, in practice, between TM's claims and reality.TM is *very* vague about what Perfect health&quot; consists of. Dr. Chopra, one of the Maharishi's closest associates, is more specific: &quot;Yogic perfect health&quot;, through the use of &quot;quantum healing&quot; (of course) can stop or greatly slow down the aging process, and cure cancer. But one needs only to notice that both the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Dr. Chopra, the two main proponents of &quot;Yogic perfect health&quot;, are quite obviously growing older and weaker just like the rest of us. Just compare their recent photos to those made 10 or 20 years ago. So much for the &quot;Reversed aging&quot; claim. As for the cancer bit, Doug Henning, one of TM's most famous supporters, recently died - at age 54 - from liver cancer. Apparently, Chopra's medical advice of how to &quot;reprogram your quantum consciousness to fight cancer&quot; came up short that time. TMers, incidentally, explain Henning's death by saying that he really *was* cured of cancer, but his subconsciousness somehow &quot;decided&quot; that it was &quot;time to go&quot;, so he died anyway (in &quot;perfect health&quot;, of course.) Such a desperate rationalizations hardly requires a reply, but it's interesting that if it WERE true, it makes TM look much worse: apparently, people who achieve &quot;Yogic Perfect Health&quot; are in constant danger of their subconscious deciding that it is time for them to drop dead, even as their bodies are healthy. Certainly a goal worth spending thousands of dollars on, don't you think?TM wants you to pay them lots of money for vague promises of &quot;perfect health&quot; that are a). not true, b). misleadingly labeled as &quot;scientific&quot;. Of course, they also insist that the ONLY way someone can really reached &quot;perfect health&quot; is through the &quot;official&quot; channels of the very expensive TM courses, and that all the rest of the Yoga teachers more or less &quot;distort&quot; the &quot;real way&quot;. This is understandable propaganda: after all, if one discards TM's claims of &quot;perfect health&quot; (as evidence suggests one should) all TM is really offering is some *extremely* overpriced Yoga classes. Naturally, TM doesn't want you to shop around and realize that there are many Yoga teacher that (unlike TM) are honest, charge modest prices, and simply teach you relaxation and Yoga without making extravagant, false promises of &quot;perfect health&quot; that will occur if you only give them lots of money. This book is part of TM's attempt to stop you from looking around. Remember: *ONLY* the TM organization knows what's good for you - if you have the money to pay up, that is."},{"Title":"TM - Transcendental Meditation : A New Introduction to Maharishi's Easy, Effective and Scientifically Proven Technique for Promoting Better Health, Unfolding Your Creative Potential, and Creating Peace in the World","review":"I was looking for the &quot;How To&quot; book which apparently does not exist on the subject.

Seems to have more substance than that of learning from a book. They, Maharishi and co., seem to promote it as a 1-way ticket to enlightenment and peace within, but the truth seems to be that it is a very useful technique, but no replacement for the personal spiritual journey, through education and experience, necessary in the journey toward true enlightenment. Tm does not give spiritual consciousness, but does seem to put one in a better purer place if one is interested in that pursuit. I believe, from my own experience, that it provides worthwhile health and spirtual benefits, in and of itself and as an adjunct to spirtitual work, but I am not comfortable with their telling people that it gives wisdom and peace in and of itself. But if one were to study the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jesus, and other enlightened beings, and make the commitment to search for spiritual truth, then, and only then, is Tm extremely valuable. This is based on my personal experience."},{"Title":"TM - Transcendental Meditation : A New Introduction to Maharishi's Easy, Effective and Scientifically Proven Technique for Promoting Better Health, Unfolding Your Creative Potential, and Creating Peace in the World","review":"3 years ago, I had &quot;sucker&quot; written on my forehead. I read the book and actually paid for lessons to learn TM. A typical lesson costs anywhere from $200 to the $1000+ range. Here's the lesson in a nutshell. You're merely taught to repeatedly recite out loud, your so-called secret mantra (mine was &quot;shreem&quot;). You'll then be guided to gradually bring down the volume of the recited mantra to a whisper, then finally reciting it in your head in silence. Hey, now you're meditating! I did get headaches for the first two weeks, and practiced TM for a long time. Yes, it does calm and quiet the mind but also try joining a normal meditation class, which I did before trying TM. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and gang write some of the best fishing lures on the planet. They were able to hook $900 out of MY pocket. Great job.

It doesn't promise to teach you to meditate so I don't know what all the complaints about that are. If you want the benefits that come from the TM technique, you have to learn it properly, from a trained teacher in a series on meetings and personal instruction. Its impossible to learn the real TM technique from a book.This book does save you the first step of going to learn TM, the Introductory lecture. You can go directly to step 2, the Preparatory Lecture. And then decide if you want the benefits and learn the technique.If you don't want to buy the book, you can read it online at www.TM.org. But its nice to have around so you can read it anywhere and look clearly at the research. Meditation techniques are very different with very different results. The scientific research is clear that other techniques do not bring the wide range of benefits that come with the TM technique. So don't think that reading a book called \\"how to meditate\\" is going to give you the proven benefits of the TM program, shown by 600 scientific studies. It won't give you the free lifetime follow-up that comes with TM instruction either.So if you want to learn some sort of \\"meditation\\" from a book, don't buy this book.If you want a thorough introduction to the most effective and scientifically-proven stress reduction and self-development technique, you can't go wrong buying this book.

I no longer buy into the idea--promoted by famous doctors trying to sell books--that you can learn real meditation out of a book. It doesn't always work. Check out the research.

I have no doubt about his sincerity. Bit I cannot accept the argument that TM must be learnt from a face-to-face interview with a teacher and cannot be learnt by reading a book or listening to a tape. TM is not that much different from auto-suggestion, self-hypnosis or the Silva Mind Control or even prayer.

Of course no life is actually \\"PERFECT\\", especially in the way MOST OF THESE ANGRY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE! Don't listen to those people, the TM movement is one of the GREATEST MOVEMENTS IN THE WORLD TODAY (2005). If you really want to seek ANCIENT WISDOM like the rest of us has, you must go through the proper channels. Pearls are not thrown out to the swine. And these people who talk so harshly of TM must be the swine the parabole refers to. Also, TM can not be learned from a book, that is why you will find no book that will teach you TM because IT IS TOO PERSONAL AND TOO INDIVIDUALIZED to be learned from a book. If you are seriously interested in learning TM, and I advise everyone i know to, check out Maharishi's book, \\"The Science of Being and the Art of Living\\",or this one which is almost as good.

They are so deep that there are even conspiracy theories about conspiracy theories, so some of them could be described as meta-conspiracies. Navigating through this convolution is a difficult task and while Cohen makes attempts to be objective and rational, he fails on a regular basis.He cites some of the kooks and their theories without producing a bit of evidence. For example, one of the common themes is that Nazi Germany made some major technological breakthroughs that allowed them to build advanced flying machines that were the \\"Foo-fighters\\" seen so often by combat pilots in World War II. The problem with this theory is that if such machines had been developed by the Germans, no Allied pilot would have lived to tell the story. Furthermore, with such technology available to them, the Germans most likely would not have lost the war.This book starts out well, yet descends into a whirlwind of theories and unsupported assumptions. There are reports of actual \\"Men In Black\\" making appearances after sightings and numerous governmental obfuscations concerning UFO investigations. While everyone will concede that the government statements on these issues have been contradictory and absurd, it is a very long road from governmental incompetence to alien spacecraft. Cohen tends to travel that road without demonstrating any sufficient reason for going down it."},{"Title":"What You Wish For (Otto Penzler Books)","review":"What You Wish For picks up its characters and themes from one of David Cray's earlier efforts - Little Girl Blue. Peter Foley, an ex-cop turned crusader who hunts throught the underground world of child abuse seeking his kidnapped daughter and whatever justice he can extract from the monstous evil he sees. And Julia Brennan, not promoted to Captain of the Sex Crimes Unit, who is learning to navigate the difficult waters of police politics while fielding a case where the perpetrator gives in too easily.While the two story arcs in the book run independently, the lives of Brennan and Foley meet and touch at all levels, their seperate quests stress the relationship, but somehow fail to break it. Even when Foley distances himself to protect Julia from the effects of his investigation and she becomes so wrapped up in her own hunt that she barely notices that Foley hasn't returned her calls. One of Cray's more interesting approaches is to let his main characters have lives that share commonality and values but can proceed independently when needed.Julia's case, the effort to solve the violent murder of an elderly, wealthy, and unpleasant woman offers a unique focus on a part of investigation that is usually slighted in procedurals - the questioning of a suspect. This is a world of subtle clues and sometimes not-so-subtle techniques and Cray does a great job of portraying the process. He captures both the gripping and tedious elements of the process graphically.Foley's hunt is on it's last stretch. He has found a porno video in which his daughter appears. He pursues one faint clue after another with little regard for 'correct' procedure - always nearly out of control, and can cross the boundary without warning. In the end he must confront a fathers worst nightmare - his own insecurity about whether finding his daughter might be worse than not finding her.While Cray often borders on writing a noir novel, he never quite crosses over into that territory. Instead he distracts the reader from the grim nature of the crimes with a flurry of details. While the overall writing of the story is excellent, sometimes this device produces more confusion than intensity, especially when the book is really two unrelated stories about related characters. It would have been more satisfactory has there been a closer connection, or if the conflict had produced more of a clash of wills.Even so this was a readable and interesting book, but a bit more loosely written than I would have liked it to be. The focus is diffuse, but the subject matter is compelling. Recommended."},{"Title":"What You Wish For (Otto Penzler Books)","review":"Not only is David Cray a master at plotting and procedure, but he knows how to get under the skin of his readers with real-life, believable characters.

Julia Brennan, a captain in the New York City Police Department, is looking for the person who brutally murdered an elderly and wealthy widow, Adeline Rose. At the same time, Julia's lover, an ex-cop named Peter Foley, is searching for his daughter, Patti, who was snatched from a day care center five years earlier. Peter has spent a great deal of time infiltrating pedophile networks in an effort to get a lead on Patti's whereabouts.Julia is a rising star in the police department. By tying herself to Peter, Julia may be placing her own career in jeopardy. Peter is known as a loose cannon who will do anything to reclaim his daughter from the monster who kidnapped her. Although Julia wants to rise high in the ranks of the NYPD, she refuses to abandon Peter, and she empathizes with his desperation to find his little girl.Cray's book is sharp, fast-moving and, at times, harsh. The criminals in \\"What You Wish For\\" display some of the most reprehensible traits that humans are prone to, including betrayal, lust, greed, violence and hatred. However, Cray tempers this negative view of humanity with his depiction of the enormous love that Julia and Peter have for one another and for their children. It is this strong bond that has enabled the couple to weather some very difficult times.\\"What You Wish For\\" is a realistic and gripping thriller. It will have you turning pages quickly to find out how the two investigations play out. Peter Foley and Julia Brennan are vivid and intense characters, and the secondary characters are equally well drawn. Cray's dialogue and plotting are crisp and intelligent, and he maintains a high level of suspense throughout this well-written and highly recommended novel."},{"Title":"What You Wish For (Otto Penzler Books)","review":"Here's what I wish for in a crime novel - a compelling story, characters that come to life and that I care about and a page-turning pace.

Great police action and interaction with the FBI. Interesting descriptions of the techniques of interrogation.But it is filled with errors that a good editor would have caught. One example: Just at the climax of the search for Foley's daughter, it is stated that Foley, encountering the woman involved in his daughter's kidnapping, has no way to restrain her. No handcuffs, nylon ties, nothing. So he just chases her away. Two pages and only minutes later, he grabs the male kidnapper, and handcuffs him to a banister. Other errors irritate and break the reader's submersion in a gripping tale.Nonetheless, you will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"What You Wish For (Otto Penzler Books)","review":"NYPD captain, Julia Brennan, commanding officer of the district attorney's sex crime unit, knew the crime scene would be bad. The very rich and elderly, Adeline Rose, was found stabbed, slashed and bloody in her upper east side bedroom; at first glance, a burglary gone very wrong. But, Julia realizes almost immediately that this was no burglary. The motive for the crime was money, plain and simple, and within twenty-four hours she has three good suspects pinned down. At the same time, her lover and ex-undercover cop, Peter Foley, is following a new and important lead of his own. He has spent the last five years trying to find his kidnapped daughter, Patti, in the seedy and desperate underworld of pedophiles and child pornography. It looks like he's finally found the proof he's been looking for... that Patti, now eleven, is still alive, and possibly close by..... David Cray brings back two of his most engaging characters, as he weaves these two intriguing and seemingly unrelated story lines toward their stunning conclusion, in this compelling and satisfying sequel to last year's Little Girl Blue. This is a thriller that has it all... a tight, tense, and suspenseful story line filled with vivid and riveting scenes, crisp and entertaining writing, and brilliant characterizations. But it's Mr Cray's indepth research and great attention to detail that really adds credibility to the story, and by the time you've finished the first chapter, you'll be hooked for sure. For those new to master storyteller, David Cray, make sure you go back and read his earlier novels, Bad Lawyer and Little Girl Blue. For those who are already fans, What You Wish For is about to keep you up reading all night."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"I hit the mother lode when I purchased this outstanding collection of Polish heritage recipes.

There is a small section of cultural pictures in the middle of the book, but no recipe photos. I wish I would have known this prior to purchase. Come on amazon...do a better job with your descriptions!"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"This detailed work is an excellent companion to a very recent comprehensive book on Polish-Americana. Please click on, and read the Peczkis review, of Strybel'sPolish/Polonian Heritage and Lifestyles - Everything You Need to Know.The foods in this single volume are grouped in 26 categories, such as soups, poultry and wildlife, eggs and egg dishes, mushroom dishes, breads and rolls, puddings and other deserts, etc. Each category includes a section describing it and its history in Polish cuisine. The sections feature interesting information. For instance, Strybel suggests that one of the reasons that Polish ham is so good is because the pigs are fed on potatoes (p. 443). Another section states that groats have excellent nutritional value, which is described. (p. 423).Two profuse indexes exist in the back--one in Polish and one in English. In them, the foods are all listed alphabetically. For instance, the index includes 48 different mushroom-based recipes.CAUTION: Perusing this excellent work may stimulate your appetite.A series of photographs are provided. They show just a few of the Polish dishes presented.Towards the end of the book, there is a helpful section for converting weights, measures and temperatures. For instance, the weight of one metric cup (250 ml) is converted, for various foods, into equivalent metric weights (decagrams) and equivalent English weights (ounces).Strybel includes helpful how-to information. For instance, he has descriptions and sketches showing the method of making, and then smoking, homemade Polish sausage. (The recipes for sausages number quite a few.). He also gets into home canning of foods.Most of the food items required for the recipes are common ones that are readily available. However, a few are not. Cities with large Polish populations not only have stores that carry Polish foods, but also do so with a far greater variety than the ma-and-pa stores of yesteryear. In addition, large supermarket chains (such as the Jewel Food Stores in Chicago) have departments that stock ethnic foods, including Polish food.The reader who does not live in or near a city with a large Polish population is told how to acquire Polish foods. For this purpose, a list is provided, along with contact information, of major outlets of Polish foods, mainly in the USA and Poland."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"My wife's a Pole, and os I bought this for her despite the fact that I've never had a Polish dish I've liked. But if you thought Polish food was nothing but sausages, cabbage, and mixing nasty fish into your otherwise fine patatoes (as I did) then prepare to expand your definition of what Polish food is all about! There's some really good food in here.A few people have cited problems with the directions, which are presented in paragraph form without the typical list of ingredients needed followed by a numerically ordered process. You will need to adjust, but the recipes are short and simple. Few recipes are longer than this review that you're reading right now. Just read the recipe first, make sure you have all the items you need. It's not so hard!I also like how the titles of each dish are in English AND Polish, though I'll never, ever be able to say those strange Eastern European words.The book is well organized too. The large section concerning the many Polish ways of preparing rabbit however, will probably never be exhausted by most Americans, as few grocers supply the meat."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"Did not like set out of book. Would prefer ingredients at the top then the recipe underneath. Hard to find ingredients."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"This is the companion book to another by the small author. Really like the idea about the the traditions and history being in the book. However, my feelings about this book is the same as the other. Good representation of Polish cooking, however, a difficult recipe book to read and follow. Recipes are in paragraph style and addtional time is needed to determine the ingredients. Not sure the recipes were edited and tested as written as I found I had to adjust each one that I used.The concept was good but the delivery was poor. Perhaps the author/book publisher should have created versions for the US and Europe."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"My girlfriend is Polish, so we got this for my mom for her birthday. She loves it! Easy to follow, and delicious recipes."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"I bake my yeast breads from this book, they taste just like Mom's and Grandma's baking. Almost everything else I cooked from this book had a taste straight from my childhood. I say 'almost' because I am Ukrainian, but our neighbours' cuisine is very close to ours. The recipes do have authentic flavours"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"There is no other comparable Polish cookbook in the marketplace. For cooks of Polish heritage this book is a must. For those interested in learning about Polish food and Polish food traditions this book is a goldmine. It is encyclopedic in its treatment of the rich culinary traditions of Poland. Some reviewers have noted that the recipes are somewhat difficult to follow as there are no ingredient listings with the recipes and few illustrations. This is true, you need to be somewhat facile in the kitchen to maximize the rich information buried in the text. That can be daunting for many amatuer cooks, but the effort is so worth it. The recipe's are authentic and have not been anglicized or adapted for western tastes. Yes there are some exotic ingredients, and if you don't live in an area that has a concentration of Poles living in it, can be difficult to find. But, over 90% of the ingredients refered to in the text are readily available in most supermarkets.The recipe's are well written and very concise. The section on Pierogi and the various fillings is worth the purchase price on its own. The book also does a superlative job of highlighting the traditional holiday dishes that are central to many families' own traditions.These are the recipes of my youth and probably the youth of many first generation people of Polish heritage. Where else can you read in the opening line of a recipe; \\" Take a 3-4 pound beef roast and beat it with a rolling pin.\\" My mother actually did that. When I read the recipes I can visualize my mother, who passed away many years ago, in the kitchen making them. I can smell the aromas and savor the flavors. I can remember the family meals where we would joyfully and eagerly devour the foods she set forth; I can still hear the laughter and bickering. This is more than a simple cookbook. The authors give the reader insights into the cultural context for many of the dishes and in the process an insight into the character of the Polish people. I often claim that a country's history is reflected in its cuisine and that is abosolutely true in this case. Every Polish American should buy this book if they want the definitive word on Poilsh culinary traditions."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"This a wonderful book that I would recommend for anyone interested in adding to their kitchen library. Very easy to read and follow recipies."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"My husband is Polish, so I wanted an authetic Polish Cookbook to use! If you want such a book, this one is for you!"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"I read the previous reviews only after looking through my Kindle version, and decided a more updated review was needed. Starting at the absolute beginning of the book, and reading only the lengthy forward, I was extremeley interested in getting to actual recipes. The history and information in the forward alone could be a book in itself and it was ALL good stuff. Before you ever try a dish, your mouth is watering for dill, and other such tastes. I only glanced at the perogi section and decided I need to buy a printed version, as this would be a book I want to share with others. It is only the 1st week of January, but I have ideas for this coming December! The small section on flavored salts, has given me ideas for gifts to friends for the next holiday season. Any cook would be very interested in this book and although I have not tried the recipes the other reviews seem to all agree that they are pretty easy and turn out great, I am sold on it!"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"I love this cookbook, the recipes are excellent, and easy to follow. I've successfully prepared many dishes I'd never heard of before I married my husband who is Polish.I'd reccommend this book to anyone who wants to prepare authentic polish recipes."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"This is the bible on good Polish home cooking.You'll find at least one recipe for most dishes you can think of. They are clear, easy to follow, and the results taste just like my grandmother's cooking (she wonders how I do it without asking her for help).There is an excellent section on ingredients and good directions for things like making your own bialy ser/twarog so that you can produce good Polish cooking regardless of how well or poorly stocked your local delicatessen is.I occassionally feel that Pan Strybel is a little bossy, but the results justify it - my chicken soup has never been better.Younger cooks may choose to ignore some of the garnishing suggestions as they are somewhat dated.The index is really good, making it easy to find what you're looking for (in Polish or in English).And when you're feeling a little tired and missing Poland, just curl up and read."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"I had no exposure to Polish cooking until I got a Polish boyfriend. I ended up with this book and I am now a big fan of Polish food. Who knew there was more than Perogies at the local fair? This book literally has EVERY recipe even a Pole could want and I have been reliably informed that the recipes are very authentic. I know I have enjoyed making many of them and have also been very surprised at how scrumptious the results have been. You could buy this book just for the dessert recipes alone but I love the soups and special hearty foods like bigos. I do wish this book had more photos but if it did, it would impossible to lift. I have found the recipes easy to follow although a bit inconvenient in that the ingredients are listed within the directions. Then again, maybe that is good because it makes me read the entire recipe before I gather the ingredients. Some of these recipes take some time to prepare so you need to read before you make up your menu. I have other Polish cookbooks but I think this is the only one a person needs. A good investment."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"Having been raised a third-generation Polish-American in Western Massachusetts (where else!), I can honestly say that this book captures the divine essence of what great Polish cooking should be. Almost everyone has tasted, or at least has heard of kielbasa, that typical sausage flavored with a lot of garlic, golabki, or stuffed cabbage, and pierogi. It is custom for most of these dishes to be served with a hearty slice or two of rye or pumpernickel and boiled potatoes, as well as a shot of good vodka. These dishes are just a tiny fraction of what should be thought of as traditional Polish fare.When I first came across this book years ago, I was so impressed to find such an extensive recipe collection printed in the English language. To this day, Polish cuisine is highly underrated to quite the extent that both fine French and Italian cuisine were at one point. It was once perceived, almost intentionally, that French and Italian chefs here in the States always cooked the same things both at home as well as in the restaurants. It is through these influences that we culminated so many of the classic dishes we all know and love today. Now there is a huge array of recipes and cookbooks out there for those who wish to explore the specific regions that make these dishes we all have come to relish. The same can be said about Polish cuisine, which is typically represented by the few dishes that has made it popular. Even today, few cookbooks talking about Polish food can be held in such high regard as this one. Those unaccustomed to this vast art form can find recipes ranging from the typical to the atypical. There are plenty of recipes for golabki, pierogi and paczki, those jam-filled doughnuts associated with Lent. Again, though, this makes up such a small amount of a cuisine that is sure to attract many devotees. There are chapters devoted to all sorts of hors d'oeuvres and soups, both hot and cold. Soup truly is the staff of life to any Pole. Cabbage, potato and mushroom lovers will rejoice at the numerous recipes (many with their own section) found all throughout this book, but it doesn't end there, my friends. The meat and game dishes are so delicious and varied, you'll wonder why you never sampled them before. Then come chapters devoted to pickling (true Polish style brine-pickled cucumbers, forget all those insipid store-bought varieties you're used to), homemade dairy products, cheese and sour cream, the essential Polish product along with twarog, or farmer's cheese. Learn how to make your own kielbasa in the chapter dealing with sausage-making, curing and smoking, endless breads and pastries, and finally a chapter devoted to the incomparable list of Polish beverages, ranging from the national favorite tea, which includes as many as eight or nine different brewing techniques. The same is included for true Polish coffee, and a long list of flavorings and liqueurs.Do yourselves a favor and buy this book.. it will always remain a huge favorite among your entire family!!"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"Just reading the pierogi dough &amp; stuffing recipes sent me right back to Babcha's kitchen! Now I remember her secrets &amp; will always have them at hand. This is the &quot;bible&quot; for all Polish kitchens &amp; those who appreciate Polish food. I bought my mother a wonderful Polish cook book many years ago, but waite 'til she sees this one!"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"At first glance the book was disappointing and daunting primarily because the recipes are in paragraph format without a list of ingredients; however, after sitting down with the book I found it to be authentic and very easy to use. The selections are immense and covered the gamut of Polish cuisine. I would recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"If you ever wanted to know where Babcia learned to cook - this is it! Every conceivable Polish recipe can be found on these pages, provided with loving detail and insider tips. Mr Strybel makes it his business to ensure you get the \\"feel\\" of Polish cooking, not just the bare bones..He provides a very useful intro describing what makes Polish cooking unique, what kept it relatively unknown and unappreciated, what gives it its national flavour and even why Poles use the ingredients they do - fascinating insights, not just for Poles.There are just enough photos and step-by-step illustrations to make things easy and inspiring, and whole sections are devoted to making your own produce, such as dairy products and meat products not readily available outside Europe. This is an immense help to Westerners who don't even seem to have access to natural, raw milk these days - Mr Strybel has some interesting things to say about health benefits and modern nutrition here! Though probably not his intent, Mr Strybel makes some of the most compelling arguments for a return to \\"slow\\" food I have ever read.Although ingredients aren't listed at the beginning of recipes (to save space) it really isn't that much of a big deal - after all, when you're cooking you probably have to read through the recipe a few times anyway to get the feel for the job, thus familiarising yourself with what's required. Instead, Mr Strybel has provided an excellent index, in both Polish and English, making recipes easy to find, even by ingredient, which I think is far more useful than listed ingredients.What I loved most about this book, however, is Mr Strybel's courage to present Polish cooking unashamedly as it is - a relatively unknown (he explains why this is so) culinary tradition, which once sampled cannot be forgotten - the kind of home-cooking that will always be chosen and enjoyed far more than any haute cuisine can be because it feeds the soul as well as the body. It's simple and stodgy cuisine, right? Wrong! This prejudice Mr Strybel blows completely out of the water by reminding us that peasant fare mixed with royal culinary tradition gives you dishes such as slow-roasted duck with wild mushrooms and juniper berries - it ain't all cabbage, folks..not that there's anything wrong with cabbage if you know how to cook it.For the health conscious, on the face of it, Polish cooking is high fat, high everything cooking, but as Mr Strybel points out - well, you'll just have to read what he has to say about all that!It's been said before but I'll say it again - this is the definitive Babcia's bible! Whether you're Polish or not, you'll be amazed at the breadth and depth of this book - I know I was and I've been cooking Polish food all my life. Thank you Mr Strybel :)"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"It's the best! Whatever my sister or I have tried from this cookbook tastes *just* like Babci used to make!!! I'd recommend this one to any cook who wants to eat like he or she used to at their grandmother's house!"},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"Anybody interested in an encyclopedic compendium of Polish recipes will not regret buying this book. This hefty tome, at over 800 pages, is as thorough a resource to the Polish kitchen as Irma Bombeck's Joy of Kitchen is to an American one. The format of the recipes may be a little daunting if you're used to a chart of ingredients preceding the cooking instructions, but the sheer volume of recipes in this book lend themselves best to this format. Sometimes, instructions can be a little non-obvious. For example, recipes will call for items like \\"beet sour\\" or \\"Polish pork seasoning,\\" which, if you're just leafing through the book, you might not realize that there are recipes contained in the cookbook for those ingredients. In other words, where a cookbook may typically write \\"1/2 cup beet sour (see recipe on page XYZ),\\" the parenthetical reference is omitted, and you have to check the index. It's a minor point, but I can see it being confusing if you don't immediately realize it.The book contains recipes for almost everything Polish food related under the sun. I was especially impressed to find recipes for homemade sausages (both fresh and cold smoked) and cured meats (like bacon), even though many kitchens may not be equipped for sausage making or cold smoking. If you have access to these things, those recipes are there for you. The spice & herbs section is a complete and informative rundown of the role of seasonings in Polish cookery. There is an entire chapter devoted to mushroom dishes (an important ingredient in our cuisine.) Five different recipes for pierogi doughs, and an entire section on Polish dumplings of all types, from pierogi to pyzy to kopytka. There's a chapter on home preserves, as well as recipes for various flavored cordials, vodkas and brandies (nalewki) that are sure to be part of any Polish bar.In short, the breadth and depth of the research and recipes are amazing. This is the best English-language resource I've seen for the Polish cuisine."},{"Title":"Polish Heritage Cookery: A Hippocrene Original Cookbook","review":"I found this book to be extremely informative and historical. I doubt if any Polish recipe has been excluded. I like the style in which the recipies are written - not a list of ingredients, but in a narrative. There are a few pictures, but due to the volume of recipies, illustrating them all would be impossible. It is a thick book full of Polish culture and cuisine. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Rotary Spokes","review":"a rip roaring ride through middle america with the good citizens of Normal, a no horse town in the middle of nowhere.

Look at how he advises directors and actors on the ways in which rehearsals become far more productive; the ways scenes become much more dynamic. I am especially impressed with Ahart's methods of rehearsing actors, how to balance structure with freedom, how to create an environment where the play &quot;inevitably happens&quot;. This text offers ideas I've never seen anywhere else and not only does &quot;The Director's Eye&quot; present theory; it equally demonstrates how to impliment techniques of rehearsing actors, staging scenes, creating a working ensemble. People may think that they know these concepts; however, I strongly advocate reading this text. It will shake up many conventions that work against the immediate theatrical experience. Just one example is the way Ahart advises having actors memorize their lines - a seemingly banal task few have investigated. Ahart argues that it is often here that acting dies, in the methods actors use to retain their lines. The text is also a practical guidebook offering examples of directing such as working with comedy, scoring the play, creating rehearsal units, and progressing through rehearsals.I plan to recommend &quot;The Director's Eye&quot; to every other teacher of directing and acting that I know!"},{"Title":"The Director's Eye: A Comprehensive Textbook for Directors and Actors","review":"Along with William Ball's superb A SENSE OF DIRECTION, Director and instructor John Ahart's THE DIRECTOR'S EYE stand as the finest book ever written about the art of directing.Breaking down the mystery of directing into simple yet illuminating steps, Ahart takes great pains to celebrate the individual voice and the joy inherent in the art of the collaborative theatre.Ahart stresses the importance of finding the artist's point of view and marrying it to the author's text in creating a staged performance. Carefull to discriminate between merely \\"staging\\" a play from \\"directing\\", Ahart lays out several activities and philosophies designed to create a safe and collaborative environment where the actors and the director (as well as designers and the rest of the production staff) work to create a unified production that can move an audience.Ahart should actually have called the book, THE DIRECTOR'S HEART as he repeatedly stresses the importance of using the natural and personal experienceds that one brings to the creative table. He constantly (and rightfully) stresses that the creative process is NOT an intellectual excersise but rather one of passion. It is the intellect though that focuses and DIRECTS the passion towards a single, focuses point.Written in an inspirational, approachable and helpful tone, THE DIRECTOR'S EYE is a must have for any director and actor."},{"Title":"The Director's Eye: A Comprehensive Textbook for Directors and Actors","review":"John Ahart's The Director's Eye is a comprehensive text for directors and actors is intended for student audiences, but contains practical information which represents a half-century of experience in teaching and directing, containing over thirty chapters on everything from imparting the style and content of a play to the special challenges of comedy and other formats. A 'must' for aspiring directors."},{"Title":"The Director's Eye: A Comprehensive Textbook for Directors and Actors","review":"This is one of those books that I keep coming back to, re-reading a passage or chapter, setting it down, and then coming back to it, again and again.It isn't just for theatre directors; it's for actors in film, television, and theatre, and anyone else in the arts who longs to build meaning into their work.As an actor in Hollywood, I can say that productions out here seem to get mired in the technical trappings--the lights, the camera angles, sightlines, continuity, cheating this out, coverage, blah blah. But where the hell is the connection between the actors? Between the director and the actor? Between the actor and himself? What is the dramatic action? And most of all, why the hell are we doing this, anyway? Does this mean anything to any of us? Where's the humanity in this piece? What's our personal connection to this material?The messages in this book are universal and practical. Someone said when I moved to LA, &quot;You need to find your voice.&quot; This book is the Start button."},{"Title":"The Director's Eye: A Comprehensive Textbook for Directors and Actors","review":"The Director's Eye, announced as a comprehensive textbook for directors and actors, is that and so much more. John Ahart's creation is a book of rare breadth and depth. Broad in its application, in the very universality that is the theatre and life. Deep in its impact, in the way it takes us to the core of our experience and ourselves.Emerging directors and actors will find Ahart's original and well thought-out approach to directing and acting invaluable as they prepare for, deepen their relationship with, and celebrate the works they engage. Gentle but purposeful instruction, ample provision for incremental practice, and reliance on the discrimination of the authentic audience, whether the audience of one or many, make this effort an extraordinary contribution to the field of theatre.For those of us who find our vocation outside of theatre, The Director's Eye is an unexpected treasure. Pithy comments, artfully constructed analogies, and rare insights are found at every turn of the page. With grace and perceptiveness John Ahart writes about directing but teaches leadership.The author himself signals the importance of this work beyond the world of the play. In the preface he tells us that learning to direct . . . &quot;demands continuous learning about ways to nurture the evolution of a collectively created world.&quot; What is leadership if not the nurturing of &quot;a collectively created world?&quot;The seven parts of the book each have a message for leaders. Part One helps us define the role of the leader and pay attention to what is important. Part Two emphasizes the value of preparing for the result we envision. Its six chapters help us enter the moment, harness the power of our mindset, appreciate the impact of words, find models to shape our action, build on the potential of our space, and enhance time through the potency of choice. Part Three invites us to let &quot;the work&quot; shape its own process and result. Part Four calls our assumptions into question and uses the tool of collaboration to unify our work. Part Five takes communication to a new level by recognizing the essential nature of deeply connected relationships. Part Six causes us to look anew at common resources and take advantage of what we have previously failed to notice. Finally, Part Seven helps us make sense of the whole. It warns us not to be defined by our resources. It inveigles us to stay true to our core purpose. It sets us free to pursue our own vision.All of us, whether company CEO or leader in a more subtle arena, will find this book to be a friend on the leadership journey. It is filled with opportunities to help ourselves, our families, and our organizations find satisfying purpose in what we do together, create the culture we want to be a part of, and deliver what we choose at a level that pleases us and our &quot;audience.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Director's Eye: A Comprehensive Textbook for Directors and Actors","review":"the director's eye is an appropriate title for a directing book that explores varied ways of seeing, looking, and translating for the stage. ahart's text is a lively introduction for the novice director while also serving as a refreshing reminder for experienced directors. the assignments nicely support the seven part organizational structure of the book. ahart does not claim to have answers but enthusiastically points the reader toward a lively \\"vision\\" of what it means and the joy as well as work involved in taking on the role of director."},{"Title":"Southern Evangelicals and the Social Order, 1800-1860","review":"Loveland delivers a fairly complete picture of evangelical's effect on southern society. Drawing from the journals and sermons of southern evangelical ministers, Loveland explores firsthand how regenrated preachers felt about politics, society and the cause of Christ throughout the South.She recounts how the evangelical sermon was a crossroads of politics, society and religion, as ministers often addressed the burning questions of the day from the pulpit. She describes the missionary activity so characteristic of northern evangelists undertaken by their southern counterparts. She shows how southern preachers were involved in a host of benevolent projects, from reforming sailors to caring for the poor. She relates how many southern evangelicals believed in instructing and converting slaves to Christianity but that they differed from their northern contemporaries in that they also upheld and defened slavery.Overall, one of the best books on the complex and fascinating topic of antebellum southern evangelicalism."},{"Title":"Book of the Pug","review":"This is a very useful and complete handbook (there is even a Perpetual Whelping Chart ) .

This cookbook is spiral bound, so it lays flat & has a ton of recipes, put together by catagory, ie: appetizers & beverages, soups & sandwiches, salads,vegetables,meats & main dishes,to terrific desserts, cookies, candies etc. It is 220 pages with 3 to 4 recipes per page plus miscellaneous recipes for things like Playdough, halloween makeup, bbq sauce etc. Between each catagory is a part of her bio with pictures, it's very sweet.

Stagner\\", etc.) or on a specific railroad (\\"Wabash Trackside With Emery Gulash 1954-1974\\", \\"Boston & Maine Trackside With Arthur E. Mitchell\\", \\"Trackside Along the B&O; 1957-1958 With Edward P. Griffith\\", etc).Although at first glance this book may appear to be part of that series, it is NOT. It was published by Greenberg Press (and later re-published by Johns Hopkins University Press), the publishing company of Bill and Linda Greenberg in Sykesville, MD, publishers of a comprehensive line of books on Lionel, American Flyer, Marx and Kusan model trains (including an extensive number of books on Lionel train repair), and other pre-war and post-war stalwart toys (such as Gilbert Erector Sets, \\"Tootsietoys\\", doll houses, and Star Trek collectibles, among other toys).This particular book represents one of Greenberg's several entries into books on full sized railroading (\\"Union Pacific Business Cars, 1870 - 1991\\", \\"The Royal Blue Line: The Classic B&O; Train Between Washington and New York\\", and several others). It is truly an outstanding book on railroading and one of the best of its genre I've seen. The book is chock full of great black and white photographs by photographer James Gallagher accompanied by descriptive prose by Baltimore Sunpapers Columnist Jacques Kelly.The photos are varied, engaging and plentiful. They are not just about trains (although plenty of them are) but also about RAILROADING, including the people of railroading and the scenes of railroading. Some of my favorites are one of a locomotive engineer accompanied in the cab by his railroad's canine mascot, as well as some taken in and around Harpers Ferry, West Virginia (which is just across the Potomac River from Maryland and must certainly be one of the most picturesque communities and railroad track layouts in the country).The book is set mainly in the State of Maryland (and surrounding locales) and features the railroads you would expect to see in that area, namely the Pennsylvania Railroad, Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, Western Maryland Railroad, Norfolk & Western Railroad, and the \\"Ma and Pa\\" (Maryland and Pennsylvania) Railroad. It focuses on the time when steam was just starting to be replaced by diesel and while the bulk of the photos are of steam locomotives, there is an ample supply of photos of diesels, GG1 electric locomotives, RDC cars and even a few of the PRR's \\"Aerotrain\\".While Marylanders will particularly enjoy this volume, one need not have a connection to that geographical area to enjoy the exceptional railroad photography and text. Any lover of railroading will truly appreciate it. As of this writing, it is available in hardback on Amazon for a price that's extremely reasonable for railroad books these days (and on Amazon Marketplace for even less in some cases). Even at the full price it surely one of the great values in railroadiana available today."},{"Title":"Trackside Maryland: From Railyard to Main Line","review":"This book offers beautiful photography and useful commentary. It is not just about trains or, worse still, just about locomotives - as are far too many railroad books. These photos show railroads and trains in their physical contexts.I should mention, however, that the subjects of these photographs are highly concentrated, in/around the state of Maryland, and perhaps are of less interest to persons not emotionally or otherwise connected to that region."},{"Title":"Trackside Maryland: From Railyard to Main Line","review":"I found this book to be very good; if you're from the Mid Atlantic States it's a great book! Many of the photos and stories are very good; almost all are black and white. This book had me looking back in time and remembering the days of powerful steam engines and then powerful diesel locomotives. A lot of the book is dedicated to the latter. I would highly recommend this book, even if you're not from the Maryland area the photos and stories are very good and trains of course are national in nature."},{"Title":"Better spelling: Fourteen steps to spelling improvement","review":"As a college instructor, I have been looking for a comprehensive spelling book made for adult learners--a book that covers the troublesome problems that most poor spellers face. This book has excellent exercises, but all the answers are included in the back of the book. A teacher would note know if students were getting the content or merely copying answers. It's a bit technical in that the book is designed at the beginning for rather detailed diagnosis. This might frighten off some students. Good section on using the dictionary, but the Pronunciation Symbols page is in such small font, one needs a magnifying glass. Overall, the book is good for college students and adult learners. One of the best, and I've looked at dozens!"},{"Title":"Dolphins","review":"The author squeezes so much information into 90 pages that, at times, he sounds like an encyclopedia. He includes but goes beyond discussing dolphin types, habitats, family life, feeding habits, and echolocation. He explains, for example, how dolphins avoid turbulences in water when swimming at high speed; that they are the only animals that can follow instructions given on a TV screen; how they team up with sea birds or use tools to catch prey, and many other fascinating facts. Wonderful photographs show popular and lesser known dolphins such as the bottlenose and Irrawaddy dolphins in Cambodia, respectively, In the last chapter, the author also discusses ongoing research, and dangers dolphins face from commercial fishing practices, underwater noise pollution, and toxic effluent from land-based industry.I wish the author had explained if and how research equipment attached to dolphins affects their swimming, social and feeding habits. Some of the equipment is quite substantial and must interfere in some way. On the one hand he seems so interested in how dolphins avoid turbulences, especially around their heads, on the other hand he does not explain how hydrophones attached to the dolphins' heads interfere with swimming speed, and other behaviors. Overall, however, it is an interesting book with lots of information."},{"Title":"Dolphins","review":"This review is for Gallery Books' 1985 publication of Dolphins by Michael Bright. Dolphins is an excellent photograph and information book. There are many great action photographs showing dolphins jumping out of the sea into the air, \\"tail-walking\\" in performing at marine parks, and affectionately interacting with human trainers. It was interesting learning that dolphins' leaping manner of swimming actually saves energy and gives them the ability to reach top speeds. It was also interesting learning that dolphins like to position themselves on the pressure waves in front of moving boats and ships so that they can stop swimming and in essence surf along at speeds over 35 miles per hour. \\"Chapter 3 -- The Greatest Show On Earth\\" (pages 36-49) covers the history of dolphins in captivity at marine parks and concludes with the interesting fact that captive dolphins tend to prefer remaining with humans than returning to the sea. (A pleasant memory from the 1970s is going to Sea World and tossing small fish to energetic dolphins and sea lions in small pools. It was so exciting seeing the dolphins and sea lions vigorously and playfully rising up out of the water in the very close experience to catch the tossed fish in their mouths.) Dolphins have been seen helping injured dolphins and humans in distress at sea. The book concludes with advice on helping stranded dolphins and a quote from Plutarch: \\"To the dolphin alone nature has given that which the best philosophers seek: friendship for no advantage. Though it has no need of help of any man, yet it is a genial friend to all, and has helped man.\\""},{"Title":"Dolphins","review":"This is an awesome books on dolphins!Tells about feeding,family life,humans and dolphins,coservation and lots more.

Far from the grand movements of the armies, the great battles and the central figures of the Civil War, one finds thousands of examples of personal courage of men who met the occasion, but have been largely forgotten by history.Mark Crawford in \\"Confederate Courage on Other Fields\\" does great justice to four of these lesser-known stories of sacrifice, bravery in the face of great danger, suffering, and devotion to duty by men fighting for the Confederate cause. I found each tale to be well researched, insightful and easy to read.\\"'Tisn't life that matters! \`Tis the courage you bring to it&quot; -Sir Hugh Walpole. I believe Colonel Charles Blacknall of the 23rd North Carolina Infantry, as described in Crawford's book, exemplifies the courageous leadership exhibited by many men of the south. A wealthy, educated planter, Blacknall hated drilling, the study of tactics and many of the trappings of the military. However, belief in a cause led him to great accomplishment, at a price of personal sacrifice, ultimately his own life. As you read his letters, and gain insight into his devotion to his family, and his love and understanding of his men, you will admire this fellow who gave all for what he believed in.My primary reason for buying this book was my lifelong interest of events in the bitter struggle for control of Southeast Missouri. Though considered a backwater of the War and often ignored by historians, the violence of partisan and guerilla actions in these border counties profoundly affected everyone living in the region. Instead of a five-hour skirmish or five-day battle, the fate of this area was sealed in five years of ugly, shocking bloodletting and destruction. Most folks fled. In many parts of Southeast Missouri and Northeast Arkansas the bitterness remains to this day. Crawford's treatment of the conflict between Major James Wilson on the Union side and Colonel Timothy Reeves on the Confederate side is the most fair, accurate and honest I have read. A consequence of this contest was the execution of prisoners on both sides. In reading this account you will come to appreciate the bravery and gallantry of men caught up in a struggle without rules and often driven by revenge that discouraged noble actions.You will finish this book with an expanded understanding of the \\"Brother's War\\", and the tremendous sacrifice of the average Confederate soldier as he faced danger in a courageous or fearless manner. I hope Mark will consider a sequel exploring the courage of Union men. I heartily recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Confederate Courage on Other Fields: Four Lesser Known Accounts of the War Between the States","review":"This book delivers what it promises... 4 battles you surely would not have studied (unless you happened to be a &quot;local&quot; to one of the sites), seperate from one another but tied together by the crimson thread of Courage.Great Stuff!I highly recommend reading this book if you are a fan of Military History, a student of the &quot;Civil War&quot;, or simply attracted to real acts of Heroism &amp; Courage from an era blessed with a level of integrity and grit that is only a faded memory to America today."},{"Title":"A Bouquet for Mother (Notable Keepsake Gift Book)","review":"This poetic book expresses thoughts that we have always felt, but seldom expressed to our mothers.

Thank you for this wonderful gift!"},{"Title":"Vampire Sextette","review":"In his introduction to this collection of six original erotic vampire novellas, editor Marvin Kaye insists that he has included stories of \\"the traditional bloodsucking variety.\\" If that is his intent, I have to say he failed rather miserably. You will find no vampires in this collection that resemble the traditional image of the breed. In a couple of cases, vampirism seems to be an after-thought having no real connection to the story being told. There is a fair share of eroticism in these pages, but as often as not it strikes me as gratuitous and thus ineffective.Kim Newman's The Other Side of Midnight is, frankly, a mess. There is hardly any plot at all to it. Genevieve is an elder vampire going on six hundred years old, currently working as a private detective in California. Someone is obsessed with remaking Dracula movies, including the great Orson Welles. Welles hires Gene to find out about the man financing his project, a horrible remake of the Dracula story that was supposed to be Welles' big comeback movie. In the midst of a plethora of Hollywood name-dropping, we also have Barbie the Vampire Slayer who is following the designs of the Overlooker (who happens to be a high school librarian). Somehow all of these people are related, but the whole story is a ridiculous farce subsisting solely on nonsense.Nancy Collins' Some Velvet Morning features Sonja Blue, the vampire/vampire slayer who has walked the pages of much of the author's fiction. Sporting a black leather motorcycle jacket and mirrored sunglasses, she is the Blue Monster who badly wounded the Contessa years earlier and is determined to finish her off once and for all. The Contessa is not a typical vampire; rather, she is a strega, one who has transformed herself into an Undead creature through black magic. Rather than drink the blood of her victims, she washes in their blood in order to retain your youth and vitality. She has her own private renfield named Phaedra who seduces men and brings them home to supply her mistress' needs. I really enjoyed this story once I got past the overtly sexual descriptions early on. Although Sonja is not heavily featured in the story as a whole-it is really the Contessa's story-she comes across as a most unusual \\"hero.\\" We know she is a vampire, and we know her transformation was not a wanted one, but we are given few clues about her history and motivations.The prolific Brian Stableford contributes the tale \\"Sheena\\" about a young Goth rock singer/songwriter. The protagonist Tony Weever meets Sheena at work and becomes intrigued with her slight, deeply mysterious presence. Sheena introduces Tony to a Gothic-dominated world built on memories of past lives, weaving a spell of sorts over him that leads him to thirst for the type of life in which the two of them can be truly together. The story reads pretty well throughout but peters out into a slightly esoteric conclusion involving uncommon shades of vampirism.S. P. Somtow's Vanilla Blood is just puerile nonsense, pornography disguised as vampiric fiction. It consists almost exclusively of the transcript of a ridiculous murder case. A young man killed his family and went on a murder spree, and the trial details the events leading up to his crime. The witnesses are teenagers who describe disgusting vampiric activities in graphic terms that would never be permitted in any courthouse in the country, much of which has little to do with the facts of the purported murder case. This courtroom farce is inane and not at all worth reading.Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's In the Face of Death seems to have a lot of potential early on but slowly fizzles as the story progresses. This is basically a tale of an affair between William T. Sherman's and a high-society vampire in 1855. My intense dislike of Sherman admittedly affected my capacity for embracing the story; I had no desire to picture the man naked and engaging in passions of the flesh, I can assure you. To the story's detriment, it never rises above the prurient level of Sherman's adulterous liaisons with Madelaine, a youthful vampire already well over a century old. Sherman comes off as a weak, pathetic fool unable to control his passion for Madelaine despite his responsibilities to a wife and children of his own. As far as the vampirism aspect of the tale is concerned, it is quite remote. We hear of Madelaine's chests of native soil and her lining of her shoes with it so as to walk in the light of day, and that's about it. The only moments involving lips and necks coming together involve kissing and nothing more. I just don't think there is much to this particular story; the inclusion of a famous man of history in its pages serves no other purpose than to make the work stand out among other genre pieces. I would not even call this horror; it is basically a romance.The concluding piece is the unusual vampire tale The Isle is Full of Noises by Tanith Lee. It does live up to its billing as a vampire story unlike any I've read before, but the story didn't work for me at all. Lee intimately links a vampire with a piano, and no amount of literary preening makes the connection an effective one. The story also contains a story within a story, sometimes making things confusing. The premise sounds good; the protagonist works out her frustrations of an unrequited love by writing the man into her works of fiction, punishing him in the only fashion she knows how. Quickly, though, the story gets bogged down in two competing storylines (one of them a story within a story) of converging vampiric pianos. The whole thing is just too murky to be effective."},{"Title":"Vampire Sextette","review":"Well, this book has its good and bad points, and since there are stories I'd like to praise immensely, let's get the bad out of the way first. The bad apple that nearly spoils the whole bunch, and my sole reason for giving this book three stars is Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's revoltingly sentimental, cheesy \\"In the Face of Death.\\" I laughed out loud quite a few times reading this tripe, and not because there is any humor involved, but because of the huge cheese factor. Okay, on to the good stuff. The higlights of this collection are S.P. Somtow's \\"Vanilla Blood,\\" and the always impressive Tanith Lee's \\"The Isle is Full of Noises.\\" \\"Vanilla Blood\\" is the tale of a high school kid who was driven to form a murderous sexual cult, apparently under the influence of a group of vampires. The story is told in quite an unusual fashion, taking place entirely at a murder trial, and told in the form of witnesses' statements. There are some very humorous elements to it as well (at least, I found them humorous).The overall effect is quite unique, and this story stayed in my mind for a long time. \\"The Isle is Full of Noises\\" is a story of a vampire of a VERY unusual sort, and a woman's peculiar fixation on it. It may be a bit hard to read at first, but stick with it, it is well worth the effort. The other stories are not as great as these two, but are not bad by any means. \\"Sheena\\" by Brian Stableford, is a very touching love story. I enjoyed it immensely, even though it really has no horrific elements. Anyone who has ever loved and lost will find much to relate to in this one. Nancy A. Collins's contribution to the collection, \\"Some Velvet Morning\\", is a Sonja Blue story, so fans of the series will undoubtedly love it. Kim Newman's \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\" is set in his \\"Anno Dracula\\" world and features Orson Welles as one of the main characters! You can't go wrong with a setup like that! All in all, this collection is worth buying, just avoid that ridiculous waste of paper whose title I am loathe to mention again."},{"Title":"Vampire Sextette","review":"Unbelieveable plots and very little vampirism in this collection of wanna-be vamp tales.I am a huge fan of vampire stories and thought by the little monologue from the book's editor Marvin Kaye that he would deliver us some real horror and scare factor here, but all I found was contrived and boring stories that had little to do with vampires at times and some downright off the path altogether, i.e., the third tale titled 'Sheena'.Some even read more like porno rather than horror, i.e., 'Vanilla Blood'.The only tale that came marginally close to vampires and horror was 'Some Velvet Morning', a tale about a slayer on the trail of a witch who bathes in blood; or in other words, Elizabeth Bathory, legendary witch/vampire from 1500's England.Six stories in all and none came close to scaring me or being 'what horror is all about' according to the promise from the editor. If this is his idea of horror and that vamps are bad guys and horrifying, than he needs to brush up on some new stories, because I can recall a few Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes that were more scary than this entire book.The two star rating? Is for 'Some Velvet Morning', the only tale I would consider worth the read and that's being generous... do yourself a favor, skip this one.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"Vampire Sextette","review":"The first story, The Other Side of Midnight by Kim Newman, gets off to a slow start and never fully recovers. It is a mishmash of several elements but is basically the tale of a Genevieve, an ancient female vampire, who spends her time as a private investigator in Hollywood. She runs into Orson Welles who, in this alternate universe, is working on filming his version of Dracula. Orson hires her to check out the mysterious man financing the film. During the investigation she gets an inside look at the making of vampire porn (nothing too explicit though, darn it!) and meets up with the hilarious Barbie and her Overlooker (if you are a fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer you will want to read the story for these priceless moments alone). There are many descriptive passages about the filming process which might have interested me if I were remotely interested in Orson Welles or in the process of making a film but sadly it was all wasted on me. Though it had its moments this 88 page story seemed much longer to me and I admit to skimming in order to get Barbie's next appearance.Some Velvet Morning by Nancy Collins was more to my liking. This story features a witch with a rather icky beauty secret. In order to rejuvenate her youthful good looks she must bathe in fresh human blood. Her victims are horny (and nearly always married) males easily tempted with a promise of sex made by a beautiful woman. In my opinion this type of guy deserves everything he gets so the comeuppance, though gory, was quite entertaining for me. Vampire Sonja Blue, Nancy Collins famous vampire-slayer, is hot on the trail of the blood witch because she, unlike myself, does not believe the witch should be allowed to continue her public service work. Though this story slightly disappointed me near its end it was fast-paced, violent and an enjoyable little read if you are in the mood for nastiness.Sheena by Brian Stableford was my favorite of all of the stories. Tony Weever is your typical young customer service-drone spending his working hours placating angry customers while surrounded by a group of venomous young female co-workers whom he does his best to avoid. Sheena is the exception. She is a loner and is rumored to be a goth who is too weird to date. Tony is intrigued and begins a tentative friendship with Sheena that slowly turns into love. Tony will do anything to please Sheena and initially feigns interest in her darker lifestyle but quickly becomes entranced in her world of music, past lives and vampirism. This is a lovely but bittersweet story of love and loss that sways towards the melancholy but remains hopeful all at the same time. It also beautifully combines the threads of music and sensuality while painting a unique picture of vampirism.Vanilla Blood by S.M. Somtow begins smack dab in the middle of a sensational court case involving the bizarre killing spree of one young man. It is a pretty blatant spoof of the over-the-top cases that were recent at the time the story was written (OJ and the like) and it is pretty darn funny in an extremely morbid and often juvenile, sex-obsessed sort of way. The story is written from the point of view of several key witnesses. My favorite was the sex obsessed best friend of the murder suspect who tends to go off on sexual tangents while telling the story that led up to the murders. This may not be the best written story I have ever read (for instance, two of the teenage witnesses are written in the same exact \\"voice\\" and I couldn't distinguish one from the other) but it has lots of sex, lots of blood and, most importantly, it made me laugh several times.My least favorite of this collection is Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's dull entry titled In The Face of Death. The story chronicles the days Madelaine de Montalia, the so-called vampire of the piece, spends in the arms of her married human lover William Sherman. Initially, the two fight their bizarre attraction to each other (bizarre to me because there is nothing particularly attractive about either of these people) but of course they succumb to the temptation. The remainder of the story consists of scattered kisses, romps and slight feelings of guilt. Interspersed within the story are Madelaine's journal entries which only cement the fact that she is one of the most mind-numbingly boring vampires I have ever come across. She writes in excruciating detail about such interesting subjects as house hunting and financial matters. Worse, even, is the fact that there is no blood letting, no sexual tension, no violence, absolutely zero character development and darn it, there is not even a good old fashioned brood going on here! This story may as well of been about two regular unlikable dullards ~ there is no need at all for the vampiric angle. As much as I love an old fashioned love story, this one was so uninteresting what with its tedious plot and flat characters that I could barely get through it without skimming. Sadly, the only thing going for it was its short length.Finishing up the sextette is Tanith Lee's odd, atmospheric tale called The Isle Is Full of Noises about an author obsessed by a man who has ignored her for decades. She gets her revenge by writing him into all of her books. His fictional character suffers hardships and usually comes to a painful and untimely end. Yse's current vampiric novel becomes a big part of The Isle Is Full of Noises and is interesting, if a bit slow moving. Somewhere along the line Yse's fantasy and reality begin to merge and I found the end result quite puzzling and a little vague and, as a result, this story was not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Vampire Sextette","review":"The Vampire Sextette is a book that is comprised of six stories written by six different authors. As one would expect, not every person is going to enjoy every story that is contained in this volume. I enjoyed two out of the three stories I've read from this book thus far. When I first picked this up, I was expecting something different than what I found myself reading, but I was not disappointed. If you're looking to read stories about vampires that have a different twist, then I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Vampire Sextette","review":"There is one decent story in this thing and it's not even a vampire story. Well not really. There is some talk about the woman being a vampire but she's mostly just a goth with cool ex-boyfriends who sees something in the narrator that he doesn't quite see himself. It's the one by Brian Stableford and I wish I could say that it's worth the price of the book alone, but it's not. Still it's a sweet and affecting romance between an office drone and the cool goth chick. It had heart which sounds like a sports cliche but when you come across these cold and bloodless tales (forgive the pun), a story with people with real emotions and feelings is like an oasis.The rest of the stories are dull and uninspired. Like most people, I bought the book for the Tanith Lee novella. Even the editor admits that he surrounded the novella with other novellas in order to charge full price. Still, when I get to the novel it's one of Lee's lesser works and it doesn't even make sense. Usually I can follow around with Tanith Lee but this time she loses me with a story within a story and a story that isn't very interesting. There's something about islands and sharks or dolphins and I don't really care.As for the rest of the stories - garbage. Kim Newman severely damages the affection he earned withAnno Draculaby writing a limp Hollywood story that sounds like a writer trying to understand Hollywood and just not getting it. Nancy Collins is merely mediocre but I read her run on Swamp Thing and I wasn't expecting much more. There's a forgettable story and then there's Somtow's \\"Vanilla Blood\\" which is just a mean spirited sexist load of garbage full of cemetary orgies and menstruation humor. The women serve as sperm receptacles and the men are from the central casting room for Frat Party Movie # 523. According to the biography, he does a lot of stuff that isn't writing.

He had innumerable meetings with the top officials (Talat Pasha, Enver Pasha, and all the other authors of the atrocities against Armenians). He got reports from all over the place--the consuls and missionaries stationed in different places in the interior. He knew the score and tried to do something about it.The thing that really got my goat was the insurance incident. The Turks came to Morgenthau and told him, Well, the Armenians are dead.

Also I think that the following web site might be useful:www.armenocide.de"},{"Title":"Ambassador Morgenthau's story","review":"Ambassador Morgenthau's Story reveals very important facts about a critical situation in a critical location prior to WWI and during it's initial two years. It was facinating to learn the psychic of the German goverment and their perception of other countries just before the WWI broke out. His book can serve as an excellent example of how history has the tendency to repeat itself and how we, the citizens of the earth, fail to learn from it.It demonstrates human greed and hunger for power and how we are ready to sacrifice EVERYTHING in order to achieve that elusive feeling of ultimate power and superiority over fellow human beings. His story is a prime example of how ignorance can result in total disregard for human life and shield the truth with the simplest deception if no one was paying attention. The sad fact, which was brilliantly described in this work, remains that a goverment would willingly start the destruction of his own existance by systematically eliminating a major and important sector of its population in a quest to become \\"pure\\" is so absurd that is mind boggling.Mr. Morgenthau's story doesn't try to create events or fabricate situations, it sincerely depicts all the facts which were unravelling in front of his eyes. He reports on actions of a government in total disarray and influenced by German philosophy which is ready to sacrifice part of their own citizens and starve the rest for achieving their goal of \\"Turkey for Turks\\". Mr. Morgenthau makes us feel sad for him for having witnessed the horrible attrocities being commited against defensless citizens of Turkey.The sincererity that he write with is unbelivible. His character study of the main figures demonstrate Mr. Morganthau's deep understanding of the political athmosphere in Europe and especially in Turkey. Thanks to his story and first hand reporting, the perished Armenians will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Ambassador Morgenthau's story","review":"I would suggest that people read Heath Lowry's \\"The Story behind Henry Morgenthau's Story.\\" It is truly sad that this book which is at most an interesting slice of history, showing how a pro-war politician sought to pull the U.S.A into WW1, is still presented as valid history, despite having been disproved so many times. The two assistants that helped Morgenthau write his 'story', Arshak K. Shmavonian and Agop S.Andonian, were, as their names imply, Armenians. Morgenthau himself never actually left Constantinople. A pro-war politician, his story was intended to form a moral impetus for coercing the United States into the war.In addition to the bulging bias in Morgenthau's work itself, one of the editors of this edition of the book, Peter Balakian, is himself an Armenian. While this is no cause for discrediting the book, it hardly adds any objectivity to it. How anyone could take this book seriously after knowing all of this truly bewilders and saddens me.It seems that all one has to do is present Muslims as hideous barbarians, paint a Christian population as innocent victims, and even after a century despite having no actual evidence to support the claims made, what should be an example of early 20th century political lobbying will still be reprinted as God's own truth."},{"Title":"Ambassador Morgenthau's story","review":"The fluidity of the narrative makes the book sound like a novel.

Morgenthau (AM) does not believe himself. From the outset, AM made it clear that his goal was to create a work of propoganda, and he did not begin his project until he received President Wilson's blessing to move forward with it.One can tell the falsehood of the \\"Amb. Morgenthau's Story\\" (AMS) simply by using purely Morgenthau as the source. The AMS is supposedly based on the diaries and letters of Morgenthau himself (written 1914-16). Yet, AMS (written or \\"compiled\\" in 1918) is almost 100% contradictory to the Morgenthau diaries and letters it is based on!!!What Morgenthau calls \\"white\\" in his diaries or letters, AMS describes as \\"grey\\", \\"colored\\" or outright \\"black\\". A few claims made in AMS, some of the juiciest in the book, are not from the diaries and letters at all, and no other source is provided. Morgenthau goes as far as relaying rumors from \\"unnamed sources\\" as first-hand quotes (!). Putting rumored statements and outright fabrications in others' mouths is proof-positive indications of an ulterior motive and disingenuity.Morgenthau knew this and was not shy about his aim to get Americans to rally behind the idea of going to war against the Ottomans. A present-day parallel is the use of hyped (if not fabricated) claims about Iraqi WMDs and \\"threat of a mushroom cloud over an American city\\".Believe it if you like, but don't pretend it is the truth."},{"Title":"Ambassador Morgenthau's story","review":"The book is advisable only when one reads it with Heath W. Lowry' s \\"The Story Behind Ambassador Morgenthau' s Story\\", published by ISIS Press, Istanbul in 1990. As Dr. Lowry describes:\\"The answer is simple and relates to the fact that Morgenthau was writing a piece of wartime propaganda with the expressly stated purpose of mobilising support for President Wilson's war effort. He consciously down played the close relationships he enjoyed with the Young Turk leadership throughout his sojourn in Constantinople and sacrificed truth for the greater good of helping to generate anti-Turkish sentiment which would transform itself into pro-war sentiment.\\"Unfortunately the American public opinion during that time was based on such sources as the services of Dragaman (translators) between the officials of the Ottoman Empire and the American Ambassador. And these dragaman were not Ottoman Turks but Ottoman Armenians and Ottoman Greeks both were in conflict with the Ottoman Empire. Ambassador Morgenthau used two of them, two Armenians, namely Hagop S. Andonian (personal secretary) and Arshag K. Schmavonian (legal assistant). The printed copy however went through severe war time propaganda editing by the US Secretary of State, Robert Lensing and Pulitzer award winning author, Burton J. Hendrick.One of the most dramatic incidents and the diversion of the facts were about the life insurance benefits of the deceased Armenian insurers of an American Insurance company. The book claims that Talaat, the Ottoman Interior Minister, made a request to him that the Ambassador should help to facilitate payment the insurance benefits to the Ottoman Treasury, as there were no heirs to the insurers! However, Dr. Lowry proved that after reading the actual dated letters, the request of the Ottoman Minister was to stop the American Insurance Company from transferring their capital funds from Ottoman Empire to France, and thereby preserving sufficient capitalization for any benefits claims. Such diversion of the facts is extremely dangerous.It is therefore an important document about the wartime journalism and subsequent unfortunate diversions of the facts to base Armenian claims of 1915.

Personally I am amazed that it was approved because it is somewhat tacky and trite compared to its ullustrious predecessor. Of course if you're not a conservative when it comes to preserving the memory of 'Triffids' then you'll probably find this story is readable.I think the thing that bothered me the most was there was nobody in the book I could care about. They were caricatures- cardboard plot devices to move the story. And the mutation angle is quite absurd. Genetic drift, even in plants as highly 'evolved' as the triffids would require more than 15-20 years and mnay false starts to produce the particular type of triffid encounted in the book. And the human immunity at the end is laughable in its convenience!WHile I thank Simon Clark from leaving the hero of the first book out of his second work, David, his son, is the main character in this one. Again, he should have avoided links- thus comparisons- with the True novel because this is found very wanting. The story doesn't focus so much around battling triffids as david and co battling the General (re. the major in the original) with the triffids more coloring then texture.In short: an ordinary tale with little to recommend it or redeem it and the tacky cover art says it all: pulp fiction!

I thoroughly enjoyed this!"},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"I hadn't read anything by Simon Clark before buying this book and I won't bother reading anything else of his in the future.There was nothing that I really liked about this tale, right from the start. It wasn't difficult to read, it was that, after getting through the first couple of chapters, I felt it was all very much like vanilla-flavoured junket; it went down okay but it was all rather bland and unsatisfying.Maybe my impressions were influenced by my liking of Wyndham's tale - so much, in fact, that I have read and re-read the original story so many times over the past 40 years that I know it off by heart!The biggest disappointment of the lot with &quot;Night Of....&quot; is the ridiculous situation whereby the triffids mutate into several different versions, all within the space of 25 years (the gap between the end of the original book and the start of this one). I won't mention specifics, so as not to divulge anything for those who buy the book, but it struck me that at least Wyndham's triffids were hybrid plants created &quot;in the lab&quot; through the auspices of humans mucking around with what we would now refer to as &quot;genetic engineering&quot;.There are also several situations where things are just so conveniently arranged (a hidden cache of weapons, for example) that you find yourself squirming with frustration when you come across them.Clark's writing style also gave me the impression that it was aimed at a younger age group - around the early teens.There isn't one swear word; I think that the strongest curse is &quot;Goddamn!&quot; and there are a few &quot;bastards&quot; and &quot;bloodys&quot; around the place.Whilst I don't believe in pouring on the expletives just for the sake of it, real life would indicate that, when faced with an attacking horde of triffids, even my maiden aunt would use the 'S' word!I have always wanted to see a sequel to the original but this certainly isn't it, I'm really sorry to say.If John Wyndham is watching from on high, he must be one embarrassed angel.Bruce Kennewell"},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"Granted the book is dedicated to John Wyndham and has the evident approval of his estate. Yet one of the great sci-fi writers of the last century must be rolling in his grave over this episodic and often downright silly romp, loaded with absurd plot contrivances and strained dialogue.

In a word: Dumb."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"I am always saddened when a good author passes. Sometimes another author will take up some of the ideas. Sometimes that is a good author like Simon Clark.One night the Earth is plunged into darkness and triffids can once again get the upper hand on humanity.Our hero, son of the previous hero, immediately finds himself in the middle of things twenty-five years after the original tale.After crashing a plane while trying to discover the extent of the darkness, he discovers floating mats of vegetation that can transport triffids to island communities, some people are immune to triffid poison, there are some major settlements in the Americas (including Manhattan), triffids are adapting to changing environments, and all is not as it seems.He is rescued and taken to Manhattan where tens of thousands of people live in pre-blindness splendor. The Manhattan power structure is very interested in some of the developments from our hero's colony. He quickly becomes a pawn in some major power plays that could have serious repercussions for his home community.A very wonderful extension of the triffid story. My only problem was the appearance of the giant triffids. While there size is not out of the scope of plants, I felt they should have suffered some in the mobility department.Much longer than the original, this tale is full of action, discovery, human interest and hope for humanity. A must for triffid or Clark fans."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"Sequelising established classics of fiction can often cause an apocalypse on a critical scale within the media not unlike the global one in John Wyndam's 'Day of the Triffids'. Fan and reviewer engage in a tug of war; one side citing the sequel a 'celebration', the other side 'desecration'. With this in mind (not to mention the 18 price tag), I decided to give Simon Clark's 'Night of the Triffids' a miss last year, ardent 'triffidite' though I am. I was certain that if I read it I would be unable to block out the sounds of a dead horse being flogged, but after re-reading Wyndham's peerless original I caved in and bought it. Leaving aside the revolting cover, painted by somebody who is clearly only vaguely familiar with the Triffids, it's better than you might think.Simon Clark had an unenviable task in capturing Wyndham's austere 1950's prose, one which could have left the characters stilted and the dialogue trite. And although some cliches do abound (plenty of 'gee's!' and 'hot diggety's! to keep you cringing here) Clark pulls off the task manfully, not unlike Wyndham's 'where men are men' narratives. The plot, where the original novel's protagonist's son David finds himself in a post holocaust New York, rolls along engagingly if a little roughly, but if nothing else this is assuredly the same world we left at the end of 'Day..'. However, where the goal of that novel was for mankind to drag itself from the ashes, here the goal is for the remaining scraps of civilisation to keep it's head above water. This is treated logically in NOTT, with conflicting and increasingly xenophobic communities tentatively making contact with one another whilst keeping the ravaging Triffid's at bay. Naturally enough, as with all the great empires of antiquity, the most prosperous community in New York, with it's electricity, TV's and cars has been founded on slavery and brutality. There the novel interestingly postulates an alternative future where the civil rights movements of the sixties did not take place, but the re-emergence of Torrence, the evil 'red headed man' of the first book is un-neccessary. The idea that he could have made it back to Brighton from Surrey through a Triffid infested England and then sailed to New York and rebuilt it is just plain silly. A new character with the same motivations would have been more believable, but then I suppose DOTT was not without it's own unlikely meetings also (the way in which Torrence himself appears both at the beginning and at the end for example).Presumably though, one of the trickiest challenges Clark would have had to have faced was that his novel was always going to lack the central intrigue of Wyndham's; that an unthinkable catastrophe has befallen the global community without warning,and he kind of solves this by employing a wry reversal of the circumstances that opened the first book. In the beginning David awakens into a pitch darkness that has been caused not by a lack of vision but by the sun's light being blotted out by a mysterious cosmic cloud. It's a disturbing calamity that had great potential story-wise, but sadly the author seemed to have gotten bored of it and a few hundred pages later it just drifts away into the background. The original novel's second great intrigue, the Triffid's themselves, are also expanded upon here, but yet again the potential for the Triffid's hyper evolution and mutation is fumbled. Mercifully, a monster that can and has been the stuff of the most ludicrous B-movie treatment is written intelligently, but by the time we come to the end, well, I don't want to spoil it for you but imagine if Godzilla had been an enraged asparagus instead of a radioactive lizard.What about the sinister satellite weapons that David Masen postulates as the cause of the 'Blinding' in DOTT? Could another malfunctioning weapon of mass destruction not have been the cause of the eerie blackout? And if you're going to augment the triffids why not have them interbreeding with other dangerous forms of plantlife for added nastiness? I wouldn't like to come face to face with a giant Triffid thorn bush in the dark I can tell you! Wyndham was careful to create a monster that had some footing in the science of genetic modification. Giant killer plants lumbering through Manhattan deaden that realistic quality.Reeling in my poisoned stinger for a second though, it has to be said that on the level of sheer blissful entertainment NOTT delivers splendidly. It's an archaic novel, but deliberately so, and recaptures a halcyon age of unpretentious sci-fi, the kind that makes you want to stick a fish bowl on your head, plant a flag in the surface of your garden and claim it in the name of the Earth. In an odd sort of way, the book is freed from certain modern literary constraints in it's imitation of a pre 1960's style- there's no tedious introspection here or trendy narrative chopping back and forth. Every page counts, and for that alone it's worth the four stars.To anyone who loves the original but was in two minds about this book as I was, buy it, and approach it in the same way that the author probably did; that it's not going to be possible to beat DOTT, but it's"},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"This book started off damn well. I have to say that the first 100 pages or so clipped along at a very enjoyable pace. As the reader you will be unsure as to what is going on. The world is tumbled into a blackness that is unexplainable and the plot takes on a charm that snakes you in. What I want to do is take the author by the lapels and slam his head into a post or dense wall. His prose is elegant and engaging far past expectations. In fact I'd have to say that for the style of writing he is engaging in, his skills in this regard are enormous. What I cant stand, literally want to yell at the guy over, is that this book became one of the most tired, predictable, unimaginative works of fiction that I have come across. Maybe I am being too hard on the author, but to take such a grand start and end up with a novel that I have read a thousand times before is almost inexcusable. I am rating this book at three stars, mainly because it starts off like a Kafka or Philip K Dick gem.

I did. The writing style of it looks the same as the original, but several things are different/wrong: All of Wyndham's books were short, clear and concise. This one is much too long and verbose. Each of Wyndham's books showed how human society is fragile by changing some \\"little\\" thing and then telling what the catastrophic consequences would be. This allways gave food for thought. This one tries a little with the darkness and the \\"new\\" triffids, but it fails IMHO to do it in a believable way. Wyndhams books were believable even though they introduced strange things like walking plants. The reason behind the darkness (the night) in \\"Night of ...\\" seems silly and out of place. And then there are the \\"new\\" triffids. In the end you start asking yourself when there'll be triffids driving cars, or flying aeroplanes.The book started well, feeling like a new Wyndham book, but in the end, after too many pages, I was left with an empty hollow impression and the feeling of having wasted my time. This was the first and last book I'll read by Simon Clark."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"This is an entertaining enough novel, but it's not a classic.The original John Wyndham novel was a marvel of understated adventure; Wyndham's prose was elegant and lucid. This, on the other hand, is little more than pulp adventure. Where Wyndham took two basic ideas - the introduction of the man eating triffids into a world where nearly everyone had gone blind - and mixed them together and pushed them inside and out and explored them thoroughly, Clark introduces new farfetched plot contrivances in almost every chapter, many of which go nowhere. There is at least one interesting idea; the rapidly evolving, possibly intelligent triffids, but these are almost incidental to the main story.There are some good things. The novel is refreshingly old fashioned, very readable, and occasionally exciting. None of the characters have post-modern angst, and there's little that's objectionable here.In any case, it would be hard to live up to the original, but, unfortunately, this novel doesn't come close."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"The Triffids definitely requires you to suspend belief for full enjoyment... carnivorous plants rule the world?Wyndham wove a superb tale in the Day of The Triffids and Simon Clark does a surprisingly good job of continuing the tale in his book.By taking the story across the pond to America, Clark is able to let his own imagination run riot and create his own human reactions to the global disaster and for the most part it works completely.For me there were a few stumbles along the way.. just one example being the super speed development of a Triffid which can breathe underwater (Doesn't natural selection take hundreds or thousands of years to effect that kind of change?).But don't let that dissuade you from giving this book a chance. If you enjoyed Wyndham's Triffids, the chances are you will enjoy Clark's efforts too. He could even continue on and write a third Triffids book, if he writes it, I'll read it."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"This book starts a generation or so after \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" ends, with the world again being plunged into darkness, this time because the earth has passed through a cloud of cosmic dust, or something. The cloud conveniently doesn't cut off the heat as well, so we don't just freeze to death. The triffids, of course, take advantage of the situation, and have to be survived all over again.The hero, son of the original hero, Bill Masen, investigates the event and finds himself taken to America, where another community is holding out on Manhattan Island (why there, for Pete's sake? It would seem even less promising than London, and far less so than America's own Southwest or Great Plains states). In New York (small world isn't it?), he runs into his father's old enemy, Torrance, who was setting up feudal baronies in the last chapter of the original novel, and has now tried his luck across the pond. Torrance hasn't changed much. While the status of the blind is less of an issue now, it seems that Blacks are kept pretty much in their 1950s place. The sequel then runs off into various adventures with new varieties of triffid, and rival groups of human, which I can only hazily recall, and probably won't bother going back to.In short, a thorough disappointment, and for me at least an infuriating one. I would have loved a decent sequel to Wyndham's book, which is up there with \\"Earth Abides\\" as one of my favourite disaster novels, but which left so much more to be told. But this doesn't even come close.Incidentally, another reviewer asked when \\"The Day of the Triffids\\" was supposed to have taken place. Fortunately, we were told that Masen removed his bandages on Wednesday 8th May, which narrows it down a bit. My perpetual calendar shows the following years, subsequent to the book's publication in 1951, when such a date existed - 1957, 1963, 1968, 1974, 1985, 1991, 1996, 2002. Since it's clearly set in the present, or at least very near future, we can probably forget the last four, and a reference in \\"Night\\" to the Berlin Wall eliminates 1957. My bet would be 1963, with 1968 and 1974 as possible but less likely. But others may have their own opinion."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"Having read DOTT and NOTT in the space of one month and watching the movie version of the former twixt the readings I can honestly say I'd like more.Of course Clark isn't Wyndham but for that matter (in the Triffid universe) David Masen isn't his father either. So that makes it easy to read the different stylings of the 2 authors. I enjoyed both and would give DOTT 5 stars to NOTT's 4 stars (the movie might get 3 for effort mainly, and like others I would love to see a new flick based on DOTT).I actually appreciated the lack of expletives and find it ridiculous that someone actually wanted more for \\"realism\\". Realism? Both works were supposed to be historical journals not word-for-word accounts. Few historians bother with including every expletive they've heard and I find it totally believable that these accounts didn't either.The complaint by some that evolution doesn't work as portrayed is hilarious since evolution doesn't work at all. Besides that, it is science-fiction. What part of fiction didn't they understand?So much could be done with Triffids by authors using different survivors (even those who might not know any of the people in these 2 books). Settings in Hawaii, Austrailia, Japan, California, ad naseum would be welcomed by me."},{"Title":"NIGHT OF THE TRIFFIDS","review":"I am a fan of both Clark and Wyndham, and it was a great feeling to see such an homage paid to a classic. Clark managed to capture the feeling of Wyndham's book while not losing his own voice, no mean feat. I highly recommend this book whether or not you've read the original.The Night of the Triffids takes place 30 years after the first book, with William Masen's son as the main character. We follow David through many adventures beginning on the Isle of Wight and continuing on to America. The cast of characters was well rounded and believable. I was sorry to put the book down at the end but was very glad to see the door was left open for another possible sequel."},{"Title":"Camp cookery,","review":"There are plenty of sources that tell you how to make a fire.

And then there's the \\"fire ring\\", which just as often as not is an overturned truck wheel rim. Half of the time I just struggled to get the fire going and the other half keeping it going. Sure I knew that a fire needs fuel, it needs air and it needs heat, but I still almost always came up short.My able bodied camping assistant had to stand by and watch me curse and throw chunks of wood as I fought to prove that I was a real camper! She decided to take matters into her own hands and got me a book. GASP, did I really need a book on camp fires?? Well, this book isn't about camp fires, it's called Camp Cookery, by Horace Kephart and it was originally published in 1910. Keep in mind that this was when people (mostly men) went camping to go way back into the wilderness to shoot or catch something to eat. It covers camp cooking tools, such as the reflector oven and folding broiler. Mr. Kephart advocates a lot of lard and has a chapter on cooking fresh killed game, like bear and squirrel. But the chapter on building fires is invaluable.I followed Mr. Kephart's advice on building a quick cookfire. I gathered twigs like he suggested, built them like it is described in the book. I lit it off and within a couple of minutes had a roaring fire with no further tinkering. The same thing happened every time I built a fire. I was sold. The rest of the chapter talks about the differences between a cook fire and a camp fire. It also describes what woods are good and for what situations. This chapter alone makes the whole book worth acquiring if you're serious about your campfire.Other chapters cover cooking gear, making breads and cooking fruits and vegetables, in addition to meat, poultry and game."},{"Title":"Camp cookery,","review":"If you already own kepharts \\"camping & woodcraft\\" then dont waste your money on this book. it has all just been taken from \\"camping & woodcraft\\"If you dont have it then its a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Camp cookery,","review":"This book is a camp cooker's dream.

The cards are hard to shuffle, but two or three shuffles and drawing the cards from a fan is good enough for a deck with just 22 cards.Since I bought this deck and started reading with it, two of my friends (one a reader and another a readee) asked me to get them this deck.

I enjoyed it a lot, and still use it, in certain ways. First of all, the use of only the major arcana is a very good way to learn the concept of the Tarot without getting lost under all the cards. That and it also simplifies the reading's complexity, leaving room for the reader to explain and detail instead of just being card after card after card. Secondly, the book is well-written and quite interesting; I remember all the meanings that I learned at the time, and still use them with other Tarot. Thirdly, the artwork is visually stunning- so much so that (don't laugh!) i actually framed the cards and hung them, replacing them with the Major Arcana of a Robin Wood, which were easier to shuffle and work with, as well as reasonably inexpensive. Then, when i had the cards laid, i would show my subject the card in question, then have them look at the one on the wall while i gave the explanation. This gives a nice point of reference, plus eases the irritation of such huge cards. Good Tarot, wonderful Artwork, good book...

I recall it as a majors-only deck in an unusually large format. I'm not sure what it was about the deck that appealed to me at the time, but this full 78-card version is disappointing.As a collage deck, several cards are poorly executed. The Strength card shows a lady sitting on the back of a lion, but the layout is poor - she looks like she's sliding off, probably because the figure chosen was not actually sitting on anything. The two figures aren't in the same style, either - the lady is colored normally, while the lion looks like he was carved out of cheddar cheese. The lemniscate over the lady's head looks like a rope someone threw in there.Justice, on the other hand, does look like she's sitting down - sitting down on a fancy toilet, that is. Death is also poorly done, the horse looking as if it is floating above the landscape rather than standing on it. The Star is the worst, with the woman's head at an odd angle and not matching her body. The head looks like a photograph (the artist? one of her friends?) superimposed on the painting.The Wheel of Fortune has the well-known greeting-card cherubs on top for some reason. The Moon is possibly the sloppiest card - Instead of a dog and a wolf, it has the same dog on both sides, in mirror image, as if the artist couldn't be bothered to find a picture of a wolf. The angels in the Judgement card are also reflections of each other. The court cards and other majors avoid these problems to varying degrees, while the pip cards are well-done and attractive - for pips. In my opinion, the Crowley Thoth deck set the standard for pips that no other deck has since achieved. I'm not sure much was gained in expanding this deck from the original majors-only version, other than giving people like me the chance to buy it dirt-cheap.The cards are the typical size; the backs are very simple, dark blue with a gold line toward the edge like a frame, and a small gold pattern at the top and bottom. It's reversible and minimalist, only slightly more going on than a solid-colored blank back.The book gives multiple interpretations - each card's \\"gift\\" and \\"challenge\\" is described for the reader, their partner, \\"the relationship,\\" and the future. Overall, the deck has a calm, Renaissance-y look, and would be a good choice for someone giving readings who wants a superficially attractive and classy deck that won't run the risk of frightening anyone."},{"Title":"Lover's Tarot","review":"I am extremely pleased with my product.

This is the story of a wolf and the high country in which he lived until he is captured by Man, a cruel and sadistic man. The wolf ultimately secures his freedom and fulfills his destiny. One is certainly rooting for the wolf and not the man. R.D. Lawrence paints a wonderful picture of the Canadian wilderness, shares his knowledge of wolves and their pack behaviour and shows how pitiful Man can be."},{"Title":"Cry wild;: The story of a Canadian timber wolf","review":"Silver was special among wolves; he was just a cub who was sleek, sociable, and clever. Perhaps a little loveable, but mischievous with his sister cub wolf who he bullies and plays with the frogs there in the woods of the north country. He was young and eager to learn about life in the forest which holds danger for such a curious little wolf cub. He has to use his wits to learn the rules of survival, as his cruelest of his predators is human men.Such was the case of Cubby, a tame black bear living in a private game farm in Minnesota. Cubby had no cause to not trust the man who purchased him for $4,650; after all, he was not a dangerous, wild black bear and had never hurt anyone. He must have been a beautiful, trusting creature who never had a chance. He was put in a fenced-in area and his new owner killed him in cold blood. That poor bear had nowhere to run and had no idea he was bought for blood sport of an evil monster; he didn't make it off the farm where he had lived.When black bears in the Smokies are killed, it is only after they have killed a human. This year, an innocent bear met her fate after a mother bear was protecting her two young cubs and killed a child. Eventually, the culprit was found and met her fate at the hands of man. Once they have tasted a human's blood, it is thought that they will kill again. But young Cubby had not hurt anyone -- never had a chance. Nor did he have a chance in hell when this demon bought him as a video showing what a good hunter he supposedly is. It was staged! There is evidence of the kill. The video was edited to make it look like he had killed the bear out in the wild. Well, that is a federal crime and so he must go to court to plead his case. In the meantime, he will be the main attraction ('headliners, they're called) at the biggest celebration in this town on Sept. 2 & 3. He had the bear's beautiful pelt (fur) sent to him in Tennessee. Perhaps he will have it around his shoulders when he is allowed to appear before a mass of youngsters who will look up to him. I have consistently vocally opposed being called a hillbilly, but this town is definitely crass and ignorant to allow that criminal to come to this event. I asked a local news columnist to write about it and suggest a boycott, but he was told by a colleague at Metro Pulse to let it be. Such is life in a backward town where killing is commonplace. But killing an innocent bear who never had a chance will make this town as sinful as New Orleans and perhaps we will suffer the same fate as they. God does not look down kindly on Soddom and Gormarrha towns, and this one definitely is on the track of that kind of living. The whole downtown is composed of bars and drinkers out on the sidewalks. It is bad and getting worse.Silverfeet the wolf survived, thank goodness, to become a grown wolf and have his freedom. I hope this criminal who killed Cubby will be cornerned in prison by those corrupt heathens and shown the same mercy he did to an animal who was caged and helpless to defend himself. Wolves and bears have a place in this world and on this earth, and they should be respected and left alone."},{"Title":"Greek Cooking for Everyone: Second Edition","review":"As the Greek Food Host at Bella Online, I refer to many Greek cookbooks. Greek Cooking For Everyone is one of my favorites. The recipes are very traditional, yet the ingredients are readily available to American cooks. The first few pages of the cookbook offer background information on the staples of Greek cuisine, and tips on stocking a Greek kitchen, which is very helpful and informative. This cookbook is divided into menus rather than types of food (i.e. 'meat menus', 'fish menus', etc.), so that each section provides a meal complete with appetizers and side dishes. Most recipes are for four or more people, so if you are looking for recipes for two, you will have to adjust the measurements. Although this is not the type of cookbook that includes professional, color photographs of Greece, it is a very handy reference and a great source of traditional Greek recipes."},{"Title":"Greek Cooking for Everyone: Second Edition","review":"I would not recommend this book to non-Greeks or people who are not familiar with Greek cooking (like myself). Some of the recipes seem to leave out important information - like how to prepare the vegetables before cooking - which might be obvious to a more experienced Greek cook. Also, some of the recipes are good and others a sort of blah. Although maybe this is because it is hard to get really fresh produce year round in the NE US - unlike in Greece. I do like how the book is organized into menus."},{"Title":"Vault of the Ages","review":"When I first read \\"Vault of the Ages\\" it was an exciting book; in reviewing it as an adult close to 40 years later as an adult I find it still an enjoyable read. Looking back on the stories I read in my youth this had to be the first in the series of this genre of post doomsday chronicles that I continued to enjoy...This book emphasizes messages about human responsibility and the importance of using science only for good almost as though accentuated with a bright yellow Hi-Lighter Pen.The story is set in the Alleghenies roughly 500 years after a nuclear holocaust, Vault of the Ages tells the story peaceful farming tribes vs. fierce warriors. Carl, our lead hero and son of the village Chief is responsible for trading with the people from the ruined city to obtain metal and other needed materials form the remains of skyscrapers etc...Carl and his companions discover a \\"time vault,\\" basically a large time capsule remaining from the pre-holocaust civilization, containing numerous tools, books, models of apparatus and more depicting the sciences that have since been lost. With the aid of the newly discovered sciences and much common sense he is able to help his people.In rereading the description of the 'VAULT' it brings a smile to my face when I look around our office, library and museum facilities here at the Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation here in Glendale Arizona.... I can imagine a facility such as this being the 'VAULT' spoken of in this story. I wonder what the world will be like in 500 years and what part the material preserved by the museum here will play in it....Ed Sharpe, Archivist for SMECC[...]"},{"Title":"Vault of the Ages","review":"With a slight word of warning from Joachim on the juvenility of Vault of the Ages, I forged ahead on my sixteenth Poul Anderson book knowing the above objective truth with my own subjective truth: Poul Anderson has his hits (Tau Zero[1970] andThree Worlds to Conquer[1964]) more often than he has his misses (The Day of Their Return[1974] andOrbit Unlimited[1961]). Sadly, the familiar theme of The High Crusade, minus the aliens, comes across as shallow entertainment with a flowery epimyth or a conclusion. It's not a dud, but doesn't hearken to Poul's own science fiction traditions of wonderment and/or zany originality.Rear cover synopsis:\\"20th Century, Mystery Century!Once upon a time (which hasn't happened yet) the fierce Lann army thundered down from the North to conquer the peace-loving Dalesmen. The \`Doom' had destroyed nearly all concepts of civilization 500 years earlier. Defying charges of witchcraft, Carl of Dalesmen entered the forbidden city and the vault which held secrets of the long-ago twentieth century.\\"------------With the winters being colder and longer than in recent memory, the northern clan of Lann has dispatched an army to the south in order to find new land to settle and cultivate, but not before killing and pillaging. Their reputation as a ruthless clan has reached further inland has become known as the fiercest, largest army. Lann's King Raymon's own son Lenard is the captain of the thousand-man platoon; both the leaders and the led are driven by the need to make a settlement further to south to ensure their clan's survival. In their way is peaceful town of Dalesmen.Democratically governed by Chief Ralph, the village has survived through the decades with the assistance of the town's \\"Doctor,\\" Donn. As with every village, the Doctor bears holy symbols, beats drums, and chants spells against witchcraft (130). One law of the Dalesmen tribe, and many tribes like them, is to not enter the City, where the scaffold remains of an ancient city still stand amid the rubble of concrete, steel, and glass. Though inhabited by a industrious yet cowardly band of so-called witches, the town is off-limits, especially so for the Time Vault within the city proper.Chief Ralph's son Carl treks through the forest and happens upon a country home where two boys, Tom and Owl, decide to tag along to enter the city, their mission to find reinforcement against the Lann horde. Their horses packed, they travel towards the City only to be chased by the Lann band, but they find solace in the City where they are greeted by the City's own Chief Ronwy. Permission is eventually granted for them to enter the Time Vault, where books and machines abound. To prove to his own clan that the City holds power enough for them to defeat the Lann clan, Carl takes a hand-crank flashlight to impress everyone.Denounced by Doctor Donn, the trio are ever eager to prove themselves potent in the eyes of the village and, most importantly, in the prying eyes of the Lann. Though the magic white light emanating from the contraption may have scared the army once, further technology must be attained so that they may conquer the horde of heathens at their threshold. Captured by the Lann eventually, the trio of Carl, Tom, and Owl defuse their situation craftily and return once again to their village where another challenge is thrown at them: the death penalty for trespassing on the ground of the City and overstepping the boundary of the Time Vault and the demons which lurk within.Yet another timely escape brandished by the young whippersnappers of Dalesmen sees them charge back into the City once and for all to gain control of the technology within the Time Vault, whether the City inhabitants or the Lann can stop them.------------Joachim is right when he states the juvenility of this novel. The gallivanting between their village, through the enemy's encampment, to the derelict perches of the City's skyscrapers is repetitive. The Vault holds such wonder to the trio of boys, but it also holds wonder in the reader. However, don't expect to be immersed in the ancient wonders of the Vault's bounty because only a handful of pages pertain to the Vault's treasures.You should familiarize yourself with some of the science lingo before dipping your toes into this science fiction novel:Smiting sabers, lancing pikes, gleaming shields, fringed buckskin breeches, sledging hammers, silver-studded boots... stop me when this begins to sound more like science fiction than fantasy or historical fiction... thudding hooves, drawn bows, quivers of arrows, moccasined feet, fur-lined tunics, saddle blankets, catapults... I could go on... hamstringing swords, creaking wagons, fur-trimmed boots, etc.It's not really that bad but it does drag on.I wasn't sympathetic with anyone in this novel, be they a person or a tribe: the morally high-grounded post-apocalyptic tribe (before post-apocalyptic was \\"cool\\") of Dalesmen pitted against the advancing threat of an impoverished clan from the Lann. Perhaps the Lann came at the encroachment the wrong way, with force, rather than diplomatically, but I didn't feel sorry for the villages left in their wake or those who had yet to feel the brunt of the great Lann warrior clan.The greedy territorial advance of the Lann army is synonymous to the technological lust of the Dalesmen youth. Where the Lann simply wanted land to live and thrive on, the Dalesmen youth look to the non-solution of technology to solve their problem of invasion. In the Time Vault itself, there were more than mere inventions of gunpowder and electricity, but there must have also been the inventions of the mind, something which they felt they could easily bypass. This reliance on knowing of technology rather than the knowledge of technology casts a dim view on the young bandits, be it for the greater cause or less. Even when they discuss to share the treasures within, they mention the material good rather than the good of knowledge.Even Doctor Donn says, \\"There is no evil in the vault. There is only evil in the hearts of men. Knowledge, all knowledge, is good\\" (187). If this were true in the context of the story, then why would the Dalesmen tribe offer to share the Vault's technology with competing clans when the exchange of ethics, morality, or religion could better change the \\"hearts of men\\" than a schooner could? Presuming the Vault is full of not only the world's most important technologies, but also full of the virtues of the world's most gifted thinkers, I would think the first thing to share would be the goodness of words, not the goodness of the material wealth.This will be one of the few Anderson novels that will be taken back to the second-hand bookstore. It's a pity that even the cover isn't noteworthy. I'll remind myself in the future to steer clear of Poul Anderson's historically themed novels if they don't include absurdity like The High Crusade. Now I'm only left with The Psycho-Technic League (1981) on my shelves... an ominous sign that I either need for Anderson, or none at all. Considering his wealth of material, there must be tastier morsels out there."},{"Title":"Vault of the Ages","review":"Poul Anderson's \\"Vault of the Ages\\" is a good tale of life going on after all is lost. Set 500 years after a nuclear disaster, a tribe in what is now the Alleghanies tries desparately to keep an invader from taking over. The son of a chiefian seeks shelter in a place that the others in his tribe are afraid of, and finds a very large time capsule in which the technology of our day is preserved in record. The rest deals with the invading horde which desparately needs fertile land or it'll strave and the fears of the tribe. Anderson showed his good writing from the beginning"},{"Title":"Vault of the Ages","review":"This contains very succinct writing that conveys a very imaginative glimpse of a fictional post-apocalyptic future where civilization is about to be re-kindled. Very well written. The author doesn't get extravagant or excessive. This book is much more enjoyable when you maintain the perspective of what our culture was like when this book was written. It's also helpful to keep in mind that science fiction was comparatively rare when this book was written."},{"Title":"Vault of the Ages","review":"I love to read anything by Anderson, and decided on this because it is short and looked like a quick read. I knew going in that it was published in 1952, and tried mightily not to let that cloud my judgement. I have read many books in the genre from that time period, and most of them suffer at least a little from the changed times.Anderson's books are always polished and concise, and this one is no exception. The writing is clear and to the point, without being boring. It is a fine adventure story, and would likely have appealed to a young audience of the time, who undoubtedly would have found it exciting. Perhaps that would still be the case today, but the odds are that the overwhelming supply of these types of post-apocalyptic adventures written since this book appeared would provide a lot of competition. The story here is really all about the adventure and struggle that the young protagonist embarks upon, and the time vault is the vehicle for the adventure. The vault itself is only vaguely described, as far as its contents are concerned, and that is okay because it clearly is not the point of the book. The vault serves to provide a possible source of unity among otherwise warring tribes, who differ in their views about the possible harm or potential benefit the vault could provide humanity. Much of the book describes tribal warfare, but there are some memorable scenes that occur at the site of the time vault.If you are a fan of early science fiction, meaning perhaps the golden age or just a bit later (such as this book), you won't be disappointed with this. If you are a fan of Anderson, you'll enjoy it. If a young reader wishes to read this, the effect will likely not be the same as it was for young readers of the time. Unfortunately, in my view, excitement today is derived from a lot more dazzle and glitter than the days of this book. To be fair, there are many fine books of this type out there, and my rating takes that into account. I'm unable to view this, as it turns out, in a vacuum consisting of 1950's science fiction. This is a fine book for what it is, and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Vault of the Ages","review":"Vault of the Ages (1952), one of Poul Anderson's earliest novels, should not be missed. Although Vault of the Ages is at its core a simplistic juvenile (50s sci-fi for younger readers), Anderson's budding storytelling skills make it engaging and a joy to read. If only I had read it when I was younger! Suggested for any fans of 50s sci-fi, early post-apocalyptical sci-fi, and Poul Anderson completests.Brief Plot SummarySometime in the future the \\"Doom\\" (caused by atomic weapons) wipes out civilization -- all that remains are intensely superstitious loosely confederated tribes who live in wooden houses and tend livestock. Five hundred years after the Doom somewhere in the Alleghenies a boy named Carl, the son of the chief of the Dalesmen, dares to defy taboos and seek out the City (the ruins of a pre-Doom settlement).The plot concerns an invasion of fierce northern peoples called the Lann. Driven by a cooling climate and attacks from other unnamed peoples, the Lann desire to occupy the lands of the Dalesmen. Unlike other authors who are content to leave the \\"barbarian\\" enemy a nameless force of evil, Anderson tries give a rational for their actions and even introduces a character in parallel to Carl, Lenard, the son of the chief of the Lann. Like Carl, Lenard also does not fear the taboos and supposed curses and demons associated with ancient technology and the City.Carl is sent to the City to acquire metal (yanked from old skyscrapers) from the \\"witches\\" (various people who eek out an existence in the ruins). Here Carl finds a time vault with instructions to resurrect ancient technology (including simplistic mechanical technology -- windmills, sailboats, etc).The Dalesmen are suspicious of the time vault and its contents and condemn Carl to death. It's up to him and his few trusted friends to rescue his own people (despite their suspicion of him), raise the taboos on the technology which can deliver his people, and obtain the secrets of the vault before Lenard and the Lann!Final ThoughtsThe plot itself pulls no punches -- it's predictable and free of frills/twists etc. However, Anderson infuses his narrative with energy and excitement. Despite knowing the outcome I found myself rooting for Carl nevertheless! Vault of the Ages is characterized by unbridled optimism and obvious morals -- technology is beneficial if used by the right people and the right people are the idealistic young who push against the boundaries imposed by their elders with the good of society at heart.In frustrating 1950s fashion, the \\"idealistic young\\" are men...

This has lead some scholars to believe he was crazy when he wrote it and in light of his chapter headings: &#147;Why I am so Wise,&#148; &#147;Why I am so Clever,&#148; etc. Against the assumption that Nietzsche was not crazy when he wrote Ecce Homo Steinbuch's book serves as a critical textual analysis on Nietzsche's first chapter heading \\"Why I am so Wise.\\" It is well written and researched and claims the key to understanding Nietzsche is in this first chapter heading, \\"Why I am so Wise\\" in his Ecce Homo. Steinbuch provides an excellent and detailed commentary for a better understanding of Nietzsche. He also does justice to the thesis of his book, as well as to Nietzsche himself. Nietzsche was far from being crazy when he wrote his last will and testament - Ecce Homo - that he offered to the world."},{"Title":"A Concise Introduction to Syntactic Theory: The Government-Binding Approach","review":"This is a case of writing that seems clear if you already know the material, but opaque if you don't. The author states that she wrote for &quot;linguists whose training has been in other theories and who want to learn the essentials of GB theory&quot;.

A rival boutique has moved into town, taking a lot of customers with it. Bebe's Belles, a group of cutthroat saleswomen for the new store, Bebe's Boutique, will stop at nothing to make a quick sale. And when all of the roses that are grown organically for Venus Envy's custom blends are sabotaged with pesticide, Persia starts to feel as though she is being personally attacked. When the store's computer is hacked into, and her fragrance journal is stolen, Persia will stop at nothing to win back her customers and save the business. Does that include murder? A saleswoman for Bebe is murdered, and Persia must work overtime to clear her name, and put a stop to the underhanded dealings of Bebe's Belles.This was a great sequel! I enjoy both the strong character of Persia and her relationship with her aunt (although the nickname \\"Imp\\" seemed a bit out of character for Persia and slightly annoyed me). The mystery was good and the characters likable. There is a bit of a new romance for Persia...and I was surprised to see a bit of a rebellious side to her. Sporting a fairy tattoo and body piercings, she is not your everyday cozy character. However, she is smart, tough, and loyal to the end...which is a great formula for any good cozy detective.Included in the book is information regarding blending your own custom fragrances, and stress reduction. This series is a light, fun read.The first book in the series is called \\"Scent to Her Grave\\". Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"A really cute second installment in the Bath and Body mysteries. Persia and her aunt are having financial woes at venus Envy and they find out it is due to another cutthroat beauty maven in town. This lady will stop at nothing to get on top. She poisens the roses, steals formulas and maybe murder?When a pushy saleswoman gets murdered and a friend is being framed, Persia goes undercover to try to find out what is going on and to get her fragrance journal back, but she bites off more than she can chew this time.Old and new friends join in this cute second installment of the Series. Cute and won't disappoint."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"The second installment in the Bath and Body mysteries does not disappoint! Not only do we get a great mystery that had me guessing up until the end but we learn alot about Persia, her feelings, motivations and character.An exciting mystery and a fascinating character study? What could make this better. Some great recipes for easy to make homemade potpourri and oils.Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"Persia and her aunt own and operate a bath and body shop, Venus Envy. The shop is an honest business and uses only good-quality ingredients. They even have a huge rose garden so that they can use fresh roses in some of the products that they make. Their shop seems like paradise!Persia and her aunt are the coolest people I've ever known! Not only are they honest people, but Persia is positive and confident and works out and she can occasionally indulge in foods she otherwise couldn't. Her wonderful aunt raised her, and she is an extension of her aunt. And in addition to all that, Persia (like me) has a very strong sense of smell, and a side effect to that is a strong sense of taste.Now on with the story line: It appears that a competitor cosmetic and fragrance company is trying to put Venus Envy (and other fragrance companies) out of business. Horrible things are happening at Venus Envy. I won't tell you exactly what is happening, because I don't want to ruin the book for you. But it does appear that someone is trying to wreck the company.Persia and her aunt are determined to find out who is doing this, and to find substantial proof of who their enemies are. They go to great measures to find out.I cannot sing enough praise for this incredible, wonderful book. It is positive; Persia and her aunt deeply and truly love each other; the book is sensual and comforting; and I can almost smell the roses."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"Persia and Aunt Florence are struggling to keep Venus Envy open. Why? Bebe Wilcox has opened her own boutique and is hell bent on putting everyone else out of business. She and her workers stop at nothing. They steal and sabotage without so much as a second thought.Then one of Bebe's pushy saleswomen ends up dead. The \\"game\\" has advanced to a new level.In an attempt to save Venus Envy, Persia and her aunt stage a public falling out. Persia applies at Bebe's Boutique and is hired. Can she snoop around without getting caught? Can she find the stolen goods and enough evidence to put Bebe away and close down her shop for good? Can she do all this before the killer finds out and comes after her?I like Persia. She is a fun character and very well constructed by the author. She is three-dimensional and her friends and aunt are terrific as well. I love the small-town feel of this book. The boutique is a great setting for the story. The feud between the two boutiques is very believable and there are plenty of twists and turns in the plot to keep you guessing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"The second in the Bath and Body Series can be read independently and enjoyed on its own but fits great in the series. Relationships developed in the first book evolve naturally and new characters appear to add intrigue and romance.The plot centers around corporate espionage in the beauty industry. Venus Envy, the spa owned and operated by the main character Persia and her aunt Florence, is struggling to make ends meet and being outdone by a new player in town - Bebe.The first part of the book is a little slow for readers who've read the first book. The final showdown between Bebe and Persia is, however, intriguing and entertaining. Overall the book is a good second in the series and leaves you anxious for the next book."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"This is a well-written, mainstream whodunit that will be enjoyed by almost any reader who enjoys this genre. The only reason I'm posting this review at all is that a couple of previous reviewers have, inexplicably, objected to the book on the grounds of language and sex. Let me assure anyone who reads this review, that those previous reviewers are WAY outside the mainstream of society on this point. If this book were turned, verbatim, into a movie, it would receive a PG13 rating. There is nothing in it that would make me even slightly uncomfortable in giving it to a 15-year-old to read. Unless you confine your reading to Dr. Seuss and Jan Karon's appalling \\"Mitford\\" series, there is nothing in this book that will even make you blink."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"Persia is one tough lady and almost seems to good to be true. But, she does have flaws. Her knowledge of computers is about nil and when facing down the barrel of a gun she is no superwoman. Her flaws make her human and thus a likable character. I look forward to spending more time with this character in the next book.The mystery was okay, the killer wasn't revealed until the end. However, I would have liked to have had more clues sprinkled throughout the story. Simply being surprised by who the killer is is one thing. Having clues and still being surprised makes for a great mystery.Also, more details about why the roses were damaged would have been nice. Yes, it was an act of sabotage, but who exactly was the one to carry out the sabotage? I can't picture any of the characters in the book sneaking around in the middle of night with bags of chemicals. Also why were only the roses damaged? Other flowers and herbs are just as important to the products that Persia develops.All in all the book was enjoyable but like Persia has some flaws."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"If profanity, cavalier sex and New Age attitudes don't bother you then, you might like this series. But if you like your cozies G-Rated, then this series probably isn't for you. Possibly only PG-17, this second installment in the Bath & Body Mysteries series is peppered with profanity and casual sex. Although parts of the plot were a bit weak (the altercation between Aunt Florence & Persia), it was interesting enough to keep me reading until the end."},{"Title":"A Blush With Death (Bath and Body Mysteries)","review":"I enjoyed the first installment of this series, and the second one didn't disappoint.

I have not yet made anything out of it. But I will. (Only 4 stars because I haven't tried to make anything). I look for quilt patterns that are effective but fast as I have limited time. If you are looking for complexity or a quilting challenge, this probably isn't the book for you.A similar style to Wilkinson's \\"Quick and Easy Patchwork and Applique : 14 Lively Designs Using All Kinds of Applied Motifs\\" - patterns are a similar nature but not repeated (which is nice). When I picked up the book it didn't occur to me that I already own a book by her, but as I adore \\"Quick and Easy Patchwork and Applique\\" I can see why this one appealed to me.Note Wilkinson edits this book (as well as \\"Quick and Easy Patchwork and Applique\\"). The quilts are designed by a variety of UK quilters, designers, authors and teachers.This book is split into four sections - Tips and Techniques, \\"Bright Colours\\", \\"Pastel Colours\\" and \\"Primary Colours\\". A bit of a furfy though as, once again, Wilkinson includes 4 alternative colour schemes for each quilt. A brilliant idea as it really gives you an understanding of how colour combinations affect the overall makeup of the quilt.The tips and techniques appear quite thorough and good enough for a beginner. There are tips also throughout the patterns.My biggest problem when choosing a book online is the inability to actually flip through the book to see if there really is anything I want to make. So I shall attempt to provide some descriptions of the quilts that particularly appeal to me...- Candy Bars - \\"Hot pink fabric frames the colourful bars in this topper for a single bed. Very simple blocks are joined together in rows to make the bars, reminiscent of the most colourful jars in the sweet shop. Simple quilting completes the project, which took just twelve hours to make.\\" - The prime example uses \\"at least nine\\" different pink, orange and mauve patterned fabrics that are then combined two to a square, sewn into horizontal bars. These bars are separated by hot pink strips. The quilt is finished with a wave or scalloped machine stitch across the quilt providing a modern feel. The alternative colour schemes include a denim variation \\"for a teenager\\".- Whirligig Quilt - A windmill square using bright, modern colours, tied in the centres.- Dotty Cot Quilt - A mix of soft pastels - blue, pink, green, yellow - to suit either boy or girl, finished size is 86x70 cm. Fabric is dots and plains arranged into 4 x 5 squares. Every other square is a single fabric with an appliqued circle. In between each is a large square with a small centre square in contrasting colour, tied in the centre.- Sherbet Twist - \\"Mouth-watering colours, a broderie anglaise frill and a scattering of mother-of-pearl buttons make this lap quilt the perfect treat for a sweet little girl.\\" Three strips of each contrasting pastel pair (yellow with purple, green and pink, blue and orange) is arranged length wise down the quilt, separated by single strips of white fabric. The colour bands are quilted down the length (like \\"tubes\\" with a puffy eiderdown effect) but the white is tied with buttons down the length. A lace border surrounds. Alternative colour schemes include patterns and florals.- Chenille Hearts - \\"The chenille technique, also known as \\"slashing\\", is a great way to use up all those ugly fabrics from your stash - when they're used for the lower layers, they don't show but add to the felted edges when cut and washed. This technique makes quite a heavy quilt as it's made up of four layers but it is very soft and cozy.\\" Finishe size is 96.5 x 85.5 cm. Basically it is a purple quilt with 12 hearts from three colours (green, yellow, pink) arranged symmetrically across the top. However, it is made from three top layers of fabric (purple and pink) over one background piece (purple). The layers + hearts are then sewn (quilted) in parallel diagonals every .75 cm. The top three layers + hearts are then \\"slashed\\" or cut between the stitching (so it is cut on the bias). Once washed, you are left with a soft, felted quilt."},{"Title":"Super Quick Colorful Quilts: 20 Sparkling Designs for Fast Quilts","review":"Compiled and edited by quilting expert Rosemary Wilkinson, beginning needlecrafters, as well as more advanced quilters who lack time, will find Super Quick Colorful Quilts: 20 Sparkling Designs For Fast Quilts to be a welcome and \\"user friendly\\" coverage presenting twenty new quilt patterns in varied colors, made with easy shapes, easy piecing, and fast techniques. 20 projects show how to gain the most from checks, flowers, pinwheels and other traditional design choices, streamlining quilting operations and patterns for maximum results."},{"Title":"Super Quick Colorful Quilts: 20 Sparkling Designs for Fast Quilts","review":"The quilts patterns/designs included are eye-catching and easy to assemble.

After being rescued from a rapist, her rescuer, Geoffery Fulton, removes her from the squallor in which she had been living, to reside with his mother as her live-in housekeeper and companion. Lizzie's life takes on a great turn for the better as she is treated like a member of the family; even being taught to play piano by Mrs. Fulton who is an accomplished player. The book will show what happens next as I am not going to write a full synopsis of the plot; however, I will say a few words about cookson's style.Cookson's writing is lively and detailed, her point of view moves smoothly between the characters so you are never at a loss as to who is central at any given time. Her dialog is by the most part fresh and informative, establishing character by the things they say. I do, however, want to point out that on occassions she allows her characters to ramble on a bit too long putting across their home spun philosophies on life and living. This in contrast to the much more realistic short, interrupted dialog that we all indulge in, which, fortunately she does mostly to good effect.I enjoyed this book very much, its many twists and turns and sub-plots kept me turning the pages to reach the surprising and satisfying finale."},{"Title":"A Ruthless Need (Center Point Platinum Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Catherine Cookson's books are almost always good to read.

Maybe I'm just angry because I had the opportunity to take a college-level class in cognitive theory over the summer and was thus exposed to much more interesting reading material, but this book is a real piece of work... even compared to most high school textbooks I've had. For starters, the pictures are much larger than the words. As much as a good illustration can help one grasp a difficult concept, the ones in this book show pretty much NOTHING. Then, there's the whole tone of the material, which really aggrivates me. It seems very condescending, with words like \\"placebo\\" that almost any high school senior would know phoneticized (pluh-SEE-boh). In additoin, it appears as though more effort has been placed towards catering to special lobby groups than towards creating a memorable book that will sucessfully teach psychology and impart a love for the field. \\"Race relations\\" are referred to a lot, as are \\"animal rights.\\" As liberal as I am (anti-war, quasi-socialist, for legal recognition of gay unions, pro-environmentalist to a certain degree), I really get irked when these petty, almost-nonissues that (stupidly) took up much of the Left's focus twenty years ago are brought back to life in the form of instructional materials. They water down the actual material to a point where it almost becomes propoganda. In an effort to make the text \\"non-biased,\\" it has in effect become MORE biased... just in the \\"right\\" direction.If you are a teacher and reading this, please do me (and pretty much every other student out there) a favor and DO NOT use this textbook in your classroom. I don't know if there are other books that do the same thing better or what your options are, but I would certainly not recommend this one. Perhaps you could let your students read some actual research journals or college textbooks; if you give them the benefit of the doubt and overestimate rather than underestimate their intellectual abilities, I bet you'll be surprised at the results. The goal of a class like this should be to make young people passionate about something; obviously, the textbook you see here does nothing of the sort."},{"Title":"Psychology: Principles in Practice","review":"I have this book, we used it in my high school psychology class.

Hochman"},{"Title":"Technique Systems in Chiropractic","review":"I am not aware of any book that covers the same subject matter. As the authors state from the outset, this book is not an advertisement for any of the techniques described in the book, but rather an honest attempt to describe them as they are. It covers the major techniques in chiropractic according to a common format, so that a patient, a chiropractic student, a chiropractor, or anyone else interested in chiropractic can figure out what it means to be treated using one technique as compared with another.The writing is formal where it needs to be, but very casual and entertaining in places and in contexts where formality would have been more expected. For me, the best part of the book are the chapter introductions. There are anecdotes and personal observations that really make these techniques come alive, and give us a window into how this book came into being. Cooperstein and Gleberzon obviously love these techniques, even the ones where they could not contain their skepticism. It's all chiropractic to them.Clearly, as authors, teachers, and researchers, they are in the middle of everthing going on in chiropractic.The book is wierdly underpriced at about $45.00, a real steal."},{"Title":"Technique Systems in Chiropractic","review":"This book helps explore the techniques, however I'd like to see more Q&A with the leaders in the various techique systems.

The authors take an evolutionary approach to the mysterious condition of Schizophrenia and come to some fascinating conclusions. Basically they argue that the great prophets and spiritual gurus of the past and present are in fact borderline (sometimes even full blown) Schizophrenics who could for other reasons have a charisma that would convince \\"followers\\" of their bizarre and revelatory insights. The authors speak of a concept called a mazeway resynthesis that both the prophet and the Schizophrenic have the capacity for and experience, where they create a revolutionary vision of a world to come. The prophet who typically for whatever reason has high self esteem or status convinces followers of his/her vision whereas the Schizophrenic often with low self esteem or status doesn't and with no \\"followers\\" too edit their thoughts they further break off from reality into their own imaginary world filled with imaginary followers, etc. Of course that's a simplistic explanation of the theory the authors propose and I couldn't do it justice in this short review. I found the book too be a fascinating exploratory journey into the mysterious origins of both the prophet and the Schizophrenic in evolutionary terms and left much to think about. The authors appear to be very knowledgable about the subject at hand. I did not nitpick the book for 'factual errors' such as those suggested by the previous reviewer. Instead I saw their views as generally well argued differences of opinion that are currently being debated by scholars in various fields with regards to these controversial issues at hand. The book also gives interesting suggestions for treatment of Schizophrenics based on their theory."},{"Title":"Prophets, Cults and Madness","review":"This is a MUST-READ book covering all the obvious cults and leaders and less obvious ones like Jesus.

Stevens's idea of prophets and messianic figures springing from the same root cause as schizophrenia and serving an evolutionary function in causing group fission is interesting (and may receive incidental support from Jane Goodall's work with the chimps at Gombe, who fissioned and essentially went to war with one another, resulting in the destruction of the smaller group by the larger). However, he is way too wedded to his biological paradigm and doesn't seem to understand the flaws in such an approach--one of the main problems with evolutionary psychology is that it works from a post-hoc ergo propter-hoc format, e.g. \\"We see this is serving this function so therefore it must have evolved to serve this function.\\"Stevens also displays only a superficial understanding of the ethnographic examples he picks out to illustrate his ideas, in particular those of Handsome Lake and other Native American examples, and to top it all off, his analysis of gender leaves a great deal to be desired. He states on page 122, \\"Males are orientated toward political issues of group leadership and group allegiances whereas females are primarily committed to motherhood and childrearing,\\" and goes on to assert that this distinction is found in all cultures except our own of the last twenty years. The assertion that females are concerned primarily with house and home and not with political matters is patently false, and arises from a profound historical male bias in ethnographical fieldwork, as anthropologists anywhere will tell you; the world over, females practice power strategies as assiduously as males do, but tend to employ more subtle strategies as spreading rumors about opponents, attempting to manipulate others into doing their bidding, and so on. Here is where a greater understanding of his data might have come in handy, as well as an understanding of the conditions under which some of these ethnographic examples were collected."},{"Title":"Magic: 25 Easy Tricks That Will Amaze Your Friends","review":"From the moment my son picked up Magic 25 Easy Tricks That Will Amaze Your Friends, he was able to follow the instructions and easily learn the tricks.

Cartier-Bresson notes in his foreword that the government never sought to censor his photographs; however, Cartier-Bresson, conscious of his position, doesn't seem to have made any major efforts to make waves, and, since neither he nor his wife spoke Russian, they were accompanied at all times by a government translator. Nonetheless, this is a valuable book. Alongside the expected-- Uzbeks waiting in line at Lenin's mausoleum, soldiers on Red Square, parades of girls in ethnic costumes, government officials-- there are little old ladies taking their grandchildren shopping, Red Army soldiers casually checking out teenaged girls, and a fabulous series of pictures showing people wandering around the Tretyakov Gallery and reacting to the artwork. Cartier-Bresson is a well-known photographer for a reason, and when he takes a look at a subject like this one, the result is a valuable historical document as well as a work of art. (Parenthetically, that said, I must describe my favorite photograph: two Red Army soldiers holding hands while they study a scale model of farm machinery at an agricultural exhibition. A small boy is crouched in front of them staring avidly at the engine; large photographs of heroic Soviet peasants engaged in farming activities decorate the wall behind them. One of the soldiers is picking his nose. I defy you to find a photograph like that in any more official work of Soviet history.) Highly recommended to anyone interested in the period who manages to run down a copy of the book. A picture sometimes really is worth a thousand words, and a book like this speaks volumes."},{"Title":"Rush to Judgment: The Simeon Rice Story","review":"Simeon Rice has been my personal favorite player since he started playing for the Fighting Illini bck in 1994, and he has continued to be now that he is playing for the Buccaneers.

There is a reason why many of the top coaches are also scientists, it works. As a coach and distance runner I have experienced a variety of training plans, and have found this one to work the best. Unlike Jack Daniels, this system takes into account metabolic systems being stressed rather than times and formulas. My advice is to read and discuss the book to allow you to process the information and clarify what you have read with others. Unfortunately this might not always be possible.The book is intended for coaches, aimed at teaching them how to create their own workouts based on the scientific principle addressed. If you want to see some workouts and more examples, try looking up articles by Frank Horwill, a former UK national coach, who invented the multi-tier (5-pace) training system. This system is quite similar to that used by Peter and Seb Coe. In fact, Coe is on record as saying, \\"We have used Frank Horwill's multi-tier system. It's all embracing.\\" You can find some of Horwill's articles here: [...]"},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"A really comprehensive book on all aspects of running.

This book requires patience and background knowledge to make the most of it. The majority of the text could have been left in the lab but then we would have lost a few gems along the way. If things don't make sense the first time then maybe you can revisit them in the future.Written by two passionate devotees - judicious editing could have avoided some of the difficulties people may find in interpreting their complex messages.Coe is Martin's key to practicality:Martin is Coe's key to academia.

While Martin's material here is reasonably useful in some respects, Coe's contributions are so over-the-top awful as to defy description (but I'll try).Coe is guilty of what, for a 'scientist' like himself must be the most heinous fallacy of all: the hasty generalisation from the particular; i.e., he egotistically trots out Seb Coe's workouts, and Seb's ONLY, as a basis for an ENTIRE TRAINING 'PHILOSOPHY' that, in the end, amounts to no more than a pile of pseudo-scientific claptrap and a surfeit of unnecessary hagiography.If you think that having detailed access to the minutiae of Seb Coe's build-up to the nineteen-seventy-whatever championships of this-or-that will help you be a smarter runner or coach, go ahead and buy this book. Otherwise, get yourself Daniels' Running Formula, by Jack Daniels"},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"If you are a competitive runner who races 800m or farther, look no further than this title for serious training advice.

I bought this book because I thought it would present a lot of training ideas on improving performance but I was disappointed because this book was full of scientific text which isn't fun to read, plus it requires a lot of knowledge to put the information in this book to practical use."},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"The purpose of the book is to be a comprehensive guide to training distance runners. If you are serious about your efforts in fulfilling your potential as a runner you will need to address all aspects of training. For some that may mean having a scientific fundamental understanding of how the body responds to training. I'm sorry that some of the reviewers may not appreciate the first 4 chapters of the book, which focuses on the physiology of running. Running, like any athletic activity, is about training the body's energy systems. Racing 100 meter requires a different energy system than racing a marathon. Thus training for 800 meters is different than training for 5000 meters. That is why in BTDR you get basic physiology first and training theory second. You can understand the book better if you start from this basic premise. You will understand why running 5 miles at certain speeds will have different effects or how to peak for a racing for a certain period of time. The science aspect makes the book a tough read, but the real value is Chapters 5-8. If the book were to contain only the last five chapters then it would still be valuable. Yes, a basic understanding of science is needed for the first four chapters. However, I find it hard to believe that concepts developed in the later chapters like periodization, total body fitness, race strategies, and training management were not of value to some of the reviewers. Newton give cursory treatment to these subjects, Jack Daniels does a better job in his 'Running Formula' (and would be the book that I would recommend to all high school distance runners), but it's BTDR that really breaks it down. BDTR will get you thinking in a whole new way about your approach to running.I have to also say a word about the expectation that popular running books created for runner eager to learn more about training. Publications like Runner's World and the Running Times are known for their easy to understand training articles that outline how to get faster. Their publishers also publish books in this same vain. What is not questioned are the training philosophies behind the programs, its just a successful runner (active or retired) or coach giving the cliff notes version of their programs. I'm sorry, but a week in the life of Runner X does me no good if I can't understand where that week is in his/her training, why they are doing what they are doing (re: goals) and most importantly their training philosophy. I applaud the fact that they are reaching a vast audience of runner who really don't want to run a sub 4:00 mile (and that is needed), but I do. BTDR is not meant for them. Glover's book ' the Competitive Runners Guide...' is a good starting point but it is more useful to a beginner runner than a high school cross-country runner (different races different goals). This simplification has its drawbacks; it encourages the simple parroting of training programs without a full understanding of their impact. Do you peak for one racing period, two periods or cycle the program? How long should base training last? When do we introduce anaerobic capacity training? Important questions to a serious runner but a less focused runner could care less. BDTR is meant for those who wish to learn how to develop thier own training programs from scratch. Which means gaining a fundamental understanding of every aspect of training runners. It not enough to say run 10 miles on Sunday as your weekly long run. Why not 5 miles or 20 miles? Is it even worth doing one at all? These questions answered in BTDR and not answered in most other popular running books.This book is not for every one. A high school runner may not want to know what the aerobic energy system is or how it works. Furthermore, s/he may not even care. Any one can tell some one to run 10 miles one day and 12x400m repeats the next, but if they can't tell you why you are doing that or what effect it will have on you then why would you want to give up your time and effort. For those that do have an interest and want to know what it takes to get to the next level then this book is gold.Bottom line. If you are not serious about your running then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"Some reviews here say that the book is too technical.

It is not for the weekend warrior who runs to lose weight, someone trying to run their first marathon, or attention deficit high school students who get discouraged because of the vast scientific knowledge contained in this book. It is a thoroughly researched, brilliantly done, scientifically based work that is probably the most complete book on competitive running ever compiled. I especially loved the fact of the 800m race being included in the strategy section, as a serious 800/1600m athlete is often left without advice on how to run the half, one of the most challenging yet neglected distance events. If you are serious, OR if you are mainly a 800m and 1600m runner as I am, then buy this book, otherwise purchase the Daniels Running Formula, the other \`best' running book ever written."},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"I have read dozens of books about training for the distance runner. This book and Jack Daniel's Running Formula are, by far, the two best books for the serious coach or distance runner. I believe they complement each other and reading BTDR after Daniel's Running Formula helped clarify some of the points made in the Daniel's book. After years of running at a highly competitive level and coaching, I really felt like I understood, for the first time, exactly how to design an individualized workout plan for an entire year or racing season with complete confidence.While the first four chapters are not for the feint of heart (especially chapters 3 and 4), they are well worth the effort. Even if you choose not to read one or more of these chapters, the remaining chapters of BTDR can be read on a standalone basis. Chapters 5 - 8 are filled with clear, comprehensive and practical training advice. These chapters do an excellent job of bringing theory and practice together.I also liked the way Martin and Coe drew on the training practices and running styles of various famous runners and coaches from Paavo Nurmi to Arthyr Llydiard to Haile Gebrselassie. (Of course, Seb Coe's training methods are discussed quite extensively since Peter Coe was both father and coach... and Seb was the best middle distance runner of his time.)BTDR also deftly combines a discussion of the art and science of running. If you are a serious runner, this book will likely convince you to periodically take your runners or yourself to a human performance lab to receive periodic testing.The only significant omission from BTDR was a more complete discussion of the effects of altitude training. They don't discuss the benefits of the \\"living high/training low\\" (sleeping or living in an hypoxic environment and training at or near sea level). Because the book was revised in 1991, I imagine most of the scientific data on this subject was not available at that time. This discussion would be helpful in their discussion of how to increase hemoglobin and hematocrit.I wish they would update this book one more time to cover some of the scientific advances over the past 15 years."},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"I am a cross-country captain and wanted to educate myself on how to help my coach with our team.

Technically sound and practically written, it is a valuable tool in the quest for achieving optimal athletic performance in the distance events. Although it doesn't go into full depth of physiological concepts, it does more than an adequate job in this regard for most coaches. Certainly its sections in terms of physiology are much more extensive than most other books of similar subject-matter. But its greatest strength is its adaptability towards implementation in distance training programs. The bottom line is that it is a must-read for distance coaches of any level."},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"I love running and I love books about running. I have degrees in the sciences and am a self-confessed nerd, having read about fifty books on training how to run. Of all of these, I found *Better Training for Distance Runners* to be the most frustrating.There is a degree of scientific complexity matched only by Noakes book *Lore of Running.* Unlike Noakes' book, this one never delivers after slogging through the detailed account of running physiology. There are some isolated bits of information, but the book lacks an integrated perspective on training.For example, Jack Daniels' book *Daniels' Running Formula* provides a step-by-step development of a training regiment that can be adapted for any competitive runner. In this book, after reading through detailed chapters on physiology I came to the chapter on putting together a training schedule. With great expectation I began to read--only to be severely disappointed. The chapter contained scattered accounts of different types of training, no direction about how much or when such training would be advised, and no guide to practical implementation. Coe's comments often seem to be platitudes or simply recalling what his son did in workouts. I'm not sure the authors really understand the cause and effect relationship between various aspects of training and the resultant changes in running performance.I guess that this book might be helpful for experts who already know everything about training and can benefit from some of the biological insights. Not being one of those, I found the book both difficult and vague, resulting in a high cost of reading with very low payoff."},{"Title":"Better Training for Distance Runners - 2nd Edition","review":"This book pulls together everything you ned to know about running and coaching.

Much of the information is science heavy for anyone without a background in physiology, however. Still, I remember reading this when I was 17 and in high school and found it very informative. Most people should probably skim through the early chapters on exercise physiology, but the information on Coe's training methods are invaluable. This is essential reading for any serious runner or coach and is one of the gospels of distance training in my opinion (Lydiard's \\"Running to the Top\\" and Daniels' \\"Daniels' Running Formula\\" being the other two). If you are serious about running or coaching it, you must read this book. If you are a hobby jogger looking for 30mpw marathon plans this book is not for you, though I feel every runner could benefit from reading it."},{"Title":"Macworld Dvd Studio Pro Bible","review":"Anybody could have written this book by working their way through the menus.

Borrow, don't buy."},{"Title":"Macworld Dvd Studio Pro Bible","review":"I got this book a couple of days before I recieved my G4 with a SuperDrive and began to study how to burn DVDs. Reading merely the first chapters on how the tutorial works and how you make a project using DVD Studio Pro will be enough to get you started. Within a couple of days after getting my computer I burned a full functioning DVD disc with several video tracks, a couple of complex menus, bonuses and a multitude of chapters...and I had never been exposed to DVD Studio Pro previously.The people slagging this book in their reviews obviously thought this 'Bible' would burn the DVDs for them. You will have to do a great deal of problem solving if you are trying to create complex DVD projects, and refering back to the Apple documentation helps fill in areas this book doesn't cover- for example my first DVD kept bombing while recording saing 'BitRate too high' , the Bible never solves such a problem, but the Apple documentation explains that a maximum bit rate cannot be exceeded and the video must be rerendered at lesser quality. Also, the DVD previewer doesn't synch the audio and video perfectly, but not to worry because when burning the DVD all tracks synch up perfectly. Perhaps this book's tutorial was eroneous, but I never use tutorials if I can produce my own project and learn through actual application, and the information provided was enough to get me through the project and understand most all abilities and limitations of the DVD Studio Pro program.The most apparent limitation of DVD Studio Pro is the ability to make motion menus with highlighted text for menu buttons, instead you can only overlay a color block onto of text presented in the motion video. Also, you cannot loop to a specific marker in a motion menu. I still can't figure out how to put markers on the specific frame of video for chapters, but only every 15 video frames. Hopefully Apple will produce a far more professional version of this program soon.My recommendations for a person wanting to use DVD Stuido Pro are these- get Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, and a couple monitors. You can put DVD Studio pro on one monitor, Final Cut on another and place Photoshop underneath the two applications. With these three programs and the two monitors you will never be confused to where your pieces are, which program you are using, and you can do all the bits of a complex DVD in a production line without having to close and open programs in order to organize your work space.Sure, the authors of this book didn't make a perfect Bible, but what can you expect from a book jumping quickly into an extremely complex program and video format. DVDs aren't VHS tapes- you can't just push REC and enjoy the program you are taping. With a bit of thought and persistance this book can help you burn DVDs using DVD Studio Pro's full capabilities."},{"Title":"Macworld Dvd Studio Pro Bible","review":"This latest volume in MacWorld's series of Bibles is indeed a true revelation. Apple's DVD Studio Pro 1.x software brings professional level DVD authoring to the Mac desktop in a moderately-priced application. Yet, like so many first generation products, it lacks extensive documentation.DVD Studio Pro, unlike so many computer \\"how to\\" books which merely are rewrites of the developers' manuals, goes beyond Apple's skimpy documentation and provides true hands-on guidance to the use of the program.The authors employ extensive visuals of menus and concise explanations of their functions. Perhaps the most valuable contribution is the step-by-step guide to the creation of DVD Menus in Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop is necessary for the creation of menus and overlays and the Apple manual provides insufficient guidance.

The cover looks nice. The table of contents stirs a little excitement. But hope deferred makes the heart sick. Don't expect any details; expect generalities.With the word &quot;Bible&quot; in its title, this book is over ambitious and all too general. The book is confused in its objective, lacking in critical substance, and therefore is not successful.The book will seem at times like an advertising gimmick as it spends most of its time speaking in generalities about other software applications. Of course DVDSP is an authoring environment for which one must create assets, but the book even goes so far as entertaining discussions of software that relates in no way to developing assets for use in DVDSP or even the DVD specification at that.In the end, the book fails for lack of detailed follow through. My recommendation is that you give yourself to fully understanding the DVD specification as you work intuitively with the DVDSP interface. If you understand the specification, mastery of the software will naturally follow.A remarkable reference for understanding the DVD specification is Jim Taylor's DVD Demystified. And if you will take the 45 minutes to do the tutorial that comes with DVD Studio Pro, you will know more than you would from reading this book.One of the arts of creativity is being precisely aware of your limitations and creating work that pushes the envelope of those limations without reflecting them (unless, of course, the subject of your art is the limitation).If you want to author for DVD, get to know the spec.

The dvd which comes with the book is also excellent .All my dvds will now have motion menus and better navigation thanks to the tips and tricks in dsp bible .In short it rocks !"},{"Title":"Macworld Dvd Studio Pro Bible","review":"don't let the title fool you; this is not a bible and macworld should be ashamed of itself to put its name on this book.in the right hands, apple's dvd studio pro is a very powerful program, and has the potential for apple to have great presence and respect in the professional dvd authoring world (much like what final cut pro has accomplished for editing). unfortunately, the authors of the book are not the &quot;right hands.&quot;the documentation included with the program by apple is slim, but does show the user, one way or another, most of what one needs to know to use dvdsp to implement the various features of the dvd spec. though not complete, the manual does not give any wrong information and is not verbose enough to be misleading. it also does not attempt to teach one the craft of dvd authoring; it only aids in the use of the program.dvdsp is actually a relatively easy program; it is dvd authoring in general that requires a good deal of knowledge (a great source of which is &quot;dvd authoring &amp; production&quot; by ralph lebarge) and can be difficult and challenging at times. the authors of the &quot;bible&quot; attempt to teach the reader how to master dvd authoring by using dvd studio pro. they mean well, but not only fall very short of that goal and show how little they know, but actually make many crucial errors as well as being very misleading.the book is poorly organized and unfocused. it should have been divided into two parts - one for explaining in great detail what all of the buttons, pulldown menus, and other components/functions of dvdsp are and what they do; and the second part for information about the dvd spec, authoring ettiquette, etc., and how to use dvdsp to implement the those items. instead, the apple and dvd communities get a book that, in fact, explains less than apple's lean documentation in an extremely verbose manner, riddled with humor that contains more stupidity than wit. the sub-articles scattered throughout the book are supposed to shed some light on different aspects of dvd production from experts in the field, but less than a handful of them are either useful or are even written by (or about) people related to dvd production!the book comes with a sample dvd of what can be accomplished with dvd studio pro, as well as including some tutorial files. any multimedia professional looking at the dvd would think that dvd studio pro is a terrible program, written for hobbyists and hacks alike. the included dvd is absolutely the worst dvd-authoring job i have ever seen anywhere (we won't comment on the quality of the content)! it is confusing and sloppy; the text and graphics are poor, unclear, and sloppily implemented; the navigation does not make any sense (or is not working properly - probably both). it makes a bad book even worse, and clearly shows how little authors really know about dvd authoring and dvd studio pro.the book's greatest fault is that it pulls apple, macworld, and dvd studio pro down to the authors' level - which damages the mac community as well as the post production and multimedia industries' image of dvd studio pro. the program is far from perfect, but like any software it needs time to mature. with the help of input from professional users, it can only improve. hopefully,with the help of professional users, apple, and macworld, this book will go out of print, with existing copies being recalled and destroyed before any more harm is done. - bw"},{"Title":"Macworld Dvd Studio Pro Bible","review":"This book was missing pages 65-112.

I was completely captivated by them, and read them over and over again. The science is pitched at exactly the right level for children: the colourful illustrations and short sections retain a child's attention. I went on to take biology, physics and chemistry A-levels at age 17, and went on to study Medicine at Cambridge University in England. Obviously there was more to this achievement than the Usborne books I read as a child, but I honestly do attribute much of my initial interest to them."},{"Title":"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science (Illustrated Dictionaries)","review":"My parents bought me this book in hardcover about ten years ago, and it has been indispensible. It covers a broad enough base of information so well, and with enough depth, that it has been a constant and indispensible reference for me through GCSE science in the UK, high school chemistry in the US, and even sometimes during my undergrad chemistry and physics. The illustrations are wonderful, and the explainations lucid. I would definitely recommend this for anyone with a child in school, or anyone who wants to look at a bit of basic science."},{"Title":"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science (Illustrated Dictionaries)","review":"This book is a wonderful source of science information, the colurful illustrtaions help explain the theorys that are explained in the book.

It was also a good refresher for any topics I hadn't studied in a while."},{"Title":"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science (Illustrated Dictionaries)","review":"The \\"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science\\" is truly an excellent effort. At nearly 400 pages this book is packed with fundamental scientific concepts and facts in the fields of physics, chemistry and biology up to GCSE level. It would also serve as a useful reference for A-level students. There are no exercise questions or difficult mathematics, instead this book focuses on concepts and explaining the key ideas behind each topic. I would highly recommend this book both for adults and children. I have a post-graduate degree in astrophysics and yet I still found this book useful for going over what I had forgotten or for getting ideas and concepts clearer in my head. The scientific ideas are very well presented here, making use of clear, colourful and illuminating diagrams and tight prose. This book serves as a very good reference work for basic scientific knowledge and theory and is especially suitable for young learners. A joy to read for anyone who enjoys science. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science (Illustrated Dictionaries)","review":"This book is clearly written, well illustrated and easy-to-understand.

Very good for anyone who needs some extra help in any branch of the sciences."},{"Title":"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science (Illustrated Dictionaries)","review":"I bought this book mainly for my 5th grader to have as a study resource for her science class. She has used it to look up some formulas and read some basic information related to labs she has done in school. Most of the subject matter covered is way beyound her 5th grade science class and lab. However, she has enjoyed sitting and just browsing through the book, as it is colorful and very detailed with loads of great drawings/illustrations. I am happy with this use for her right now, as it is just helping to get her interested and curious about science. The table of contents is well laid out. And the book covers the topics pretty thoroughly. It is definitely more of an encyclopedia of science, as it goes way beyond just giving definitions for scientific terms.My 3rd grader has also spent some time with this book. Again, I think because of the colors, all of the lovely graphics/illustions and the layout peeks his interest. We have sat together and looked at the period table and discussed some of the elements. And he goes off with the book and just sits and reads through different passages for fun.I am a chemist and was very impressed with the chemistry section as well as the other sections. The tables, images/illustrations and text size are all great, making it easy to read and enjoyable to read as well.This is a pretty good sized book. I expected it to be smaller and contain less information. So I was very pleasantly surprised when the book arrive.So far, the cover has held up very well, which is important to me. My kids, especially my son, can really wear books out. And this one has a nice coating on the cover, so even though it is paperback, it is much sturdier than a normal paper back book. It is really almost like a thin plastic cover.This book exceeded my expection as far as what all it contains and the quality of the book itself. Osborne really does a great job with its art books, and now I see they do a great job with their science books (and math also...we have bought and enjoy that one as well!) as well. The fact that this book covers so much makes it a really wonderful deal.

AbduljawadThe 8th habit book SummaryTo achieve interdependence from a path of dependence to independence; one must find their voice first, and express that voice. Then they must inspire others to find theirs by focus and execution.In order to understand ones personal pain and overcome it and to reach a level of satisfaction, one must understand the causation of the problem. With that said, they will be able to reach a solution to forget about the pain, and become more effective, productive, and contribute to his or her organization. The development of technology has not only changed the world, but it has also changed the way people think and operate where managers are programmed to function under the mindset of the industrial age. These managers control the employees of their organizations in a centralized fashion with lack of trust and anathematize the generality and especially the lower in chain of command personnel, their right of empowerment. These workers begin to loose their voice and identity, and feel they are not adding to the organization.People rarely find their voice and do not realize the ability to contribute, and instead they spend their careers giving at a lower level. The first solution as the author states is \\"Discover your voice\\". Simply stated, each individual is born with traits of greatness gifted by God almighty. It is that individual's call to either use those unopened gifts or to loose them. A person could discover these traits and improve them by indulging deeply and hard dedicated work. These magnificent privileges include \\"The power and freedom of choice\\", which is explained in detail fourteen centuries ago. God almighty in the holy Qur'an revealed in the ninetieth (sura) the chapter of the city, the countryside verses 9-12 says: \\"We have given man kind and humans the means of knowledge and the faculties of thinking and understanding and opened up before him both the highways of virtue and vice: one way leads down to moral depravity, and it is an easy way pleasing for the self; the other way leads up to moral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for scaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is man's weakness that he prefers slipping down into the abyss to scaling the cliff.\\" Bottom line, no one can blame another for his or her own choices.\\"Natural laws or principles\\", is the second gift. I would consider personally faith of a book (Islam, Christianity and Judaism.) one of the biggest gifts to humanity, which outlines laws, universal principles, and guidelines. These religions have fruitful teachings of fairness, respect, honesty, kindness, charity, contribution, and integrity. These Norms and values should be reposited in our conscience, and used in proper decision and choice making in one's daily life.The third gift is \\"The four intelligences/ capacities of our nature\\". As Mr. Covey mentioned, mankind is made up of four parts of nature \\"Body, mind, heart, and spirit\\". Corresponding to these natures are four overlapping capacities that are touched daily listed respectively as following: \\"The Mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual intelligence.\\" The highest manifestations of these capacities respectively are \\"discipline, vision, passion, and conscience\\". In order to express your voice more decisively and distinctively and to become an influential leader; at least the former three manifestations should be placed into actions. Vision the most important of the four manifestations brings upon the imagination, the future, and self-sense. Discipline, which is effectively willpower, which is an important trait to all successful people. It is accepting, implementing that imaginary visionary idea. Passion comes from the heart and it is the thing that excites human beings to reach for their desires. Conscience is the moral sense of what is right or wrong, the set of values that dictates the sense of fairness. Conscience encourages us to sacrifice to get to something valuable. Building our capacities in each of the above-mentioned four dimensions with the application of them makes us find and express our voices displaying personal leadership.It is the Leaderships responsibility to inspire others, and for an organization to find its voice; leaders must fulfill four sequential and simultaneous roles: \\"Modeling, path finding, aligning and empowering\\". These four influential roles are characters of leaders everywhere. Modeling: It inspires trust without expecting it. The leader must be a good example. Leaders must buy into the culture of the corporate aligned within the organizations vision. Path finding: It creates order without asking for it. It is finding a strategy to move to, and a vision of where to be in the future. Aligning: It forms a spontaneous authority. It is the creation of a structure and the system to keep everybody on track. Empowering: Leaders give help and direction only when demanded in empowered organizations. It is all about execution.The 8th habit is a combination of Knowledge, skill, and attitude. Leadership includes people's guidance becoming better. Path finding is the toughest of all since we have to deal with several personalities, issues, agendas, and levels of trust. Focusing tools that enhance path finding are creating a mission statement and a strategic plan.Better execution incorporates aligning goals and systems and empowering others, which helps organizations to find their voices and to achieve greatness. Utilizing structures and systems is needed in organizations for reinforcement purposes. Empowerment on the other hand, is a model of trustworthy behavior. Empowered people do not need supervision, which inspires trust. When people are empowered they find their voice by doing the things they want. Their individual voices blend with the voices of the organization. This type of directed autonomy shifts the manager from a controller to an enabler. Empowered mission statements are produced when enough people are fully informed, and interact freely and trustfully.The ability to work with a team must be achieved in order for a precedence to be set. Models are needed to show how they work and lead in different ways. Striving and encouraging others for personal excellence, while taking initiatives and doing the right thing without waiting for permission to do so. Avoiding criticism, negativity, and blaming others enhances working with others. The ability to be stable and constantly keeping to the same principles all of the time are factors that enhance trust. To be influential without authority, the leader must be trustworthy, which enables that leader to inspire others to find their voice. Building strong relations, understanding others point of views, and openness. I truly believe that loyalty and forgiveness all are tactics that enhances trust thus power to build focus.This trust allows the leader to find alternatives, which is the best way to find a solution between two conflicts. This solution requires a new mindset, which creates synergy that addresses differences between ideologies. This solution should be better than proposals of other parties, and must be a simple satisfactory rule that is agreed upon. This \\"third alternative\\" is based on the Win-Win principle. Miscommunication is a stressful event. Communication on the other hand is the most important skill in dealing with others and to be an excellent leader one must be a good listener.The other major source of trust is the trust within the organization. Organizational character and organizational competence are both required in building trust in an organization. Character is an important factor of trustworthiness. Character has three aspects \\"Integrity, maturity, and abundance mentality\\" Integrity is incorporating principles and natural law when dealing with others. Maturity is dealing with difficult issues with the ability to be compassionate at the same time. Abundance Mentality: is seeing life full of opportunities and not envying others for their success. Another important factor of personal trustworthiness is competence. Competence has three aspects and they are known as \\"Technical competence, conceptual knowledge, and interdependency.\\" Technical competence is the knowledge and skill needed to finish a given task. Conceptual knowledge is the ability to imagine the macro picture. Interdependency is the thought of interconnectedness of everything in life. These principles are important basis to the design structures, systems, processes and personal values aligned with organizational values.Aligning structures, systems, and processes and culture gives us the ability to realize our vision. Constant adjustments, and change to systems is a requirement to keep up with times keeping in mind to not change the universal principles. The 360- or balance feedback system is one of the best alignment tools that can be used. This feedback is an informative tool to know if the organizational strategies are in line with its mission.Asaad Abduljawad"},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"Covey says he worked a year to produce the Best-Selling 7 Habits of Effective People\\" and 5 years to produce the 8th Habit.

His seminal work \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" was a truly revolutionary work that significantly advanced the school of thought around personal development. Unfortunately, it's difficult to duplicate that success and 8th Habit falls short. The book centers on the premise that today's \\"Knowledge Worker\\" (not sure why the author gravitates toward such Orwellian descriptors) needs to find their own voice while helping others find theirs as well. Soundview likes that concept but wishes there was a stronger quantitative link to its claim that this 8th Habit is the catalyst for anyone or any organization seeking to jump from being effective to great. Additionally, there is a lot of discussion of the previous 7 habits to set the appropriate context of the 8th habit - which makes it a decent read if this is the first time you've been exposed to Covey's concepts, but a bit slow for those of us who read it the first time."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"In a time when many people are feeling at a loss about the future - this author says the future lies in upbuilding the people around you.... good book.

I personally think I wasted my money in purchasing this book."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"A Zen master once said:\\"You go to University and spend time studying hundreds of books, we prefer to spend all our time studying one book to get all the essence out of it\\". If I had to choose one book that I would like to study again and again it would be this one.If you have read and applied Stephen Covey's previous books, then don't expect the 8th Habit to be similar as it is very dense, so not as easy to apply. However I think it is the best success book I have ever read. Whilst First Things First and 7 habits are applicable to your daily life, this book is applicable to the world surrounding you: your community, your organization and your planet. It gives strategies for turning things around to success in a much more holistic way and it works!!This book could be the subject of a PHD on changing the world and making organizations and communities successful.Here is one area and example I chose where this book applies (and there are many others): Managing and Leading Corporations.Today we are suffering either through lay offs or the dwindling of our savings from corporations run by CEOs bad at their jobs. Millions of people are suffering, including the CEOs and board members. Corporations over a hundred years old are disappearing. People are demotivated in the workplace, only 5% of their capacities is used and no amount of top down initiatives can motivate them. Nobody really wants this. So why is it happening? It could be that capitalism is made of creation and destruction. But what is key to survival then? Steven Covey's book in my opinion answers these questions. He gives the key to turning around corporations to success in a more effective way than 6 Sigma processes, big 5 consulting reorganizations and all the hypes that come and go. As I said the book is very dense, but here are some highlights:- S. Covey explains the context: we have moved from an industrial era to a knowledge era. This changes the rules of how success is achieved.- What is key now is people and leading them to get the best of them. We can no longer be lead by specialists in Finance and PR jobs who play lip service to employees. \\"Employees are on the forefront of our minds\\";- S. Covey explains how to motivate people;- S. Covey explains the importance of devising synergistic solutions. So many companies are run through silos. The objective of one department is defeating the objective of another.- S. Covey outlines the importance of focus by limiting goals to 3 wildly important goals;- S. Covey explains how you cannot change the laws of nature. Ethics is a cornerstone of his principles and again this is an area where too many companies just play lip service to. Ultimately whether Ethics is not applied or is just a PR job the company pays the price.And so on...extremely powerful concepts. No amount of financial restructuring and marketing can make up for all these basic concepts.This book is to be put in the hands of all CEOs (and those who hire them :)), Presidents and Leaders (and we are all leaders). More organizations should employ S. Covey's consulting services. S. Covey should create a research community that brings the edge to these corporations and devises of simple ways of rolling them out. The proof is in the pudding old tricks no longer work and in my opinion S. Covey has the secret."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"I have to work at it in a bit by bit method to digest each of the concepts and practice what I preach is a lot harder and it only works if we do it that way.This is a life time of work list out for me to do.The High quality DVD also help me to understand by example, I have share that with everyone around me and I will show it again and again until we are all align with the basic principle and values."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"The book is a good companion to the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. The 7 Habits looks into becoming an effective person, while the 8th Habit explores becoming an effective leader. What the 7 Habits is to personal organization and excellence, the 8th Habit is to leadership and organizational excellence. It is the same principles applied to your company or organization.Like the 7 Habit, the 8th Habit builds from the inside out. Covey looks at how you must first master your own leadership or \\"find your voice\\" and build outward to your organization (\\"help others find their voice\\"). The book itself is build around the concept of \\"the whole person\\" and I think he makes a convincing case for why this is a good way to approach people and lead your organization. His focus on conscience and the need to serve a higher cause is inspiring and, I think, well stated.My only complaint about this book is that you will recognize many of the examples from the 7 Habits and this can feel a bit repetitive at times. The book includes a companion DVD, but I did not watch it due to the fact that this was a friend's book."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness: Miniature EditionCovey generally writes well, and his 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (which is a much better and more useful read) remains one of the better personal development books on the market today.In short, this 8th Habit book...any strong synonym for \\"bad\\" will do. Only read it if you can buy it for less than $3, and will not spend more than 20 minutes on it.With the 8th Habit he capitalized on the success of his previous books to generate more cash. He does try to make this book as useful to a reader as possible, albeit with little success. The book is more tedious than his previous ones. Covey reiterates the same points (I almost feel like he copy and pastes paragraphs) and fills space with many inspirational stories and quotes which, and one can disagree, should be really limited to specific examples and supporting points in order to be effective.In this text, yet again, he goes over different types of intelligence. If you never did particularly well academically, you can think that you are \\"intelligent in other ways.\\" He spends a good chunk of the book persuading you that great leaders develop their physical, emotional and spiritual intelligence into higher sense of right and wrong (among other things). Creative genius perhaps? Just one look at the creative accounting by senior executives at Lehman and AIG suggests they really found a creative outlet for their physical and emotional intelligence :) Sorry, Covey explained away all modern-day corrupt leadership with Hitler and \\"mad ego\\" example.The voice and the speed of trust was a good section, and probably a useful one for most people. Is it worth reading the entire book though..? I think there are far better texts(including his own 7 Habits), that are less theoretical/philosophical, and are packed with real-life concrete ideas that can be put into action today. Brian Tracy tends to be good with that and his books/programs on Maximum Achievement and How to Master Your Time are worth a look as a substitute to the 8th Habit."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"This audio book was great.

It is a message many modern companies with their focus on profits would do well to heed, especially in an economic downturn.The story is full of anectdotes of men and women with humble beginnings who became great by putting the needs of others before their own.A considerable amount of time is spent on the stories of Anwar Sadat and Gandhi, men who paid the ultimate sacrifice, with their lives.Not the easiest of reads, and if possible, listening to the audio edition can make things easier.Recommended.Cheers!"},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"One of the best leadership and self help books that I have ever read.

I am a particular fan of Covey because his books are usually grounded in established principles of human behavior.While this book is listed in category of self help and business, I would consider it as a welcome addition to the area of psychology and Positive Psychology in particular.The 8th habit is an inspirational attempt to get everyone to connect with their inner voice. Voice for Covey is that special place that you are able to connect your mental, physical, social/emotional and spiritual talents. It is those areas that express your and harness your vision, passion, discipline and conscience. In some ways it is the spex of Maslowe's theory of motivation and self actualization. It is a message that resonates in the field of Positive Psychology to discover your strengths and passion. It is aligned with Marty Seligman's Authentic Happiness.Covey has divided the book into section of: finding and developing your own voice; inspiring others to find their voices; and aligning organizations to support systems which empower and develop these qualities.This book is rich with anecdotes, exercises and even references to videos on Covey's website.It is a little cumbersome to read and not meant for a casual view.If you read it and take notes on relevant sections, it is well worth having and keeping as a reference."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"\\"The 8th habit:Find your voice and inspire others to find theirs.\\"Following up on Stephen Covey's blockbuster \\"The 7 habits of highly effective people\\" we have this sequel. The main principle of this book is that you should empower employees to make decisions with you. You should ask them for their opinions and truly listen at their ideas before making decisions that fall in their circle of competence. The days of one manager leading and everyone else holding screwdrivers and following is over. The author warns that in our current competitive environment we must maximize all the experience and talents of every one of our employees. Managers and employees should be working together to achieve goals that will benefit both of them along with clients and customers. Mr. Covey shows precisely how to accomplish this with diagrams and flow charts that breaks it down step by step.This book is 330 pages plus an additional 50 pages of appendixes. While I give the powerful life changing content of this book 5 stars I would have liked to seen it more concise and brief in its writing style. It contains voluminous information and is a huge investment of time to read. With that warning, It is still worth the effort and is a great more advanced companion for the original \\"7 Habits\\" book.

It is about 3\\" x 3\\"."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"In \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People,\\" Stephen Covey describes seven principles, that if established as habits, are key to leading an effective professional and personal life. In his book \\"The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness Covey takes the idea a step further. Becoming effective is surely something to be desired, but what would it take to achieve greatness?The first seven habits are focused on how to run your life effectively, how to manage your relationships with others effectively and how to keep learning so you can maintain this effectiveness over time. Habit 8 is \\"Find Your Voice and Help Others to Find There Voice.\\" This book makes a few passing references to the first seven where it makes sense, but its goal is different. It's wanting to help in the search for significance and how to apply your influence and leadership to that end. It discusses how to identify your chosen place in this world so you can best apply your skills, personal interests, and passion. All these are intended to drive you to make a real difference in this world and more so if you can apply your influence and leadership to maximize the contribution made be those in your sphere of influence. The book doesn't come out and say it, but it analyzes characteristics of great leaders and how they are able to accomplish what others might say, \\"Can't be done.\\"The book includes a DVD with videos to summarize and illustrate the points made in the book. All of them are very well produced and appropriate for clarify the points in the chapters where they appear. Covey complements the book with a well put together online community website that provides additional resources and recommendations on how to make the most of the published material. It's more than just a book, but a lesson plan with study materials for growing yourself (and your team and organization possibly).I am reading this book a second time and will soon be teaching it to others in the organization where I work. It forms the basis of a good leadership program and, if facilitated right, can be used to improve teamwork and interaction. We're using it to challenge people to become leaders of those around them.I'm sure I'll be writing more about this as I experience this content with others."},{"Title":"The 8th Habit","review":"8th Habit is another book in the Stephen Covey 7 Habits series. It extends the 7 habits with the 8th one which is called \\"Finding your voice and helping others to find theirs\\". Its an important habit, though I didn't think the book was a very good read.The book is split in three parts. The first part is an introduction part which is some chapters about how many people are currently lost in their job and their lives. It continues to talk about the change from the industrial age to the knowledge worker age and how everyone needs to be deeply involved in their work. I thought the first couple of chapters were great and looked forward to the rest of the book.The next part is \\"finding your voice\\" which isn't very large and largely repeats Coveys earlier work. If you have read the previous books in this series, like me, then you'll probably gradually fall asleep! It is not that the things he talks about are unimportant or that he doesn't use the Covey inspirational way of writing, its just that it takes too long and has too much repetition.The third part, by far the largest part of the book, talks about helping others to find it. Covey uses four \\"roles\\" to structure his work. They are \\"modeling\\", \\"pathfinding\\", \\"aligning\\" and \\"empowering\\". Modeling and pathfinding are part of what he calls \\"focus\\". Modeling refers to being a model for others. Pathfinding relates to creating a common vision for which people are passionate.The third and fourth role are what he calls \\"execution\\". The first one is aligning which relates to aligning the system and goals. The last is empowering, which I guess is clear what it means. Most of the things Covey discusses are quite standard in leadership and organizational literature. I don't think, in this case, he contributed very much, instead he tried to link everything together and squeeze it in his model of the world. Sometimes the linking of things seemed fairly arbitrary to me, which made me somewhat uncomfortable.All in all, I think the 8th habit was a huge disappointment. His earlier work is concrete and inspirational. However, 8th habit is more abstract, still inspirational and ... too long. It probably should have been a new chapter to the 8th habits instead!I wouldn't really recommend picking up the 8th habit. It's probably better to look at Coveys older work (7 habits). After reading these, this one is not worth reading. It is not a bad book either thus 3 stars."},{"Title":"Frommer's Tuscany & Umbria's Best-Loved Driving Tours","review":"This is one of the least useful travel guidebooks I have ever purchased.*the routes are difficult to follow because they are vague at times (if you've ever driven the Italian countryside, you know that detailed directions are a must),*the descriptive paragraphs about each stop offer too little information and are sometimes unreliable (their description of the interior of San Lorenzo in Perugia, for example, made me wonder if I was in the wrong church),*and, worst of all, there are NO food or lodging recommendations included.I would have appreciated any hint at all as to whether or not a great little caffe or trattoria was hiding in any of the stops on the itineraries, but you have to buy a second book for that information.A very disappointing purchase."},{"Title":"The Pirates of Shan (A Rick Brant Science-Adventure Story)","review":"\\"PIRATES OF SHAN\\" WAS LOADED WITH ACTION, FROM FRONT TO BACK COVER,JUST AS ALL OF JOHN BLANE'S \\"RICK BRANT\\" BOOKS WERE.

Much to their dismay, their plans are seriously disrupted by a series of brutal murders by a perpetrator well known to the Roman polizia, one who is making dire threats against their boss, Leo Falcone. The women are forced into protective custody, while their men attempt to foil the maniacal plans of Giorgio Bramante.Many police procedural novels highlight the pressures that their work places upon the marriages of police personnel. David Hewson does the same in this book, in which the urgencies of the case at hand override personal needs for two harrowing days. Bramante is the quintessential antagonist, a devious, vicious killer, but the true villain in this horrific crime spree is someone beyond suspicion. It is this element of surprise, coupled with the mystery that underlies a related cold case, that makes The Seventh Sacrament so compelling, a creepy crawl through underground Rome."},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"This was an enjoyable meander but for a book that takes place in large parts in a Mithraic Temple, one would think there would be more about that cult or religion or that the author might have seen some opportunities to utilize Mithraism to more substantial effect. Not going to happen, so if you're hoping for that, go elsewhere. As a detective story this delivers somewhat but you can find that in other places and often it will be better done."},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"Fourteen years ago seven-year-old Alessio Bramante vanished in the tunnels beneath Rome's ancient Circus Maximus. His father, renowned archeology professor Giorgio Bramante had left his son by the underground labyrinth and his students were drunk and with the child when they performed a ritual at the altar of an Ancient Roman God. The kid was not found, but the police further bungled the case when they left their prime suspect, student Ludo Torchia, alone with an outraged Giorgio. He went to prison for murdering the suspect, but is now free.However, almost from the moment the bitter Giorgio left prison, those associated with the disappearance begin to die and someone assaults Italian Police Inspector Leo Falcone, who worked on the unsolved case. He and his partner Detective Nic Costa begin making inquiries into the original vanishing as well as Giorgio's recent activity as he has the motive for serial killing vengeance plus he knows the underground like no one else does; Costa and Falcone believe the answer lies there.Costa's last outing (see The Lizard's Bite) was one of the top police procedurals of 2006; THE SEVENTH SACRAMENT will prove likewise in 2007. The story line is fast-paced while it smoothly moves back and forth between the present and the past. The investigation is top rate filled with twists and turns while Leo brings a human element with his feelings of inadequacy and guilt. Fans will appreciate David Hewson's superior Roman adventure.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal.

David Hewson's descriptive writing and spell-binding characters open a whole new world of both ancient and modern Rome including the history of the church which is truly fascinating. Great reads and I can't wait for more from this brilliant author."},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"Set in modern day Rome, but tied intricately to the city's ancient past, \\"The Seventh Sacrament\\" is long on atmosphere and reveals a part of the city that few tourists will ever see much of, its historic catacombs. This fifth book in David Hewson's well received Nic Costa series follows the efforts of Costa and his fellow Roman policemen Gianni Peroni and Leo Falcone to solve a case that the department bungled fourteen years earlier.When seven-year-old Alessio Bramante disappeared in one of the tunnels being studied by his archaeologist father, Giorgio, the department's chief concern was to find him while he was still alive. As time seemed to be running out, a decision was made that would ruin one man's career and haunt Detective Leo Falcone for the rest of his life. The boy's father was purposely left alone in the cell of one of the suspects in his son's disappearance where he tried to beat a confession out of the prisoner. The prisoner did not survive that encounter and, as a result, the case against him and his fellow suspects fell apart. Alessio Bramante was never found, and his father turned out to be the only one to serve prison time as a result of his disappearance.Now, fourteen years later, someone is picking off the remaining suspects one-by-one and has even attempted to kidnap Detective Falcone. Because Giorgio Bramante has recently been released from prison it is easy to name him the prime suspect. But what proves to be nearly impossible is finding him before he finishes going down the list of men he considers responsible for the loss of his son. And Falcone appears to be at the end of that list.Readers of earlier Nic Costa novels will already know much about the personal lives of Costa and his colleagues but Hewson has made sure that this one can be equally enjoyed by those reading their first novel in the series. His characters, including the villains, are fully-fleshed human beings who share the usual strengths and weakness of the species. One of the novel's strong points, in fact, is the way that Hewson develops personal lives for his characters and those closest to them, something that not all thriller writers bother to do.\\"The Seventh Sacrament\\" is a complicated narrative that requires the reader to pay strict attention as Hewson tells his story via several points-of-view and across several time lines: the present, the weeks just before and just after the boy's disappearance, and fourth century Rome. But this extra effort is ultimately rewarded by the way that Hewson so completely ties together all the loose ends and false leads into a satisfying ending."},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"THE SEVENTH SACRAMENT is the latest installment in David Hewson's series of novels featuring Italian policeman Nic Costa. As is always the case with Hewson, one must expect nothing less than the unexpected. Back in Rome after the events that transpired in THE LIZARD'S BITE, Costa and his partner, the quietly enigmatic Gianni Peroni, investigate a series of murders tied not only to an unsolved disappearance from over a decade previously but also to a religion that was eradicated thousands of years ago.Hewson has made a practice of bringing illumination to the dark and dusty corners of history. He does so again in his newest work, casting light upon Mithraism, a religious cult that flourished among the military and bureaucratic components of the Roman Empire until it was all but eradicated by the Emperor Constantine in 312 AD. As Hewson advises in his short but fascinating prologue, subterranean Mithraic temples have been discovered through the Roman Empire's military frontiers, including several in Rome itself.Fourteen years before the events in THE SEVENTH SACRAMENT, a seven-year-old boy --- the son of Giorgio Bramante, a respected and feared archaeologist --- vanishes into the labyrinth of a newly discovered Mithraic temple. His father, in a rage, murders one of the students whom he believes to be responsible. The man goes to prison, a police commissario resigns in disgrace, and the boy is never found.As the contemporary events in the book commence, Bramante is released from prison and almost immediately resumes his quest for revenge --- a quest that appears to include Leo Falcone, Costa and Peroni's inspector as a target. Their investigation incorporates a wide array of disciplines --- from archaeology to biology, from mythology to computer science, from the basest emotions to the highest ideals --- before the fascinating puzzle of Bramante's motives is revealed, and the final fate of his son, lost for so many years, is ultimately uncovered.THE SEVENTH SACRAMENT is possibly Hewson's most accessible work, providing not one but several new wrinkles to one of the mystery genre's most reliable themes --- the abducted child --- and contrasting the ancient and modern worlds, even while setting up scenarios for future novels in the series. If you are unfamiliar with previous volumes, now is the time to jump on board.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"I am truly addicted to his series, which has returned to Rome after a Venetian exile."},{"Title":"The Seventh Sacrament (Signed!)","review":"David Hewson is a weekly columnist for the Sunday times. As well as several novels he has also found the time to write a number of travel books. He lives in Kent.David Hewson's books can, to some people be extremely violent, some would say gratuitously but his books are after all thrillers and this one is up there with the best of them. I am sure that if this type of book is not your cup of tea, you will not buy it. For those who like a travelogue as well as a thriller the book open in Rome where Nic Costa and his cronies have returned from Venice. They are soon involved in another mystery surrounding fresh bloodstains on the shirt of a small boy who has gone missing. To go any deeper into the storyline would spoil it for the reader.The author's love of foreign places is evident by the number of travel books he has written and this comes through in the background to his books.

What were the different strategies used by government agencies to promote American ideals, self sacrifice, and gas rationing to a scared and confused public? Which advertising methods and artistic techniques worked best? Why?This concise, colorful guide examines the power, poetry, and politics of American WWII posters in five thematic chapters. Delving beneath the surface of over 150 colorful posters, the authors showcase and analysis the zig-zag evolution of wartime posters.Personally, I found chapter three (Art, Advertising, and Audience) to be a fascinating summary of vigorous debate among message makers. How should the war effort be framed? Is it a struggle for truth and democracy against terror and fascism? Is it a battle for survival? Should the focus be on personal fears, national achievements, or heroic freedom fighting?George Gallup, later of pollster fame, urged posters be designed to appeal to \\"the lower third\\" of the population. Other analysts warned that the Office Of Facts and Figures early communication efforts were too abstract and contained too much information. \\"It would be wonderful indeed if the psychological war could be fought on an intellectual basis,\\" warned two critics \\"if the American people who will win or lose this war were so educated and conditioned that we could bring them understanding on the terms we all prefer. But, through no fault of ours, they unfortunately are so educated. And in pitting the strategy of truth against the strategy of terror, we cannot stop to educate - we must win a war. We must state the truth in terms that will be understood by all levels of intelligence. Further, we must dramatize the truth.\\" Powerful images soon replaced statistics in posters.The considerable efforts to coordinate wartime messages across departments also generated vigorous debate. Eventually, the newly formed Office of Wartime Information identified six basic propaganda themes for general information programs: The nature of the Enemy; the nature of our Allies; the need to work; the need to fight; the need to sacrifice; and Americans and our ideals.This visually appealing book also carefully examines the proliferation of wartime posters, full of patriotic messages, created by non-profit organizations, unions, and corporations. The last chapter, Postwar Aims and Private Aspirations, focuses on the impact of Sheldon-Claire company posters celebrating the middle class home, the traditional nuclear family, consumerism, and free enterprise. It also features a haunting gas mask poster produced and distributed by Kroger Grocery store chain.The epilogue, the weakest section by far, argues that the change in postwar workplace posters reflected a more condescending air toward workers, explicit anti-union messages, and the renewnal of industrial conflict between management and labor. This thin section seems both out-of-place and a disjointed conclusion.Design for Victory, despite this somewhat weak ending, should satisfy the curiousities of graphic designers, artists, historians, and scholars interested in advertising methods and persuasive communication."},{"Title":"Design for Victory: World War II Poster on the American Home Front","review":"Anyone intersted in the graphic stylism, the stark imagery, the sometimes disturbing and sometimes hilarious generalizations made in American Propaganda during World War Two should check out this book. It contains many posters that I've not seen in print before, but unfortunately leaves many others out. From an academic, historical perspective the documentation and historical explanations for the U.S. propaganda machine are too brief. Still, the poster reproductions are fantastic, mostly in color.

The message invariably was \\"Be A Nurse\\", \\"Help the Troops\\", \\"Contribute to the effort\\", and most important \\"Don'T SHIRK ON THE JOB..MAKE EVERY MOMENT COUNT FOR THE BOYS OVERSEAS!\\" Of course similar posters were designed and displayed by all combatants, and their messages were all near identical.

It tells you how to make your own yogurt, sourdough, sausage, salami, \\"bisquick\\" type mix, etc.The ingredients are easy to find, recipes geared toward family eating, frugal meals. Can't say enough good things about this book. When we first started eating healthy it was a godsend b/c the meals were GOOD, unlike some crazy healthy eating cookbooks. The instructions are easy and it walks you through things you thought would be complicated like yogurt making and sourdough. (which are really quite easy) The other thing I like is that most recipes give substitution options for different ingredients. If you want to eat healthier, make stuff homemade with lots of whole grains, veggies and not give up meat, this is a great resource."},{"Title":"Whole Foods for the Whole Family: La Leche League International Cookbook (Plume)","review":"I had purchased this cookbook 30 years ago when my children were young.

A few months after my arrival I became pregnant. I was completely without any family support and gladly joined the La Leche League in Ft. Walton Beach, FL. Beside getting good advice for pregnancy and childbirth, I discovered this wonderful cook book. It was my first one here in the States. Finally some food I enjoyed with simple ingredients I was able to find in the stores.The pages of the book have become brown and stains decorate the pages of favorite recipes. Some of the pages were ripped out of the spiral binding and taped to keep the book together. A few months back I laminated all pages, keeping them loose leaf in a basket that has the perfect fit. The pages are protected and preserved now, and I can pick out a single one with the recipe I wish to prepare. I did this because I was unable to find the book. I am very glad to see it available again. I think it is an ideal cook book for a beginner who likes to prepare wholesome dishes.

Brown offers a mixture of political analysis and personal recollection, discussing the nature of the workers' struggle and the best method of organisation. For Brown, despairing of the internecine rivalry and fragmentation of craft and trades unions, the most efficient solution is clear - \\"Syndicalism... revolutionary industrial unionism\\". Taking his inspiration from continental anarcho-syndicalism, Brown argues for organising all the workers of one workplace in \\"one union, based on the commodity made or the service rendered\\". This, he hopes, will bring the day when \\"the workers must decide not to ask for another loaf, but to take over the bakery\\".Brown discusses in some detail dramatic aspects of British labour history: the five month strike on Tyneside in 1871 for the nine-hour day; the struggle for free speech in Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park at the end of the 1880s; the post-war strike of engineering workers in Southampton in 1924. This pamphlet will appeal to those familiar with the history of class struggle in the U.K., for the brevity of the essays does not allow for a broader historical context to be provided. Yet they are peppered with gems of wisdom. One in particular is as significant today as it was when first written nearly half a century ago: \\"Free speech came the hard way. It could go the easy way.\\""},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"Our local newspaper featured Joanna Lipper's book in a front page story titled, \\"For Teenage Mothers in Pittsfield, It's a Bleak Story.\\" Yes and no.Growing Up Fast provides a window into the lives of those girls we see pushing baby strollers along a downtown sidewalk, laying out the challenging truths that led them to become mothers, and that they continue to confront as they raise their children. The \\"bleak story\\" is not just for the six teen mothers profiled in this book, but for American children, ill-prepared or uncaring young fathers, extended families, schools, taxpayers and all of us who care about America's next generations.I have just finished reading Random Family, by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc, which has to be the publishing world's equivalent of a first cousin for Growing Up Fast. I highly recommend both books, but I came to appreciate Lipper's approach in dividing her narrative into six stories. Although some stories are related, no chapter is so long and complex that one becomes overwhelmed with names and relationships and timelines. The diversity achieved by profiling six girls also allows Lipper to avoid the question, \\"Why Coco?\\" that LeBlanc notes was posed to her repeatedly about her decision to focus on one of the two principal subjects of Random Family. Lipper also provides beautiful photos that allow us to look right into the haunted eyes (as well as some moments of contentment) of these young families.I am the Mayor of Pittsfield. Before publication of Growing Up Fast, I worried how Lipper's book would portray our City. Lipper is successful in telling the story through the words and experiences of Amy, Liz, Colleen, Shayla, Sheri and Jessica, and avoids injecting judgments of her own. I find her research is thorough and her engaging words are fair although none of our urban problems is left off the table. But mental illness, substance abuse, unemployment, domestic violence, poverty, homelessness and absentee parents are widespread problems. The Pittsfield community and all of America can learn from the stories of these young women, and from the successful programs here and in other communities that Lipper describes in her closing chapters. We owe it to these girls and to their children to do our best."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"This portrait of six teen mothers in a decaying industrial town is a wonderfully thought-provoking book. The photos help with the impression of a window into their world. The interlocking influences of economic problems, environmental degradation, drug addiction, and domestic violence are all compelling in explaining their situation.The behavior of the girls is often so idiotic as to stun the reader. Colleen's baby, for example, is fathered by Ryan. Ryan is a heroin addict who steals from Colleen and her family, and beats up Colleen many times, including an incident during her pregnancy that causes permanent injury to the baby. Society can only be thankful that Ryan spends a lot of time in jail. Yet Colleen remains faithful to Ryan for years.One of the book's major themes is the economic decline of Pittsfield, Massachusetts after GE pulled out of the town. After GE's departure, it left behind a legacy of industrial pollution on a massive scale. While the book does not address economic questions as such, I think the Pittsfield story shows the need for the costs of pollution to be included in measures of economic growth. A large part of Pittsfield's prosperity when GE was there can only be described as an illusion. For more on this question, I would recommend the book \\"Beyond Growth\\" by Herman Daly.Some of the policies recommended in the book strike me as naive. For example, the author concludes with a quote from Carol Gilligan (who helped with the book's preparation) that \\"The problem with these girls is that there is no safety net. The absence of resources really needs to be addressed.\\" The book itself shows that this is simply not true. These girls and their babies received enormous public resources, including welfare payments, subsidized rent, subsidized day care, free medical care, social services, etc., etc. Giving a larger safety net to such girls would only encourage more teen births. This is easy to see from the book's stories on Amy and Shayla, who each went on to have a second baby out of wedlock. The others haven't had more babies yet, though given their talent for making poor choices I certainly wouldn't put it past any of them. In the long run, I think we will be better off putting more resources into birth control and pregnancy prevention, not more support for teen mothers. The book does have some good proposals on providing incentives to teen mothers not to have another child.Some of the girls made it clear that their decision not to abort their babies was inspired by religion. The book does not follow up on this. I think the Catholic church and other churches opposed to abortion have a lot to answer for here. If they feel it is unethical to use birth control or have an abortion, that is fine with me; but I believe they must take responsibility for the results. \\"Abstinence-only\\" programs can be effective in reducing teen births, but it is harder to do than other approaches, and there is a price to be paid for that. I don't see churches willing to pay for research into establishing what programs really work, getting them implemented, and paying for the difference in cost. If a girl doesn't have an abortion because her church tells her abortion is a sin, it should be her church that supports her and her baby, not taxpayers.Overall, the book is well written and the stories are fascinating. I had a hard time putting it down. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"This book is so naturally written you will feel like you are in the same room with the six girls whose lives it explores. By turns deeply personal and then again unflinchingly political, Joanna Lipper's probing investigative journalism reveals the hidden truths of life in Pittsfield, Massachusetts--which like hundreds of postindustrial communities all across the United States, is struggling with the fact that the jobs that were once there disappeared into thin air when the factories closed--and children are paying the price. Lipper's detailed, incisive examination of the enormous role class plays in shaping destiny and opportunity, reminds me of another writer she discusses in one section of the book, Edith Wharton, whose novel, Summer, also set in the Berkshires, is about a teen mother. Like Edith Wharton, Joanna Lipper portrays the deep, complex internal lives of young women, which are full of conflict, pathos, longing, romantic ideals, disappointments, challenges, determination, and in the end, resilience."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"I was deeply moved to find that the teen mothers Joanna Lipper portrays so vividly illustrate both how behind our society is in addressing the lives of young women--and yet, how determined and resilient these young women remain. Lipper does a masterful job of letting these teenage mothers speak for themselves, while still incorporating the kind of psychological insight and sociological context that makes Growing Up Fast a book that will change the way we think about the world we live in. The hopeful and critical message of this book lies in the potential of social and emotional education to change the path of these women's lives and in their unbreakable spirit to move forward against all odds. I have screened both of Lipper's documentaries for top educators in the field and they have provoked emotional reactions and thoughtful discussions, just as this book undoubtedly will."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"This book takes place in Pittsfield, Mass. and it documents the lives of 6 teenage mothers. This book is very sad because of the lives these girls had and the troubles that they went through with the fathers of their children. I am 16 and I have a 5 month old daughter so I can relate to the situation that these girls are in to some extent. I didn't have an abusive boyfriend and he wasn't addicted to drugs. But I can relate to not having the father around and having to do this all by myself while going to school. I couldn't put this book down, I was very moved by it. The stories that these girls had to share about their lives and growing up are just heartbreaking. You are tempted to laugh at some of there thoughts before they were pregnant but then you remember that they didn't know any better. So I recommend this book to teen parents, teens and parents. This book is good for everyone. It teaches us to be thankful for what we have and the freedom that we have. Read this book if it's a rainy day and you just want to curl up in a big comfy chair with a blanket and a hot cup of something. This is definately a snuggle book."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"Growing Up Fast is engaging and thought-provoking. Joanna Lipper's book provides a detailed, heart-breaking account of the consequences society faces as a result of corporate, community, and individual decisions. From the very first page of the book, you learn about the daunting issues facing Pittsfield primarily through the eyes of the teen mothers profiled. Not only will other young adults learn from their peers in Pittsfield, but so too will educators, parents, policymakers, and community leaders."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"I chose to read this book for a class I took this semester, Sociology of the Family, and was very pleased with it. Normally, I have a difficult time getting into books, especially nonfiction, but I really found this book engaging. If you have any interest in social structure, sociology, or family issues or teen pregnancy (of course), this book is a great read. I felt both emotionally invested in the book, and like the biggest expert ever on Pittsfield, MA as a result of reading it. These mothers are incredibly strong and have all been through a lot; find out for yourself!"},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"Joanna Lipper tells the stories of teenage mothers in Pittsfield, Massachussets, struggling to raise kids with deadbeat dads, neglected by their families, and no good jobs to be found. The town had a General Electric plant that provided all the jobs, but when the plant closed, the town began a slow, steady, slide into decay. By the late 1990's it was drug infested and crawling with low-lifes.The girls all had different family experiences. Amy came from a two-parent family, but her father was away all week and her mnother had no backbone. Sheri had parents who were both alcoholics. Jessica's parents had no idea what was going on in their kids lives.The common thread in this book is that the parents are depressed over the lack of a job, and they end up ignoring their kids. The second problem here is welfare. These girls end up having subsidized apartment and welfare checks, so they have an incentive not to put up the child for adoption.The book was written in 2003, so the births occured years earlier. I haven't seen the documentary that Lipper made about these girls, but I would like to see a follow up on where they are now."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"The book is fantastic!

It's a shame that some of the main characters in the book had to get prison sentences to decided to turn their lives around. Others relocated to \\"better\\" areas, but still continued the actions that keep/kept them in poverty, such as continuing to have children out of wedlock. I thought the book to very good and insightful and recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the mentality of those who continue the cycle of poverty in the minority community."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"We often hear in the media about the teen pregancy rate, about the welfare lists, and about abuse. Unfortunately, it seems as if the country is divided on what to do... Except that we are often united in our disgust and blame of the teen mother. Joanna Lipper's book gives compelling evidence that the problems of teen pregancy won't be fixed through classes on abstinence or birth control, but instead of looking at the root of the problems that cause teens to make risky decisions. In all of the cases in this book, the teen mother became a parent because of problems in her life. Several of the teens were sexually abused, or came from families with a history of abuse. Additionally, people need to closely examine the teen fathers. As with research that indicates that teen girls are more likely to engage in risky behaviors because of childhood abuse, they are also more likely to hook up with abusers to be the fathers of their children. The fathers are in and out of jail in this book, and few of them pay child support. The only way to reduce the amount of teen pregnancy, and through this, hopefully our welfare lists, special education classes and foster care homes (often centers for abuse as well) is to truly respond and help children at an early age with education, access to medical and psychological care, and support for their families."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"Growing Up FastI was somewhat disappointed with this book-it started to feel tedious after about a third of the way through and I easily could have put it down. For good. \\"Random Family\\", on the other hand, was awesome-a book I truly couldn't put down. This book was just too much of the same story after story and I did not truly care about anyone that was being written about. Just too much of the same thing in each chapter. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"Pittsfield, Mass. used to be a company town. General Electric provided work that in turn enabled a big percent of the population to live middle class lives. When the company closed down most of its divisions in Pittsfield, the economic and social climate plunged into the depths. Families that didn't leave suffered large drops in income, many people turned to drugs and alcohol, and education and health care---despite some government aid---plummetted too. The city was found to be highly polluted as well. In this atmosphere of despair and disappointment, child abuse and domestic violence grew. Teenage pregnancies have been around forever, but in an environment like Pittsfield's in the 1990s and early 2000s, the problem was intensified. Many girls associated sex with violence, felt that abusive men were the norm. Families could not cope; many teenage fathers could not or would not cooperate, and at last we learn that as many as two-thirds of the teenage girls who gave birth to babies had suffered heavy abuse of some kind as children. These girls, not even 20 years old, were left to cope with bringing up children, almost always without the support of the father.Joanna Lipper not only wrote this sad, but interesting book, she made a film about the main participants---six teenage mothers, some of the fathers, some parents and siblings. The bulk of the book traces the stories of the six girls in very empathetic detail, combining interviews, observations, and records of participation in various programs. Drugs, violence, and general unawareness of life and its possibilities play strong roles in nearly all cases. Race is factored into the picture. Most of the girls are white, but race doesn't seem to be very important here. But what about class? While economic background and education are often discussed and described, Lipper makes no effort to draw any conclusions about class and people who \\"fall\\" from middle to lower, people who resent being at the bottom. Where does all this self-destructive behavior come from ? I would say such questions are not dealt with. A few black and white photos only make the stories more poignant. If----if only---there are so many of these ifs. What can be done ? The author outlines various programs that exist or existed in Pittsfield, but offers no general ideas on the problem. The strong point of the book is the well-written stories of the teenage mothers. I admit I had never given much thought to teenage mothers and their children until I read GROWING UP FAST. I think that for raising the consciousness of people about this problem, you would have to go a long way to beat Lipper's book."},{"Title":"Growing Up Fast","review":"Growing up Fast is a book that is made up of eight girls that shared their story on how they \\"grew up fast\\". Some of the girls got pregnant on accident and some got pregnant by their actions. This book overall shows how important it is to have a father in a girl's life. A daughter looks up to her father; he should be her main man in her life, a role model. Every single girl in this book had a father that left their family. So intern, these girls grew up without a dad. I recommend this book to any mother of a teen or preteen. I also recommend this book to any girl that feels that the only way to feel loved by any man is to have a boyfriend. They do not have to have a boyfriend. This was a really good book.

Since then, I have also recommended it to homeschoolers and adults who want to learn to sign on their own. It starts out with an interesting, concise history of the language with some information about Deaf culture, then gently introduces the basics of ASL including the hand shapes and the manual alphabet. It has 16 chapters of ASL vocabulary organized around logical topics such as \\"Family, People and Pronouns\\" in Chapter 1 to \\"Opposites and Questions\\" in Chapter 15. Once the reader understands how to make the hand shapes and some other basics covered in seven pages toward the beginning of the book, she or he is ready to choose any chapter and learn the signs. Each sign is illustrated with a line drawing of a person making the sign. There is also a written description of how to do it, plus memory aids (these really help me). A student could go through the book chronologically and learn all 1,400 signs, or skip to what interests them. If signing in church, they could go right to Chapter 9 \\"God and Religion,\\" or if they want to be able to help people with first aid they could skip to Chapter 13 \\"Health, Medical and the Body.\\" The chapters each end with practice pages so the student can test her or his knowledge immediately.

For Example, Chapter 1 is Family,People,and Pronouns.There is all an index in the back were you can look up the words.No DVDS to mess up the lessons.- If you like the DVD books fine,they work for you perfect.Than maybe this is not the book for you. Otherwise, again it is a great book.Cons:The pictures in the book will not be exact. In class we learned that deaf people( I hope I said that right) have different ways of doing signing. Their own version, slang. And, that there is English ASL, and regular ASL.Similar signs, for me took a little longer to understand the difference, and meaning.A friend of my family gave me an ASL dictionary, and I have not had to use it yet.

I've found it very easy to use, and it is well organized in looking things up. If you seek a book for doing what I am using it for, this is a good choice. I can't rate it 5 stars simply because of my inexperience with this, and I'm not sure if it is what a serious student needs, but using it to be able to learn easily the basics is a solid 4 stars."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"Easy to learn and pick up the basics of sign language.

I'm definitely going to need to supplement this with another source on the grammar of sign language."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"I am using the book 'the Joy of Signing\\" and found another book at the library called \\"Signing Illustrated\\".

My son is 2 and has oral apraxia and uses signing to convey his needs and wants. I have not not found a word I needed to work with my son. But I'm surprised the alphabet is not in the book. Alot of signing is based on basic letter signs; however, it is easy to figure."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"Being a Deaf American Sign Language instructor, I spend much of my time searching for resources regarding ASL vocabulary, syntax, and non-manual communications. &quot;Signing Illustrated&quot; is the perfect book to start you out.This book includes 1500 signs, very clearly illustrated with memory aids, as well as help tp practice fingerspelling. Like any ASL book you'll come across, there are some regional differences in the signs, but they're few and far between.The vocabulary is listed in categories instead of alphabetical order. This means that you can learn all of your feeling words or all of your action words without having to sift through the book and find each one. I love that about this!Along with this book, you can purchase a board game called, &quot;Sign It!&quot; which uses this text as its reference. There are also a couple of books that are the exact same pictures and descriptions, exact same author, but different format.No matter what your reason is to learn ASL, this is a wonderful book to get you started. HIGHLY recommended from a deafie! :v)"},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"This book is absolutely the BEST in its class!

This book is great because is it so user friendly and packet with signs."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"I am a beginning student of ASL, and I found this book to be of great help. I have a deaf friend, and wanted to communicate better with him, and I feel this book will really help me do that.It would be best as an add-on to a course or to practical one-on-one conversation, but it is great on it's own too.I loved the quizzes to keep checking myself."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"I'm deaf and they're is only 1 person in my school that is deaf also. All of our friends don't understand what we're saying, and on days that our translater isn't there, they're totally lost. Our friends all found out about the book and are learning to sign and understand what we say. We don't feel like we're in a hole and nobody can hear us. Everything is illustrated clearly and it's very easy to learn. This book is a definate must-read."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"ASL (Amercian Sign Language) is not just a different language but is also a culture. I am a hearing person currently enrolled in a Beg. ASL class, and for anyone who is starting to learn this art form, this book is very useful as both a learning and especially a reference tool. After combing thru other options, I thought this book is the most efficient one that a beginner like me can use. The book, unlike most others, organizes the signs categorically instead of alphabetically. Emotions, food, actions, etc...For someone who seeks a quick word by alphabet, there is also the index at the end. In addition, there are signing tips under each illustration to help to memorize the signing gesture with word or thought associations. Signs that require repetitive motion are pointed out clearly with arrows. I find it easy to use and comprehensible, but for someone who has some basic signing knowledge, they would probably be better off buying a smaller reference guide to carry around. Overall, the book should be the 1st option among the other offerings currently on the shelves."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"It seems counter-intuitive that you would be able to learn a lot of sign language just by looking at pictures in a book. But if you have this book by Mickey Flodin (as well as Barron's American Sign Language the Easy Way), you are well on your way to becoming fairly communicative in ASL.ASL purists will immediately jump on this statement, but please allow me to explain. Unless you are enrolled in a class taught by a certified instructor, you will not be proficient enough to be a sign-language interpreter.However, if you want to be fairly conversant; if you want to be able to communicate with the hearing impaired, this resource (as well as the Barron's book)can have you well on your way. By using /studying these two books I was able to conduct an interview in a social services-setting with a hearing-impaired person, who used ASL, by using the ASL I learned from these two works. Also, I was able to tell my daughter what two deaf individuals were talking about one day while shopping in an office supply store. It can be done! You can learn this wonderful language!The illustrations are simple, and crystal-clear. Definitions for signs are given along with memory aids that all but ensure memorization by the learner. The author has written this book by categorizing the over 1400 signs in this book by concept as this has proven to be the most efficient, thorough,and quickest way for individuals to pick up signs.To top it all off, there is a comprehensive index which includes all entries and synonyms for easy-cross reference. This is the type of book that you can (1)spend a focused, concerted amount of time studying, and/or (2)you can carry it with you (like, let's say, to the doctor's office)to study on the fly.I love this book and I would highly recommend it. Mr. Flodin has performed a great service to those of us who wish to serve/and communicate with those persons who have limited or no hearing. As a hearing impaired individual myself, this book has given me a lot of encouragement that I will be able to continue to communicate, should my hearing deteriorate."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"This book is not ASL as other reviewers have noted, it's signed english! I've taken a few ASL courses and now I am using this book for a signing course (not pure ASL). The teacher has to review each chapter before we study it because there are modification and corrections to many sign forms or synonyms. The book does include a nice amount of vocabulary and it is organized by categories. The vocabulary words learned in this book are not reinforced with any type of actual language/sentence formation. I would use this book more as a dictionary instead of a learning tool."},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"I had just finished my ASL 4 class and still had 2 years to go in college and I was afraid that I would forget the language.

It's a great review for anyone not wanting to forget!!"},{"Title":"Signing Illustrated (Revised Edition): The Complete Learning Guide","review":"The best thing about this book, is it gives you a reason WHY you are making the particular sign instead of making you just trying to memorize everything.

There are 300 words that most people can use to get by in English. This book has 1500 words, but the useful ones are scattered throughout. I don't need to know Kangaroo or Trombone before I know words like \\"like,\\" how to tell time, interrogatory words, etc. This is one of the most frustrating books I have ever tried to learn from, and I'm pretty good at languages. There is no grammar, and many of the signs are British instead of American.

For example, Fra Angelico's fresco 'The Annunciation' appears much too small to appreciate the subtleties of the depiction of Gabriel and Mary. Fra Lippi's 'Adoration' and Uccello's 'Battle of San Romano' suffer a lot, too.

But indepth on monuments, paintings, cities and regions all over the country and throughout the 12th- 16th centuries."},{"Title":"One Was Annie","review":"Reiter belongs in a category of particularly powerful authors - women like Alice Walker or Maryse Cond&eacute;. One was Annie is a sweeping saga - not so much of epic historical proportions, though historical elements here demonstrate wealth and careful research - but of the epic of what it means to be human, in all its beauty and ugliness. It is a novel of strength, of unflinching honesty, of integrity. Reiter's style is supple and strong, like the oaken strips of Annie's baskets, and the story weaves together tightly, each strip polished and tucked neatly in. Keen observations of nature abound in the novel, and there are moments where Reiter achieves near perfection in her description of Annie's landscapes. Annie, as the central figure around which this novel turns, is a woman of endless grace and depth, and though the writing here is easy and clear, the questions Annie asks are highly complex and universal. One was Annie will speak to many of us, in a simple, insistent voice."},{"Title":"One Was Annie","review":"Three of us who went to college with Lora Reiter have had the honor and privilege of hearing \\"One Was Annie\\" from its beginnings. We get together each summer to renew our friendship; about ten years ago Lora began reading us excerpts from her novel about Annie...and we became hooked!!! It was hard to wait til the next summer to find out more about Annie and her family, her exploits, etc. She became alive for us, as she certainly will for anyone who reads about her. Lora's characters are beautifully drawn, and the settings--from Tennessee through the boat trip north and across Kansas--make that period in the late 19th century real and vivid in our imaginations. Readers will fall in love with Annie and, perhaps, even Will! There are moments of great hilarity, as well as tears and a lump in the throat. This book is hard to put down; luckily, readers no longer have to wait til the \\"next summer\\" to find what happens next!! You will be glad that Annie was in this world, even in our imaginations, and that Lora Reiter is very much in this world!! Let's hope for another novel!!!"},{"Title":"One Was Annie","review":"I started reading this book with much trepidation as I knew the author at Ottawa University. However I quickly forgot about that connection as I was drawn into the story. For me, the beginning was fascinating. I loved the rich background \\"gossip\\" of William's character. I also enjoyed the arduous journey that eventually brought them to Brittsville (very loosely based on Simpson), Kansas. (My father was a pastor of the Simpson Church &lt;there's just one now> for over 2 decades so I know the area.) The author succeeded in showing me how a person could choose to stay in an abusive relationship and all that involves. Dealing with good lovers/bad husbands, poverty and loneliness, Annie perserves and I fell in love with her character. I would like to know how much of the epilogue is factual. In conclusion, this was a really delightful book and I've already promised to share it with my cousin. (And I agree- it would make a great Hallmark-type movie)"},{"Title":"One Was Annie","review":"I love the images conjured up in this book! Being from Kansas myself, it was particularly gratifiying to see our habitat described with such beauty and a sense of the awesome vastness of our terrain. The people in this book are real and it was good to come to know them over a lifetime.

I was caught after the first chapter, and I continued to read whether I was a passenger in the car, the only person awake in our camper, or while the family was fishing. I was amazed by the vivid descriptions of nature and the landscape of the Kansas prairie as well as the detailed development of the characters. Upon finishing the book, I found myself going back and re-reading sections. Now my only question to Lora is \\"When will you write a sequel so I know what continued to happen with Edward and Sissie's families and more about Emily's involvement with the right to vote issues?\\" Thank you Lora for the autographed copy. I will treasure it."},{"Title":"One Was Annie","review":"This story reached in and touched that part of me that is strong, human, Annie. Annie demonstrtates time after time that somewhere inside there is bravery enough, not merely to survive during the post civil war, but to pull herself through the pain of a tormented marriage, face life alone, and to remain kind and loving. She teaches her children and future generations of her family dignity and love. Annie comes out whole. She has great courage and serenity. I admire her.Annie/Reiter loves nature and is part of it, not seperate from it. I am particularly fond of the images she creates when Annie cares for the family animals in a tough winter and of Annie's observations of nature.

My 5 stars goes completely to the translation.This edition, however, was produced by a machine which scans the pages of the original text, and duplicates the exact text in a very hard to read format. For example, all of the book titles are the same size and font of the rest of the text, so it is very difficult to find a specific passage. (Paul's epistle to the Ephesians might look like another line in the middle of a paragraph when it is actually the end of one book and the beginning of another). In addition to the difficulty of navigation, there are plenty of typos where the computer mistook an i for a 1, i.e. salvat1on... or it didn't know what to do with an apostrophe or greek word.I would recommend getting a more expensive version of this translation, so you don't have to deal with all those issues.I also purchased the Wuest and Phillips translations at the same time as this, and they are both incredible. I would recommend those as well."},{"Title":"Open Skies, Closed Minds Pb","review":"From 1991 to 1994 Nick Pope was posted as the British MOD investigator of UFOs. That means he worked for the Ministry Of Defense. Pope believes that UFOs are real and explains what he discovered while working for the MOD. Although a lot of the information here is known to most UFO researchers he does uncover some new UK material. This is a good book about UFOs from an MOD insider. A worthy addition to any UFO book collection."},{"Title":"Open Skies, Closed Minds Pb","review":"First published in 1996 shortly after Nick Pope left his three-year posting as head of the UFO desk but whilst still employed by the Ministry of Defence, \\"Open Skies, Closed Minds\\" is a thoughtful, literate and occasionally amusing summary of the author's tenure as a full-time, government-paid researcher into the UFO phenomenon. He turns out to be a good writer, and although there may be few new revelations here for the serious student of the subject, Nick's unique official position and his fair-minded, diligent approach make for an original and valuable contribution to the field. It's the impartiality, the outsider parachuted into the job with no previous interest and no preconceptions who then undergoes gradual conversion to realize there is real substance to the UFO issue that makes for a compelling read. The level of commercial success and subsequent publicity for the UFO phenomenon gained by this book in the UK has only to date been equaled by the best work of Tim Good.This review is of the original hardback edition, which has a good 8-page monochrome photo section in the middle and a comprehensive index.Quote from the author: \\"One of the first things I did on taking up the UFO post was to read into the subject...there were also things called \`close encounters'...where people saw a UFO and then arrived home much later than expected unable to account for a lost period...I had responsibilities both to the MOD and to the public as a whole to investigate all sightings and experiences in a totally impartial way, irrespective of my own views about a witness......many in the world of UFOlogy regarded me as just \`the man from the ministry' as likely as not up to my eyeballs in crashed UFOs, dead aliens and cosmic cover-ups. But as I began to deal on a daily basis with people who had experienced events which appeared to go beyond human understanding, I formed working relationships with UFO researchers and a mutual trust developed.\\" Has this trust been maintained and built on by Nick's successors? Alas, no.The book is written with a broadly chronological narrative which proves to be a more engaging style than the fragmented listing of sighting reports. The author shares his discoveries opening up the MOD's existing UFO files and his own evolving conversion from admitted ignorance and skepticism to an appreciation of the reality of a mysterious, multi-faceted phenomenon of some complexity. He comes to the conclusion that the ETH best fits the facts, and that the evidence is that the ETs in the main do not appear to have humanity's best interests at heart. This is a remarkable public admission from someone working at a high level in the MOD, and in the absence of any official denial or disclaimer represents the nearest thing we're likely to get for the moment to a government acknowledgement that there is an ET presence and that it ain't friendly.A whole chapter on attitudes to the subject begins: \\"There can be few subjects other than ufology for which government policy is dictated so much by attitudes and so little by facts or hard evidence. Many of these attitudes have been created by the media.\\" Indeed. Nick writes about the main UFO groups and researchers in the UK and his personal investigations into multi-witness sightings, crop circles, cattle mutilations, the Rendlesham Forest incident (all given their own chapters), the notorious Santilli \\"autopsy\\" film and many other well-known cases. He expands the content to a more global perspective in the final chapters. His reputation for taking reports from the public about UFO encounters and other paranormal happenings seriously, and investigating them thoroughly and openly led to \\"maverick\\" status inside the MOD and thus to the media's term \\"The UK's own Fox Mulder.\\"So in summary, a good introduction to the subject for the casually interested reader, and even for the avid UFOlogist an interesting excursion into the workings of government and how the subject was managed during this period. Above all the author comes across as balanced, intelligent, grounded, sensible and good-humored - and that alone, many would admit, is something of a rarity in this field.A fortuitous career move inside the MOD led eventually to Nick carving out a whole new life in the UFO field outside government service in the real world, and achieving minor celebrity status as a recognizable face on TV. He's a professional, and has proved to be consistently effective at bringing the UFO subject more respectability and serious treatment by the mass media. Good for him, and good for the field."},{"Title":"Open Skies, Closed Minds Pb","review":"For all of us who understand the looming confrontation that is building between alien, space-based, and human, earth-based, species, Nick Pope comes to our rescue. I mean do we really know what this trauma will bring to a society that is still split in every way imaginable? We can't even pull together politically on a national-level let alone internationally to face these close encounters with courage and wisdom! So I shutter once this convergence of consciousness, this melding of minds, begins in a undeniable way in era-2012 as we enter into Solar Cycle 24. Indeed, the closest we come to this new paradigm, model of reality, is the shaman where extraordinary reality ultimately becomes ordinary to those who have mastered the seemingly miraculous third-eye open skills of shapeshifting, self-healing, as well as telepathy. The larger truth is you simply cannot open your third eye and stay the same. Whether you become a mystic, prophet, or shaman, afterwards is your business but, as I discovered and spent 15-years of my life researching and writing and speaking about, you will never ever be the same person again. Thus, do not overlook this book for it is a master-reference on this phenomenon and the sensational case histories and their impact on fragile egos. Personally, I doubt that we have time to bridge-the-gap between science and religion on this topic to circumvent the mass suicides I envison, due to misunderstanding that the cosmos itself is a living being that co-creates an infinite set of life forms to carry its very own consciousness both in time and eternity, but I salute my public-servant colleague for making every attempt to do so. Our people are so closed-minded to the catastrophic Earth Changes to come this year alone that they still look to our elected-leaders to save them from natural disasters, when these myopic folks have about as much collective foresight as FEMA in 2005.

English language books about the Portuguese experience in Africa, particularly during the early 60s to the mid to late 70s are few and far between, so any book that is decently researched and written, as this one is, is a welcome addition. It is not a perfect book, though. Despite an impressive list of sources and exclusive interviews, including with some of the most prominent Portuguese political figures during this period, the treatment of the topic is fairly superficial. Most of the material seems to come from declassified cables, open sources and less than incisive interviews with key players. The interviews with Portuguese and American personalities are, for the most part, not particularly revealing -- sometimes no more than platitudes. And there is almost no material from sources in the former insurgent movements. MIsspellings of common Portuguese terms abound, and the author employs an often disconcerting asychronous structure to the narrative. At its best, the book provides a window into the utter failure of US policy to affect Portuguese policy towards Africa in the years leading up to the coup of 25 Apri 1974 that deposed the old regime in Portugal, the failure of US intelligence to predict the coup itself, and the failure of US policy, despite Frank Carlucci's best efforts, to make any significant difference in the post-revolutionary struggle for democracy (the \\"PREC,\\" or \\"Processo Revolucion&aacute;rio em Curso.\\" Far from being a victory of US policy and diplomacy in engaging Africa, the independence of Portugal's colonies seemed to have been carried out partly by chance and partly by neglect. And Portugal's transition into democracy are due almost entirely to the combined efforts of Mario Soares and his Socialist party alliances, and to the determination and reasonableness of the Portuguese people themselves, who seemed to know, despite agressive efforts by the Communist Party and its left-wing allies, exactly what they wanted, and did not want, to come out of the revolution. As noted, very little insight is provided into the dynamics of the insurgent and post-insurgent process in the former Portuguese colonies. Other books have focused on this topic in more detail. All in all, this may be a useful general introduction to the unitiated, but it could have been much more, given the resources that the author seems to have had access to."},{"Title":"Engaging Africa: Washington and the Fall of Portugal's Colonial Empire","review":"A very interesting book about the US relations with Portugal from Kennedy to Ford administrations."},{"Title":"The divine art of soul-winning (Moody press colportage library)","review":"A fabulous book for people who care about souls.

But &quot;Decision&quot; isn't Drury at his best.The novel has its good points. The characters are well-drawn and mostly convincing, and both the general topic (the Supreme Court) and two of the specific questions (the objectivity of the Court, and media coverage of executions) are interesting and extremely timely. The book was written in the early '80s; it says something that the issues are hot in the '00s. It's not fast-moving, but Drury is a thought guy, not an action guy, and he's not fast-moving even as his best.The book's weaknesses overwhelm the good points. The writing is ponderous and self-absorbed, with a tendency to drift off into endless paragraphs full of ellipses. Reality is sometimes warped distractingly by the author's antileft leanings. In Drury's world, the only people who contribute to an organization against the death penalty are Hollywood elitists and &quot;such overseas sources as Libya, South Yemen, Angola&quot;. The common folks are unanimously in favor of the government throwing its weight around; vigilantes lynch only criminals, and vigilante justice is bad only because it violates theoretical principles of law. (In real life, of course, vigilantes are bad mostly because they lynch innocent people.)And (bizarrely) Drury doesn't seem to have done his legal homework. He gets the meaning and function of _Miranda_ pretty much entirely wrong, and I think he seriously overestimates how often the Supreme Court takes up murder cases. The legal case at the center of the plot, which supposedly pits the Law against &quot;common sense&quot;, fails to convince me; it seems driven by plot requirements rather than legal or political reality. And surely any Supreme Court Justice would instantly and automatically remove himself from any case in which his own daughter was a victim?You might want to read this if you know you like Drury and you want to see him thinking about the Supreme Court. But if you haven't read any Drury yet, don't start with this one!"},{"Title":"Decision","review":"Allen Drury's DECISION seems that it was Written to accomodate a certain number of pages required rather than have an attention holding story line.

Each book stands on its own, but it definitely is a series. Once I finished with CBB2, I eagerly went back and read CBB1 and wasn't disappointed. I call CBB2 the \\"anger\\" book and CBB1 the \\"overcoming the wimp factor\\" book.What's really great about the Biker Bob books is that they are addressing real men's issues in an engaging and fun way. There are tons of novels written by women about women's growth and finding their power. There are no novels, that I'm aware of, about men's growth, except now, the Biker Bob series.Men and women will equally love these books. Women will learn and understand what men need through these characters. Men won't have to be in a men's group (although Colyer's concept of a biker men's group is both hilarious and wonderful, as we follow the men's group in the books), we can just read these fun books and learn some things about ourselves while we're laughing through the stories.I personally can't wait for CBB3and 4, where the stories will center around men as Magician and King.

Together with an Accurate Statement of the Most Remarkable Transactions and Events Recorded in Ecclesiastical History\\" by Rev. Charles Buck, with a forward by Rev. George Bush. Originally published 1802, numerous reprints; may have been reprinted in more than one volume. (From a seller's review of the 1831 ed.): \\"Despite a stated reliance on the plain meaning of the Bible and the dictates of common sense, antebellum evangelicals required methods to create international consensus in a trans-denominational movement. Buck's Theological Dictionary, first published in London in 1802, sought to provide a textual basis for the evangelical community. By combining brief essays on orthodox belief and practice with historical entries on various denominations, Buck provided an interpretive lens that allowed antebellum Protestants to see Christianity's almost two millennia as their own history. American evangelicals rapidly seized on Buck's dictionary, ceding to it an almost canonical status as the textual interpreter of what it meant to be evangelical. Unfortunately Buck's Dictionary, as well as evangelicalism, amplified aspects of Enlightenment ideas about objectivity and history. Such notions validated the very concept of an evangelical dictionary and the tenets of reasonable Christianity. Ultimately, though, the Dictionary contained its own downfall. Unorthodox groups like the Universalists used Buck's Theological Dictionary to launch a theological assault on evangelicalism. By codifying former heresies and modern sects, Buck's Dictionary provided a potential voice to those sects, while by validating evangelical consensus it made the consensus itself vulnerable. Aside from that, Buck's Theological Dictionary still contains some interesting material, especially when it comes to Religious Sects. Some of the more obscure ones that you will find in this book include: Beareans, Brownists, Cereinthians, Circoncelliones, Dunkers, Hopkinsians, Illuminati, Joachimites, Libertines, Manicheans, Marcionites, Materialists, Monophysites, Moravians, Muggletonians (no, I did not make that one up, and it has nothing to do with Harry Potter), Novations, Origenists, Pelagians, Petrobrussians, Philadelphian Society, Photinians, Picards, Pricillianists, Rellyanists, Sandemanians, Serpentinians, Socinians, Supralapsarians, Swedenborgians, Theophilanthropists, Valentinians, Waldenses, Waterladians and others. There is also some good content on Quakers, Shakers, Universalists and others as well.

Heggen gave a more amusing account of the war than other factual book could have."},{"Title":"Mister Roberts","review":"Mr. Roberts is termed a classic of naval literature, but you can take out the \\"naval.\\" It is simply a classic. And I am amazed that there haven't been more reviews written on it. This book should be on everyone's must read list.Although the books takes place in WWII, this is not your typical war novel. The USS Reluctant plies the back-water of the war. The author describes the ship and its mission rather succinctly:\\"For the most part it remains on its regular run, from Tedium to Apathy and back; about five days each way. It makes an occasional trip to Monotony, and once it made a run all the way to Ennui, a distance of two thousand nautical miles from Tedium. It performs its dreary and unthanked job, and performs it, if not inspiredly, then at least adequately.\\"The title character is an officer who wants to get in the war, to become a part of history. He chaffs at what he sees as an unimportant job. But he takes his job seriously, and he cares for the crew. It is up to him to run interference between the crew and the somewhat tyrannical ship's captain.The novel is both hilariously funny and quite sad, stretching from one end of the spectrum to the other. But there is a degree of describing what true leadership means. Not charging the hill or going in to a bombing run on an enemy carrier, but how to be a true leader when motivation is nill. This should be required reading for all new military officers and staff-noncommissioned officers, but it should not be limited to them. Anyone can benefit from that aspect of the novel.More people are probably familiar with the 1955 Hollywood movie, and while that movie was excellent, it cannot hold a candle to the book. Not to be trite, but if you want to laugh, if you want to cry, and if you want a deep introspective on the human condition, please give Mr. Roberts a read."},{"Title":"Mister Roberts","review":"Mister Roberts had the right amount of amusement and sadness, which is the main reason I really liked it.

I will probably be tarred and feathered in effigy for this.I have been wanting to read this book for most of my adult life. I have heard/read all the reviews that claimed it was the greatest thing printed since the Gutenberg Bible. I recently acquired a first edition hardback copy, and promptly started reading. And waiting for the funny bits. And the hilarious bits.I finished the book, and I'm still waiting.I simply don't see why this book was called a masterpiece of American literature.I fully expected Mr. Roberts to be the central character, and be involved in the story most of the time. I also expected a storyline. Instead, the title character is seen somewhat less than half the time, and rather than a continuous story, we are presented with a bunch of short stories that are only bound together by being set on the USS Reluctant. There was no movement of storyline from one chapter to the next. The closest that I spotted was the transition between Mr. Roberts' transfer and the arrival of the news of his death.The only character that I felt any attachment to is Bookser. When I was in the Navy, I was for the most part a loner like him. I had a few friends, but I tended to go ashore on my own. Most of my friends were civilians. So, it was easy to identify with Booksie. As a consequence, the chapter about the liberty and Bookser is my favorite.Otherwise, the characters were just placeholders. A vehicle to move the story in the chapters along to their usual fall-flat finish.Having read this book, and Admiral Gallery's humor books, I'll take the Admiral's books every time. I think he may have gotten some ideas from Mister Roberts, but I believe he was much more successful in his story telling.Mister Roberts is at best, in my opinion, a lousy book. It is a collection of short stories that have at most a tenuous connection with each other. Only the ship and the Captain seem to be constant connectors between the stories (chapters). That wouldn't be bad, but this book is classified as a novel, which I do not agree with.Mr. Heggen was obviously a talented short story writer.

That information should have been on the back cover. A glaring bad design decision that seriously mars the photograph and book cover. It's amazing how such bad decisions get made and no one catches them. So obviously wrong."},{"Title":"Mister Roberts","review":"One of the (If not the best war plays). Touching and humourous. Truly a maaaad play."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"My meat used to be dry and tasteless until I bought The Compleat Meat Cookbook. Now everything I make is succulent and juicy. This book has been a life saver."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I consider myself to be at least a half way decent home cook, though I still occasionally burn water, usually after I've had one to many glasses of vino rojo. I love his sausages and buy them frequently from Ferry Plaza Farmers Mkt in SF, though NEVER from Whole Paycheck; there are some excellent recipes; but the Layout and Index are a nightmare. It's kinda like finding yourself trapped in a Kafkaesque abattoir. I hope they publish a revised edition that makes sense. I usually end up throwing the book into the corner and pulling out Joy of Cooking, Julia Child, Silver Palate, or adapting a Moosewood veggie recipe."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"AGAIN! It's unbelievable to me that Amazon charges almost the same for the Kindle edition of a book's hard copy price! Why?! Any cookbook or other reference book on Kindle is horrible to navigate! Recipes that require to go elsewhere in the book with a reference like \\" go to page 286\\". Amazon needs to get their collective act together or they will loose heavy users of the Kindle for cookbooks, etc, and will take our business elsewhere when the competion starts to use dynamic links for their reference books! DONT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This book contains some good general information on meat such as the different cuts and how to select meat at the butchers etc. But there dearth of information as well. There are many many recipes for marinades and sauces and dry rubs- most of which I would classify as absurd novo must-have-been-thought-up-while-drunk cuisine. No mention is made of basics like chimichurri. Basic recipes for cooking meat are also left out in favor of some stuff that must have been included because of a dare. I have tried about six of the reciepes of which three were passable."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"The book is nice to look at, and might even be pretty enough for the coffee table (if you loved meat that much). However, the recipes are something else again. I've tried several and all were somewhat disappointing, and none would make my &quot;make again&quot; list."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Not-Like-Mom's Meat Loaf was very good although a little too moist. Oakland-Style Barbecue Sauce was a loser - a waste of good ingredients as well as time. Am now skeptical of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I've always been intimidated by cooking meat...I'm much better at veggies, fish and poultry. This book will take me a lifetime to get through but all my first tries have been hits. Well organized. Lots of variety. THE source on cooking meat."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Thanks for posting Lisa's Lazy Pot Roast on the cookbook home page. It was fantastic. What a great way to introduce a cookbook's content. I wasn't actually looking for a &quot;meat&quot; cookbook, but after trying the recipe, I was prompted to read the book's description. Wow, what a compendium of recipes and meat information. This is a great find. Keep those recipes coming.."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is the best cook book I have read. I love to cook and have read many cook books. This one told me how to cook meat, buy it, and prepare it. The meat I cook now is wonderful and those I cook for tell me that it is the best meat they have ever eaten -- and better than that they get in good restaurants. Tips like letting the meat come to room temperature before cooking help enormously. Now I know why those crock pot roasts came out so bad. Because of the book I got a digital instant read thermometer and with it cooked the best pork chops I have tasted. Moist and succelent with no fear of illness. Steak I cook on the stove top comes out better than off my Weber Grill. Amazing. Although I do smoke up the house pretty good."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I learned so much about choosing & cooking beef just in the first chapters of this book. It is a very practical guide to helping laymen identify different cuts of meat, the characteristics of each, and the best methods of cooking. It has definately helped my ability to choose & prepare meat selections. I would highly recommend this book to everyone from casual weekend cook to seasoned cooks."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is a fabulous meat cookbook! I have used several of the recipes for lamb, pork and beef and they have all worked. The directions are very clear; no guess work is required. The different herb and spice rubs are really delicious. Many of the recipes work very well on a budget, and there are recipes for leftovers, too. The explanations of the different cuts of meat and their different (and for some cuts multiple) names were really helpful when I moved from the midwest to the west coast. Unlike some fancy cooking magazines which actually have recipes for beef stew using beef tenderloin, Aidells and Kelly will guide you to the best cut of meat for every dish. Highly recommended for both the beginning meat cook and those who just want some new, delicious, fool-proof recipes to try."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This is by far the best cookbook I have (and I have a lot). The book is not only a collection of great recipes, but it teaches you how to select the best cuts of meat. I've never been a big meat eater, but I've tried at least two dozen recipes from this book, and loved every one. The recipes are very easy to follow and don't use strange or hard to find items. Definitely 5 stars! A must for every kitchen!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I really love this book. I've learned an enormous amount from it. It is definitely worth buying. The only reason I would dock a half-star is because I would like it better if the recipes were organized by cut of meat."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"LOVE this book. First recipe I tried was Braised Short Ribs. So Good I thought I was eating at a fine restaurant. I know we\\"ll be getting alot of use out of this book over the years."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I borrowed this book from the library as it looked different, plus I don't own any cookbooks. I borrowed it several times in a row. It is a great help not only in cooking but I think mainly on buying meat. It has taken the whole mystery out of buying meat. When I go through the store flyer for sales I check this book and can tell if I am getting a good cut of meat. I just had to own this book. Something in it for everyone."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This book passes the only test a collection of recipes needs to pass: the food tastes great. I am pretty sure I have loved everything I have prepared from this book, including the chili Colorado, the oven-roasted tri-tip, the garlic-roasted pork loin, the pork and coleslaw sandwich, the roasted leg of lamb, the roasted pork tenderloin with rum pecan glaze over sweet potatoes, the boneless short ribs with tomato and fennel, the Korean short ribs, the Chinese braised pork loin, the Thai pork curry, the Catahoula smoky short ribs and, of course, the pot roast and brisket. Unlike a previous reviewer, I do not find that the recipes call for exotic ingredients, and unlike another reviewer, I do often consult this book for last-minute meal ideas. An excellent reference and kitchen companion."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"Received very timely and in excellent condition.Very thorough presentation of diverse meat recipies and related discussion of food preparation and presentations. A voluminous discussion also of sources of meat cuts."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I refer to this book as my Meat Bible. It is fun to read but also the most usable and comprehensive cookbook I own. There is lots of information about different cuts of meat. The recipes are clear and they really work. I've cooked over 40 recipes from the book and they all come out great. There are recipes for a wide range of cuts of beef, pork, veal, and lamb using a wide range of cooking methods and from a wide range of North-American and international cuisines. There is also a long list of recipes for brines, rubs, and marinades. I've owned my copy for 8 years and have gifted it to several friends. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I am 58 and am a very good cook and I cook a lot. I highly recommend this book. It gives massive amounts of useful info...the Joy of Cooking but for meat. Useful stuff on different cuts and how best to cook them. Great recipes. I have had this for over 2 years and used many recipes....there is one problem. The cook times in my experience( maybe it is my stove/oven) are much too short. So be aware if you use the recipes the cooking time is not long enough. That is the only complaint and I still rate it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"A must!!! Not only a great cookbook - the written information is worth it. We call it our \\"meat bible\\""},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"I've had this book for awhile now. You can just read through it for insight into particular types and cuts of meat, or look for specifics. Every recipe has been great, but the real value has been learning the skills to cook meat perfectly almost every time!"},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This not only gives you recipes; it gives you information on how to select the best cuts of meat. That is really the secret ingredient to a great roast or steak, etc. The Lazy day roast recipe is a never fail, impress your in-laws, most requested recipe I have ever tried. This is one of my most favorite and most frequently used cookbooks. It is one of the best purchases I have ever made."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"This cookbook is excellent - comprehensive, recipes are well-written, etc. But the Kindle edition is a disaster. You can't find anything - when they tell you to go to page xyz for a pan sauce, it's impossible to find. And there are all kinds of great sidebars with recipes that would go great with a particular dish, e.g., spinach with sesame seeds, but there was no way to find it. This is a travesty - a great trove of information, imprisoned within this format."},{"Title":"The Complete Meat Cookbook","review":"The section on how to brine cuts of pork to tenderize the meat is worth the price of this book. This is what most resturants do to their cuts of chops and tenderloins. This gives the meat its tender and tasty flavors that only a brine can bring to a specific cut."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],H={key:0},D={key:1};function B(n,e,s,c,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(t(!0),a(y,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),w(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",D,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,P)):b("",!0)])}const W=u(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-c4fe2c33"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/54.md","filePath":"guide/54.md"}'),q={name:"guide/54.md"},F=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,F as default};
